But the proviso does not require that the treaty should be one between the United States and the tribe from whom the purchase is made, as in the cases coming under the first clause of the section. It is sufficient if the purchase is made at <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> held ‘under {{the authority of the}} United States,’ and in the ‘presence and with the approbation of the commissioner or commissioners of the United States,’ etc.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the battle, the Abbasid forces were forced to {{withdraw}} from Syria, and Tulunid control over the province was reaffirmed.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of world government, <b>an</b> {{effective}} <b>treaty</b> to control the {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} should be self-enforcing. <b>A</b> self-enforcing <b>treaty</b> has the property that, if a country expects other countries to abide by the treaty, it will be in the self-interest of that country to abide by the <b>treaty</b> too. (<b>A</b> difficulty with the Kyoto Protocol {{is that it does not}} appear to lay the groundwork for <b>a</b> self-enforcing <b>treaty).</b> <b>A</b> self-enforcing <b>treaty</b> can be modeled as a Nash equilibrium of a suitably defined dynamic game among a large number of sovereign countries of diverse sizes and economic capabilities. We study such a game and characterize its equilibria (typically there are many) and the global-Pareto-optimal solutions. We identify one of the equilibria, which we call “business as usual,” with the current situation. The multiplicity of equilibria provides an opportunity to move from the inefficient business-as-usual equilibrium to one or more equilibria that are Pareto-superior. Using a calibrated model with 184 countries, we give numerical illustrations of business-as-usual and global-Pareto-optimal trajectories and estimate the potential welfare gains from <b>a</b> self-enforcing <b>treaty...</b>|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Philip {{engaged in a}} flurry of {{diplomatic}} activity. He bribed Berisades, son of the Thracian king Cotys, to withdraw Thracian support for Pausanias, and thereby prevented the Thracian invasion. Similarly, he bought off the Paionians with gifts in exchange for their withdrawal from Macedon. Philip may also have concluded <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> with the victorious Dardanian king Bardylis, possibly surrendering large parts of Macedon in exchange for peace. Although no evidence remains of such <b>a</b> <b>treaty,</b> the fact that Illyrians did not follow up their victory despite Macedon's weakness is suggestive that some agreement was reached. Philip also married Bardylis's daughter (or niece), which may have formed part of the treaty. At any rate, Philip's diplomacy gave Macedon some breathing space and time for recovery.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Vietnam War ended, the {{relationship}} between the Khmer Rouge—which {{was in the process of}} seizing power from a US-backed regime headed by Lon Nol—and North Vietnam was strained. Clashes between Vietnamese communists and Khmer Rouge forces began as early as 1974, and the following year Pol Pot signed <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> codifying the ‘friendship’ between the Khmer Rouge and China.|$|E
5|$|Following an 1846 treaty, the Winnebago {{tribes of}} Iowa were {{relocated}} to the Long Prairie reservation in central Minnesota {{in the late}} 1840s establishing an important presence in the territory. Because of the poor land in the new reservation the tribe subsequently negotiated <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> in 1856 allowing them to relocate further south to Blue Earth but ceding substantial land in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} project was negotiated as <b>an</b> international <b>treaty</b> {{between the two}} countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. <b>A</b> draft <b>treaty</b> was signed on 29 November 1962.|$|R
50|$|In 1873 Bolivia signed <b>a</b> secret <b>treaty</b> of {{defensive}} alliance with Peru. This {{would be used}} as an argument 5 years later in Chile, when it unleashed the War of the Pacific. The secret alliance, forbade Bolivia from signing <b>a</b> border <b>treaty</b> with Chile, without consulting with Peru. However, in 1874 Chile and Bolivia signed <b>a</b> border <b>treaty,</b> which replaced the previous treaty of 1866. One of its points was not to impose new taxes on individuals, industries and Chilean capital for 25 years.|$|R

5|$|Following the First Seminole War and <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> with Spain, Florida {{became a}} U.S. {{territory}} in 1821.

5|$|Opinion amongst modern historians is also split; for instance, Fine {{accepts the}} concept of the Peace of Callias, whereas Sealey {{effectively}} rejects it. Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia, but no actual treaty. Fine argues that Callisthenes's denial that <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point. Further, he suggests that Theopompus was actually referring to <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in 423 BC. If these views are correct, it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty's existence. A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in 449 BC, which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement. On the other hand, if there was indeed some kind of accommodation, Thucydides's failure to mention it is odd. In his digression on the pentekontaetia, his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power, and such <b>a</b> <b>treaty,</b> {{and the fact that the}} Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it, would have marked a major step in the Athenian ascendancy. Conversely, it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides's history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement. There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty's existence.|$|E
