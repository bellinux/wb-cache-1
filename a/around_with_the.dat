5|$|Because {{they have}} to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner, snow melting {{machines}} tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at <b>around</b> , <b>with</b> <b>the</b> largest being hauled by semi-trailer tractor units. In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E
5|$|Darcus Allen, {{a convicted}} murderer who {{previously}} served in an Arkansas prison with Clemmons, was allegedly {{present for the}} conversation. Also on Thanksgiving, Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor which Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle. On November 28, Clemmons showed two handguns to friends Eddie and Douglas Davis and told them he planned to shoot police officers with them; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons' half-brother Rickey Hinton, with whom he shared a house. During the exchange, Clemmons danced <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> guns in his hands, claiming to be Lucifer. He told the men he had twice tried {{to go to a}} Tacoma police station, where he planned to walk in and start shooting. The first time the station was closed, and the second time he got a flat tire on the way there, Clemmons claimed. He talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{defining}} actions of Sakic's career was {{at the conclusion of}} the 2001 playoffs. Defying the NHL tradition of the captain being the first to skate <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Stanley Cup, Sakic passed it off to teammate Ray Bourque. Bourque, one of the best defensemen to ever play, had been traded to the Avalanche the year before after spending 21 years with the Boston Bruins and setting the record for most games played without winning the Cup. Sakic's handing of the Stanley Cup exemplifies his classiness and how he performs through actions rather than words.|$|E

5|$|Other {{species have}} special glands to produce {{deterrent}} chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce {{a variety of}} hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, quinones, esters, and acids released from an opening {{at the end of}} the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, Anthia and Thermophilum – Thermophilum is sometimes included within Anthia) employ the same chemicals as ants: formic acid. Bombardier beetles have well-developed pygidial glands that empty from the sides of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers, one for hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, the other holding hydrogen peroxide and catalase enzymes. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of <b>around</b> , <b>with</b> <b>the</b> breakdown of hydroquinone to hydrogen, oxygen, and quinone. The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.|$|E
5|$|Ripley 8 (Sigourney Weaver), {{also known}} as Number 8, is a human-Alien hybrid cloned from the DNA of Ellen Ripley and the {{embryonic}} Alien Queen recovered from Ripley's blood samples taken from Fury 161. The DNA's integrity has been compromised {{by the process of}} infestation and the human and Alien DNA in Number 8 is mixed, creating a humanoid organism with Alien traits such as an empathic link {{with the rest of the}} hive, acidic blood, enhanced strength and reflexes and genetic memories. After United Systems Military researchers extract the Alien Queen from Number 8 on the ship USM Auriga in the year 2381, they keep her alive and confined and give her a rudimentary education. When the Aliens breach their containment, Number 8 joins the crew of the mercenary vessel Betty to attempt an escape; she is captured by the Aliens, who bring her to their nest. Number 8's Alien Queen gives birth to a Newborn, a hybrid which identifies Number 8 as its mother after it kills the Alien Queen. Number 8 escapes from the Auriga on the Betty and again encounters the Newborn, which she jettisons into space. After the Betty lands on Earth, Number 8 looks <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other survivors and wonders about their uncertain future.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball.

In {{the course of a}} decade, he had taken control of a network with no shows in the Nielsen Top 10 and left it with five. Tartikoff was succeeded by Warren Littlefield, whose first years as entertainment president proved shaky as a result of most of the Tartikoff-era hits ending their runs.

25|$|Neil Lake needed three metal plates {{inserted}} {{in his face}} after being attacked by a Hells Angel at a petrol station in Cardiff in October 2007. Lake took down the registration of his attacker's Harley-Davidson motorcycle which led police to Sean Timmins, the vice-president of the Wolverhampton chapter. Timmins denied inflicting grievous bodily harm on Lake and claimed that a fellow club member had been riding <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same number plates as him; he told a judge he knew {{the identity of the}} actual attacker but explained that it would be against club rules for him to name him. Timmins was cleared of the charge in September 2008 after providing an alibi who said that he was working in his hometown {{on the day of the}} attack. He would later be one of the three Hells Angels jailed for six years after the brawl with the Outlaws at Birmingham Airport.|$|E
25|$|After {{seven games}} in the NHL, the Senators {{assigned}} Hossa to junior, where he tallied 45 goals and 40 assists for 85 points in 53 games with the Winterhawks in 1997–98, earning him the Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy as WHL rookie of the year, as well as CHL and WHL West First Team All-Star honors. He led the Winterhawks to a President's Cup as WHL champions {{en route to the}} 1998 Memorial Cup championship. Late in the third period of a tied championship game against the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)'s Guelph Storm, Hossa collided with Guelph forward Ryan Davis and suffered a serious knee injury, forcing him out of the game. The Winterhawks went on to clinch the championship in overtime and Hossa returned to the ice on a chair as his teammates pushed him <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Memorial Cup to celebrate the victory. With seven points in four tournament games, Hossa was named to the Memorial Cup All-Star team, along with teammate Andrej Podkonický.|$|E

25|$|In October 2012, Lexus {{staged a}} {{race as a}} result of a charity bet between pilot Marc Arnold and Kent Stevinson to race a Lexus LFA against an Eclipse 500 jet. The top speed of the LFA is 203mph while the Eclipse 500 can reach speeds of 400mph. In order to make it a fair test to measure acceleration, handling, braking, {{according}} to Paul Williamson the race took place on a 4800 feet runway. The plane was given a head start of about 110mph with the Lexus LFA launching from a dead stop as the jet flew by at 110mph. As the race begun, the plane started accelerating from 110mph and Lexus LFA launched from a dead stop. Both accelerated to the end of the runway where the LFA will have to brake and turn <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plane turning around as well. Then it was a race all the way back to the starting line with the LFA needing to brake before the plane in order for the Lexus LFA to win the race. The proceeds of the win were to benefit charities. Lexus decided to choose the Lexus LFA Nurburgring Edition for the race and professional race car driver and champion Scott Pruett was selected as the driver for the Lexus LFA. Once the race was complete, the Lexus LFA was able to win through completing the race including a full dead stop at the end before the plane cleared the finish line 2 seconds ahead of the Eclipse 500 jet. The Lexus LFA hit a maximum speed of 171mph before it hit the braking zone.|$|E
