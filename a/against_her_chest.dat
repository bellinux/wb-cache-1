2500|$|The present Saint Thuriau {{church in}} Landivisiau was built between 1864 and 1865 {{replacing}} the earlier 16th-century building {{but the old}} church's porch and bell-tower were retained, fortunately so as they are both magnificent. The porch was dismantled and then re-erected in 1728 by Jean Perrot and Sébastien Roussel. The entrance to the porch comprises a semi-circular arch, with side buttresses and above the arch a pointed gable culminates in an elaborate lanteron. Inside the porch are statues of the apostles, and a two-door entrance to the church has further decorated arches, with further statues on the wall {{as well as a}} tympanum. Unusually for porches in churches in the Élorn valley, the porch is accessed using ten steps. As at Pencran, Bastien Prigent created a series of piédroits and voussures depicting biblical and other scenes as decoration of the arch over the porch's entrance (the blocks of stone at the part of the arch near to ground level are the piédroits and the remaining wedge-shaped stones used in constructing an arch form the voussoirs. [...] Above the biblical scenes in the arch's piédroits are depictions of the four Evangelists and their attributes, with Saints Luke and John positioned on the left and Mark and Matthew positioned on the right and finally a [...] "heavenly choir" [...] of thirty one winged angels are shown floating in the clouds and praying, singing, playing various instruments or holding censers. Above the entrance arch is a gable in the Gothic style and on this the sculptors placed a statue depicting a female saint reading a book and another female saint higher up has her hands crossed <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> [...] The gable is also decorated with two lions supporting the blason of François de Tournemine. [...] Above the gable there is an ornate lanteron with three niches. The central niche contains a statue of Saint Thuriau to whom the church is dedicated. [...] The two buttresses supporting the arch have niches containing statues of the four Evangelists each seated at a desk with their attributes at their side. The buttresses also hold a statue of the Virgin of the Annunciation and another depicting Saint Anne with the Virgin Mary. All these statues are by Bastien Prigent. [...] The inside of the porch is vaulted and is decorated with the blason of the Danycan family and Henry Prigent added statues of [...] "Christ the Saviour" [...] and the twelve apostles in niches each with an elaborate canopy. The heads of these apostles were damaged during the turmoil of the French revolution and bear signs of restoration and some of the attributes were destroyed which makes identification difficult. The arches around the two doors giving access to the church are in turn richly decorated with garlands of thistles ("chardon") and grapes and a series of statuettes in niches, these depicting Saint Yves, Saint Peter holding a book and a key, Saint Salomon the Breton king wearing armour, holding a sword and the royal crown, Saint Miliau carrying his head in his hands, Saint Thivisiau, a bishop, Saint Côme holding a vase containing medications, Saint Damien (Côme and Damien were brothers and both doctors martyred under Diocletian), and another bishop giving a blessing. On the left side angels hold a cartouche reading [...] "ANNO.DOMINI.1554" [...] and on the right the cartouche reads [...] "LAN.MIL.VCC.L1111.FVST.FONDE.CESTE.PORTAL.ET.ESTOIENT.LORS.FABRIQVES.Y.MART(I)N.J.ABGRALL". Above the doors a tympanun depicts angels holding phylacteries on either side of a statue of Jesus Christ. The phylactery held by the three angels on the left side reads [...] "MEMENTO.MEI/O.MATER.DEI/PAX VOBIS" [...] and that held by three angels on the right reads [...] "DOMVS MEA/SALVATOR MVNDI/ LETVS MARIA". There is an elaborate stoup on the wall between the two entrance doors.|$|E

50|$|In LASALASDELUCRECIA (an {{installation}} inspired on {{the legendary}} {{figure in the}} history of the Roman Republic. The title may mean Lucretia's Wings, or Lucrecia's Halls), she portrays the same image of herself in seven different modes of representation (oil painting, stenciling, embroidery, etc.) as Lucretia, holding a dagger <b>against</b> <b>her</b> naked <b>chest.</b> <b>Her</b> facial expression is highly ambiguous, since it can be understood, at first glance, as emotionless; however, through repetition and the playful exaggerated arrangement and inclusion of items such as feathers, candles, within the installation it can be seen as a pose, a deadpan form of delivering an acerbic yet darkly humorous critique on the discourse of female victimization and convenient voluntary disempowerment.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they read}} the letter through once more, sitting close together, he with one arm round her shoulder, she {{nestling}} <b>against</b> his <b>chest,</b> <b>her</b> hair brushing <b>against</b> his lips and with the letter in her hands which she could scarcely read for the tears of joy which filled her eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{stood before}} Amyntas, letting him gaze; then {{suddenly}} {{she lifted her}} eyes to his. Amyntas's heart gave a mighty beat <b>against</b> his <b>chest.</b> <b>Her</b> eyes, her eyes were the very lights of love, carrying passionate kisses on their beams. A sob of ecstasy choked the youth, and {{he felt that he}} could kneel down and worship before them.|$|R
60|$|What of {{her anger}} and pent feelings, her lungs were irritated into the dry, hacking cough, and with blood-suffused face and one hand clenched <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> {{she waited for}} the {{paroxysm}} to pass.|$|E

Her heart gave a great beat <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> The thought had never entered her head. She sat down and {{waited for him to}} speak. He did not move. There was a {{singular}} immobility about him when something absorbed his mind.|$|E
50|$|While she {{was waiting}} to board the ship, Lucheni ran {{over to her and}} slammed his body <b>against</b> hers, {{penetrating}} <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> with a sharp needle file (which is now part of the Sisi Museum exhibition at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna). Not realising she was hurt because of her extremely tight corset, and wanting to board as quickly as possible, Elisabeth got to her feet straight away and boarded the steamer. The vessel departed but quickly turned around when it was realised that Elisabeth was injured. She was carried back to the Beau-Rivage hotel on an improvised stretcher and two doctors were summoned, but they pronounced her dead at 2:10 pm.|$|R

60|$|He {{answered}} her no words but {{pulled himself up}} from his crawling attitude {{by means of the}} alder stem, and hacked at her thongs with the sharp edge of his axe.

Her heart beat violently <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> and in her {{agitation}} she fumbled with the corner of her apron.|$|E
50|$|A fatal air embolism, when air {{enters the}} bloodstream, can occur due to sex shortly after {{childbirth}} before the placental bed has healed, {{particularly if the}} woman's knees are pressed <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> but this is rare.

5000|$|During her screen {{tests for}} To Have and Have Not (1944), Bacall {{was so nervous}} that, to {{minimize}} her quivering, she pressed her chin <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> faced the camera and tilted her eyes upward. This effect, which {{came to be known}} as [...] "The Look", became another Bacall trademark along with her sultry voice.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes called [...] "tube", [...] "pocket" [...] or [...] "ringless" [...] slings, {{these are}} {{generally}} formed {{by a wide}} piece of fabric sewn into a tubular shape. Simple, or fitted pouches do not have rings or other hardware. Adjustable pouches may adjust with zippers, snaps, buckles, clips, rings, drawstrings, velcro, and other methods. Most pouches have a curve sewn in to shape the cloth to the parent's body and hold the baby more securely than a simple straight tube. The wearer slips the pouch over the head and one shoulder, sash-style, creating a pocket or seat to hold the baby in. Many pediatricians and baby-wearing experts do not recommend pouch slings because babies can suffocate when held incorrectly. Suffocation risk is greatest in newborns and infants under six months, and usually occurs because the baby's chin is collapsed <b>against</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> constricting the airway. Pouch slings also often restrict the parent's view of their child, making suffocation more likely. When using a pouch sling, wearers should {{be sure to keep}} the baby's face elevated and clearly visible.|$|R
50|$|Oyuki, a tattooed female assassin - {{the renegade}} {{member of a}} daimyo's {{personal}} bodyguard detail - is killing every man that is sent up <b>against</b> <b>her.</b> Along with her deadly use of the short blade, she strips to the waist while fighting to reveal elaborate tattoos on <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> and back. On her front is a kintarō grasping her left breast. A portrait of a mountain witch covers her back. She then cuts off her victims' topknots, or chonmage, which brings dishonor to the dead man and his family.|$|R
5000|$|During several {{episodes of}} season five ("Mr. Monk Makes a Friend," [...] "Mr. Monk Is At Your Service," [...] "Mr. Monk Visits a Farm," [...] "Mr. Monk and the Really, Really Dead Guy" [...] and [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to the Hospital"), Traylor Howard was {{pregnant}} with her son Sabu. Hence, during these episodes, {{it is easy to}} notice that scenes with Natalie were redone to hide the abnormal bulge in <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> in these episodes, such as having her wearing long trenchcoats, carrying boxes, newspapers, a bag, or something large, or sitting/standing behind something like a counter or a desk. For instance, in [...] "Mr. Monk Is At Your Service", when Monk and Natalie are at the crash site, Natalie is seen leaning <b>against</b> <b>her</b> car in close-ups with the driver's side door open to hide <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> In a rare exception, later in the episode, Traylor's real pregnant frame is revealed, when Natalie pretends to be pregnant by stuffing a pillow down her shirt so as to avoid advances from Paul Buchanan (Sean Astin). Noticeably, Natalie is not positioned in such ways as to hide <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> in [...] "Mr. Monk Is on the Air", because (as can be determined from Natalie's clothing, her car model, and a calendar for July 2006 when Monk and Natalie are in Max Hudson's bedroom) that episode was filmed alongside the eight episodes {{in the first half of}} the fifth season, all filmed before Traylor's pregnancy began to show.|$|R
5000|$|For {{those who}} have pain on deep {{penetration}} because of pelvic injury or disease, recommend a change in coital position to one with less penetration. In women receiving vaginal penetration: maximum vaginal penetration is achieved when the receiving woman lies on her back with her pelvis rolled up off the bed, compressing her thighs tightly <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> with her calves over the penetrating partner's shoulders. Minimal penetration occurs when a receiving woman lies on her back with her legs extended flat {{on the bed and}} close together while her partner's legs straddle hers. A device has also been described for limiting penetration.|$|E
5000|$|A fourteen-year-old {{girl with}} sleepy-looking {{eyes and a}} large scarf that Shinkurō [...] "saves". She is {{actually}} a reputable hitman from the Akuu Company known as [...] "Guillotine". Though she is just fourteen, she unintentionally has perverted reactions to events, such as assuming Shinkurō wanted a threesome in the back alley with her and Murasaki. As if pressing his hand <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> wasn't proof enough {{that she was a}} girl, she even offered to show him an upskirt. She seems to be weak to the cold and heat. After encountering Shinkurō a couple more times, she develops a crush on him and steals a kiss from him. Now, she is trying her best to understand the concept of friends as she slowly makes the effort to make other friends within their circle.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The [...] "mise au tombeau". Part of the Guimiliau calvary. Jesus' {{body has}} been taken down from the cross and his body is {{prepared}} for burial. Nine people are present and in the centre the three Marys (Mary Salome, Mary Cleophas and Mary Magdalene) comfort each other. It has been written {{that the image of}} Mary Magdalene is based on Mary Stuart who was beheaded in 1587 and came to Roscoff to marry François 11. Near the head of Jesus is the Virgin Mary, her arms crossed <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> next to Nicodemus who holds the shroud. At Jesus' feet is a depiction of Joseph of Arimathea with John the Evangelist and Gamaliel. Behind Joseph of Arimathea are a group of pilgrims from Emmaüs. The Guimiliau calvary is the only calvary to deal with the journey to Emmaüs. Jesus has now risen and leads Cleophas and another to Emmaüs.|$|E

6000|$|Madame and {{the four}} young men had arrived at about six. Madame, said Mrs. Rollings, was a little fat woman, and she was {{complaining}} {{all the time that}} she had got a cold on <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> laying <b>her</b> hand on <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> and trying <b>her</b> breathing and going [...] "He-e-e-er! Herr!" [...] to see if she could breathe properly. She, Mrs. Rollings, had suggested that Madame should put her feet in hot mustard and water, but Madame said she must have something to clear <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> The four young men were four nice civil young fellows. They evidently liked Madame. Madame had insisted on cooking the chops for the young men. She herself had eaten one, but she laid her hand on <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> when she swallowed. One of the young men had gone out to get her some brandy, and he had come back with half-a-dozen large bottles of Bass as well.|$|R
5000|$|Much {{research}} has been generated {{on the role of}} lullabies in nurturing caregiving bonds between mother and child. Mothers who sing lullabies to their infants engage in a bonding activity that actually alters the underlying neural structure of the infant brain such that the infant becomes [...] "tuned" [...] into music and its association with parental affiliation. In one Taiwanese study of Kangaroo Care, a technique practiced on newborn infants in which a mother holds her child tightly <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> it was demonstrated that infant-mother dyads who listened to their choice of lullaby were associated with more quiet sleep states and less occurrence of crying by the infant and were also associated with significantly lower maternal anxiety, than those dyads who did not listen to lullabies. The therapeutic effect of lullabies can thus have a strong impact on calming anxieties and nurturing bonds, which is especially important with premature and fragile infants.|$|E
50|$|A ghost who {{was once}} {{a young woman who}} lived in the same {{apartment}} that Daikichi is currently squatting in. She committed suicide 10 years before the events of the story by repeatedly stabbing herself in the chest. Her only memories of her past life are that she killed herself on a warm summer day looking out at beautiful sunset. Although she can effortlessly go through walls and solid materials, she can still eat and drink, and she eventually learns how to wear new clothes. Her spiritual body is normally very cold in temperature, and she sometimes cools Diakichi off on a hot summer day by wrapping herself around him or chills drinks by holding them in her arms or <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> However, her body can also be quite warm, especially in the midst of passion. She encouraged Daikichi to continue to live on even when he felt he had reached rock bottom in his life. She can also get sick, where her body shrinks in the process.|$|E
50|$|Premanand Swami {{was born}} into a Sathodara Nagar Brahmin family in a village1 near Nadiad (some say that he was born in the village Dora, near Bharuch) around 1784 CE (Samvat 1840). His mother was very {{beautiful}} but his father was treated as a lunatic by the people. So, after his birth, people started slandering the mother. They said, “This child is illegitimate, so the mother should either disown him or kill him. We are not going to accept it in our family.” This caused great pain to the mother. However, bowing to social pressure, one early morning she pressed the child <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> went out of thevillage and left the child in the hole of a tree. After some time a carder passing by suddenly saw the child lying in the hole of the tree. His joy knew no bounds on seeing the child. He thought, “I have no child of my own; here is God’s gift.” He carried the child home and said to his wife, “Look here. God has sent this child to us. Let us rejoice.’’ With these words, he handed over the child to his wife.|$|E

5000|$|While {{his parents}} are away for the weekend, Benny invites a girl (Ingrid Stassner) he has seen outside the local video store to his home. He shows her the video of the pig slaughter, and {{they talk about the}} film. She: [...] "Did you make this film? How was it, with the pig? I mean, {{have you ever seen a}} dead person--a real one, I mean?" [...] Benny: [...] "No. I once saw a TV program about the tricks they use in action films. It's all ketchup and plastic," [...] and then he unveils and loads the {{slaughtering}} gun. He holds it against his chest, and dares the girl to discharge it. When she refuses, he calls her a coward (Feigling!). He holds it <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> and when he hesitates, she calls him a Feigling also. He fires the gun, and she falls. Her falling reveals a video monitor, on which we see her crawling away from Benny and completely out of frame, Benny running to reload the gun and returning to shoot her a second time, the girl crawling back partially into frame, Benny again reloading and firing, this time apparently at her head, and, finally, her body remaining still.|$|E
5000|$|The {{incident}} {{was described in}} details in the Amnesty International report issued in July 2009. Family members testified that on January 7, the shelling around the house increased and around 12.50pm they were ordered to leave their house by the Israeli soldiers. Khaled Abd Rabbo told Amnesty representatives:My wife and our three daughters ..., my mother, ... and I went out. My mother was holding a white cloth tied to a broom handle and we were holding white cloths. ... Outside there was a tank parked about 10m {{from the front door}} of our house, in our garden, which by then had been destroyed... We stood still outside the door waiting for the soldiers to tell us or signal to us what to do next. Two soldiers stood outside the tank in our garden, eating chips and chocolate and ignored us. We stood still for several minutes. Then suddenly a soldier emerged {{from the middle of the}} tank. He was out of the tank from the waist up, and he took aim at us and shot many bullets. My daughter Amal had nine bullets in the chest area. She was holding a teddy bear <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> and it got ripped by the bullets, my daughter Souad got some 11 or 12 bullets also in the chest area, and my daughter Samar got several bullets in the chest and tummy, and my mother was shot...|$|E
50|$|Los Angeles, California. Xanther and Anwar drive amidst heavier rain {{on their}} way to get the dog that is her “big surprise.” Anwar asks Xanther to call the {{adoption}} agency, Galvadyne, Inc., and over the phone she hears that the dog is currently named SugarLady and feels uneasy. Her thoughts stray to the Horrorsphere, Realic, and Paradise Open before her brain starts up a more uplifting Question Song about the dog. She asks Anwar what breed it is and he tells her she will find out. At this point she starts to feel strange, so she turns up the song on the radio: “When the Levee Breaks” by Led Zeppelin. It doesn’t help; she hears a familiar cry inside her that seems to get louder when she opens the window to look at a sign, {{despite the fact that the}} rain is pouring and such a cry would never be audible. She races out into the storm after the sound without saying goodbye. She continues to hear the meek cry for help as she runs over puddles, through intersections, and down a steep hill. At one point she falls on her hands and knees and loses her glasses, but she keeps going. Finally she comes to a sewer drain, where she drops to the ground and starts digging through the litter. Once it starts to give way she plunges her arms through the grating to grasp onto a tiny white creature. When she sees that it appears to be dead she starts crying, cradling it <b>against</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> in the downpour.|$|E
