500|$|Starting with Madonna's voice multi-tracked {{questioning}} – [...] "Am I gonna be a star?", [...] "Should I {{change my}} name?" [...] – the lyrics develop into what Rikky Rooksby of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna {{states is a}} complaint about modern-day life. She also questions the shallowness of modern life and the [...] "American dream." [...] "I know it sounds clichéd," [...] she admitted. [...] "But I've had 20 years of fame and fortune, and I feel that I {{have the right to}} an opinion on what it is and isn't. All everyone is obsessed about now is being a celebrity. I'm saying that's bullshit, and who knows better than me? Before it happens, you have all kinds of notions about how wonderful celebrity is and how much joy it's going to bring you. Then you arrive... In America, more than any other place in the world, you have the freedom to be <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be. Which is all well and good, but it only works if you have a value system – and we seem not to have one anymore. It's, 'Whatever it takes to get to the top, that's what you gotta do.' It's the allure of the beautiful life: 'Look like this, you're gonna be happy. Drive this car, you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna want to fuck you.' It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rolf {{was born}} in 1969 {{and grew up in}} Cincinnati. His father, a lawyer, and mother, a unionized teacher with a blue-collar background, held liberal values and taught him to abide by the Golden Rule. His father had pledged to a mostly black {{fraternity}} in the early 1960s in support of the civil rights movement, and his mother took him to [...] "U.S. Out of Central America" [...] meetings at her Unitarian church. They also instilled the belief [...] "that everyone is equal and you can be <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be", which Rolf now considers [...] "either the most naive or dishonest thing you can tell a child". He had a comfortable upbringing, once recalling, [...] "We had a brick ranch home and a sandbox in the backyard. We had a station wagon. For vacation, throw the kids in the back seat, stay in the Best Western on the way to Disneyland. It was a sitcom, stereotype life." ...|$|E
2500|$|FBI agents twice {{visited the}} Paine home in early November, when Oswald was not present, {{and spoke to}} Mrs. Paine. Oswald visited the Dallas FBI office about 2 to 3 weeks before the assassination, asking to see Special Agent James P. Hosty. When {{he was told that}} Hosty was unavailable, Oswald left a note that, {{according}} to the receptionist, read: [...] "Let this be a warning. I will blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you don't stop bothering my wife" [...] "Lee Harvey Oswald." [...] The note allegedly contained some sort of threat, but accounts vary as to whether Oswald threatened to [...] "blow up the FBI" [...] or merely [...] "report this to higher authorities". According to Hosty, the note said, [...] "If you have <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> learn about me, come talk to me directly. If you don't cease bothering my wife, I will take the appropriate action and report this to the proper authorities." [...] Agent Hosty said that he destroyed Oswald's note on orders from his superior, Gordon Shanklin, after Oswald was named the suspect in the Kennedy assassination.|$|E
60|$|MABEL. Major Colford's taken Ronny {{off in his}} car for the night. I {{thought it}} would do him good. I said I'd come round in case there was <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say before to-morrow.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh dear no, sir!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Peckover, {{very much}} amazed. [...] "I {{should be ashamed}} of myself if I went making any {{objections}} <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know about little Mary. But it's strange to me to be in a beautiful place like this, drinking wine with gentlefolks--and I'm almost afraid--" ...|$|R

60|$|On being questioned, the Frogman {{told them}} {{the whole story of}} the loss of Cayke's highly prized dishpan and their adventures in search of it.

6000|$|The doctor {{crossed over}} to Horton, {{who sat in}} a corner. [...] "If there is <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> ask him lose no time," [...] he said. [...] "The man can't last until the morning." ...|$|E

6000|$|Jimmy chuckled. [...] "No, you don't!" [...] said he. [...] "If {{there is}} <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know from Grandfather Frog, ask him yourself.

6000|$|... "One of {{the points}} about the Chesterton post-office is that there's no {{letter-box}} outside. You {{have to go into}} the shop and hand <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> post across the counter. I thought this was a tremendous score for me. I thought they would be bound to remember who handed in the letters. There can't be many at a place like that." ...|$|E

6000|$|Her {{father looked}} at her over his glasses and spoke with grave deliberation; [...] "If there is <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> say to me," [...] he said, [...] "you must say it in the study. I am going to smoke a little here, and then I shall go to the study. I don't {{see what you can}} have to say. I should have thought my note cleared up everything.

60|$|FRIDAY--I HAD to have company--I {{was made}} for it, I think--so I made friends with the animals. They are just charming, {{and they have the}} kindest {{disposition}} and the politest ways; they never look sour, they never let you feel that you are intruding, they smile at you and wag their tail, if they've got one, and they are always ready for a romp or an excursion or <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> propose. I think they are perfect gentlemen. All these days we have had such good times, and it hasn't been lonesome for me, ever.|$|E
