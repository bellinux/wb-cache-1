5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns <b>about</b> <b>privacy,</b> and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E

25|$|Concerns <b>about</b> <b>privacy</b> {{have led}} many to {{consider}} the possibility that big data infrastructures such as the Internet of things and data mining are inherently incompatible with privacy. Writer Adam Greenfield claims that these technologies are not only an invasion of public space but are also being used to perpetuate normative behavior, citing an instance of billboards with hidden cameras that tracked the demographics of passersby who stopped to read the advertisement.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to rising concerns <b>about</b> <b>privacy</b> and smart technology, in 2007 the British Government stated it would follow formal Privacy by Design principles when implementing their smart metering program. The program {{would lead to}} replacement of traditional power meters with smart power meters, which could track and manage energy usage more accurately. However the British Computer Society is doubtful these principles were ever actually implemented. In 2009 the Dutch Parliament rejected a similar smart metering program, basing their decision on privacy concerns. The Dutch program later revised and passed in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Capita Group {{maintained}} the system under {{a five-year contract}} worth around £230m. Having been threatened with the {{termination of the contract}} by Ken Livingstone, then Mayor of London, for poor performance, when the zone was subsequently extended, Capita was awarded an extension to the original contract up until February 2009 to cover the expanded zone. Capita employed sub-contractors including India-based Mastek, who were responsible for much of the Information Technology infrastructure. Due to the wide spread of sub-contractors around the world and due to varying data protection regulations in different countries, the scheme had prompted concerns <b>about</b> <b>privacy.</b>|$|E

25|$|There is {{a growing}} number of social network users who decide to quit their user account by {{committing}} a so-called virtual identity suicide or Web 2.0 suicide. A 2013 study in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking investigated this phenomenon from the perspective of Facebook users. The number one reason for these users was privacy concerns (48%), being followed by a general dissatisfaction with the social networking website (14%), negative aspects regarding social network friends (13%) and the feeling of getting addicted to the social networking website (6%). Facebook quitters were found to be more concerned <b>about</b> <b>privacy,</b> more addicted to the Internet and more conscientious.|$|E
25|$|Another popular {{approach}} to fighting phishing {{is to maintain}} a list of known phishing sites and to check websites against the list. Microsoft's IE7 browser, Mozilla Firefox 2.0, Safari 3.2, and Opera all contain this type of anti-phishing measure. Firefox 2 used Google anti-phishing software. Opera 9.1 uses live blacklists from Phishtank, cyscon and GeoTrust, as well as live whitelists from GeoTrust. Some implementations of this approach send the visited URLs to a central service to be checked, which has raised concerns <b>about</b> <b>privacy.</b> According {{to a report by}} Mozilla in late 2006, Firefox 2 was found to be more effective than Internet Explorer 7 at detecting fraudulent sites in a study by an independent software testing company.|$|E

[...] Drastic cuts were also made to many essential programs, some so deep {{that they had to}} shut down entirely, including the monitoring of smoke stack emissions, food inspections, oil spills, water quality, and climate change. [...] During this time, the long form census was also discontinued as a mandatory part of the census.

500|$|Rock Paper Shotgun writer Alec Meer {{argued that}} Microsoft's intent for this data {{collection}} lacked transparency, stating that [...] "there is no {{world in which}} 45pages of policy documents and opt-out settings split across 13different settings screens and an external website constitutes 'real transparency'." [...] ExtremeTech pointed out that, while previously scroogling against Google for similar data collection strategies, Microsoft now hoovers up your data {{in ways that would}} make Google jealous." [...] However, it was also pointed out that the requirement for such vast usage of customer data had become a norm, citing the increased reliance on cloud computing and other forms of external processing, as well as similar data collection requirements for services on mobile devices such as Google Now and Siri. In August 2015, Russian politician Nikolai Levichev called for Windows10 to be banned from use within the Russian government, as it sends user data to servers in the United States. The country had passed a federal law requiring all online services to store the data of Russian users on servers within the country by September 2016, or be blocked. Writing for ZDNet, Ed Bott said that the lack of complaints by businesses <b>about</b> <b>privacy</b> in Windows10 indicated [...] "how utterly normal those privacy terms are in 2015." [...] In a Computerworld editorial, Preston Gralla stated that [...] "the kind of information Windows10 gathers is no different from what other operating systems gather.

40|$|This {{paper was}} done in partial {{fulfillment}} of a Master's Degree in Education - Educational Technology (University of Hawaii at Manoa). Also, this project {{was presented at the}} TCC 2009 Worldwide Online Conference. Many college students are misled into making uninformed choices about what to disclose online and avoid taking the necessary precautions to protect their privacy on social networking sites. This study was aimed at developing and evaluating a multimedia, Web-based, instructional module to educate college students <b>about</b> protecting <b>privacy</b> on social networking sites. The module covered privacy, threats to one’s privacy, and ways to protect oneself on social networking sites. It was hoped that students would also gain awareness for protecting their privacy in all online activities. A formative evaluation was conducted {{with a small group of}} 19 college students. Improvements in participants’ pre- and post-test scores indicated that the instructional module was successful in educating the students <b>about</b> protecting <b>privacy</b> on social networking sites. Additionally, survey results showed that the participants felt that they increased their knowledge <b>about</b> protecting <b>privacy</b> on social networking sites and took a positive liking to the module. While the module proved to be successful in educating college students <b>about</b> protecting <b>privacy,</b> the researcher concluded that a different instructional approach may be even more effective in teaching how to protect privacy.
