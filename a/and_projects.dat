Therefore, {{there is a need}} to conduct a study on KM <b>and</b> <b>project</b> performance specifically focussing on the Malaysian construction consulting companies. In this study, KM <b>and</b> <b>project</b> performance framework has been developed using factor analysis to generate variables for KM areas <b>and</b> <b>project</b> performance components. The classification of the implementation of KM areas are further grouped into two categories, i. e., exploitive and explorative. This paper also presents the classification of project performance framework within the Malaysian construction consulting companies based on practitioners’ perceptions to formulate two categories of project performance, i. e., normal <b>and</b> high <b>project</b> performance. Finally, a KM <b>and</b> <b>project</b> performance capability matrix is presented based on the consolidation of the prior findings...|$|R

Furthermore, for a substantial collection of cut <b>and</b> <b>project</b> sets we show that the number of frequencies of patches of size r remains bounded as r tends to infinity.

In the process of measurement design for collaborative working <b>and</b> <b>project</b> performance, a Likert Scale is adopted.
