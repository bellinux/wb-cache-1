The Saudi ambassador Abdul Aziz bin Ibrahim al-Ghadeer completely dedicated himself to relief efforts and hardly visited his office in Islamabad because of his constant field presence in Lahore, Multan and Hyderabad. As of 30 August, relief goods worth USD 40 million had been delivered and some USD 67 million worth of relief goods were in the pipeline; USD 5.3 million had been handed over to National Disaster Management Authority - NDMA Pakistan in cash. Two 100-bed mobile hospitals were also donated by the Saudi Government to the flood victims. Saudi public response was also staggering, as women donated jewellery to fundraising camps. In the aftermath of floods, Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal and Princess Amerah Al Taweel, visited the flood affected areas of Pakistan and took 10 tons of relief materials with them.|$|E

This research was conducted to gain a better understanding of the filling process in closed pipes and thus try to optimize the filling operations and minimize the risk of damages. An experimental investigation was performed to characterize the inflow front and assess the validity of the vertical front assumption. In these experiments, the upstream reservoir head and the pipe slope were varied, and the inflow front was measured and characterized with the aid of digital camcorders. A piezo-resistive pressure transducer was also used to record the pressure during the filling process. Among other findings, this investigation demonstrated that inflow fronts do not always close the pipe cross-section, invalidating the vertical interface assumption even when proposed criteria for this assumption to be applicable have been satisfied. Two different numerical models, based on the rigid column analysis proposed by Liou and Hunt (1996) and the shock-capturing technique developed by Vasconcelos et al. (2006) were used in this investigation to assess their predictive abilities in simulating the rapid filling of empty pipes. This assessment showed that while the rigid column model reproduces certain aspects of the observed flow, the shock-capturing model was capable of resolving more of the essential features of the flow...|$|E

An on-site wastewater treatment project site with two separate drip fields produced data on emitter flow rates and uniformity after 6 years of operation. The site served a two-bedroom residence in Weslaco, Texas, with treatment through a septic tank and subsurface flow constructed wetland. Filtration was accomplished with a small sand filter and screen filter. Results represent a worst-case scenario because the <b>air</b> <b>relief</b> valves were improperly installed and maintenance on the system was lacking. A pressure compensating (PC) emitter (Netafim Bioline 2. 30 L/hr) and a pressure dependent (PD) emitter (Aqua-Drip 3. 79 L/hr) were evaluated. When new, the PC emitters produced a mean discharge of 2. 33 L/hr with a manufacturing coefficient of 0. 043. The PD emitters, when new, produced a mean discharge of 4. 30 L/hr and a manufacturing coefficient of variation of 0. 016. The testing protocol was verified with the collection of data on new emitters. Two individual drip fields contained PC emitters (Netafim Bioline 3. 50 L/hr) and PD emitters (Aqua-Drip 2. 35 L/hr). The PC emitters were installed in a 200 m continuous length of tubing and the PD emitters were installed with ten individual lines of 15. 24 m connected with a supply and return header. Wastewater with an average BOD? of 23 mg/L was applied to two drip fields for 6 years. Emitter flow rates for 313 PC emitters were reduced to a mean discharge of 0. 95 L/hr with a coefficient of variation of 0. 74 and the 251 PD emitters were reduced to a mean discharge of 1. 52 L/hr with a coefficient of variation of 0. 35. Two shock chlorination treatments with chlorine concentrations of 500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L were used to increase the emitter's flow rate. Sixty PC and 61 PD emitters were evaluated. The initial average flow rate of the PC emitters was 0. 818 L/hr. Average flow rates for the PC emitters increased significantly to 0. 859 L/hr and 0. 954 L/hr following the 500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L shock chlorination treatments, respectively. The initial flow rate of the PD emitters was 1. 54 L/hr. The field flushing cycle represented an increase in flow rate to 1. 60 L/hr. The shock chlorination treatments increased the average flow rate to 1. 71 L/hr and 1. 77 L/hr following the 500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L treatments respectively. All increases in mean discharge were statistically significant. Uniformity and over-application of wastewater were evaluated by analyzing the soil profile on a 1. 22 m grid over the entire drain field. Statistical uniformity was 48. 1 percent and 71. 4 percent for the PC and PD emitters, respectively. The uniformity coefficient resulted in similar results with 70. 1 percent for the PC emitters and 85. 6 percent for the PD emitters. PC and PD fields caused an over-application of 55. 3 percent and 58. 5 percent of the field area, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Wave loads on coastal bridges due to tsunami {{and storm}} waves are studied through {{a set of}} {{laboratory}} experiments and numerical calculations. Effects of wave nonlinearity and entrapped air on wave loading under conditions where the bridge may be partially or fully inundated are of particular interest. In addition, effects of compressibility and scaling are investigated through numerical calculations. With the destruction of bridges during recent events such as the 2011 Tohoku tsunami and hurricanes Katrina in 2005 and Ivan in 2004, this highlights the importance of this research in understanding the mechanisms of failure during such events to prevent future coastal bridge failures. Destruction of these bridges is not only financially costly, but can prevent emergency services from reaching coastal communities, thus potentially contributing to loss of life. Along with the bridges, this research is applicable to other coastal and offshore structures, such as piers, submerged breakwaters and offshore platforms, in which wave loading or entrapped air is of concern. To investigate this problem, an extensive set of experiments is conducted on a flat plate, bridge model with girders, and a bridge model with varying percentages of trapped air that serves as a valuable benchmark for understanding wave loads on coastal structures, and bridges in particular. The wave cases tested include an extensive set of water depths, wave amplitudes and wave periods (for periodic waves) to cover a wide range of solitary and shallow-water to intermediate-water depth cnoidal waves. A range of model elevations was also tested to cover a range where the entire model is fully submerged below the water surface, to where the model is fully elevated above the water surface, {{and in the case of}} the model with girders, the girders are fully elevated as well. Experiments were conducted in a two-dimensional wave flume located in the University of Hawaii at Manoa's Hydraulics Lab in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. The models used were representative of a 1 : 35 scale model of a two-lane coastal bridge, typical in an island community. To study the effects of entrapped air, a series of experiments is conducted where side panels were added to each side of the model to trap air between the girders. Then different percentages of air-relief openings are added to the panels to capture a range of cases where no air can escape between the girders, to where all the air can escape and the wave can freely interact with the bottom of the bridge deck. Data from these experiments show the largest vertical uplift forces and forces in the direction of wave propagation on a flat plate and a bridge model occur when the structure is near the still-water level (SWL). For the cases where air is trapped, the addition of <b>air</b> <b>relief</b> openings significantly reduces uplift forces. Many current empirical relations estimating wave loads on coastal bridges only take hydrostatic effects into account. When compared with empirical estimations, data from these experiments show both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces must be taken into consideration. Comparison is also made with numerical calculations solving incompressible Euler's equations by use of the CFD software OpenFOAM, discussed in Hayatdavoodi (2013), Seiffert, Hayatdavoodi & Ertekin (2014), and Hayatdavoodi, Seiffert & Ertekin (2014 b) with excellent agreement. Effects of compressibility and scaling are tested numerically by solving compressible and incompressible Euler's equations. Numerical calculations show that the effects of compressibility on the long duration forces are small. Calculations also show that when Froude scaling is applied to forces on the model scale, the forces agree well with force calculations at the prototype scale. These results have important design implications for bridge engineers...|$|E
