5|$|One hundred {{thousand}} {{soldiers on the}} high seas in a multitude of transports converged on Gibraltar. More than 400 aircraft of all types were crammed into the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway. Fighters had been shipped in crates and assembled on the airfield.

5|$|Platform A2 {{is built}} {{along the edge}} of the {{retaining}} wall behind Pyramid A1. It faces west towards the pyramid and has two access stairways. Three successive versions of the platform were built, each overlying the previous. The earliest version sat upon the early retaining wall, as did the second version. The final version was much larger and was built after the new retaining wall had extended the <b>available</b> <b>area</b> for Group A.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{success of}} the American white ibis is sensitive to the hydrological conditions of the ecosystem such as rainfall and water levels. Low and decreasing water levels predict good prey accessibility. Water level reversals, where levels rise in the breeding season, disperse prey and impact on foraging success. Nest numbers and average clutch sizes are smaller in periods of reduced prey availability. The success rate of parents raising one or more young to 20 days of age ranges widely from 5 to 70% of nests, and varies greatly between nearby colonies. American white ibis parents {{have been known to}} supplement their chicks' diet with items such as cockroaches and rotting food from human garbage in poorer years, when fish and crayfish are more scarce. Studies have also shown that years with higher nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates of water bodies than years with low nesting numbers. This is because faster drying rates means that there are fewer fish and increased <b>available</b> <b>area</b> where crayfish can be hunted. This highlights the fact that American white ibises do not use probability of nesting failure as a key factor in determining nesting sites but instead, rely on other criteria such as prey availability and nest-site predation rates. The draining of wetlands in south Florida has also impacted on species that forage in shallow water such as the American white ibis, and its increase in numbers is a key indicator of restoration of habitat within the Everglades.|$|E

25|$|During the pre-war era, flying boats {{had been}} {{preferred}} for conducting long distance flights as, unlike their land-based counterparts, {{they were not}} limited by available runway length – the majority of which were still grass-surfaced at this point – and as a long range aeroplane {{would be required to}} carry a large load of fuel, a larger size of the aircraft could be permitted without needing to cater for factors such as limited runway and airfield sizes. In addition, for services to far-flung parts of the British Empire, the ability to land and take-off from any <b>available</b> <b>area</b> of water was a distinct advantage for services to such places, many of which at the time had no airport facilities at all. With the end of the Second World War, flying boats services were resumed with other types being operated, such as the Short Hythe, Short Sandringham, and Short Solent. However, the war had also produced a legacy of large runways and sizable airports formerly used for military purposes that could now meet the needs of a larger generation of land aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|Franklin {{cars were}} {{technological}} leaders, first with six-cylinders (by 1905) and later that year, the first eight-cylinder engine {{was built by}} Wilkinson {{in preparation for the}} [...] "Vanderbilt Cup" [...] race by placing two four-cylinder engines in tandem. The automatic spark advance was introduced in 1907. They were undisputed leaders in air-cooled cars at a time when virtually every other manufacturer had adopted water cooling as cheaper and easier to manufacture. Before the invention of antifreeze, the air-cooled car had a huge advantage in cold weather, and Franklins were popular among people such as doctors, who needed an all-weather machine. The limitation of air-cooling was the size of the cylinder bore and the <b>available</b> <b>area</b> for the valves, which limited the power output of the earlier Franklins. By 1921, a change in cooling—moving the fan from sucking hot air to blowing cool air—led the way to the gradual increase in power.|$|E
6000|$|We are--as the Census Returns for 1901 {{quite clearly}} show--in the early {{phase of a}} great {{development}} of centrifugal possibilities. And since {{it has been shown}} that a city of pedestrians is inexorably limited by a radius of about four miles, and that a horse-using city may grow out to seven or eight, it follows that the <b>available</b> <b>area</b> of a city which can offer a cheap suburban journey of thirty miles an hour is a circle with a radius of thirty miles. And is it too much, therefore, in view of all that has been adduced in this and the previous paper, to expect that the <b>available</b> <b>area</b> for even the common daily toilers of the great city of the year 2000, or earlier, will have a radius very much larger even than that? Now, a circle with a radius of thirty miles gives an area of over 2800 square miles, which is almost a quarter that of Belgium. But thirty miles is only a very moderate estimate of speed, and the reader of the former paper will agree, I think, that the <b>available</b> <b>area</b> for the social equivalent of the favoured season-ticket holders of to-day will have a radius of over one hundred miles, and be almost equal to the area of Ireland.[17] The radius that will sweep the area available for such as now live in the outer suburbs will include a still vaster area. Indeed, it is not too much to say that the London citizen of the year 2000 A.D. may have a choice of nearly all England and Wales south of Nottingham and east of Exeter as his suburb, and that the vast stretch of country from Washington to Albany will be all of it [...] "available" [...] to the active citizen of New York and Philadelphia before that date.|$|E

60|$|This {{does not}} for a moment imply that cities of the density of our {{existing}} great cities will spread to these limits. Even {{if we were to}} suppose the increase of the populations of the great cities to go on at its present rate, this enormous extension of <b>available</b> <b>area</b> would still mean a great possibility of diffusion. But though most great cities are probably still very far from their maxima, though the network of feeding railways has still to spread over Africa and China, and though huge areas are still imperfectly productive for want of a cultivating population, yet it is well to remember that for each great city, quite irrespective of its available spaces, a maximum of population is fixed. Each great city is sustained finally by the trade and production of a certain proportion of the world's surface--by the area it commands commercially. The great city cannot grow, except as a result of some quite morbid and transitory process--to be cured at last by famine and disorder--beyond the limit the commercial capacity of that commanded area prescribes. Long before the population of this city, with its inner circle a third of the area of Belgium, rose towards the old-fashioned city density, this restriction would come in. Even if we allowed for considerable increase in the production of food stuffs in the future, it still remains inevitable that the increase of each city in the world must come at last upon arrest.|$|E

40|$|Geographic {{range and}} numbers of buff-breasted flycatchers (Empidonax fulvifrons) have {{decreased}} in Arizona. I conducted surveys to locate additional populations.

I measured vegetation in used areas, nest sites, and <b>available</b> <b>areas.</b> I used logistic regression to compare used to <b>available</b> <b>areas</b> and nest sites to used <b>areas.</b> Used vs. <b>available</b> comparisons indicated that buff-breasted flycatchers used areas dominated by pines, with a sparse oak understory. I found significant associations between buff-breasted flycatcher presence and vegetation type, structural stage, canopy cover, and forest patch width. I developed a habitat model to help manage this rare species. I recommend continued monitoring of buff-breasted flycatcher populations and creation of open pine forest with an open understory of oak.
