40|$|In {{the turning}} {{operation}} chatter or vibration {{is a frequent}} problem, which affects {{the result of the}} machining, and, in particular, the surface finish. Tool life is also influenced by vibration. Severe acoustic noise in the working environment frequently occurs as a result of dynamic motion between the cutting tool and the workpiece. These problems can be reduced by active control of machine-tool vibration based on high magnetostrictive actuators. However, both the physical features and properties of a <b>active</b> <b>tool</b> holder construction based on high magnetostrictive actuators and the fact that this type of actuators generally have a non-linear behaviour highly reduce its applicability to the general lathe and turning operation. Therefor, a new generation embedded <b>active</b> <b>tool</b> holder shanks based on piezo ceramic actuators have been developed. Based on spectrum estimates, both coherence spectrum and frequency response function estimates has been calculated for both the old tool holder construction and the new generation <b>active</b> <b>tool</b> holder shank. From the results it follows that the phase delay is smaller and the linearity of the new generation <b>active</b> <b>tool</b> holder shank are superior compared to the old technology. It is also obvious that physical features and properties of new generation embedded <b>active</b> <b>tool</b> holder shanks based on piezo ceramic actuators fits the general lathe application...|$|R

Neurophysiological evidence suggests, however, that a vRF will grow to encompass a hand-held <b>tool</b> following <b>active</b> <b>tool</b> use but not after passive holding. Why does <b>active</b> <b>tool</b> use, and not passive holding, lead to spatial adaptation near a tool? We asked whether spatial adaptation could be the result of motor or visual experience with the tool, and we distinguished between these alternatives by isolating motor from visual experience with the tool. Participants learned to use a novel, weighted <b>tool.</b> The <b>active</b> training group received both motor and visual experience with the tool, the passive training group received visual experience with the tool, but no motor experience, and finally, a no-training control group received neither visual nor motor experience using the tool. After training, we used a cueing paradigm to measure how quickly participants detected targets, varying whether the tool was placed near or far from the target display. Only the active training group detected targets more quickly when the tool was placed near, rather than far, from the target display. This effect of tool location was not present for either the passive-training or control groups. These results suggest tha...|$|R

40|$|Tool {{making is}} a very time {{consuming}} and expensive operation because many iteration loops are used to manually adjust tool components during the try-out process. That means that trying out deep drawing tools is 30 % of the total costs. This {{is the reason why}} an <b>active</b> deep drawing <b>tool</b> was developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU in cooperation with Audi and Volkswagen to reduce the costs and production rates. The main difference between the active and conventional deep drawing tools is using piezoelectric actuators to control the forming process. The <b>active</b> <b>tool</b> idea, which is the main subject of this research, will be presented as well as the findings of experiments with the custom-built deep drawing tool. This experimental tool was designed according to production requirements and has been equipped with piezoelectric actuators that allow active pressure distribution on the sheet metal flange. The disposed piezoelectric elements are similar to those being used in piezo injector systems for modern diesel engines. In order to achieve the required force, the actuators are combined in a cluster that is embedded in the die of the deep drawing tool. One main objective of this work, i. e. reducing the time-consuming try-out-period, has been achieved with the experimental tool which means that the actuators were used to set static pressure distribution between the blankholder and die. We will present the findings of our analysis and the advantages of the active system over a conventional deep drawing tool. In addition to the ability of changing the static pressure distribution, the piezoelectric actuator {{can also be used to}} generate a dynamic pressure distribution during the forming process. As a result the <b>active</b> <b>tool</b> has the potential to expand the forming constraints to make it possible to manage forming restrictions caused by light weight materials in future...|$|R
