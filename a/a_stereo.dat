5|$|Disney {{considered}} {{releasing the}} film's soundtrack {{around the time}} of the film's roadshow release, but this idea was not realized. The soundtrack was first released as a mono three LP set and <b>a</b> <b>stereo</b> 8-track tape in sixteen countries by Disneyland and Buena Vista Records in 1957, containing the musical pieces without the narration. <b>A</b> <b>stereo</b> edition LP was issued by Buena Vista Records in 1961. Disney was required to obtain permission from Stokowski, who initially rejected its sale unless the Philadelphia Orchestra Association received a share of the royalties.|$|E
5|$|In {{professional}} concert {{sound system}} design, subwoofers {{can be incorporated}} seamlessly with the main speakers into <b>a</b> <b>stereo</b> or mono full-range system by using an active crossover. Such a system receives its signal from the main mono or stereo mixing console mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance. If the main sound system is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a mono subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from <b>a</b> <b>stereo</b> mix, depending on the crossover make and model.|$|E
5|$|To {{mark the}} album's tenth anniversary, The Downward Spiral was re-released on November 23, 2004 in {{high-resolution}} SACD and DualDisc formats. Disc {{one of the}} album's deluxe edition re-release is nearly {{identical to the original}} version; track anomalies such as sounds from previous tracks creeping up on start of tracks are fixed, and it includes <b>a</b> <b>stereo</b> and multi-channel SACD layer. The second bonus disc is a collection of remixes and B-sides and also includes <b>a</b> <b>stereo</b> SACD layer in addition to the Redbook CD layer. The last three tracks on the bonus disc are previously unreleased demo recordings from the original album.|$|E

5|$|The group {{carried out}} their vocal overdubs during the {{afternoon}} of 18 October. Over the instrumental break and the outro, the harmonies consist of McCartney singing a third above and Lennon a tenth below Harrison's double-tracked lead vocal. During the same session, Ringo Starr added a tambourine part. Although some Beatles authors credit Martin as having played harmonium, Fontenot says this contribution is inaudible on the completed track. A mono mix of the song was made on 25 October, and <b>a</b> <b>stereo</b> mix on 26 October – the day the Beatles collected their MBEs from Buckingham Palace.|$|E
5|$|Ciao Italia: Live from Italy (credited as Madonna: Ciao, Italia! Live from Italy in {{the video}} sequence) is a video album by American singer-songwriter Madonna and was {{released}} by Warner Reprise Video and Sire Records on May 24, 1988. It contained footage from a previous TV special of the Who's That Girl World Tour, Madonna in Concerto, broadcast in Europe in 1987, filmed at the Stadio Comunale in Turin, Italy. The video release also contained footage from shows recorded in Florence, Italy and Tokyo, Japan, the latter having previously been released as a Japanese TV special and home video release, Who's That Girl: Live in Japan. The decision to release Ciao Italia was spurred {{by the fact that}} this previous release became a commercial success in Japan. A re-release of the video took place in 1999, when it was released in DVD format, with <b>a</b> <b>stereo</b> soundtrack containing the songs only.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Sargent {{recorded}} Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, {{one of his}} specialities, {{which was}} reissued on CD in 1990 and again in 2004. Sargent recorded Walton's Façade Suites in 1961. With the LSO, Sargent recorded Walton's Orb and Sceptre March. He also made <b>a</b> <b>stereo</b> recording of Walton's First Symphony {{in the presence of}} the composer, but Walton privately preferred André Previn's recording, issued in January 1967, the same month as Sargent's. Of Vaughan Williams's shorter pieces, Sargent recorded, with the BBC in 1960, the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis (which he also recorded with the Philharmonia), and with the LSO, Serenade to Music (1957; choral version) and Toward the Unknown Region. He also recorded Vaughan Williams's overture The Wasps with the LSO.|$|E

The thesis aims to compare the most common methods of obtaining <b>a</b> wide <b>stereo</b> field based on metrics defined in the introduction to the thesis and subsequently to provide a recommended approach to achieving <b>a</b> wide <b>stereo</b> field taking into consideration the attributes and restrictions of the reader. The theoretical definitions of basic acoustic principles and sound as a physical entity will be presented in the theoretical part of the thesis. Within the practical part of the thesis the reader will find typical methods of creating <b>a</b> wide <b>stereo</b> field executed and monitored. The conclusion of the thesis will compare the individual methods and will provide the recommended approach to achieving <b>a</b> wide <b>stereo</b> field...|$|R

5|$|Muntz {{designed}} <b>a</b> <b>stereo</b> {{tape player}} called the Autostereo for cars {{and had it}} inexpensively manufactured in Japan. The Autostereo could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning the tape over, did not suffer from skipping or premature wear as the phonograph-based players did, and its number of knobs and controls were minimized to allow the driver {{to concentrate on the}} road. The tape player gave customers greater control over their listening experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or public service announcements, unlike radio broadcasts. Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his own stores and through franchises in Florida and Texas.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Sargent and the Liverpool Philharmonic {{accompanied}} Albert Sammons, the dedicatee, in his 1944 {{recording of}} the Delius Violin Concerto. Later, in 1965, with Jacqueline du Pré, in her début recording, Sargent recorded Delius's Cello Concerto, coupled with the Songs of Farewell (1965). At {{the end of the}} war, Sargent turned to recording Elgar. A recording regularly chosen over all others in comparative surveys is the first of Sargent's two versions of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius with Heddle Nash as tenor and the familiar Sargent pairing of the Huddersfield Choral Society and the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, recorded in 1945. Sargent was also the conductor for Heifetz's 1949 recording of Elgar's Violin Concerto and Paul Tortelier's first {{recording of the}} Cello Concerto in 1954. He also recorded Elgar's Wand of Youth Suite No. 2, with the BBC; the Pomp and Circumstance Marches 1 and 4 with the LSO; and the Enigma Variations with the Philharmonia. Sargent made two recordings of Holst's The Planets: a monaural version with the LSO for Decca (1950) and <b>a</b> <b>stereo</b> version with the BBC for EMI (1960). He also recorded shorter Holst pieces: The Perfect Fool ballet music and the Beni Mora suite.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>stereo</b> {{microphone}} integrates two microphones in {{one unit}} {{to produce a}} stereophonic signal. <b>A</b> <b>stereo</b> microphone is often used for broadcast applications or field recording {{where it would be}} impractical to configure two separate condenser microphones in a classic X-Y configuration (see microphone practice) for stereophonic recording.
