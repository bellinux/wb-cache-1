40|$|A large {{shortcoming}} {{of current}} chemistry transport models (CTM) for simulating {{the fate of}} ammonia in the atmosphere {{is the lack of}} a description of the bi-directional surface-atmosphere exchange. In this paper, results of an update of the surface-atmosphere exchange module DEPAC, i. e. DEPosition of Acidifying Compounds, in the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS are discussed. It is shown that with the new description, which includes bi-directional surface-atmosphere exchange, the modeled ammonia concentrations increase almost everywhere, in particular in <b>agricultural</b> <b>source</b> areas. The reason is that by using a compensation point the ammonia lifetime and transport distance is increased. As a consequence, deposition of ammonia and ammonium decreases in <b>agricultural</b> <b>source</b> areas, while it increases in large nature areas and remote regions especially in southern Scandinavia. The inclusion of a compensation point for water reduces the dry deposition over sea and allows reproducing the observed marine background concentrations at coastal locations to a better extent. A comparison with measurements shows that the model results better represent the measured ammonia concentrations. The concentrations in nature areas are slightly overestimated, while the concentrations in <b>agricultural</b> <b>source</b> areas are still underestimated. Although the introduction of the compensation point improves the model performance, the modeling of ammonia remains challenging. Important aspects are emission patterns in space and time as well as a proper approach to deal with the high concentration gradients in relation to model resolution. In short, the inclusion of a bi-directional surface-atmosphere exchange is a significant step forward for modeling ammonia. © Author(s) 2012. CC Attribution 3. 0 License...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{many parts}} of the world, {{groundwater}} quality deterioration is occurring often due to changes in land use along with overexploitation of some aquifers. Some of the drinking water distributed in Paris (France) is collected from a karstic Cretaceous chalk aquifer at two groups of springs located 80 km south of Paris, in the Lunain catchment. Although geographically close to each other, these springs (Sp 1 and Sp 2) have quite different hydrogeochemical characteristics. In Sp 1, an increase in the NO 3 - concentrations of 18 mg L (1) (from 16 mg L (1) in 1965 to 34 mg L (1) in 2009) has been observed and in Sp 2, NO 3 - concentrations have increased by 26 mg L (1) (from 20 mg L (1) in 1965 to 46 mg L (1) in 2009). The origin of the NO 3 - was, however, unclear. The stable isotopic composition of NO 3 - was used to identify the sources causing the increase of NO 3 - concentrations and to assess seasonal variations. The isotopic composition of two potential sources including agricultural effluents and wastewater was determined. Likewise, two additional NO 3 - sources, the chalk groundwater and the Lunain River water, were considered, following the hydrogeological context of the Lunain catchment. Determination the concentrations and the delta N- 15 and delta O- 18 values of spring water NO 3 - and the use of a Bayesian isotopic mixing model SIAR (Stable Isotope Analyses in R) allowed determination of the proportional contribution of respective NO 3 - sources in the springs. In spring Sp 1, all the potential NO 3 - sources (4) contributed almost equally during the low flow period, but higher NO 3 - contributions from the <b>agricultural</b> <b>source</b> and the chalk groundwater were observed during the high flow period. For the Sp 2 group of springs, elevated contributions of NO 3 - from the <b>agricultural</b> <b>source</b> and from the chalk aquifer were observed during the high flow period as well as during the low flow period. Knowledge of NO 3 - sources contributing to these springs is important for the implementation of remediation measures to protect the water resource and avoid further water quality deterioration.

40|$|A pilot area {{within the}} Venetian Plain was {{selected}} to assess the arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater. The area represents a typical residential, industrial and agricultural organization representative of most western countries, and is also devoid of lithologies with high or anomalous As content. Hydrogeological and chemical data have been collected, the latter spatialized by a geostatistical approach. The unconfined aquifer reservoir varies from a predominantly gravel composition in the north to a sandy and silt–clay composition further south, including peat layers. The hydrochemical features of the waters are rather homogeneous, featuring low mineral content and a Ca-bicarbonate signature. In contrast, the redox state is highly variable; oxidizing conditions are predominant in the northern and coarse parts of the aquifer, whereas reducing potentials prevail in the southern and silt–clay parts. Several well waters contain arsenic in excess of drinkable limits (= 10 ppb), {{and most of these}} wells are located in the southern area. A large portion of the studied area has a high probability of containing nonpotable water (up to 150 ppb As).

A spatially explicit inventory of methane emissions from agriculture is made for China taking the interconnections between the different <b>agricultural</b> <b>sources</b> into account. The influence of land-use change on methane emissions is studied by linking a dynamic land-use change model with emission calculations. The land-use change model calculates changes in rice area and livestock numbers for a base-line scenario. Emissions are calculated for 1991 based on land-use statistics and for 2010 based on simulated changes in land-use patterns. Emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management are based on emission factors, while emissions from rice paddies involve the calculation of total organic carbon added to rice paddy soils and assume that a constant fraction is emitted as methane. Spatial patterns of emissions are presented for the different sources. For the land-use scenario considered {{it is expected that}} total methane emissions from <b>agricultural</b> <b>sources</b> in China increase by 11 hile the relative contribution of rice fields to the emission decreases.

40|$|Despite recent {{evidence}} on {{an important role}} of volatile amines in the nucleation of particulate matter, very scarce information is available on their atmospheric abundance and source distribution. Previous measurements in animal housings had identified livestock husbandry as the main amine source, with trimethylamine (TMA) being the key component. This {{has led to the}} assumption that the agricultural sources for amines are similar as for ammonia, emitted throughout the cascade of animal excretion, storage and application in the field. In this study, we present the first micrometeorological flux measurements as well as dynamic enclosure experiments showing that the amine source strength from stored slurry is negligible, implying significant consequences for the global amine emission inventory. In the case of cattle, amine production is attributed to the animal's rumination activity and exhalation is suggested to be an important emission pathway, similar to the greenhouse gas methane. Fodder like hay and silage also emits volatile amines, potentially assigning these alkaloid compounds a key function in enhancing particle formation in remote areas. Citation: Kuhn, U., J.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} the socioeconomic and environmental changes in rural China {{from the perspective}} of agricultural households and developed a multi-agent agricultural household model for rural environmental management (MAREM). The MAREM model consists of four submodules: the agricultural household production module, the consumption module, the labor supply module, and the environmental assessment module. In the model, virtual agricultural households exist in a hypothetical village. Farmers follow a self-adaptive approach to learn and understand policy variations, in order to make relevant decisions. The model has been validated through simulation of actual trends (the based-on-reality scenario). On the basis of this scenario, we further analyzed possible future trends in rural environmental pollution in China. Our results reflect that China may enter a period of farmer income stagnation accompanied by a rapid deterioration in rural environmental quality. Ammonia emission from livestock production may become the primary <b>agricultural</b> <b>source</b> of air pollution, and eutrophication is calculated to be the major water pollution issue for the long term. Synthetic fertilizer application is projected to be the dominant source of total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in aquatic system (contributing to about 64 % and 46 % of the total discharge, respectively). Our study shows that MAREM is an effective tool to analyze the interactions between agricultural households' behavior and environmental consequences under specific policies in China...|$|E

The d 13 CofCH 4 data corroborate the record from Law Dome, Antarctica, with high fidelity. The new dD ofCH 4 data set covaries with the d 13 Cof CH 4 record. Both d 13 CofCH 4 and dD ofCH 4 were relatively stable and close to the present-day values from 1000 to 1500 CE. Both isotopic ratios decreased to minima around 1700 CE, remained low until the late 18 th century, and then rose exponentially to present-day values.

Using the superposition of ArcGIS raster data, we also described the spatial distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus comprehensive loss risk by the formula of comprehensive loss risk. The results showed that critical risk areas of nitrogen and phosphorus loss mainly originated from livestock breeding and agricultural land during flood period in Tiaoxi watershed. Agricultural land and livestock breeding sources formed major parts of nitrogen loss, accounting for 30. 85 % and 36. 18 %, respectively, while phosphorus loss mainly originated from livestock breeding (56. 28 %). During non-flood period, integrated management of livestock breeding and domestic discharge requires much attention to control nitrogen and phosphorus loss in the critical risk area.
