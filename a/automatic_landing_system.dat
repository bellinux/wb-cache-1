500|$|The Comet 3, which flew for {{the first}} time on 19 July 1954, was a Comet 2 {{lengthened}} by [...] and powered by Avon M502 engines developing [...] The variant added wing pinion tanks, and offered greater capacity and range. The Comet 3 was destined to remain a development series since it did not incorporate the fuselage-strengthening modifications of the later series aircraft, and was not able to be fully pressurised. Only two Comet 3s began construction with G-ANLO, the only airworthy Comet 3, demonstrated at the Farnborough SBAC Show in September 1954. The other Comet 3 airframe was not completed to production standard and was used primarily for ground-based structural and technology testing during development of the similarly sized Comet 4. Nine additional Comet 3 airframes were not completed and their construction was abandoned at Hatfield. In BOAC colours, G-ANLO was flown by John Cunningham in a marathon round-the-world promotional tour in December 1955. As a flying testbed, it was later modified with Avon RA29 engines fitted, as well as replacing the original long-span wings with reduced span wings as the Comet 3B and demonstrated in British European Airways (BEA) livery at the Farnborough Airshow in September 1958. Assigned in 1961 to the Blind Landing Experimental Unit (BLEU) at RAE Bedford, the final testbed role played by G–ANLO was in <b>automatic</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> experiments. When retired in 1973, the airframe was used for foam arrester trials before the fuselage was salvaged at BAE Woodford, to serve as the mock-up for the Nimrod.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- During landing, aircrafts {{have to face}} low-altitude {{wind shear}} that can be fatal. Most {{commercial}} aircrafts currently have optimal <b>automatic</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems,</b> but they are activated only if well-specified wind speed limitations are met. The reason is that these autolanding systems are not designed {{to work in the}} presence of strong wind gusts. In this paper, we apply a modified version of brain emotional learning based intelligent controller (BELBIC) to the autolanding system whose multivariable and non-minimum phase nature make the task difficult. By comparing the results with the results derived from using a high-gain controller, we show that our proposed solution can achieve robust and satisfactory performance...|$|R

50|$|On 21 July 2013, a Russian Sukhoi Superjet 100 airliner, {{prototype}} aircraft 95005, unintentionally crash-landed gear-up at Keflavík International Airport near Keflavík, Iceland when, during {{evaluation of the}} aircraft's <b>automatic</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system,</b> {{and its ability to}} land with a single engine while in a crosswind, the plane hit and slid down the runway with the gear up. The accident was blamed on pilot error, which was caused by severe fatigue. As a result, during an intended go-around, the pilot throttled up the wrong engine. Due to the plane's low-energy state, the plane continued to lose altitude, and, before the pilot realized his mistake, and throttled up the correct engine, it was too late, and the aircraft hit the runway. One of the five crew on board was injured evacuating the aircraft. Nine safety recommendations were made by the Icelandic Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the accident. The aircraft was repaired and it flew again on 27 December 2013.|$|E
50|$|The flying {{controls}} of the Belfast incorporated numerous features developed by Bristol and Canadair, {{in addition to}} Shorts; all three parties had heavily collaborated on its development. It used the same manual servo-tab system as used on the Britannia, but had some advancements, {{especially in terms of}} lateral control via a simpler spoiler configuration. Other advancements include the linking of the port aileron to the rudder to counteract adverse rolling due to rudder deflection, and the elevator is linked to the flaps to cancel out trim changes caused by flap operations. The Belfast was equipped with a full <b>automatic</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system,</b> produced by Smiths Aerospace, the first aircraft in the world to be designed to feature such capability from the onset of development. The autopilot and flight control system, known as the ASR 518, was triplex in the roll and pitch channels, with duplex or emergency simplex ability. The instrument landing system comprised many functions, such as an autothrottle, a head-up display, and radio altimeter.|$|E
50|$|Some {{commercial}} aircraft {{are equipped with}} <b>automatic</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems</b> that allow the aircraft to land without transitioning from instruments to visual conditions for a normal landing. Such autoland operations require specialized equipment, procedures and training, and involve the aircraft, airport, and the crew. Autoland {{is the only way}} some major airports such as Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport remain operational every day of the year. Some modern aircraft are equipped with Enhanced flight vision systems based on infrared sensors, that provide a day-like visual environment and allow operations in conditions and at airports that would otherwise not be suitable for a landing. Commercial aircraft also frequently use such equipment for takeoffs when takeoff minima are not met.|$|R

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to other operations, CAT III weather minima {{do not provide}} sufficient visual references to allow a manual landing to be made. CAT III minima depend on roll-out control and redundancy of the autopilot, because they give only enough time for the pilot {{to decide whether the}} aircraft will land in the touchdown zone (basically CAT IIIa) and to ensure safety during rollout (basically CAT IIIb). Therefore, an <b>automatic</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> is mandatory to perform Category III operations. Its reliability must be sufficient to control the aircraft to touchdown in CAT IIIa operations and through rollout to a safe taxi speed in CAT IIIb (and CAT IIIc when authorized). [...] However, special approval has been granted to some operators for hand-flown CAT III approaches using a head-up display (HUD) guidance which provides the pilot with an image viewed through the windshield with eyes focused at infinity, of necessary electronic guidance to land the airplane with no true outside visual references.|$|E

50|$|Though Leonov {{was able}} to {{complete}} his spacewalk successfully, both that task and the overall mission were plagued with problems. Leonov's only tasks were to attach a camera {{to the end of}} the airlock to record his spacewalk and to photograph the spacecraft. He managed to attach the camera without any problem. However, when he tried to use the still camera on his chest, the suit had ballooned and he was unable to reach down to the shutter switch on his leg. After his 12 minutes and 9 seconds outside the Voskhod, Leonov found that his suit had stiffened, due to ballooning out, to the point where he could not re-enter the airlock. He was forced to bleed off some of his suit's pressure, in order to be able to bend the joints, eventually going below safety limits. Leonov did not report his action on the radio to avoid alarming others, but Soviet state radio and television had earlier stopped their live broadcasts from the spacecraft when the mission experienced difficulties. The two crew members subsequently experienced difficulty in sealing the hatch properly due to thermal distortion caused by Leonov's lengthy troubles returning to the craft, followed by a troublesome re-entry in which malfunction of the <b>automatic</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> forced the use of its manual backup. The spacecraft was so cramped that the two cosmonauts, both wearing spacesuits, could not return to their seats to restore the ship's center of mass for 46 seconds after orienting the ship for reentry and a landing in Perm Krai. The orbital module did not properly disconnect from the landing module, not unlike Vostok 1, causing the spherical return vehicle to spin wildly until the modules disconnected at 100 km.|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to describe the}} pilot as a monitor of <b>automatic</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems.</b> The failures treated are equivalent to {{the addition of a}} dynamic change in the mean of the observation process. The failure detection model of the pilot consists of two stages: a linear estimator (Kalman filter) and a decision mechanism based on sequential analysis. The filter equations are derived from a simplified version of the linearized dynamics of the airplane and the control loop. The perceptual observation noise is modified to include the effects of allocation of attention among the several instruments. The final result is a simple model consisting of a high-pass filter to produce the observation residuals and a decision function which is a pure integration of the residuals minus a bias term. The dynamics of a Boeing 707 were used to simulate the fully coupled final approach in a fixed-base simulator. Observers monitored the approaches and detected the failures; their performance was compared with the predictions of the model...|$|R
