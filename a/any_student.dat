5|$|Early in the Society's history, {{when its}} focus was still {{primarily}} literary, membership was considered {{by a committee}} {{for three days and}} then voted upon. By 1908, that model had been abandoned in favor of an open system in which <b>any</b> <b>student</b> who paid an annual fee could be part of the group. At that time, Philaletheis was governed by a six-member board consisting of a president and vice-president (both seniors), secretary, treasurer, and props manager (juniors), and an assistant props manager (a sophomore). In 1951, the board was vastly expanded to include managers of scenery, lights, sound, makeup, publicity, {{and a number of other}} fields.|$|E

It is not recorded what these changes were, but after a further discussion in 1762 the Inns adopted a rule that <b>any</b> <b>student</b> with a Master of Arts or Bachelor of Laws degree from the universities of Oxford or Cambridge could be called to the Bar after three years as a student, and any other student could be called after five years. An attempt was made to increase the quality of legal education at Gray's Inn; in 1753 a barrister, Danby Pickering, was employed to lecture there, although this agreement ended in 1761 when he was called to the Bar.|$|E
