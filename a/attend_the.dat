5|$|As the {{composition}} is not precisely defined, some states {{which have a}} considerable division of executive power can {{find it difficult to}} decide who should <b>attend</b> <b>the</b> meetings. While an MEP, Alexander Stubb argued that {{there was no need for}} the President of Finland to attend Council meetings with or instead of the Prime Minister of Finland (who was head of European foreign policy). In 2008, having become Finnish Foreign Minister, Stubb was forced out of the Finnish delegation to the emergency council meeting on the Georgian crisis because the President wanted to <b>attend</b> <b>the</b> high-profile summit as well as the Prime Minister (only two people from each country could <b>attend</b> <b>the</b> meetings). This was despite Stubb being head of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at the time which was heavily involved in the crisis. Problems also occurred in Poland where the President of Poland and the Prime Minister of Poland were of different parties and had a different foreign policy response to the crisis. A similar situation arose in Romania between President Traian Băsescu and Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu in 2007–2008 and again in 2012 with Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who both opposed the president.|$|E
