5|$|In December 1903, in {{an effort}} to avert another bout of Beebe's throat ailment, Hornaday sent him on an {{expedition}} to Mexico which would last until the following April. Since Mexico was still largely unstable at this point, he and Blair traveled on horseback and lived mostly in tents, and both carried revolvers for self-protection. Although the purpose of the expedition was to discover, identify and collect Mexico's birds, it has also been described as yet another honeymoon between him and Blair. Beebe's first book, titled Two Bird Lovers in Mexico, was an account of this expedition. The last chapter was written by Blair, and was an explanation of how to plan and execute <b>a</b> <b>vacation</b> <b>in</b> the wilderness. The book was enthusiastically well received.|$|E

Peter asks Cleveland where he first heard the joke, and Cleveland reveals that a Washington, D.C., bellhop named Sal Russo told it to him. The group sets out for D.C. with Cleveland in tow. They are attacked by a black car, whose occupants fire guns at them {{to prevent them from}} learning the joke's origin.

5|$|The WSPU's {{approval}} of property destruction {{led to the}} departure of several important members. The first were Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and her husband Frederick. They had long been integral members of the group's leadership but found themselves in conflict with Christabel {{about the wisdom of}} such volatile tactics. After returning from <b>a</b> <b>vacation</b> <b>in</b> Canada they found that Pankhurst had expelled them from the WSPU. The pair found the decision appalling, but to avoid a schism in the movement they continued to praise Pankhurst and the organisation in public. Around the same time, Emmeline's daughter Adela left the group. She disapproved of WSPU endorsement of property destruction and felt that a heavier emphasis on socialism was necessary. Adela's relationship with her family – especially Christabel – was also strained as a result.|$|E
