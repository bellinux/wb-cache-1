5|$|At many of {{the early}} crucial battles of the Pacific, for {{instance}} Coral Sea and Midway, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's , which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never {{given a chance to}} show their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in Japanese pre-war planning.|$|E

Attacking the posts, Derrick personally rushed forward on four separate occasions and threw his grenades <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of about , before all three were silenced. Derrick's platoon held their position that night, before the 2/48th Battalion moved in to take Sattelberg unopposed the following morning.

5|$|On 3 July, Linienschiffsleutnant Ludwig Müller sailed U-20 {{out from}} Trieste for the Gulf of Venice. A day later, U-20 was spotted by the Italian {{submarine}} F-12, {{which was on}} patrol in the northern Adriatic. F-12 initially pursued U-20 underwater, {{and then on the}} surface. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of , F-12 torpedoed U-20 at position , sinking her with all hands.

5|$|One of {{the design}} intents of the SS190 variety of this {{cartridge}} was that it {{have the ability to}} penetrate Kevlar protective vests—such as the NATO CRISAT vest—that will stop conventional pistol bullets.

5|$|The {{development}} of military camouflage {{was driven by}} the increasing range and accuracy of infantry firearms in the 19th century. In particular {{the replacement of the}} inaccurate musket with weapons such as the Baker rifle made personal concealment in battle essential. Two Napoleonic War skirmishing units of the British Army, the 95th Rifle Regiment and the 60th Rifle Regiment, were the first to adopt camouflage {{in the form of a}} rifle green jacket, while the Line regiments continued to wear scarlet tunics. A contemporary study in 1800 by the English artist and soldier Charles Hamilton Smith provided evidence that grey uniforms were less visible than green ones <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of 150 yards.|$|E
5|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{testing of}} the rocket launchers {{took place at the}} end of 1938, when 233 rounds of various types were used. A salvo of rockets could completely straddle a target <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of 5,500 metres (3.4mi). But the artillery branch was not fond of the Katyusha, because it took up to 50 minutes to load and fire 24 rounds, while a conventional howitzer could fire 95 to 150 rounds in the same time. Testing with various rockets was conducted through 1940, and the BM-13-16 with launch rails for sixteen rockets was authorized for production. Only forty launchers were built before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.|$|E

An immunological study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to the plains zebra. A 1987 study suggested that the mtDNA of the quagga diverged <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of roughly 2% per million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to the plains zebra.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 September 5, Lieutenant Colonel Rollins S. Emmerich, {{one of the}} ROK I Corps KMAG advisers, {{hastened to}} Yonil Airfield where he conferred with Lieutenant Colonel D. M. McMains, {{commanding}} the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry, stationed there, and informed him {{of the situation in}} P'ohang-dong. Emmerich obtained a platoon of tanks and returned with them to the town. He placed the tanks in position and awaited the expected North Korean armored attack. At 05:30 he received information that elements of the ROK 22nd Regiment had retreated in the face of North Korean attack. North Korean troops entered this gap and just before 11:00 the American tanks in P'ohang-dong were under heavy North Korean machine gun fire. Five NK SU-76 self-propelled guns approached and began firing. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of one city block the US tanks knocked out the lead gun, killing its three crew members. In the ensuing exchange of fire the other four withdrew. Emmerich then directed air strikes and artillery fire which destroyed the other four guns. But that afternoon at 14:35 the order came to evacuate all materiel and supplies from the Yonil airstrip.|$|E
5|$|At 13.5degrees of elevation, the 30.5cm gun {{could hit}} targets out to 16,200m (17,717yards) with armor-piercing shells. After the turrets were {{improved}} to allow elevation to 16degrees, the range correspondingly increased to 20,400m (22,310yd). <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of 12,800m (14,000yd), the L3 armor-piercing shells {{fired by the}} gun were expected to penetrate 254mm (10in) of armor plate. At 15,000m (16,000yd) {{the effectiveness of the}} shell decreased; it was able to pierce 229mm (9in)-thick plate. The range of the World War II guns was significantly greater than the guns used in World War I. With the 405kg shell at 45degrees, the guns had a maximum range of 32,000m (35,000yd). With the 415kg shell at 49.2degrees, the range was 41,300m (45,166yd), and with the lighter 250kg round at 49.1degrees, the maximum range was 51,400m (56,200yd).|$|E

5|$|Both German ships {{initially}} concentrated {{their fire}} on Hood and destroyed her with salvoes of 8- and 15-inch shells. An 8-inch shell hit the boat deck and struck a ready service locker for the UP rocket projectors, and a fire blazed {{high above the}} first superstructure deck. At 05:58 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of , the force commander ordered a turn of 20 degrees to port to open the range and bring the full battery of the British ships to bear on Bismarck. As the turn began, Bismarck straddled Hood with her third and fourth four-gun salvoes and at 06:01 the fifth salvo hit her, causing a large explosion. Flames shot up near Hoods masts, then an orange-coloured fireball and an enormous smoke cloud obliterated the ship. On Prince of Wales, it seemed that Hood collapsed amidships, and the bow and stern could be seen rising as she rapidly settled. Prince of Wales made a sharp starboard turn to avoid hitting the debris {{and in doing so}} further closed the range between her and the German ships. In the four-minute action, Hood, the largest battlecruiser in the world, had been sunk. 1,419 officers and men were killed. Only three men survived.|$|E
5|$|Colossus, {{named after}} the Colossus of Rhodes, was the fifth ship of her name {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy (RN). The ship was ordered on 1 June 1909 and laid down at Scotts Shipbuilding & Engineering at their {{shipyard}} in Greenock on 8 July. She was launched on 9 April 1910 and completed in July 1911 at the cost of £1,672,102, including her armament. The ship began trials on 28 February that lasted until July. Colossus commissioned at Devonport on 8 August and was assigned to the 2nd Division of the Home Fleet. This was redesignated as the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. The ship participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead and became the temporary flagship of the squadron while her sister ship, , was being refitted in November–December. During this time, she conducted gunnery practice off Portland <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of , the longest shoot performed by any ship of the RN {{before the start of the}} war. Shortly afterwards, Colossus was transferred to the 1st BS. She visited Cherbourg, France, with part of the fleet in March 1913.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
