5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} {{a lovely}} ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year. He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E
5|$|On {{the sixth}} {{night of the}} Games, Lochte swam his last two finals, with only 30 minutes in between. First, he won the bronze medal in the 200m backstroke, {{finishing}} behind compatriot Tyler Clary and Japan's Ryosuke Irie. His time of 1.53.94 tied the time he swam four years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{won the gold medal}} at the 2008 Games, which was then a world record. Half an hour later, Lochte took on Phelps in the 200m individual medley. He won a silver medal behind Phelps in what was thought at the time to be the last head-to-head race of their careers, as Phelps retired after the Games. This was the third consecutive Olympics in which Lochte won a medal in the 200m individual medley.|$|E

Since then the name of the Serpent Lord has once more become a famous one throughout Harad, and his own legend grows with each victory. A Haradrim chief analogous to one whom Théoden faces at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Tolkien left him unnamed; his name and title are invented by Games Workshop although his name is likely an altered form of Saladin; the Muslim leader during the Third Crusade.|$|E

Ben then starts to call Will [...] "Dewey" [...] (just as other students did at his old school), which stands for [...] "DWI" [...] ("Driving While Intoxicated"). Will detests this nickname because it reminds him of his father, whom he is ashamed of. What is more, Charlotte's father dies and she decides to quit the band. As she explains to Will, her father hated how she acted when she was with her ex-boyfriend, so after he got sick, she decided to change her image and be nicer to [...] "people like [...] ", meaning outcasts, hoping that this good behavior would cause her dad to get well. The band members are hurt by this discovery, as it means she did not genuinely like them, but they decide to go on nonetheless, with Sa5m taking over as lead singer.|$|E
500|$|In 1888, Getzein {{compiled}} an 18–22record and a 3.05ERA. [...] He started 46games {{and completed}} 45 {{of them with}} 404innings pitched. However, Getzein lost his role at the team's leading pitcher, as Pete Conway compiled a 30–14record and a 2.25ERA for the 1888 Wolverines. [...] After Getzein gave up 10runs in an August1888 game against Washington, the Detroit Free Press dubbed him the [...] "Pulverized Pretzel." [...] The newspaper reported: [...] "The Detroits were defeated again to-day ... simply because Getzein could not keep the ball away from the Senatorial bat. [...] When he pitched high they hit it. [...] When he delivered his famous drop, he was knocked out of the lot, and his in and out curves were as big as balloons to Ted Sullivan's men." [...] As the 1888season progressed, relations between Getzein and the Detroit manager became strained. [...] After {{a game in which}} Getzein gave up 21hits against Boston, The Sporting Life reported on speculation that Getzein may have intentionally thrown the game: [...] "The Getzein episode makes Detroiters weary. [...] The Bostons have no license to make 21 hits off the Pretzel when he pitches his game.
