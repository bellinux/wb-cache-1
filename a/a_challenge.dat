Five challenges resulting from this crisis are identified: <b>a</b> production <b>challenge,</b> <b>an</b> underutilization <b>challenge,</b> <b>a</b> distributional <b>challenge,</b> <b>a</b> performance <b>challenge,</b> and <b>a</b> financing <b>challenge.</b> Differences between the labor market approach and others used in the health field are noted.

While their representatives tried to clarify matters, Breckinridge and Cutting made amends, averting the duel.
