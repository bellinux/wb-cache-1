The RMLE advanced through a downpour to Bouleaux Trench and then overran Le Golfe; early on 18 April, Byzance, Dardanelles and Prince Eitel trenches, to the south-west of Aubérive were captured. The attack achieved a measure of surprise but the German defence on the left flank, held up the French advance at Levant Trench and in Bois <b>Allonge,</b> which were eventually captured, before the advance resumed on Landsturm Trench.

2500|$|In January it {{was decided}} to {{manufacture}} a longer suspension. Schneider had, already before 9 December 1915, devised a system thirty centimetres longer with seven road wheels instead of five. Mourret ordered to build an alternative system. [...] Two Baby Holt tractors, part of the order of fifteen by Schneider on 21 September 1915, and property of the French State, were during two weeks from 2 February onwards in an army workshop combined into a single elongated vehicle, a caterpillar offensif <b>allongé,</b> by Lieutenant Charles Fouché, assisted by a small team of mechanics. The workshop was in the Farman factory at Billancourt appropriated from the l'Automobilette company. It was again about a foot longer than the Schneider type, and featured three bogies with a total of eight road wheels. The new suspension system was not based on exact blueprints but improvised by private Pierre Lescudé. On 17 February the eight-wheeled system, which prototype was later designated L'appareil n° 1 Type A ("Device Number 1 Type A") was tested at Vincennes, easily crossing trenches up to 1.75 metres wide and overcoming barbed wire obstacles. On 21 February successful tests were held at Vincennes, the Schneider company providing a non-elongated Baby Holt chassis for comparison. From this it was concluded that the tank was sufficiently developed to justify a production order. On 25 February 1916 the War Ministry secretly ordered the production of four hundred tracteurs-chenilles type Schneider & Cie blindés ("tracked and armoured tractors of the Schneider type"), at a price of 56,000 French francs per vehicle. For security reasons it was pretended these were simple towing vehicles, tracteurs Estienne. The earlier order of 15 December for ten vehicles was hereby replaced. Fouché was ordered to improve the prototype, which resulted in a slightly changed L'appareil n° 1 Type B, tested on 2 March. Further changes, now including improvised side armour extending to the front in a bow, created the L'appareil n° 1 Type C or Machine Profilée which was tested on 17 March. On 27 February, Schneider had been asked to provide a first armoured superstructure made of boiler steel, which was late March placed on the eight-wheeled chassis. Pictures of this vehicle have often been presented in books as showing the [...] "first Schneider CA prototype". However, this entire development line, even though its official order had been based on it, would not be ancestral to the Schneider tank. In the Spring of 1916, for reasons that are not entirely clear, there was a fundamental falling-out between the French Army and Schneider Cie. The latter company would develop and produce its Schneider tank {{on the basis of its}} seven-wheeled chassis, which had been patented on 17 January; the Army would develop the eight-wheeled system into the Saint-Chamond heavy tank.|$|E

5000|$|Galzy's {{novels are}} {{frequently}} regarded as romans à clef—transcribing her personal experiences. Thus, in La Femme chez les garçons and L'Initiatrice aux mains vides she {{is considered to}} recount her own life as a teacher in Paris, and likewise Les <b>Allongés</b> is supposed to treat solely her two-year disease. Galzy herself resisted such a reading (called the [...] "autobiographical fallacy" [...] by literary critics), claiming that writing fiction allowed her a detachment from reality. In Les <b>Allongés,</b> for instance, readers should find, besides a possible biographical connection, [...] "a more general metaphysical investigation and validation of human suffering." [...] Critics note, however, that explicit denials that a given novel is a roman à clef is often a rhetorical move; such a denial is given {{on the first page}} of Jeunes Filles en serre chaude, a novel of [...] "intergenerational love" [...] (between teacher and student) in a [...] "pedagogic context" [...] similar to Galzy's experiences at the École normale supérieure which questions [...] "the suitability of contemporary educational opportunities for young women".|$|R

An <b>allonge</b> is more usually met with in those countries where the Code Napoleon is in force, as the code requires every endorsement to express the consideration. Under English law, as the simple signature of the endorser on the bill, without additional words, is sufficient to operate as a negotiation, an <b>allonge</b> is seldom necessary.|$|E
