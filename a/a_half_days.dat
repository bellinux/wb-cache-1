5|$|Barman drew on {{data and}} {{measurements}} taken by Heather Knutson, {{a student at}} Harvard University, from the Hubble Space Telescope, and applied new theoretical models to demonstrate the likelihood of water absorption in {{the atmosphere of the}} planet. The planet orbits its parent star every three and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>days,</b> and each time it passes in front of its parent star, the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the atmosphere absorbs light passing from the star directly through the atmosphere in the direction of Earth.|$|E
5|$|By 1818, seventy 60-ton barges {{were working}} on the canal, the {{majority}} of the tonnage being coal and stone travelling via the Somerset Coal Canal.

5000|$|Many {{people believe}} that it was named <b>Half</b> <b>Day</b> because it was {{regarded}} that <b>Half</b> <b>Day</b> was <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>day's</b> distance from Chicago by horse and carriage. In reality, a horse and carriage could make it to Chicago in <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>day</b> but some believe the area was actually named after Potawatomi Chief Aptakisic, the chief at the time the area was settled. The name was anglicized as [...] "Half Day" [...] or [...] "Hefda" [...] and a cartographer spelled it [...] "Half Day", and the misnomer stuck, giving rise to the reputed, but erroneous, derivation of the name.|$|R
5|$|The six {{survivors}} {{buried the}} bodies {{found on the}} beach, then travelled east along the beach, expecting to reach Cape Town. However, after four and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>days,</b> they realised their error {{and returned to the}} site of the wreck. Here they subsisted off a cask of oatmeal, while trying to effect repairs to the ship's pinnace, which had been washed ashore. They were discovered six days later on 14 June by a farmer's son, who was out hunting.|$|E
5|$|Following Whitman's {{resignation}} and DiFrancesco's departure, John O. Bennett served as acting governor {{for three and}} <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>days.</b> During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as acting governor as well. Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of acting governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle {{as much as any}} other factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 b (commonly {{shortened}} to GJ 3634 b) is a super-Earth exoplanet in {{the orbit}} of the nearby red dwarf Gliese 3634 at approximately 64.5 light-years in constellation Hydra. The planet is approximately eight times the mass of Earth, and orbits its star every two and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>days</b> {{at a distance of}} 0.0287 AU. The planet was the first to be discovered by a group of astronomers searching for exoplanets in {{the orbit of}} very-low-mass stars after the team reorganized their strategy, choosing to search for targets that they could also confirm using the transit method. However, a transit event associated with Gliese 3634 b was not detected. The planet's discovery was published in Astronomy and Astrophysics on February 8, 2011.|$|E

5|$|The adverse {{conditions}} {{faced by the}} keepers resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, but the remote location suited some veterans. Archibald McEachern was assistant keeper for 14 years from 1870–84 and John Nicol was principal from 1890–1903. The latter {{was involved in a}} dramatic rescue when the liner Labrador en route from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Liverpool ran aground on the nearby Mackenzie's Rock in 1899. The lifeboats were manned and two made it to Mull, but one with eighteen passengers reached the lighthouse where they were looked after for two and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>days</b> before they could be taken to the mainland. No lives were lost and Nicol and his two assistants were commended by the NLB for their efforts.|$|E
5|$|Europa orbits Jupiter in {{just over}} three and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>days,</b> with an orbital radius of about 670,900km. With an {{eccentricity}} of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital inclination relative to Jupiter's equatorial plane is small, at 0.470°. Like its fellow Galilean satellites, Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of Europa constantly facing Jupiter. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa's surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa's prime meridian is the line intersecting this point. Research suggests that the tidal locking may not be full, as a non-synchronous rotation has been proposed: Europa spins faster than it orbits, or at least did so in the past. This suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy crust from the rocky interior.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of May 19, PC-815's sonar {{detected}} what the crew believed to be an enemy submarine off Cape Lookout, about ten to twelve miles offshore. Over the next two and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>days,</b> Hubbard ordered his crew to fire a total of 35 depth charges and a number of gun rounds to target what Hubbard believed to be two Imperial Japanese Navy submarines. The PC-815 was joined by the US Navy blimps K-39 and K-33, the US Coast Guard patrol boats Bonham and 78302 and the subchasers USS SC-536 and USS SC-537 to assist it in the search for the suspected enemy vessels. Hubbard was given temporary command of the vessels on the afternoon of May 19. The larger subchaser PC-778 also joined the submarine search, though it found no indication of submarines and its commander was subsequently castigated by Hubbard for his refusal to lay its own larger stock of depth charges or resupply the PC-815.|$|E

5|$|Storms {{were most}} likely to occur in May, {{followed}} by December. Out of all recorded storms in the database, only one cyclone was reported in the month of March; the 1908 March hurricane, as well as one tropical storm in February, which was the 1952 Groundhog Day Storm. In addition, only three tropical or subtropical cyclones formed in April ndash& a subtropical storm in 1992, Tropical Storm Ana of 2003, and Tropical Storm Arlene of 2017. A hurricane in 1938, a tropical storm in 1951, a subtropical storm in 1978, and Hurricane Alex of 2016 occurred in January. Of all cyclones during the off-season, Hurricane Lili in 1984 lasted the longest, for a total of 12 days. Hurricane Epsilon, which formed in November, maintained hurricane status for five days in December 2005, longer than any other storm in December; the previous record was two and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>days,</b> set by Hurricane Lili in 1984. Additionally, Hurricane Alice in 1954–1955 and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005–2006 were the only recorded cyclones to have spanned two calendar years.|$|E
