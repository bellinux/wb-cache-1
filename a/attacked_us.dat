5|$|Despite American counterattacks, the North Koreans {{were able}} to {{continue}} pressing forward and take Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area. By August 10 the entire NK 4th Division was across the river and beginning to move south, outflanking the American lines. The next day, scattered elements of the North Korean forces attacked Yongsan. The North Korean forces repeatedly <b>attacked</b> <b>US</b> lines at night, when American soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting.|$|E

North Korean forces {{were able to}} divide the American force and kill most of its commanders, further disorganizing the men. Following the failed operation, the wounded US commander ordered a withdrawal, which quickly became disorganized, resulting in hundreds of casualties. Destroyed after its first engagement, the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment was disbanded and merged with other units as the North Korean forces advanced through the pass and <b>attacked</b> <b>US</b> positions to the east.|$|E
5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, the Sudanese government allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who <b>attacked</b> <b>U.S.</b> troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E

The 22nd Sentai re-equipped with production Hayates. Though it lacked sufficient high-altitude performance, it performed well at medium and low levels. Seeing action against the USAAF 14th Air Force, it quickly gained a reputation as a fighter to be reckoned with. Fighter-bomber models also entered service. On April 15, 1945, 11 Hayates <b>attacked</b> <b>US</b> airfields on Okinawa, destroying many aircraft on the ground.|$|E

25|$|In {{the weeks}} prior to Night of Champions, Big Show {{constantly}} <b>attacked</b> <b>U.S.</b> Champion Kofi Kingston and Evan Bourne among others. He then feuded with Kingston over the U.S. Title and earned himself {{a spot in the}} six-pack challenge at Night of Champions. At the event, Big Show was introduced as Chris Jericho's new tag team partner due to Edge needing time off to tend to an injury, thus taking Show out of the six-pack challenge for the U.S. Title. Together, Jeri-Show were able to successfully defend the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship against The Legacy. Jeri-Show successfully defended the title against Cryme Tyme at SummerSlam, MVP and Mark Henry at Breaking Point and Rey Mysterio and Batista at Hell in a Cell. At Bragging Rights, Big Show represented Team Raw, but he betrayed and attacked his teammates, which led to Team SmackDown winning, so that he could receive an opportunity at the World Heavyweight Championship. Big Show received his title shot at Survivor Series in a triple threat match against The Undertaker and Jericho, but the Undertaker successfully retained his title.|$|E

In a 2009 interview, Cross praised the planning for the invasion and the removal of Saddam Hussein, but said that he [...] "was very keen that we thought through carefully the postwar aspects of what we were going to do once the military campaign was over.

[...] Edwards alleged that Crawford had known of the impending failure of Illinois' Bank of Edwardsville in 1821, but had not withdrawn federal money from it. Edwards found that none of Crawford's rivals was willing to support his charges, and {{he was unable to}} produce corroborating evidence. He resigned his Senate seat on March 4, 1824, to take a job he wanted as the first United States Minister to Mexico. While en route to his new position, Edwards was called back to Washington to testify before a special House committee concerning the [...] "A.B. Plot". Unable to substantiate his claims, Edwards resigned his diplomatic post, to be replaced by Joel Roberts Poinsett.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the events}} of the {{previous}} night the Australians still held the road, while D Company continued to occupy the former Chinese strongpoint on Hill 63, even if it was isolated {{from the rest of the}} battalion. Yet B and C Companies were now precariously positioned in the paddy field to the east and west of the road respectively, and come daylight were exposed to the Chinese positions on the high ground. The same day Coad visited 3 RAR; dissatisfied with the battalion's dispositions and having now lost confidence in its commander, he relieved Walsh of his position, appointing the second-in-command, Major Bruce Ferguson, in his place. Walsh returned to his posting at US Eighth Army headquarters. Ferguson came forward to take command of the battalion. Ordering 3 RAR to dig-in, he despatched a number of clearing patrols, while C Company advanced unopposed to a hill overlooking the road [...] north-east of D Company. Reaching the top the Australians observed the Chinese withdrawing northwards up the valley. Further east, the Chinese <b>attacked</b> <b>US</b> 19 RCT; however, by the afternoon of 6 November it became apparent that the Chinese withdrawal around Pakchon was part of a general disengagement.|$|E
500|$|A few mounted militiamen on {{the road}} would dismount, fire muskets at the {{approaching}} regulars, then remount and gallop ahead to repeat the tactic. [...] Unmounted militia would often fire from long range, {{in the hope of}} hitting somebody in the main column of soldiers {{on the road}} and surviving, since both British and colonials used muskets with an effective combat range of about [...] [...] Infantry units would apply pressure to the sides of the British column. [...] When it moved out of range, those units would move around and forward to re-engage the column further down the road. [...] Heath sent messengers out to intercept arriving militia units, directing them to appropriate places along the road to engage the regulars. [...] Some towns sent supply wagons to assist in feeding and rearming the militia. [...] Heath and Warren did lead skirmishers in small actions into battle themselves, but it was the presence of effective leadership that probably had the greatest impact on the success of these tactics. [...] Percy wrote of the colonial tactics, [...] "The rebels <b>attacked</b> <b>us</b> in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance and resolution, nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body.

500|$|In their {{accounts}} afterward, British officers and soldiers alike noted their frustration that the colonial militiamen fired {{at them from}} behind trees and stone walls, rather than confronting them in large, linear formations {{in the style of}} European warfare. [...] This image of the individual colonial farmer, musket in hand and fighting under his own command, has also been fostered in American myth: [...] "Chasing the red-coats down the lane / Then crossing the fields to emerge again / Under the trees {{at the turn of the}} road, / And only pausing to fire and load." [...] To the contrary, beginning at the North Bridge and throughout the British retreat, the colonial militias repeatedly operated as coordinated companies, even when dispersed to take advantage of cover. [...] Reflecting on the British experience that day, Earl Percy understood the significance of the American tactics: During the whole affair the Rebels <b>attacked</b> <b>us</b> in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance & resolution, nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body. Indeed, they knew too well what was proper, to do so. Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about, having been employed as Rangers against the Indians & Canadians, & this country being much covered with wood, and hilly, is very advantageous for their method of fighting.|$|E
