5|$|Growth in the Northeast was {{accompanied}} by the creation of moral reform organizations, such as Sunday schools, temperance associations, tract and Bible societies, and orphanages. The proliferation of voluntary organizations was encouraged by postmillennialism, {{the belief that the}} Second Coming of Christ would occur <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> era of peace and prosperity fostered by human effort. The 1815 General Assembly recommended the creation of societies to promote morality. Organizations such as the American Bible Society, the American Sunday School Union, and the American Colonization Society, while theoretically interdenominational, were dominated by Presbyterians and considered unofficial agencies of the Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|In Budapest Tales (1976), Szabó traded his earlier, complex {{narrative}} structures, {{characterized by}} flashbacks and dreams, {{for a more}} linear one. At the same time, he traded the literal representation of history for an allegorical one. The film follows a disparate {{group of people who}} come together on the outskirts of an unnamed city <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unnamed war to repair a damaged tram and ride it into the city. Allegorically, the film was interpreted by critics variously as representing Hungarian history specifically or universal human responses to war and reconstruction more generally.|$|E
5|$|In DNA, fraying {{occurs when}} non-complementary regions exist <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{otherwise}} complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed {{regions of the}} pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA {{can be used in}} nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E

5|$|The Tobruk {{garrison}} received {{supplies from}} the Royal Navy and Rommel {{was unable to}} take the port. This failure was significant; his front line positions at Sollum were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. The substantial commitment required to invest Tobruk prevented him from building up his forces at Sollum, making further advances into Egypt impractical.

Besieging Tobruk also required a substantial commitment of troops and prevented Rommel from making further advances into Egypt.

5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize {{for the death of}} Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer had no pupils and {{no direct}} 'school'. Yet as his works spanned , clear traces of his {{influence}} {{can be found in}} the grand operas of Fromental Halévy, Gaetano Donizetti, Giuseppe Verdi and others. After 1850, Huebner notes a continuing tradition of operas at Paris where 'principals appear with chorus <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> act and where private intrigue conjoins a well-articulated public dimension in the plot' and cites amongst others Charles Gounod's La nonne sanglante (1854), Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet and operas by Jules Massenet, amongst them Le roi de Lahore (1877) and Le Cid (1885). The line of succession was however virtually washed away in the tide of Wagner in Paris after 1890 (see below). The influence of Meyerbeer has also been detected in the operas of Antonín Dvořák and other Czech composers, and in the operas of Russian composers including Rimsky-Korsakov and the young Tchaikovsky, who thought Les Huguenots 'one of the greatest works in the repertoire'.|$|E
5|$|There are six main plot {{lines that}} the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Each scenario is divided into eight episodes, one interlude episode and an epilogue. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> episode, an announcement of the next episode appears showing a preview of what is to consist in the next episode. Each episode takes place within the span of one month between June and March from episode one through the epilogue. The interlude episode is placed between the second and third episodes.|$|E

5|$|Wear of the {{insignia}} is {{according to}} guidelines {{issued by the}} Chancellery of Honours, which stipulate that the badges be worn before most other national orders—that is, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individual's medal bar closest to {{the centre of the}} chest or at the wearer's neck—with only the Victoria Cross, the Cross of Valour, and the badge of the Order of Merit permitted to be worn before the badges of the Order of Canada. Those in the grades of Companion or Officer may wear their badges on a neck ribbon, while those in the Member group display their insignia suspended by a ribbon from a medal bar on the left chest. Protocol originally followed the British tradition, wherein female appointees wore their Order of Canada emblem on a ribbon bow positioned on the left shoulder. These regulations were altered in 1997, and women may wear their insignia in either the traditional manner or in the same fashion as the men.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} going to feature online elements, offered through Square's PlayOnline service. The features, however, were dropped during production, and online gaming would not {{become part of}} the Final Fantasy series until Final Fantasy XI. Map director Nakazato wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional Final Fantasy game, in line with the realism of the game's 3D backgrounds, as opposed to pre-rendered backgrounds. As a player of the games in the Final Fantasy series, battle director Tsuchida wanted to recreate elements he found interesting or entertaining, which eventually led to the removal of the Active Time Battle system, and instead, incorporated the strategy-focused Conditional Turn-Based Battle system. Originally, Final Fantasy X was going to feature wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters. Battle art director Shintaro Takai has explained that it was his intention that battles in Final Fantasy X come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element. However, due to hardware limitations, this idea was not used. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field map to the battle map were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect that would happen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> event scene. The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game. Kitase has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters' attributes, such {{that they will be able}} to observe the development of those attributes firsthand. The developers experienced difficulty with the scene of Tidus and Yuna kissing, as they were not used to animating romance scenes. Visual Works director Kazuyuki Ikumori stated that this was due to the use of 3D models in the scene. Because of the negative response from female members of staff, the scene was remade multiple times.|$|E
