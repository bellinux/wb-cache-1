Critics generally praised the game's graphics and smooth frame rate, but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence.

5|$|To {{mark the}} game's fifteenth anniversary, a port for the Game Boy Advance, titled Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis, was {{released}} on November 14, 2006. While the port is mostly identical to the original, it includes several new features not seen in the original Genesis release, {{such as the ability}} to save game progress, a level select option, <b>and</b> <b>inclusion</b> of the Spin Dash move. This version of the game, unlike others, received poor reviews, with a Metacritic score of 33/100. The chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the Game Boy Advance, resulting in a bad performance and poor implementation of the original music and gameplay.|$|E
30|$|Fractional {{differential}} equations <b>and</b> <b>inclusions</b> are generalizations of ordinary {{differential equations}} <b>and</b> <b>inclusions</b> to arbitrary non-integer orders. Fractional differential equations <b>and</b> <b>inclusions</b> appear naturally {{in a number}} of fields such as physics, engineering, biophysics, chemistry, biology, economics, control theory, etc. Recently, many papers have been published about fractional differential equations <b>and</b> <b>inclusions</b> by researchers which apply the fixed point theory in their existence theorems. For instance, one can find a lot of papers in this field (see [1 – 24] and the references therein).|$|R

The Arts by the Sea Festival is a mix of dance, film, theatre, literature, and music which was launched in 2012 by the local university, the Arts University Bournemouth, and is set to become an annual event. The Bourne Free carnival is held in the town each year during the summer. Initially a gay pride festival, it has become a celebration of diversity <b>and</b> <b>inclusion.</b> Since 2008, Bournemouth has held its own air festival over four days in August. This has featured displays from the Red Arrows as well as appearances from the Yakovlevs, Blades, Team Guinot Wing-Walkers, Battle of Britain Memorial Flight including Lancaster, Hurricane, Spitfire and also the last flying Vulcan. The festival has also seen appearances from modern aircraft such as the Eurofighter Typhoon. The air festival attracts up to a million people over the four-day event.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Howard Thurman {{became the}} Dean of the Boston University School of Theology and, {{after ten years}} in California, the couple moved to Boston. The move was {{prompted}} {{by the desire to}} share their ideas of outreach <b>and</b> <b>inclusion</b> in a university setting, though they were aware that the arrival of the first black pastor in a white university would lead to difficulties. From the beginning, Thurman tried to create an inclusive environment, organizing monthly dinners for the Marsh Chapel Choir members and their friends. Shortly after they arrived, a Japanese student committed suicide leaving a note that she had no friends. Not only was she not known well at the university, finding her family to notify them was difficult. In response, Thurman organized the International Student Hostess Committee to keep international students from feeling isolated. By 1965, the committee was serving 500 international students at Boston University. The Thurmans were at times criticized by those who felt they should be visibly active in the Civil Rights Movement, but they believed their commitment was to addressing the spiritual needs of those who were visible, rather than participating in marches, protests and demonstrations. Among the papers of MLK were many letters from people such as Homer A. Jack, who co-founded the Congress of Racial Equality; Lillian Smith, author of the novel Strange Fruit; Glenn E. Smiley, national field secretary of Fellowship of Reconciliation, as well as King's own acknowledgement, which credited their spiritual guidance.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{includes}} a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} seven different game types: Beach, Raptor, Heist, War, Tank, Race and Deathmatch. In Beach, some players must go up through a beach and into a waiting escape vehicle, while others must stop them by firing at them from fixed positions. Raptor involves players controlling raptors to feed a baby dinosaur, while others play as cavemen that have to steal dinosaur eggs. Heist engrosses players in the robbery of a bank, where the goal is to retrieve a cash bag {{from the center of the}} level and run with it to the team's vault without being damaged. War can either be a traditional capture the flag mode or Total War, where players have to get the other teams gas canister and use it to release a chemical gas that annihilates the enemy. Similarly, in Tank players fight against each other by using tanks and grabbing chemical canisters that can release a lethal corrosive gas, destroying all the tanks that are outdoors. Race is a racing mode which provides two variations of the same course. Items can be acquired and used against opponents. Finally, there is a standard deathmatch mode where players fight against each other in shooting style from a third-person perspective. Players can set a number of different options for each game, such as score limit, number of lives, <b>and</b> <b>inclusion</b> of optional bots.|$|E
30|$|The {{literature}} on initial and boundary value problems of differential equations <b>and</b> <b>inclusions</b> containing a single fractional order operator is now much enriched {{and one can}} find useful results {{in a series of}} articles [8 – 19] and the references cited therein. However, the topic of boundary value problems of differential equations <b>and</b> <b>inclusions</b> containing more than two fractional order operators needs to be investigated. For some works on differential equations <b>and</b> <b>inclusions</b> involving two fractional order operators (sequential fractional differential equations) can be found in [20 – 23].|$|R
