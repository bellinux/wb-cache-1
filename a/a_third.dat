5000|$|A common triad chord can be {{regarded}} as consisting of a [...] "stack" [...] of two thirds. There are four permutations: <b>A</b> major <b>third</b> stacked on <b>a</b> major <b>third</b> creates <b>an</b> augmented triad. <b>A</b> minor <b>third</b> on top of <b>a</b> major <b>third</b> manifests <b>a</b> major triad. <b>A</b> major <b>third</b> on top of <b>a</b> minor <b>third</b> produces <b>a</b> minor triad. Finally, <b>a</b> minor <b>third</b> stacked on <b>a</b> minor <b>third</b> constitutes <b>a</b> diminished triad.|$|R
50|$|A minor chord {{can also}} be {{described}} as <b>a</b> minor <b>third</b> with <b>a</b> major <b>third</b> on top, {{in contrast to a}} major chord, which has <b>a</b> major <b>third</b> with <b>a</b> minor <b>third</b> on top. They both contain fifths, because <b>a</b> major <b>third</b> (four semitones) plus <b>a</b> minor <b>third</b> (three semitones) equals a perfect fifth (seven semitones).|$|R
