40|$|Most of the {{biological}} interest in pyridine derivatives centres around nicotinamide which is the building block for the coenzymes, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Except for some polarographic studies, not many references {{are available on the}} electrochemical behaviour of nicotinamide. In the present investigation, the reduction of nicotinamide has been studied in non aqueous medium using glassy carbon electrode, in the solvent dimethyl formamide (DMF). Investigations have been carried out in the potential range + 400 mV to - 2400 mV at different scan rates using tetra alkyl <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorates</b> as the supporting electrolyte. Two cathodic peaks are observed around - 1. 6 V and - 1. 9 V, Depending upon the alkyl group used in the supporting electrolyte, the peak potentials are slightly varied.

50|$|NaClO4 finds {{only minimal}} use in {{pyrotechnics}} {{because it is}} hygroscopic; <b>ammonium</b> and potassium <b>perchlorates</b> are preferred. These salts are prepared by double decomposition from a solution of sodium perchlorate and potassium or ammonium chlorides.|$|R
5000|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{most often}} used {{in the preparation of}} sugar motors is potassium nitrate (KNO3). Other oxidizers can be used as well, like sodium and calcium nitrates as well as mixtures of sodium and potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate (KClO3).

5000|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>Perchlorate</b> is classed as an {{explosive}} by the UK Health and Safety Executive, so <b>Ammonium</b> <b>Perchlorate</b> Composite Propellant (AP) motors formerly required the purchaser {{to have an}} Explosives Licence and Recipient Competent Authority Transfer Document (RCA).

50|$|The rocket was 21 ft {{tall and}} 10 in in diameter, and used an <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> based solid propellant.|$|E
5000|$|The rocket {{propellant}} mixture in each solid rocket motor consisted of <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> (oxidizer, 69.6% by weight), atomized aluminium powder (fuel, 16%), iron oxide (catalyst, 0.4%), PBAN (binder, also acts as fuel, 12.04%), and an epoxy curing agent (1.96%). This propellant is {{commonly referred to}} as <b>Ammonium</b> <b>Perchlorate</b> Composite Propellant, or simply APCP. This mixture gave the solid rocket motors a specific impulse of [...] at sea level or [...] in a vacuum.|$|E
50|$|Like most {{ammonium}} salts, <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> decomposes before melting. Mild heating {{results in}} production of hydrogen chloride, nitrogen, oxygen, and water.|$|E
50|$|Nitronium perchloratoborate (NO2B(ClO4)4)can {{be formed}} by {{reacting}} nitronium perchlorate with boron trichloride in solution. Similarly <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> reacts with BCl3 forming ammonium perchloratoborate.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, {{the factory}} started {{producing}} plastic rocket propellant with <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> and poly-isobutylene rubber {{as two of}} its main ingredients.|$|E
50|$|A typical, well-designed <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> {{composite}} propellant (APCP) first-stage motor {{may have}} a vacuum specific impulse (Isp) as high as 285.6 seconds (Titan IVB SRMU).|$|E
50|$|Common oxidizers include gaseous or liquid oxygen, nitrous oxide, and {{hydrogen}} peroxide. For a reverse hybrid, oxidizers such as frozen oxygen and <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> are used.|$|E
50|$|The {{chlorine}} in the perchlorate anion is {{a closed}} shell atom and is well {{protected by the}} four oxygens. Hence, perchlorate reacts sluggishly. Most perchlorate compounds, especially salts of electropositive metals such as sodium perchlorate or potassium perchlorate do not oxidize organic compounds {{until the mixture is}} heated. This property is useful in many applications, such as flares, where ignition is required to initiate a reaction. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> is however different, being unstable even at room temperature. The PEPCON disaster destroyed a production plant for <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ammonium tetraperchloratoaluminate can {{be formed}} by three moles of nitronium perchlorate, one mole of {{anhydrous}} aluminium chloride, and one mole of <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> combined in liquid sulfur dioxide.|$|E
5000|$|PEPCON disaster: On 4 May 1988 about 8500000 lb of <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> {{burned in}} a fire and set off explosions near Henderson, Nevada. A 16 in natural gas {{pipeline}} ruptured under the stored <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> and added fuel to the later, larger explosions. There were seven detonations in total, the largest being the last. Two {{people were killed and}} hundreds injured. The largest explosion was estimated to be equivalent to one kiloton of TNT. The accident was caught on video by a broadcast engineer servicing a transmitter on a nearby mountaintop.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{materials}} with positive oxygen balance are e.g. ammonium nitrate (+20%), <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> (+34%), potassium chlorate (+39.2%), sodium chlorate (+45%), potassium nitrate (+47.5%), tetranitromethane (+49%), lithium perchlorate (+60%), or nitroglycerine (+3.5%).|$|E

50|$|Composite {{modified}} double base propellants {{start with}} a nitrocellulose/nitroglycerin double base propellant as a binder and add solids (typically <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> (AP) and powdered aluminium) normally used in composite propellants. The <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> makes up the oxygen deficit introduced by using nitrocellulose, improving the overall specific impulse. The aluminium improves specific impulse as well as combustion stability. High performing propellants such as NEPE-75 used to fuel the Trident II D-5, SLBM replace most of the AP with polyethylene glycol-bound HMX, further increasing specific impulse. The mixing of composite and double base propellant ingredients has become so common as to blur the functional definition of double base propellants.|$|E
50|$|Similar propellants, often {{referred}} to as APCP (<b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> composite propellant) are used in larger model rockets. A typical APCP produces 2-3 times the specific impulse of the black powder propellant used in most smaller rocket motors.|$|E
50|$|Perchlorate salts are {{the product}} of a base and perchloric acid.

5000|$|Recycling {{aluminium}} uses about 5% of {{the energy}} required to create aluminium from bauxite; {{the amount of energy}} required to convert aluminium oxide into aluminium can be vividly seen when the process is reversed during the combustion of thermite or <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> composite propellant.|$|E
5000|$|The PEPCON plant, {{located in}} Henderson, Nevada, 10 mi from Las Vegas, {{was one of}} only two American {{producers}} of <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> [...] "AP," [...] an oxidizer used in solid propellant rocket boosters, including the Space Shuttle, military weapons (SLBMs launched from nuclear submarines) and non-weapons (Atlas, Patriot, etc.) programs. The other producer, Kerr-McGee, was located less than 1.5 mi away from the PEPCON facility, within the area that suffered some blast damage. In addition to <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate,</b> the plant produced other perchlorate chemicals including sodium perchlorate.

50|$|Composite: Composites {{contain no}} nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, nitroquanidine {{or any other}} organic nitrate. Composites usually consist of a fuel such as {{metallic}} aluminum, a combustible binder such as synthetic rubber or HTPB, and an oxidizer such as <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate.</b> Composite propellants are used in large rocket motors.|$|E
50|$|The torpedo {{is driven}} by a pump-jet coupled to a Hamilton Sundstrand 21TP04 gas turbine engine using Otto fuel II and {{hydroxyl}} <b>ammonium</b> <b>perchlorate</b> as oxidiser.
