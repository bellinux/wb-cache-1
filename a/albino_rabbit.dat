40|$|PURPOSE. To {{elucidate}} the intraocular pressure (IOP) –lowering effects and associated characteristics of Y- 39983, a selective Rho-associated coiled coil-forming protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor derived from Y- 27632, in animal eyes. METHODS. Y- 39983 was compared with Y- 27632 for selectivity of ROCK inhibition by biochemical assay. The IOP was monitored by pneumatonometer in <b>albino</b> <b>rabbits</b> and cynomolgus monkeys that were given topically administered Y- 39983. The total outflow facility and uveoscleral outflow were measured by two-level constant-pressure perfusion and perfusion technique using fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, respectively, at 2 hours after topical administration of Y- 39983 in <b>albino</b> <b>rabbits.</b> The ocular toxicologic effects of topical administration of Y- 39983 {{were observed in}} <b>albino</b> <b>rabbits</b> and cynomolgus monkeys. RESULTS. A biochemical assay showed that Y- 39983 inhibited ROCK more potently than Y- 27632. In rabbits, topical administration of Y- 39983 significantly increased conventional outflow by 65. 5 %, followed by significant, dose-dependent reduction in IOP. Maximum IOP reduction was 13. 2 � 0. 6 mm Hg (mean � SE) at 0. 1 % Y- 39983 in rabbits. In monkeys, at 3 hours after topical administration of 0. 05 % Y- 39983, maximum reduction of IOP was 2. 5 � 0. 8 mm Hg. No serious side effects were observed in ocular tissues except sporadic punctate subconjunctival hemorrhage during longterm topical administration of Y- 39983 {{four times a day}} (at 2 -hour intervals) in rabbits or monkeys. However, punctate subconjunctival hemorrhage was not observed with administration twice daily (at a 6 -hour interval) or three times a day (at 5 -hour intervals). CONCLUSIONS. Y- 39983 causes increased outflow facility followed by IOP reduction. Y- 39983 ophthalmic solution may be a candidate drug for lowering of IOP, since it increases conventional outflow and produces relatively few side effects.
