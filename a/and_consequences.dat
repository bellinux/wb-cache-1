5|$|The Nemesis of Faith is an epistolary {{philosophical}} {{novel by}} James Anthony Froude published in 1849. Partly autobiographical, the novel depicts the causes <b>and</b> <b>consequences</b> {{of a young}} priest's crisis of faith. Like many of his contemporaries, Froude came to question his Christian faith in light of early nineteenth century developments in history, theology, and science. Froude was particularly influenced by the Catholic teachings of the Oxford Movement and by the new approach to religious scholarship developed by the German Higher Critics.|$|E

As a result, the relative (modal) tableau expansion rule is static, as both its precondition <b>and</b> <b>consequence</b> refer to the same world.|$|R
