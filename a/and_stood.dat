5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} companies do send scientists {{all over the}} world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use. The appearance of The Smoking Man in a stand-alone episode is unusual, as Chris Carter did not like mixing the mythology and stand-alone episodes. Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode so close to the release of the similarly-themed movie Outbreak. In the end, however, they realized that the two entities were separate <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> on their own.|$|E
5|$|Foreign comics, {{especially}} Japanese, {{became quite}} successful in Canada, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> out for gaining {{large numbers of}} female fans, who had traditionally stayed away from comic books. They also had a significant influence on artists such as Bryan Lee O'Malley and his Scott Pilgrim series. Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian customs officials. Incidental nudity could be interpreted by them as child pornography and result in jail terms.|$|E

30|$|As long as {{sample size}} was > 1 and not {{excessive}} (generally < 30), the number of samples selected from the copula, and averaged to produce the DBH and HT growth estimates, had very little influence on model behavior <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> trajectories (not shown). A single sample produced extremely variable individual tree <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> trajectories. As sample size increased, the variability in individual tree <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> trajectories decreased. For all analyses shown in this paper, we used a sample size of 10 as a compromise between large variations in tree <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> development <b>and</b> smoothing out the variability completely. Sample size had much greater effect on ideotypes at the lowest densities and greatest Dq; however, trends were similar across {{the entire range of}} density and Dq.|$|R

30|$|In studies about {{modeling}} LAI from stand parameters, Kashian et al. (2005) {{reported a}} significant but weak relationship between LAI or BAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> density (r 2 [*]<[*] 0.20) at stand ages characterized by canopy closure. DeRose et al. (2010) developed some nonlinear regression equations, which indicated that LAI {{was significantly related}} to relative density, site quality, <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> top height, <b>and</b> concluded that LAI increased nonlinearly with increasing relative density holding stand top height constant. Sidabras and Augustaitis (2015) found indirect relationships between LAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> mean diameter <b>and</b> height in a multi-aged mixture of coniferous forest, while they found no significant relationships between LAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> sum square basal area. In the same study, the authors found a significant relationship between LAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> density <b>and</b> volume of the pure pine forest stands. Dantec et al. (2000) found that there were significant relationships between LAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> basal area <b>and</b> number of trees of stands. Özbayram et al. (2015) reported positive correlations between LAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> age, mean diameter, top height, green tree height, basal area, and litter in Turkish red pine stands, but negative correlation between LAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> age <b>and</b> mean diameter in black pine stands. The ANN models have been used for predicting LAI from remotely sensed data, for example, Bacour et al. (2006), Shoemaker and Cropper (2008), Verger et al. (2008), Omer et al. (2016), and Wang et al. (2017). Beyond these studies about the LAI predictions from the remote sensing data by the ANN models, the present study has underlined that the ANN models may be used alternatively to traditional regression techniques for predicting LAI predictions from terrestrial measurements such as some stand parameters.|$|R

On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire. The fire fighters tried to fold out a life net in the Papenbroekssteeg (which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat) but the alley was too narrow for it.|$|E
