5|$|Properties {{common to}} {{terrestrial}} organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, {{a capacity to}} grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made analogs of life may also {{be considered to be}} life.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the portraits on the Makkotai coins <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not have {{identical}} head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they {{all have the same}} written legend. Such an observation has been made of coins assigned to the Western Kshatrapas of Gujarat, which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera coins. Scholars who analyzed the varying portraiture on the Kshatrapa coins have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the coins could be of different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their coins or the coins all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his different ages. Based on such theories, the Chera coins could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.|$|E

40|$|The main {{causes of}} children's bed-wetting {{in their sleep}} before dawn may be {{considered}} to be such as the following. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> often drink water after going to bed to quench their thirst. Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> so fast asleep <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not wake up, although subconscious of a desire to pass urine. Still another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may wake up, feeling the accumulation of urine in the bladder, but are unwilling to go out of bed to urinate, owing to sleepiness, chilliness and fear. The fourth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> fall into a still deeper sleep again, after once getting aware of the accumulation of urine in the bladder. The last <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> get confused with some illusion, for instance, that of finding themselves in a rest-room or on a scene od a fire...|$|R
40|$|This paper gives game-theoretic {{versions}} of several results on "merging of opinions" obtained in measure-theoretic probability and algorithmic randomness theory. An {{advantage of the}} game-theoretic versions over the measure-theoretic results <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> pointwise, their advantage over the algorithmic randomness results <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> non-asymptotic, {{but the most important}} advantage over both <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> very constructive, giving explicit and efficient strategies for players in a game of prediction.

5|$|P. rebeli live in {{different}} habitats; therefore, {{they do not}} parasitize the same Myrmica ant species. Through observation and experimentation, researchers found that if P. rebeli try to parasitize a different Myrmica ant species than the one they normally do, the Myrmica ants will identify the P. rebeli larvae as intruders and will kill 100% of the P. rebeli larvae. The differences between the P. rebeli <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> synthesize different hydrocarbons, which allow them to mimic different species of Myrmica ants. This explains why they have no success in being mistaken for another species of Myrmica ant and the ensuing 100% mortality rate when the other Myrmica ant species is not fooled.|$|E
5|$|This {{process can}} be modeled by Rule 184, as follows. The {{particles}} are modeled as points that are aligned, not with {{the cells of the}} automaton, but rather with the interstices between cells. Two consecutive cells that both have state 0 model a particle at the space between these two cells that moves rightwards one cell at each time step. Symmetrically, two consecutive cells that both have state 1 model an antiparticle that moves leftwards one cell at each time step. The remaining possibilities for two consecutive cells <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> both have differing states; this is interpreted as modeling a background material without any particles in it, through which the particles move. With this interpretation, the particles and antiparticles interact by ballistic annihilation: when a rightwards-moving particle and a leftwards-moving antiparticle meet, the result is a region of background from which both particles have vanished, without any effect on any other nearby particles.|$|E
5|$|Unaided AAC {{systems are}} {{those that do not}} require an {{external}} tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages and systems. Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities. More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language, and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia, aphasia and dysarthria. The benefits of gestures and pantomime <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.|$|E
30|$|The {{advantage}} of involving subspecialised radiologists <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{more familiar with}} radiological subspecialities and can teach with more confidence. However, the risk <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may go too much into details <b>that</b> <b>are</b> beyond the learning objectives for undergraduate students.|$|R
50|$|The name {{derives from}} two local legends. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> mark {{the graves of}} three traitors who were buried alive. Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> three men from Skye who deserted their wives and were turned to stone by a witch.|$|R

25|$|Dead weights are the {{simplest}} type of anchor. They are generally {{made as a}} large concrete block with a rode attached which resists movement with sheer weight; and, to a small degree, by settling into the substrate. In New Zealand old railway wheels are sometimes used. The advantages <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are simple and cheap. A dead weight mooring that drags in a storm still holds well in its new position. Such moorings are better suited to rocky bottoms where other mooring systems do not hold well. The disadvantages <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are heavy, bulky, and awkward.|$|E
25|$|The crucial {{properties}} of {{this set of}} rules <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are sound and complete. Informally {{this means that the}} rules are correct and that no other rules are required. These claims can be made more formal as follows.|$|E
25|$|At present {{there are}} few local options for the {{treatment}} of persistent pain, whilst managing the exudate levels present in many chronic wounds. Important properties of such local options <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> provide an optimal wound healing environment, while providing a constant local low dose release of ibuprofen during weartime.|$|E
5|$|Using fossil evidence, {{there are}} three main {{theories}} for the origin of modern amphibians. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> evolved from dissorophoid temnospondyls. Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> evolved from lepospondyls, most likely the lysorophians. A third hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> caecilians descended from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolved from dissorophoids.|$|R

25|$|Collectively, a {{key feature}} of RICS {{building}} surveys <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{provide an opportunity}} for clients and surveyors to strike up a detailed dialogue about the property they are intending to purchase. Purchasers find a building survey useful in allowing for further negotiations on price or for providing a clients briefing document for extensions or repairs. The building survey is a very interactive process.|$|E
25|$|Household use {{survey methods}} {{typically}} include food accounts, inventories, and list recalls {{which are used}} to account for all food used in the household during a survey period. Limitations of household use surveys <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not include food consumed outside of the household, food waste is often not accounted for and consumption by different subpopulations within the household cannot be distinguished.|$|E
25|$|The main {{benefits}} of L-estimators <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are often extremely simple, and often robust statistics: assuming sorted data, {{they are very}} easy to calculate and interpret, and are often resistant to outliers. They thus are useful in robust statistics, as descriptive statistics, in statistics education, and when computation is difficult. However, they are inefficient, and in modern times robust statistics M-estimators are preferred, though these are much more difficult computationally. In many circumstances L-estimators are reasonably efficient, and thus adequate for initial estimation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{absence of}} hard {{evidence}} {{of what happened to}} the Princes has led to a number of theories being put forward. The most common theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> murdered close to the time <b>that</b> <b>they</b> disappeared, and among historians and authors who accept the murder theory, the most common explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> murdered by Richard.|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of surasundaris in religious shrines is interpreted in several ways. A spiritual interpretation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> represent shakti (the feminine cosmic energy), {{and can be}} considered as both auspicious and empowering. A secular interpretation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> represent the prosperity of the king who commissioned the temple.|$|R
25|$|According to the Syrian {{opposition}} website Syrian Martyrs, {{the figure}} was 151,888 up to 30 April 2016, which was {{the time of its}} last update. The number includes 35,859 rebel combatants but does not include members of the government security forces or pro-government foreign combatants who have died. Early in the conflict, the Syrian Martyrs number of civilian deaths was significantly higher than the ones presented by other organisations, including the UN; among the reasons <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> recorded deaths even when no name is given for the reportedly killed individual and that they collated reports of deaths from more sources.|$|E
25|$|Light {{emitting}} diode (LED) lamps {{are used}} for both general and special-purpose lighting. Compared to fluorescent bulbs, their advantages <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> contain no mercury, they turn on instantly at any temperature, their extremely long lifetime is unaffected by cycling on and off, they have no glass to break, and they don't emit UV rays that fade colored materials. LED lamps radiate almost no heat, and can be either multi-directional or unidirectional, {{eliminating the need for}} a mirrored reflector in the bulb or fixture. LED lamps can emit saturated colored light. Disadvantages include spectrum limitations due to discrete emission colors, and higher up-front cost than incandescent bulbs.|$|E
25|$|Most {{workbenches}} {{are made}} from solid wood; the most expensive and desirable are made of solid hardwood. Benches may also be made from plywood and Masonite or hardboard, and bases of treated pine and even steel. There are trade offs with the choice of construction material. Solid wood has many advantages including strength, workability, appearance. A plywood or hardboard bench top {{has the advantage of}} being stable, relatively inexpensive, and in some ways it's easier to work with - particularly for a woodworker who doesn't yet have hand tools. The practical drawbacks of a plywood or composite bench top <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> don't hold their corners and edges well, and they can't be resurfaced with a plane - something that is needed from time to time.|$|E
50|$|A further rule {{regarding}} clearing points <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> cannot <b>be</b> modified once a train has <b>been</b> accepted, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must <b>be</b> locked {{for passenger}} train movements.|$|R
50|$|One {{feature of}} ABCP <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> provide {{the ability to}} fund bank assets that do not appear on bank balance sheets. One result of keeping these assets {{off-balance}} sheet <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not factor in for regulatory capital requirements. Thus the ABCP market may contribute to systemic risk.|$|R
30|$|The main {{advantage}} {{of the use of}} Web page zones <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can aid inspectors in evaluating only the elements <b>that</b> <b>are</b> present in the evaluated mockup. Another expected benefit of the use of Web page zones <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can provide inspectors with a guideline to identify the elements within the application.|$|R
25|$|Varricchio et al.(1997) {{were able}} to extract enough {{evidence}} from the nests to infer several characteristics of troodont reproductive biology. The results <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> appear {{to have had a}} type of reproduction that is intermediate between crocodiles and birds, as phylogeny would predict. The eggs are statistically grouped in pairs, which suggests that the animal had two functional oviducts, like crocodiles, rather than one, as in birds. Crocodiles lay many eggs that are small proportional to adult body size. Birds lay fewer, larger, eggs. The Two Medicine troodont was intermediate, laying an egg of about 0.5kg for a 50kg adult. This is 10 times larger than reptiles of the same mass, but two troodont eggs are roughly equivalent to the 1.1kg egg predicted for a 50kg bird.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogels are a {{class of}} {{biomaterials}} that are chemically or physically cross-linked water-soluble polymers. They can be either degradable or non-degradable as determined by their chemistry, but degradable is more desirable whenever possible. There has been great interest in hydrogels for tissue engineering purposes, because they generally possess high biocompatibility, mechanical properties similar to soft tissue, {{and the ability to}} be injected as a liquid that gels. When hydrogels are physically cross-linked they must rely on phase separation for gelation; the phase separation is temperature-dependent and reversible. Some other advantages of hydrogels <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> use only non-toxic aqueous solvents, allow infusion of nutrients and exit of waste products, and allow cells to assemble spontaneously. Hydrogels have low interfacial tension, meaning cells can easily migrate across the tissue-implant boundary. However, with hydrogels it is difficult to form a broad range of mechanical properties or structures with controlled pore size.|$|E
25|$|The {{officers}} {{have been subject to}} criticism, both in the media and in formal proceedings before the Braidwood Commission of Inquiry. The officers were served notices of misconduct by the commission forewarning them the commissioner may include a finding of misconduct in its final report. The warnings allege specific but overlapping grounds for each of the four. The collective allegations <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> failed to properly assess and respond to the circumstances in which they found Mr. Dziekański. They repeatedly deployed the taser without justification and separately failed to adequately reassess the situation before further deploying it. The notices allege that afterwards they misrepresented facts in notes and statements, furthered the misrepresenting before the commission and provided further misleading information about other evidence before the commission. The four officers each sought judicial review to prevent the commission from making findings based on the notices. The petitions were dismissed. Three of the officers appealed and lost. In July 2013 one of the three officers was cleared of perjury. The remaining two officers stood trial in 2014.|$|E
