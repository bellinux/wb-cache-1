2500|$|Hope {{started by}} saying [...] "Why, Groucho Marx! (applause) Groucho, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> {{here in the}} desert?" [...] Groucho retorted, [...] "Huh, desert, I've {{been sitting in the}} {{dressing}} room for forty minutes! Some desert alright..." [...] Groucho continued to ignore the script, and although Hope was a formidable ad-libber in his own right, he could not begin to keep up with Groucho, who lengthened the scene well beyond its allotted time slot with a veritable onslaught of improvised wisecracks.|$|E

I've never, {{never in my}} life seen anything so queer." [...] She suddenly raised her strange eyes on me. [...] "What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{children}} <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> here?” demanded Mrs. Quabarl {{the next}} morning, on finding Irene sitting rather glumly {{at the head}} of the stairs, while her sister was perched in an attitude of depressed discomfort on the window-seat behind her, with a wolf-skin rug almost covering her.|$|R

I'm mighty glad to meet up with you. I know you very well by reputation, and Weissmann is an old acquaintance of our family's. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> here?

60|$|Very {{soon the}} Rabbit noticed Alice, {{as she went}} hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what <b>ARE</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the {{direction}} it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.|$|E
6000|$|Soon {{the rabbit}} noticed Alice, {{as she stood}} looking curiously about her, and at once said in a quick angry tone, [...] "why, Mary Ann! what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> here? Go home this moment, and look on my dressing-table for my gloves and nosegay, and fetch them here, as quick as you can run, do you hear?" [...] and Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once, without saying a word, in the {{direction}} which the rabbit had pointed out.|$|E

6000|$|Her {{father was}} walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. [...] "Lizzy," [...] said he, [...] "what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing?</b> Are <b>you</b> <b>out</b> of your senses, to be {{accepting}} this man? Have not you always hated him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{good to see}} you again! And here's my old dog Mose! But how {{on earth}} <b>did</b> <b>you</b> know? Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> strike my trail?

6000|$|... "They say {{you have}} become a {{publisher}} with an American partner, a sort of Harmsworth and Nelson and Times Book Club and Hooper and Jackson all rolled into one. That seems so extraordinary to me that for that alone I should have had to write to you. I {{want to know the}} truth of that. I never see any advertisement of Stratton & Co. or get any inkling of what it is you publish. Are you the power behind the respectable Murgatroyd and the honest Milvain? I know them both and neither has the slightest appearance of being animated by you. And equally perplexing is your being mixed up with an American like that man Gidding in Peace Conferences and Social Reform Congresses and so forth. It's so--Carnegieish. There I'm surer because I've seen your name in reports of meetings and I've read your last two papers in the Fortnightly. I can't imagine you of all people, with your touch of reserve, launching into movements and rubbing shoulders with faddists. What does it mean, Stephen? I had expected to find you coming back into English politics--speaking and writing on the lines of your old beginning, taking up that work you dropped--it's six years now ago. I've been accumulating disappointment for two years. Mr. Arthur, you see, on our side,"--this you will remember was in 1909--"still steers our devious party courses, and the Tariff Reformers have still to capture us. Weston Massinghay was comparing them the other night, at a dinner at the Clynes', to a crowded piratical galley trying to get alongside a good seaman in rough weather. He was very funny about Leo Maxse in the poop, white and shrieking with passion and the motion, and all the capitalists armed to the teeth and hiding snug in the hold until the grappling-irons were fixed.... Why haven't you come into the game? I'd hoped it if only for the sake of meeting you again. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> beyond there? ...|$|E

5000|$|Ormond was {{involved}} in a notable piece of sledging; when, in a Test match against Australia in 2001, Mark Waugh asked him, [...] "Mate, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> here? There's no way you're good enough to play for England." [...] Ormond replied [...] "Maybe not, but at least I'm the best player in my own family", a reference to Waugh's brother Steve, who was the captain of the Australian team.|$|E

So he dug and dug until he had a wonderful underground home. All about were plenty of seeds and tender grasses to eat, and he was happy. He had found {{his place in the}} Great World. Then one day along came Old Mother Nature. 'Hello, Mr. Chipmunk,' she exclaimed, as she caught sight of his striped coat, 'what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> way <b>out</b> here?' ...|$|R

"I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> there, {{although}} <b>you</b> have {{never said a}} word to me about it," [...] she continued, with an odd little note of passion in her tone.

"And of all unmitigated immoral gouges, your {{destruction}} of the closed-shop principle <b>was</b> the limit. <b>You</b> know how it <b>was</b> <b>done.</b> <b>You</b> bought <b>out</b> Farburg, the last president of the old American Federation of Labour. He was your creature--or the creature of all the trusts and employers' associations, {{which is the same}} thing. You precipitated the big closed-shop strike. Farburg betrayed that strike. You won, and the old American Federation of Labour crumbled to pieces. You follows destroyed it, and by so doing undid yourselves; for right on top of it began the organization of the I.L.W.--the biggest and solidest organization of labour the United States has ever seen, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> responsible for its existence and for the present general strike. You smashed all the old federations and drove labour into the I.L.W., and the I.L.W. called the general strike--still fighting for the closed shop. And then you have the effrontery to stand here face to face and tell me that you never got labour down and gouged it. Bah!" ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{investigation}} or {{arrest was}} prompted {{more by the}} atmosphere of terror than by charges of wrongdoing, which were often baseless. Walter Laqueur later wrote of the period, [...] "There was no rhyme or reason as to who was arrested and who was not, the security organs were given a plan to fulfill, {{a certain number of}} people were to be arrested in a certain region, and from this stage on it was more or less a matter of accident at whose door the NKVD (the secret police) emissaries would knock {{in the early hours of}} the morning." [...] The procedure was for the NKVD to knock, the accused was told to pack a small suitcase with a few things, get dressed and wait outside the door to be picked up and taken away. Then the NKVD returned to collect the accused and seal the door. One night, the NKVD knocked on the Langs' door and Franz Lang was told to get ready. Dutifully waiting outside his door to be picked up, the security police returned. [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> standing around <b>out</b> here?", asked the NKVD. Lang replied that he'd been ordered to do so. [...] "What's your room number?", asked the security officer. [...] "Number 13." [...] "We're only taking away the even numbers tonight!" [...] Astonished, Lang went back to bed. Nor did the NKVD ever knock on his door again.|$|R

When you from here have marked the [...] return of the spies, give me a signal with your hat--do not use a [...] handkerchief, as others might see its white, and take warning.
