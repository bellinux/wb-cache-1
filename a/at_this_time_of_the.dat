5|$|To {{the sailors}} {{who visited the}} Mascarene islands from 1598 onwards, the fauna was mainly {{interesting}} from a culinary standpoint. Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet has survived. The others likely all vanished due {{to a combination of}} extensive hunting and deforestation. Due to being easily caught, the Mascarene grey parakeet was often hunted in abundance by early visitors to Mauritius and Réunion. As they fattened themselves from June to September, they were particularly sought after <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. An account by Admiral Steven van der Hagen from 1606 even suggests that the grey parrots of Mauritius were sometimes killed for amusement.|$|E

On September 22, 1847, Kane assumed command of a canoe brigade up the Columbia River and arrived on October 10 at Boat Encampment. The party had to wait for three weeks until a badly delayed horse trek from Jasper arrived. Then they switched, the horse team taking over the canoes and going down the Columbia River, and Kane's group loading their cargo on the horses and taking them back over Athabasca Pass. They managed to bring all 56 horses safely and without loss to Jasper's House, despite the heavy snow and intense cold. As the canoes that should have been awaiting them had already left, they were forced to set out on snowshoes and with a dog sled to Fort Assiniboine, where they arrived after much hardship and without food two weeks later. After a few days' rest, they continued to Fort Edmonton, where they spent the winter.|$|E

Evidence from the eighth century Anglo-Saxon historian, Bede points to the Picts also being subjugated by the Northumbrians during Oswald's reign, and that this subjugation continued into the reign of his successor, Oswiu.|$|E
500|$|Another popular festival held in Chamba is the [...] "Minjar Mela", held on {{the second}} Sunday of the Shravana month, {{corresponding}} to the month of August in the Gregorian calendar. It marks {{the triumph of the}} Raja of Chamba over the ruler of Trigarta (now called as Kangra), in 935 AD and also celebrates the paddy and maize crops grown <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. The festival commences with offerings of 'minjar', consisting of a bunch of paddy plant and golden silk wrapped in red fabric. The offerings also include a rupee, a seasonal fruit, and a coconut. This occasion is also celebrated with a flag hoisting ceremony at the Chaugan that initiates a week of cultural and social programmes. The image of the deity, Lord Raghuvira, and more than 200 other deities, are taken in a procession, in a chariot pulled by ropes. Folk dances and music performances known as 'Kunjari Malhar' are part of the festivities. On {{the last day of the}} festival, a parade is held from the Akhand Chandi Palace to Ravi River, where offerings are made to the river. This commemorates an event in which Raja Sahil Verman changed the course of the river, to make the Hari Rai temple accessible to all devotees.|$|E

2500|$|Winters {{are cool}} and overcast, with a January mean of , though lows {{sometimes}} fall below freezing. Since 2000 Glasgow has experienced few very cold, snowy and harsh winters where temperatures have fallen much below freezing. [...] The most extreme instances have however seen temperatures around [...] in the area. Snowfall accumulation is infrequent and short-lived. The spring months (March to May) are usually mild and often quite pleasant.

2500|$|Cardinal Augustin Bea, {{the head}} of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity, added {{at the end of the}} visit, [...] "Let us move forward in Christ. God wants it. Humanity is waiting for it." [...] Unmoved by a harsh {{condemnation}} by the Congregation of Faith on mixed marriages precisely <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visit, Paul VI and Ramsey appointed a preparatory commission which was to put the common agenda into practice on such issues as mixed marriages. This resulted in a joint Malta declaration, the first joint agreement on the Creed since the Reformation. Paul VI was a good friend of the Anglican Church, which he described as [...] "our beloved sister Church". This description was unique to Paul and not used by later popes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{retreat of}} Guthrum {{and his band}} to East Anglia in late 879 and the similar retreat of the Viking army {{stationed}} at Fulham, west of London, back to the Continent {{at the same time}} (both events recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle), {{can be seen as a}} tactical response to the effectiveness of the strategic offensive posed by the construction of the Burghal system. [...] The ratification of a mutually agreed boundary to the east of London, in Alfred and Guthrum’s Treaty, between Guthrum’s new Viking kingdom of East Anglia and Alfred’s newly won territory, can best be ascribed to this time. [...] These developments gave Alfred control of London and its surrounding territory, which included a good length of the strategically important Watling Street as it approached London. [...] This interpretation is supported by the issue <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special celebratory London Monogram coinage from the London mint, now under the control of Alfred, and by the issue at the same time of coins from Oxford and Gloucester in southern Mercia.|$|E
2500|$|Psalm 27, {{which is}} recited in most {{communities}} twice daily {{starting at the}} beginning of Elul, continues to be recited on Shemini Atzeret outside of the Land of Israel. When Shemini Atzeret falls on the Shabbat, the Scroll of Ecclesiastes, or Kohelet ( [...] , otherwise read in Ashkenazi synagogues on the Shabbat of Sukkot), is read on that day outside of the Land of Israel. In the Land of Israel, it would have been read {{on the first day of}} Sukkot, which would also have been on Shabbat. The Torah reading (Deuteronomy 14:22–16:17) is the same as on the Final Day of Passover and Second Day of Shavuot. However, unlike Passover and Shavuot, the full length of the Torah reading is included on Shemini Atzeret even when the day does not fall on the Shabbat because the reading refers to separation of agricultural gifts (like tithes and terumah), which are due <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. The Haftarah describes the people's blessing of King Solomon at the end of the dedication of the First Temple.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Snow {{wrote in}} 1991 {{that he had}} read the novels from Master and Commander to Desolation Island from American {{publishers}} twenty years earlier. He enjoyed the happy ending of Master and Commander and was grateful for more, including [...] "a complex and fascinating successor [...] appeared -- The Mauritius Command." [...] O'Brian's [...] "portrayal of life aboard a sailing ship is vivid and authoritative" [...] and O'Brian presented [...] "the lost arcana of that hard-pressed, cruel, courageous world with an immediacy that makes its workings both comprehensible and fascinating." [...] He noted too that [...] "behind the humor, behind the storms and the broadside duels [...] [...] [...] loomed something larger: the shape and texture of a whole era." [...] As strong as the historical detail was, Snow remarked that [...] "in the end it is the serious exploration of human character that gives the books their greatest power", and he also referred to the poetry of the writing, saying that O'Brian [...] "manages to express, with the grace and economy of poetry, familiar things that somehow never get written down, as when he carefully details the rueful steps by which Stephen Maturin falls out of love." [...] <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> re-issues of the novels by W W Norton in the US, Snow recommended that a reader start with the first and keep reading to the last one, then [...] "You will have read what I continue to believe are the best historical novels ever written." ...|$|E
