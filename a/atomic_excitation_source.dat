40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} a single two-level atom, which interacts with pulses propagating in two spatial-modes (right and left) and frequency-continuum. Using Heisenberg equations of motion, we present the explicit analytical derivations and general formalisms for <b>atomic</b> <b>excitation</b> with two spatial-mode multi-photon pulses in both Fock state and coherent state. Based on those formalisms, we show that perfect <b>atomic</b> <b>excitation</b> by single photon Fock state pulse can only be realized when it is rising-exponentially shaped in the even-mode [...] -a balanced superposition of the two spatial-modes. Single photon from single spatial-mode can only give half of the maximal <b>atomic</b> <b>excitation</b> probability. We also show that the maximum <b>atomic</b> <b>excitation</b> probability with multi-photon pulses in the even-mode is a monotonic function of the average photon number for coherent state, but not for Fock states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the atomic dynamics can be controlled by the relative phase between the two counter-propagating coherent state pulses incident on the atom, {{which is not the}} case with two Fock state pulses.

40|$|Recently, the photon {{absorption}} attracts lots {{of interest and}} {{plays an important role}} in a variety of applications. Here, we propose a valuable scheme to investigate the perfect {{photon absorption}} in a hybrid atom-optomechanical system both under and beyond the low-excitation limit. The perfect photon absorption persists both in the linear <b>atomic</b> <b>excitation</b> regime and nonlinear <b>atomic</b> <b>excitation</b> regime, below the threshold of the optical bistability/multistability, respectively. We also show that the optical nonlinearity raised by the nonlinear optomechanical interaction and nonlinear <b>atomic</b> <b>excitation</b> can be overlap-added, there presents a perfect corresponding relation between perfect photon absorption and the optical multistability beyond the low-excitation limit, the optical bistability can be switched to the optical multistability by increasing the input intensity. The combination of the perfect photon absorption and optical bistability/mutistability is useful for the photon switch application. We believe that this study will provide a possible design of an optical switch. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

For a coherent squeezed state as the phase-sensing field, the phase sensitivity can approach the Heisenberg limit under the optimal conditions. We also study the effects of the loss of light field and the dephasing of <b>atomic</b> <b>excitation</b> on the phase sensitivity. Since nonlinear processes are involved in this interferometer, they can couple a variety of different waves and form new types of hybrid interferometers, which provides a new method for basic measurement using the hybrid interferometers.

30|$|Similarly, {{there are}} also three field sources which diffuse and {{attenuate}} {{in the form of}} waves towards the space. The skin effect in the distribution of the coil current density is more obvious at the frequency of 10  MHz, so the <b>excitation</b> <b>source</b> is concentrated around the two edges of the coil, so that each excitation coil contains two excitation points. There is a big difference in the magnetic induction intensity between ωt[*]=[*] 0 and ωt[*]=[*]π/ 2 at the frequency of 10  MHz.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the circular dichroism (CD) for absorption of the twisted photons, or optical vortices, by atoms, caused by <b>atomic</b> <b>excitation</b> into discrete energy levels. The effects of photon {{spin on the}} rates and cross sections of atomic photo-excitation are considered. It is demonstrated that although for electric dipole transitions the <b>atomic</b> <b>excitation</b> rates depend on the relative orientation of photon spin and orbital angular momentum (OAM), the resulting CD is zero. However, CD is nonzero for atomic transitions of higher multipolarity, peaking in the optical vortex center, resulting in preferred absorption of the photons with their spins aligned with OAM. The effects remain large in a paraxial limit, where analytic expressions are provided. The predicted spin asymmetries are equivalent to OAM dichroism for the fixed photon spin.

40|$|Flexible {{structures}} are frequently subjected to multiple inputs {{when in the}} field environment. The accurate determination of the system dynamic response to multiple inputs {{depends on how much}} information is available from the <b>excitation</b> <b>sources</b> that act on the system under study. Detailed information include, but are not restricted to appropriate characterization of the <b>excitation</b> <b>sources</b> in terms of their variation in time and in space for the case of distributed loads. Another important aspect related to the <b>excitation</b> <b>sources</b> is how inputs of different nature contribute to the measured dynamic response. A particular and important driving mechanism that can occur in practical situations is the parametric resonance. Another important input that occurs frequently in practice is related to acoustic pressure distributions that is a distributed type of loading. In this paper, detailed theoretical and experimental investigations on the dynamic response of a flexible cantilever beam carrying a tip mass to simultaneously applied external acoustic and parametric excitation signals have been performed. A mathematical model for transverse nonlinear vibration is obtained by employing Lagrange’s equations where important nonlinear effects such as the beam’s curvature and quadratic viscous damping are accounted for in the equation of motion. The beam is driven by two <b>excitation</b> <b>sources,</b> a sinusoidal motion applied to the beam’s fixed end and parallel to its longitudinal axis and a distributed sinusoidal acoustic load applied orthogonally to the beam’s longitudinal axis. The major goal here is to investigate theoretically as well as experimentally the dynamic behavior of the beam-lumped mass system under the action of these two <b>excitation</b> <b>sources.</b> Results from an extensive experimental work show how these two <b>excitation</b> <b>sources</b> interacts for various testing conditions.

40|$|We study {{interactions}} between polaritons, arising when photons strongly couple to collective excitations in {{an array of}} two-level atoms trapped in an optical lattice inside a cavity.

We show that, in spite of the underlying repulsion in the subsystem of <b>atomic</b> <b>excitations,</b> saturability induces a broadband bunching of photons for two-polariton scattering states. We interpret this bunching as a result of interference, and trace it back to the mismatch of the quantization volumes for <b>atomic</b> <b>excitations</b> and photons. We examine also bound bipolaritonic states: These include states created by dipolar forces, as well as a gap bipolariton, which forms solely due to saturability effects in the atomic transition.

The first part of my research is to apply MR-EOM-CC approaches to the <b>atomic</b> <b>excitation</b> spectra of the neutral and the + 1 and + 2 Cr, Mn, Fe and Co atoms using ACESII program. Scalar relativistic effects are considered but spin-orbit coupling is not included. The computational results are compared to J-averaged experimental values and the errors are typically below 0. 1 eV. The second part of this project is to combine MR-EOM approach with a simple treatment of spin-orbit coupling and the resulting MR-EOM-CC-SOC approach can be used to the <b>atomic</b> <b>excitation</b> spectra and the splitings in each L-S multiplet of the Cr, Mn, Fe and Co neutral atoms using the ORCA program. The errors of the spin-orbit calculations in the ORCA program are somewhat larger compared to the J-averaged calculations run in ACESII program and this is still under investigation. From both parts of this research, one can easily find that upon introducing additional cluster operators T, S, X, D and U in different variations of MR-EOM, the dimension of the final diagonalization space is greatly reduced, the overall cost of the calculation is significantly reduced, and finally, the accuracy of the calculations is, perhaps surprisingly, improved...|$|R
