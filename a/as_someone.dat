5|$|Gandhi's {{experiment}} with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food. He consulted the Jain scholar Rajchandra, whom he fondly called Raychandbhai. Rajchandra advised him that milk stimulated sexual passion. Gandhi began abstaining from cow's milk in 1912, {{and did so}} even when doctors advised him to consume milk. According to Sankar Ghose, Tagore described Gandhi <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> who did not abhor sex or women, but considered sexual life as inconsistent with his moral goals.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have often}} {{referred}} to Conroy <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> with strong ambition, {{with varying degrees of}} positive or negative opinion. Rumours circulated during and after his lifetime that he was perhaps the Duchess of Kent's lover. Queen Victoria was shocked to hear this, stating that her mother's piety would have prevented it.|$|E

5|$|A new comedy duo called Supergirly {{were also}} {{introduced}} from January 2000 {{to fill the}} gap left by 'Ben, Gez and Rich' who had quit the show the previous series. Supergirly, which consisted of Louise McClatchy and Jai Simeone, (known as Lou and Jai) would feature in sketches throughout the morning as BBC make-up artists who were rude to the guests, either through a misunderstanding, by being tactless or by mistaking the guests <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> else. The sketches would usually culminate with the guests storming off.|$|E
5|$|Despite the one-sided {{national}} loss in 1984, Ferraro {{was still}} viewed <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> {{with a bright}} political future. Many expected her {{to run in the}} 1986 United States Senate election in New York against first-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato, and during 1985 she did Upstate New York groundwork towards that end. A Senate candidacy had been her original plan for her career, before she was named to Mondale's ticket. But in , she said she would not run, due to an ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe on her and her husband's finances stemming from the 1984 campaign revelations.|$|E
5|$|During {{her first}} {{appearances}} as {{a figment of}} Newt's imagination, Rae was depicted as a goth with an emo persona. When she was reintroduced as a real person, Rae's character was more reminiscent {{to that of a}} chav. The character later underwent a transitional period; she retained her strong personality, but displayed a weaker side resulting from the setbacks she encountered. Barlow found the role challenging, as her own personality is dissimilar from her character's. She described Rae <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> who always makes her opinion known, and hoped she would be remembered for her strong-willed persona.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} three months of 1944, Cicero {{supplied}} the Germans with copies of documents taken from his employer's dispatch box or his safe. Photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion, this led to a high-speed chase around Ankara <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> had taken an interest in the hand-over. Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped. Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information, the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did not know that the source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Izzard as {{the voice}} of Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse. Over 100 actors auditioned to voice the character. Izzard {{approached}} Reepicheep as less camp and more of a bloodthirsty assassin with a sense of honour (a cross between Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars): Izzard interpreted Reepicheep <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> whose family was killed by the Telmarines. The Narnia series were some of the few books Izzard read as a child, and he cherished them. When discussing Reepicheep to the animators, Adamson told them to rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible. Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own; beforehand, the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek 2.|$|E
5|$|From 1947 through 1956, each BBWAA voter used {{discretion}} {{as to who}} {{qualified as}} a rookie. In 1957, the term was first defined <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> with fewer than 75 at bats or 45 innings pitched in any previous Major League season. This guideline was later amended to 90 at bats, 45 innings pitched, or 45 days on a Major League roster before September 1 of the previous year. The current standard of 130 at bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster of a Major League club (excluding time in military service or on the disabled list) before September 1 was adopted in 1971.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} found {{photography}} {{is not well}} documented because it most likely started <b>as</b> <b>someone's</b> hobby before being introduced to the art world, but even its first ventures into fine art are uncertain because the art community has not received found photography well, much like its predecessor found art.|$|R

5|$|In 1914, {{the court}} {{moved into the}} new Oregon Supreme Court Building, and McNary filed to run for a full six-year term on the bench. At that time the office was partisan, and McNary lost the Republican primary, by a single vote, to Henry L. Benson, after several recounts and the {{discovery}} of uncounted ballots. After his defeat, he served {{the remainder of his}} partial term and left the court in 1915. On July 8, 1916, after a close, multiballot contest, with several contenders, the Republican State Committee elected McNary to be the chair. He was seen <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> who could unify the progressive and conservative wings of the party in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker can be defined <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer {{each year in the}} USA.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Adams {{later became}} a {{controversial}} figure in American history. Accounts written in the 19th century praised him <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> who had been steering his fellow colonists towards independence long before {{the outbreak of the}} Revolutionary War. This view gave way to negative assessments of Adams {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, in which he was portrayed as a master of propaganda who provoked mob violence to achieve his goals. Both of these interpretations have been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that these traditional depictions of Adams are myths contradicted by the historical record.|$|E

5000|$|Generally, in Nigeria, {{development}} planning refers to [...] "adult males," [...] "households," [...] or [...] "families". Women {{were included in}} such units but not as a separate category. Up until the 1980s, the term [...] "farmer" [...] {{was assumed to be}} exclusively male, even though in some areas of the south women did most of the farm work. In Nigerian terms, a woman was almost always defined <b>as</b> <b>someone's</b> daughter, wife, mother, or widow.|$|R
5|$|Ti Noel is well {{established}} early on as not only a witness to events, but also <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> who makes observations and offers reflection. It is he who considers slavery under Henri Christophe worse than that under French rule because blacks are now enslaving fellow blacks. It is also he who offers reflections about the difficulty of this world allowing {{for the possibility of}} greatness during the concluding remarks of the novel. His perspective represents that of the folk, including his belief in the African gods.|$|E

5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{investigate}} the crash. Scully suggests a man {{stopped the car}} but Doggett points out {{that it would have}} required a dense block of steel to stop the car. Nora Pearce appears and asks what happened to Curtis Delario. Soon afterwards, Scully finds Delario’s body left in a garbage can nearby; his face has gaping holes in it. Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man’s face were made by human fingers, <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> reached into Delario’s head and pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint with the blood of Ray. Agent Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard. Doggett asks about Ray, but Nora insists she saw Ray die; both do not believe Ray could be involved in Curtis’s death.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} {{detailed}} analysis, {{looking at a}} player's ability as a power hitter often involves using statistics such <b>as</b> <b>someone's</b> 'slugging percentage' (a function that's calculated by evaluating someone's number of moments at bat {{in relation to the}} nature of their hits and strikes). 'Isolated Power' (ISO), a measure showing the number of extra bases earned per time at bat that's calculated by subtracting someone's batting average from his slugging percentage, is another statistic used.|$|R

5|$|Aleph {{was created}} to embody the Shin Megami Tensei II world, which is {{reflected}} in his character design: he has a portable computer and a visor that he controls demons with, and carries swords, guns and armor for use in battle. His computer was designed to look compact, and the visor {{was designed to be}} wireless, to show that the game takes place in the future. Kaneko decided to not give Aleph a personality, partially because he is controlled by the player, and partially because he is portrayed as an artificial being, created by the Center's scientists. Beth and Daleth were designed to look similar to the first Shin Megami Tensei Heroine and Hero, using the colors blue and green, respectively. Lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman, as Kaneko saw him <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> who tempts and tries the player, rather than being evil. He designed Lucifer in accordance with portrayals of him as a beautiful twelve-winged angel, but gave him six wings instead, for a total of twelve across his appearances in Shin Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei II.|$|E

His plan to revitalize Buffalo by demolishing its abundant vacant buildings has drawn opposition from historic preservationists, but he has made the development of the Buffalo waterfront a priority.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{relaunch}} of Star Trek in 2009 {{with a new}} cast playing those roles seen in The Original Series, {{there was}} commentary online {{about the lack of}} female characters and whether Rand might be appearing in future installments. While the sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, was in production, Rand was one of five characters who was stated not to be appearing in the film by writer Roberto Orci. But there was still speculation {{at the time of the}} broadcast of the first trailer about who Alice Eve was portraying in the film. The options given by Tor.com was that it was either Janice Rand or Carol Marcus. Daily Variety reported that she was cast <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> new to the franchise, but she was actually cast as Marcus.|$|E
