5|$|Before {{the start}} of the colonial period, the region of South Kasai formed part of the Luba Empire, a {{federation}} of local kingdoms with <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> cultural uniformity. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Baluba spread across large parts of the Kasai-Katanga savannah along the Kasai river basin and eventually developed into a number of ethnic subgroups, notably the Luba-Kasai and the Luba-Katanga. Although never united into a single centralised state, the groups retained <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> emotional attachment based around shared origin myths and cultural practices.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we develop a {{knowledge-based}} {{view on the}} choice of knowledge transfer mechanisms in franchising that integrates results from the information richness theory. Starting from the information richness theory we argue that tacitness of system knowledge, operationalized by codifiability, teachability and complexity, determines the information richness of the knowledge transfer mech-anisms of franchising firms. We examine the following hypotheses: (1) If the franchisor’s knowledge is characterized by <b>a</b> high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> codifiability and teachability and <b>a</b> low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> complexity, knowledge transfer mechanisms with <b>a</b> lower <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> information richness are used; (2) If the franchisor’s knowledge is characterized by <b>a</b> high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> complexity and <b>a</b> low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> codifiability and teachability, knowledge transfer mechanisms with <b>a</b> higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> information richness are used. We test these hypotheses by using data from 52 franchising firms in the Austrian franchise sector. The data provide support for the hypotheses...|$|R

5|$|After humans {{migrated}} out {{of their}} ancestral environment of eastern Africa, they were exposed to new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> independent evolution, leading to genetic and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages.|$|E

This unit was used for inter-state movement of goods, but was not applied in all states for internal use.|$|E
