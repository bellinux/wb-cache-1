40|$|Complex capital {{programs}} require specialized management techniques, {{in order}} to address the volatility, cost overruns, significant delays in completion, and failures with which such programs are typically associated. The need is greater than ever for careful oversight, especially for programs that expend public monies. Audit is commonly a statutory or governance requirement on such programs, but traditional performance audit techniques and standards may be insufficient for certain types of programs and industries, providing a mere illusion of oversight adequacy instead of the assurance that is needed. In order to most appropriately define the performance <b>audit</b> <b>scope,</b> phrase the solicitation for services, select the audit team, and provide support to the auditors during the engagement, public and private sector entity auditees need to understand the factors that impact performance audit results and effectiveness. The question becomes one of how performance audit can be improved, and stakeholders satisfied regarding program achievements, accountability for resource use, transparency in operations, and risk management. The author considered program complexity, governance, project controls, the history and evolution of the audit function, stakeholder expectations, assurance, and obstacles to audit, and used this information in conjunction with data from a large sample of 775 audit reports from complex construction programs, to derive questions and conclusions about performance audit results and effectiveness, and comparisons to expenditure audit results. The ultimate goal was to define key components in the execution of performance audits, based on theconclusions of the analysis, {{in order to}} improve performance audit findings and thus their applicability and usefulness. While this study focused on program performance audit, it was also related to the field of program management. Although the data population was concentrated in the area of construction programs, conclusions from this research may also be applied to other complex, multifaceted or phased activities such as projects and programs in other industries (manufacturing, information technology), and also pursuits such as major event planning, company launch, mergers, and large program implementations or rollouts. The research results clearly demonstrated that different types of findings were generated by different audit scopes. The author observed that typical audit findings focused on routine procedural, accounting, and controls errors. On average, contract expenditure audits questioned only 2. 65 % of expenditures, and performance audits of large complex programs questioned only 0. 03 % of expenditures. The majority (72. 56 %) of the performance audits in the sample yielded no findings or questioned costs. There were significant positive correlations between: the number of expenditures tested and the number of qualitative findings, inclusion of construction experts on the audit team and the percentage of expenditures questioned, inclusion of construction experts on the audit team and the number of qualitative findings, broader <b>audit</b> <b>scope</b> and the percentage of expenditures questioned, and broader <b>audit</b> <b>scope</b> and the number of qualitative findings. Of these, auditor expertise and <b>audit</b> <b>scope</b> were the driving factors. There were significant negative correlations between the application of agreed-upon procedures and the percentage of expenditures questioned, and the application of agreed upon-procedures and the number of qualitative findings. It was determined that the significant negative correlation between the application of audit standards and the number of qualitative findings was due to other factors, such as the application of agreed-upon procedures and the lack of construction experts on the audit team. Other findings, resulting from review of the data, were unrelated to the research questions yet of considerable importance to industry. An extremely high percentage (81 %) of the “performance audits” instead applied a very limited set of agreed-upon-procedures (AUP) in the engagement, According to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), AUP engagements could not be classified as audits. Thus, it was inappropriate for the accounting firms to apply AUP engagements in lieu of a performance audit, and it was especially egregious for them to state in their report that the engagements were conducted in accordance with audit standards, as AUP engagements and the specific audit standards were by their very nature mutually exclusive. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Implementation of {{groundwater}} flow and transport numerical models is generally a challenge, time-consuming and financially-demanding task, in charge to specialized modelers and consulting firms. At a later stage, within clearly stated limits of applicability, these models are often {{expected to be}} made available to less knowledgeable personnel to support/design and running of predictive simulations within more familiar environments than specialized simulation systems. GIS systems coupled with spatial databases appear to be ideal candidates to address problem above, due to their much wider diffusion and expertise availability. Current paper discusses the issue from a tight-coupling architecture perspective, aimed at integration of spatial databases, GIS and numerical simulation engines, addressing both observed and computed data management, retrieval and spatio-temporal analysis issues. Observed data can be migrated to the central database repository and then used to set up transient simulation conditions in the background, at run time, while limiting additional complexity and integrity failure risks as data duplication during data transfer through proprietary file formats. Similarly, simulation scenarios can be set up in a familiar GIS system and stored to spatial database for later reference. As numerical engine is tightly coupled with the GIS, simulations can be run within the environment and results themselves saved to the database. Further tasks, as spatio-temporal analysis (i. e. for postcalibration <b>auditing</b> <b>scopes),</b> cartography production and geovisualization, can then be addressed using traditional GIS tools. Benefits of such an approach include more effective data management practices, integration and availability of modeling facilities in a familiar environment, streamlining spatial analysis processes and geovisualization requirements for the non-modelers community. Major drawbacks include limited 3 D and time-dependent support in traditional GIS, and lack of dedicated calibration, analysis and visualization tools.

To do so, they assess whether a company’s business processes and information systems process financial data correctly. The audit process is a complex endeavor that in practice has to rely on simplifying assumptions. These simplifying assumptions mainly result from the need to restrict the <b>audit</b> <b>scope</b> and to focus it on the major risks. This article describes a generalized audit process. According to our experience with this process, {{there is a risk}} that material deficiencies remain undiscovered when said simplifying assumptions are not satisfied. To address this risk of deficiencies, the article compiles thirteen control patterns, which – according to our experience – are particularly suited to help information systems satisfy the simplifying assumptions. As such, use of these proven control patterns makes information systems easier to audit and IT architects can use them to build systems that meet audit requirements by design. Additionally, the practices and advice offered in this interdisciplinary article help bridge the gap between the architects and auditors of information systems and show either role how to benefit from an understanding of the other role’s terminology, techniques, and general work approach...|$|E

Audit summary:  In Victoria, {{there is a}} minimum of 58 000 prisoner movements per year {{for a variety of}} reasons. Prisoners are moved between prisons to accommodate changes in their risk profile, maximise prison capacity, attend health and welfare programs, and facilitate court appearances. They move between police cells to maximise capacity and attend court and are also moved to hospitals and forensic health facilities for planned and emergency medical care. Recent changes to the external criminal justice environment have affected prisoner numbers and, consequently, the need for prisoner movements. Changes include modifications to the parole process and the abolition of some suspended sentences, which took effect in the County and Supreme Courts in September 2013. Combined with additional factors, such as increases in average sentence lengths and imprisonment rates, these changes have contributed to significant growth in prisoner movements.

It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, diminishing the possibilities of pilfering and governance processes Internal audit began in unsophisticated manner during the Second World War, especially In 1939,when the Nazi Party were the first government to recognize the importance of having a well-controlled mechanism for running an evil, world-conquering regime. The IIA were contracted to undertake a series of efficiency reviews in the early weeks of World War II. At this time many organizations found it difficult to maintain operational efficiency and control. So, Companies appointed special staff (i. e. present day internal auditors) to review operations and report to them. The task starting as an internal business function primarily focused on protection against payroll fraud, loss of cash, and other assets, internal <b>audit’s</b> <b>scope</b> was quickly extended to the verification of almost all financial transactions, and still later, gradually moved from an “audit for management” emphasis to an “audit of management” approach which is assigned to internal auditors. Internal audit activities are performed in diverse legal and cultural environments; within organizations that vary in purpose, size, complexity, and structure; and by persons within or outside the organization. While differences may affect the practice of internal auditing in each environment, compliance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing is essential if the responsibilities of internal auditors are to be met.

A local company {{instituted a}} new {{chemical}} procedure in their spray phosphating system {{used in the}} pretreatment of large components for industrial racking systems. An inorganic conversion coating is deposited on the workpiece surface during phosphating and this prepares the surface to receive an organic top-coat. The organic coating {{is applied to the}} workpiece surface {{in the form of a}} powder and cured to form a continuous film about 80 u. m thick. The solution chemistry of the phosphating system was monitored by sampling and chemical analysis and taking direct reading instrumental measurements on the process and rinse solutions. The process was also evaluated using the results of a waste minimisation audit. This involved gathering data on composition, flow rates and costs of inputs and outputs of the process. Two types of information were collected and used during the audit, namely chemical monitoring (concentration levels of Na, Fe, Zn, Mo, Mn and Cr and measurements of conductivity, TDS, SS and pH) and water usage data on the Phosphating Line and existing data (raw materials, workpieces and utility inputs as well as domestic waste, factory waste and scrap metal outputs). The data were analysed using four established waste minimisation techniques. The <b>Scoping</b> <b>Audit</b> and the Water Economy Assessment results were determined using empirically derived models. The Mass Balance and the True Cost of Waste findings were obtained through more detailed calculations using the results of the chemical analysis. The results of the audit showed that the most important area for waste minimsation in the Phosphating Line was the (dragged-out phosphating chemicals present in) wastewater stream. According to the <b>scoping</b> <b>audit,</b> water usage had the third highest waste minimisation potential behind powder and steel consumption for the entire powder coating process. While the <b>scoping</b> <b>audit</b> and the specific water intake value showed that water consumption for the process was not excessive, it did not indicate that the pollution level in the rinse waters was high. Further, drag-out calculations showed that drag-out volumes were typical of those found in the metal finishing industry. However the presence of high levels of metal species in the rinse waters was highlighted through the chemical monitoring of the Phosphating Line. The True Cost of Waste Analysis estimated potential financial savings for the effluent stream at about R 8000 for a period of 105 days. However this does not take into consideration the cost of the liability associated with this stream when exceeding effluent discharge limits (given in the Trade Effluent Bylaws) or of the chemical treatment necessary to render this stream suitable for discharge to sewer. Intervention using only "low-cost-no-cost" waste minimisation measures was recommended as a first step before contemplating further areas for technical or economic feasibility studies. However, a further study involving monitoring the sludge was recommended in order to establish the potential financial savings offered by this waste stream...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{consensus}} among scholars that proper records management {{plays a significant role}} in the auditing process. Despite this role, in South Africa, many governmental bodies are issued with disclaimer opinions every year by the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) due to a lack of supporting documentation. Whenever AGSA embarks on an audit assignment, the first constraint it faces is that records either do not exist or, if they do exist, are disorganised, and retrieval becomes problematic, resulting in a disclaimer of opinion. Furthermore, many public organisations rarely see the connection between the lack of proper records management and failures of financial accountability. This article reports on part of doctoral research project by Ngoepe in 2012 that sought to develop a framework to embed the records management function into the auditing process. However, this article seeks to investigate the role of records management in the auditing process in the public sector of South Africa, with a view to entrenching a culture of clean audits. The study relied on both quantitative and qualitative approaches, with thequantitative paradigm as the dominant design, while the qualitative paradigm was used to substantiate numerical data. Data collection adopted a multi-approach with three key sources of data: a questionnaire, interviews and literature review.

The existence of the board of commissioners, audit committee, and concentration of ownership as a mechanism of checks and balance and internal control function as a internal control mechanism is expected to reduce control risk, so that lower external audit fees can be achieved. This study uses secondary data from financial statements and annual reports of manufacturing companies which listed on Bursa Efek Indonesia in 2009 - 2011. This study uses purposive sampling method and uses multiple linier regression as the analysis instrument. Before being conducted the regression test, it is examined by using the classical assumption test. The result of this study indicate that the independence board of commissioners, the independence audit committee, the meeting intensity of audit committee, and the internal audit function did not influence the external audit fees. The meeting intensity of the board of commissioners and the concentration of ownership have significant positive relationship on the external audit fees. It means that the board of commissioners who held frequent meetings and the existence of concentrated ownership will demand a high quality audit from external auditors, resulting in higher audit fees. While the size of board of commissioners and the size of audit committee have significant negative relationship on the external audit fees. It means that board of commissioners that are small, will be more effective in checks and balances the financial reporting, and will be more support the external audit function, so that there is will increase <b>audit</b> <b>scope</b> activity, that will increase audit fees. While the audit committee that ara large will increase the quality of financial reporting which leads to lower external audit fees...|$|E
40|$|Proper records {{management}} plays {{a significant role}} in the auditing process, risk management and wider corporate governance. Despite this role, in South Africa, many governmental bodies are issued with disclaimer reports every year by the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) due to a lack of supporting documentation. This problem is exacerbated by the exclusion of {{records management}} from the criteria for a sound financial management infrastructure in many governmental bodies. The other dilemma is that some records such as financial records, personnel records and electronic records usually fall outside the jurisdiction of the organisation’s records manager. Utilising the King Report III as a framework, this study sought to develop a framework to embed records management practices into the auditing process in the public sector of South Africa, with a view to entrench a culture of clean audits. The study relied on mixed methods research (MMR), with the quantitative study conducted first through informetrics analysis of audit reports, while the qualitative paradigm was used to substantiate numerical data. Data collection adopted a multi-approach with four key sources of data: a questionnaire, interviews, literature review and publicly available data from the consolidated general reports of AGSA. The study revealed that most governmental bodies have established internal audit units, audit committees and records management units, which did not work in unison. In most governmental bodies records management did not form part of the <b>audit</b> <b>scope</b> and records management professionals were not part of the audit committees. As a result, most governmental bodies continued to receive negative audit opinions from AGSA. The study recommends that records management community should utilise auditing and risk management as a springboard to propel records management to the new heights. A further empirical study on the role of auditing and risk management in records management that embraces both the private and public sectors is recommended. Information ScienceD. Litt. et Phil.

40|$|The {{publication}} illustrates various {{approaches to}} auditing and reflects on their merit, {{as well as}} outlines the implementation of audits in different higher education systems across Europe. One focus is to show common aspects and apparent deviations concerning purpose and aim of the <b>audit,</b> national legislation, <b>scope</b> of the <b>audit,</b> external assessments and their effects. In addition it reflects on current and future challenges and developments. Contributions from twelve European quality assurance agencies provide an insight into their audit approaches. The publication is targeted at quality assurance agencies, higher education institutions and other stakeholders and aims to increase knowledge about different quality assurance procedures across borders.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis presents {{an analysis of}} Internal Auditing at the County and Municipal levels of government in the State of California. Specifically, the research addresses the degree of local governments compliance with the expanded <b>scope</b> <b>audit</b> standards issued by the United States General Accounting Office (GAO) in 1972 and revised in 1981. The research encompasses specific aspects of the organization and independence, the professional skills, the audit performance and the reporting procedures of local level government audit offices. The information relevant to these areas was gathered by an author developed questionnaire. The response data provided is {{used to assess the}} degree of ccmpliar. ee with the GAO Standards and also to ascertain, if applicable, why local governments do not comply with these procedures.

40|$|Theoretical {{waste minimisation}} {{opportunities}} and options for electroplating were sought from the literature. Their suitability under the specific site conditions of a chromium electroplating plant were evaluated using {{the results of}} a waste minimisation audit (audit). The audit showed that many waste minimisation practices were already in place. These included counter current flowing rinse systems, multiple use of rinses and recycling of the drag-out solution back into the plating solution. Two types of information were collected during the audit, namely new chemical monitoring (concentration levels of sodium, iron, zinc, copper, lead, chromium and nickel and conductivity, total dissolved solids and pH) and flow rate data and existing data (composition of the process solutions, products and waste outputs, and raw materials, workpieces and utility inputs). The data were analysed using four established waste minimisation techniques. The <b>Scoping</b> <b>Audit</b> and the Water Economy Assessment results were determined using empirically derived models while the Mass Balancing and the True Cost of Waste results were obtained through more detailed calculations. The results of the audit showed that the three most important areas for wast...|$|R
