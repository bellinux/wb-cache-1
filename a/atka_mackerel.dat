50|$|<b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{migrate from}} shelves to coastal waters to spawn which occurs (in the Aleutians) from July to September. Their eggs adhere to crevices in the rocks, and {{incubate}} for 40-45 days. Males guard {{the clutches of}} eggs until they hatch. <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> feed on copepods and euphausiids. They are, in turn, preyed upon by several species, such as the coho salmon and the Steller sea lion.|$|E
50|$|Able {{to live up}} to 14 years, {{the largest}} <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{recorded}} was 56.5 cm long; the heaviest recorded weight was 2.0 kg. Adults have five vertical, blackish bands on their bodies, which are normally yellowish. <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> can be distinguished from other, similar species by the number of spines and rays that they have on their fins. They have 21 spines, and anywhere from 25-29 rays on their dorsal fins, and only one spine (but 24-26 rays) on their anal fins.|$|E

When first hooked they would come up very readily, in fact they seemed to swim upward until near the surface when they would become alarmed and dart back and forth in their efforts to free themselves. The sport was very exciting. During 4 hours fishing 9 persons with 26 lines took 585 fish... And as our ship was out of fresh meat of every kind, all these fish were soon eaten by the officers and crew.|$|E

40|$|Prey-size {{selectivity}} by Steller {{sea lions}} (Eumetopias jubatus) is relevant {{for understanding the}} foraging behavior of this declining predator, but studies have been problematic because of the absence and erosion of otoliths usually used to estimate fish length. Therefore, we developed regression formulae to estimate fish length from seven diagnostic cranial structures of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Pleurogrammus monopterygius). For both species, all structure measurements were related with fork length of prey (r 2 range: 0. 78 − 0. 99). Fork length (FL) of walleye pollock and <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> consumed by Steller sea lions was estimated by applying these regression models to cranial structures recovered from scats (feces) collected between 1998 and 2000 across {{the range of the}} Alaskan western stock of Steller sea lions. Experimentally derived digestion correction factors were applied to take into account loss of size due to digestion. Fork lengths of walleye pollock consumed by Steller sea lions ranged from 3. 7 to 70. 8 cm (mean= 39. 3 cm, SD= 14. 3 cm, n= 666) and <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> ranged from 15. 3 to 49. 6 cm (mean= 32. 3 cm, SD= 5. 9 cm, n= 1685). Although sample sizes were limited, a greater proportion of juvenile (≤ 20 cm) walleye pollock were found in samples collected during the summer (June−September) on haul-out sites (64 % juveniles, n= 11 scats) than on summer rookeries (9 % juveniles, n= 132 scats) or winter (February−March) haul-out sites (3 % juveniles, n= 69 scats). Annual changes in the size of <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> consumed by Steller sea lions corresponded to changes in the length distribution of <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> resulting from exceptionally strong year classes.

40|$|<b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Pleurogrammus monopterygius) is hexagrammid {{fish that}} inhabits the {{temperate}} and subarctic North Pacific Ocean and neighboring seas (Fig. 1). This highly abundant fish is a critically important prey species (Sinclair and Zeppelin, 2002; Zenger, 2004) that supports a directed commercial trawl fishery (Lowe et al., 2006). <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> is a demersal spawner and males provide parental care to eggs (Zolotov, 1993). During breeding periods, sexually mature males aggregate {{on the bottom}} at nesting sites where they establish territories (Lauth et al., in press). Sexually mature females periodically visit male nesting territories from July to October to spawn batches of demersal egg masses (McDermott and Lowe, 1997; McDermott et al., 2007). Individual nests may consist of multiple egg masses deposited by different females, and males defend nesting territories for a protracted period lasting from the time territories are being established until all eggs within the territory are completely hatched (Lauth et al., 2007). Knowledge {{about the timing of}} the reproductive cycle and the use of spawning habitat are important for understanding population structure and the dynamics of stock recruitment, which in turn are important factors in the management of <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> populations...|$|E
40|$|Trade-offs {{in energy}} {{allocation}} between growth and reproduction {{can result in}} variations in reproductive potential in fish with differing growth patterns. Spawning biomass is often used {{as a proxy for}} reproductive potential on the assumption that fecundity is directly proportional to body weight. We examined variations in the reproductive potential of <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> Pleurogrammus monopterygius by studying the effect of differential growth and condition patterns on fecundity, atresia, and egg energy. Fecundity and egg energy were determined for fish from two geographic areas, Seguam Pass and Amchitka Island, Alaska, and compared with those of fish held in captivity. These <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> showed distinct differences in growth and condition, with weight at length and length at age being the highest among captive fish, intermediate among fish from Seguam Pass, and lowest among fish from Amchitka Island. Realized fecundity showed that on average captive fish spawned seven batches, fish from Seguam Pass six batches, and fish from Amchitka Island five batches. For wild fish, potential and realized fecundity at length or age was significantly higher at Seguam Pass than at Amchitka Island, whereas the fecundity-at-weight relationship did not differ by area, suggesting that weight is a better predictor of fecundity than length or age. Atresia and batch fecundity by length or weight did not differ by area, suggesting that the variation in fecundity is better explained by the variation in batch number than by batch size. Oocyte dry weight was higher for captive fish than for wild fish, whereas batch order did not significantly affect oocyte dry weight. Increased potential fecundity, realized fecundity, and oocyte quality in <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> females were strongly related to body size, indicating that growth differences and maternal feeding success impact the fecundity and oocyte quality of <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel.</b> Therefore, changes in growth and condition patterns need {{to be taken into account}} to accurately estimate the reproductive potential of this species...|$|E
40|$|The {{mating system}} and {{patterns}} of gender-specific egg cannibalism in <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> Pleurogrammus monopterygius were examined through genetic parentage analysis of embryos in egg clutches produced in captive and wild populations. Like other hexagrammid fishes, <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> exhibit polygynandry, which is characterized by serial matings by both genders within a breeding season. Most matings in captivity were pairings of females with nest-attendant males, although parentage analysis of clutches produced in a small tank with limited nesting substrate revealed that 31 % contained contributions by non–nest-guarding males. In contrast, all egg clutches produced in a large exhibit tank were sired by guardian males. Multiple parentage, sometimes involving both genders, was detected in 35 % of egg clutches collected in the field or retrieved from the guts of adult male and female cannibals. Half-sib and unrelated full-sib embryos were found in several putative clutches, indicating that the reproductive output from multiple males and females may be combined sequentially and fused into a single clutch. These results suggested that nest takeovers, combined with alloparental care of existing broods, represent common reproductive tactics in males. Egg cannibalism is a significant seasonal factor in the diets {{of male and female}} <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel.</b> Analysis of loose eggs and partial egg clutches ingested by 4 female and 15 male cannibals showed that nearly all conspecific predation represented heterocannibalism. One instance of partial filial cannibalism was documented in a male that was one of multiple sires for the clutch...|$|E
40|$|Annual {{potential}} fecundity, batch fecundity, and oocyte atresia {{were estimated}} for <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Pleurogrammus monopterygius) collected in Alaskan waters during 1993 − 94. <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> were {{assumed to be}} determinate spawners {{on the basis of}} decreasing fecundity after batch spawning events. Histological examination of the ovaries indicated that oocytes in the vitellogenic stage and higher had been spawned in the current spawning season. For an average female of 40 cm, potential annual fecundity was estimated to be 41, 994 eggs, average batch size (i. e., batch fecundity) was estimated to be 6689 eggs, and there were 6. 13 batches per spawning season. Atresia was estimated by examining postspawning specimens and was found to be substantial. The average amount of atresia for a 40 -cm fish was estimated to be 11, 329 eggs, resulting in an estimated realized fecundity of only 30, 664 eggs and 4. 64 batches of eggs per spawning season...|$|E
40|$|The {{timing and}} {{duration}} of the reproductive cycle of <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Pleurogrammus monopterygius) was validated by using observations from time-lapse video and data from archival tags, and the start, peak, and end of spawning and hatching were determined from an incubation model with aged egg samples and empirical incubation times ranging from 44 days at a water temperature of 9. 85 °C to 100 days at 3. 89 °C. From June to July, males ceased diel vertical movements, aggregated in nesting colonies, and established territories. Spawning began in late July, ended in mid-October, and peaked in early September. The male egg-brooding period that followed continued from late November to mid-January and duration was highly dependent on embryonic development as affected by ambient water temperature. Males exhibited brooding behavior for protracted periods at water depths from 23 to 117 m where average daily water temperatures ranged from 4. 0 ° to 6. 2 °C. Knowledge {{about the timing of}} the reproductive cycle provides a framework for conserving <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> populations and investigating the physical and biological processes influencing recruitment...|$|E
40|$|A leading {{hypothesis}} {{to explain}} the dramatic decline of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in western Alaska during {{the latter part of}} the 20 th century is a change in prey availability due to commercial fisheries. We tested this hypothesis by exploring the relationships between sea lion population trends, fishery catches, and the prey biomass accessible to sea lions around 33 rookeries between 2000 and 2008. We focused on three commercially important species that have dominated the sea lion diet during the population decline: walleye pollock, Pacific cod and <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel.</b> We estimated available prey biomass by removing fishery catches from predicted prey biomass distributions in the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska; and modelled the likelihood of sea lions foraging at different distances from rookeries (accessibility) using satellite telemetry locations of tracked animals. We combined this accessibility model with the prey distributions to estimate the prey biomass accessible to sea lions by rookery. For each rookery, we compared sea lion population change to accessible prey biomass. Of 304 comparisons, we found 3 statistically significant relationships, all suggesting that sea lion populations increased with increasing prey accessibility. Given that the majority of comparisons showed no significant effect, it seems unlikely that the availability of pollock, cod or <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> was limiting sea lion populations in the 2000 s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Acoustic {{surveys are}} {{routinely}} {{used to assess}} fish abundance. To ensure accurate population estimates, the characteristics of echoes from constituent species must be quantified. Kirchhoff-ray mode (KRM) backscatter models were used to quantify acoustic characteristics of Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska pelagic fish species: capelin (Mallotus villosus), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus). <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> and eulachon do not have swimbladders. Acous-tic backscatter was estimated {{as a function of}} insonifying frequency, fish length, and body orientation relative to the incident wave front. Backscatter intensity and variance estimates were compared to examine the potential to discrimi-nate among species. Based on relative intensity differences, species could be separated in two major groups: fish with gas-filled swimbladders and fish without swimbladders. The effects of length and tilt angle on echo intensity depended on frequency. Variability in target strength (TS) resulting from morphometric differences was high for species without swimbladders. Based on our model predictions, a series of TS to length equations were developed for each species at the common frequencies used by fisheries acousticians.

Abstract: Approximately 1 000 Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus (Schreber, 1776); SSL) and 14 000 northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus (L., 1758); NFS) breed sympatrically on Lovushki Island in the Russian Far East, creating {{the potential for}} interspecific competition for prey. An additional 13 000 – 14 000 juvenile NFS are present during the breeding season. The diets of breeding SSL and both breeding and juvenile NFS were examined through analysis of scats and spews collected during the breeding seasons of 2003, 2005, and 2007 – 2008. There were significant overlaps in the prey species and size selection of SSL and juvenile NFS. There were {{significant differences between the}} diets of SSL and breeding NFS. SSL and juvenile NFS fed primarily on <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Pleurogrammus monopterygius (Pallas, 1810)), while breeding NFS fed on cephalopods, salmon (genus Oncorhynchus Suckley, 1861), <b>Atka</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and northern smoothtongue (Leuroglossus schmidti Rass, 1955). The partitioning of resources between breeding animals has allowed both species to coexist within the same region and likely reflected differences in foraging abilities and provisioning strategies of the adults and the fasting abilities of their pups. However, continued growth of the NFS population may lead to the exclusion of SSL owing to interspecific competition for prey.

Support from NPRB allowed us to substantially increase sample sizes (from about 700 to more than 1200) with collections targeted to address specific questions about distribution, catch incidence, and coloration. The project was initiated by our discovery of two genetically distinct forms of rougheye rockfish (Sebastes aleutianus).
