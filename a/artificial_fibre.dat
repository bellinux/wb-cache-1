5000|$|European {{manufacturers}} use wool blends or even 100% wool, usually Merino {{or other}} high-quality wool. Some models might include {{a thin layer}} of polyester to transport moisture away from the skin. Wool, in addition to being fire retardant, provides highly effective insulation and will keep its insulating properties even when wet, as opposed to cotton. In central Europe in Poland there is still one company called EWAX, which manufactures traditional cotton Long Johns.
