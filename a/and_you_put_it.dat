When asked why the song was remixed, Hugo replied with, [...] "We wanted something with more of a straight-ahead, club-bumping beat, just a different take on it. We like to remix, dismantle, take apart shit {{and put it back}} together. It's just like a Rubik's Cube: When you can't solve it, you just break it <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> back together." [...] Williams added, [...] "We think that 'Everyone Nose' in its current form already hits a certain demographic a certain way, so I just wanted to go and do something different." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the joint}} album leaked on February 22, 2002 it caused the label, Roc-A-Fella, {{to push the}} album's release date up from the initial date, March 26, to March 19. Jay-Z {{expressed}} his frustration about the album leak to MTV News: [...] "It's the gift and the curse. It's an honor that everybody wants your music fast, {{but on the other}} hand, it's another thing when the music gets out before you [...] Because that's your art. You feel attached to it. You feel a certain way and you want people to go out and support it. The time that you take, it's like a piece of your life.

6000|$|... "Oh dear no! I didn't {{mean that}} at all. It can't be too near. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> couldn't <b>put</b> <b>it</b> off now, <b>you</b> know, because the Dean has been bespoke. It {{is a good}} thing to have the Dean to fasten the knot. Don't you think so, Miss Lawrie?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of {{historic}} fact, <b>and</b> since <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> directly, one does not," [...] said Attwater. [...] "Why ring a bell, when there flows out from oneself and everything about one a far more momentous silence? the least beat of my heart and the least thought in my mind echoing into eternity for ever and for ever and for ever." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{few weeks}} before {{releasing}} the LP, dAsK wrote on the band's scrapbook, [...] "…it was very exhausting to get the things right, sonically. It was like painting a picture where every stroke of paint brush has its place, <b>and</b> if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> differently it will change the whole meaning. The whole record, for me, is what Guernica is for Picasso or Sunflowers for Van Gogh…" ...|$|R

'In {{times for}} ever fled Arthur,' {{returned}} Mrs Finching, 'pray excuse me Doyce and Clennam infinitely more correct and though unquestionably distant still 'tis distance lends enchantment to the view, at least I don't mean that and if I did I suppose {{it would depend}} considerably {{on the nature of}} the view, but I'm running on again <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> all out of my head.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{gave you}} the key of my shop <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> {{yourself}} where you liked, and did you not find it {{in exactly the same}} spot and in the same state?

[...] "Put it in that way, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> right. Just look round you. Here we three persons are alive and hearty at this snug table. If (which God forbid!) good Mistress Germaine or yourself were to fall down dead in another moment, I, doctor as I am, could no more explain what first principle of life and movement had been suddenly extinguished in you than the dog there sleeping on the hearth-rug. If I am content to sit down ignorant {{in the face of such}} an impenetrable mystery as this--presented to me, day after day, every time I see a living creature come into the world or go out of it--why may I not sit down content in the face of your lady in the summer-house, and say she's altogether beyond my fathoming, and there is an end of her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must excuse my curiosity, my dear Kennedy, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> must <b>put</b> <b>it</b> {{down to my}} {{ignorance of}} the world.

[...] He passed {{his hand over his}} {{forehead}} like a man who is half dazed, and then fell rather than sat down upon a chair.|$|R
60|$|It should {{hardly have}} escaped so curious an {{observer}} {{that when the}} cat jumps up on the dinner table, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down, it instantly jumps up again, and finally establishes its right to {{a place on the}} cloth by convincing you that if you put it down a hundred times it will jump up a hundred and one times; so that if you desire its company at dinner you can have it only on its own terms. If Weismann really thought that cats act thus without any consciousness or any purpose, immediate or ulterior, he must have known very little about cats. But a thoroughgoing Weismannite, if any such still survive from those mad days, would contend that I am not at present necessarily conscious of what I am doing; that my writing of these lines, and your reading of them, are effects of Circumstantial Selection; that I heed know no more about Darwinism than a butterfly knows of a lizard's appetite; and that the proof that I actually am doing it unconsciously is that as I have spent forty years in writing in this fashion without, as far as I can see, producing any visible effect on public opinion, I must be incapable of learning from experience, and am therefore a mere automaton. And the Weismannite demonstration of this would of course be an equally unconscious effect of Circumstantial Selection.|$|E
5000|$|If {{you have}} a frog {{that is used to}} living in a dirty drain, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in some flowers, it will say, 'What hell have you put me?' It will not like it. When it jumps back into the dirty drain, the frog will exclaim, 'What heaven is this! Can {{something}} be better than this?' The frog can only enjoy the dirty drain because its life is in the dirty drain.|$|E

5000|$|In June 2013, {{during an}} {{interview}} with XXL, Freddie Gibbs previewed the album. He spoke about “Eastside Moonwalker”, saying: [...] "That’s one of the dopest tracks. Shout out to GMF. He produced that. It’s showing people that I’m the staple of the game {{when it comes to}} Gary Indiana. Michael Jackson is dead, so I gotta pick up the torch and run with it for my city. Actually, I am the only person grabbing it. I am just doing what I got to do. I’m the eastside moonwalker. I stay high, baby.” He also spoke about “Freddie Soprano”, saying: [...] "That’s the definitive verse from the album. Basically, telling y’all what it is. How I feel about what’s what." [...] He spoke about “F.A.M.E.” which features Daz Dillinger and Spice 1, saying: [...] "acronym stands for ‘Fuck All My Enemies.’ You know who I am talking about. If you an enemy—fuck you. I grew up listening to Daz and Spice-1. If it wasn’t for guys like that, I wouldn’t be rapping. Any project I do, I try to pay homage to guys that I respect. Last project I fucked with Jadakiss. He’s one of the guys that when I came up, I came up listening to. He’s still an athlete in this game. He’s still {{one of the best in}} it. He don’t get his credit. I always try to pay homage to the guys that were instrumental in my career with me coming up. That’s why I linked up with Daz and Spice-1. is a diss track to anybody who want it. If the shoe fits, wear it. I’m talking shit about all of you niggas. If the shoe fits, wear it. If you pick up the shoe <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on. You want to take to Twitter and you want to get on your track and say something about Freddie Gibbs, make sure you got your hardhat on." [...] He spoke about “Lay It Down” which is produced by Willie B, saying: [...] "Shout out to Willie B. He fuck with Jay Rock and them. He produced that shit. That’s one of them hard-hitting joints. It’s going straight to the point. Lay it down. That’s a robbing song." [...] He also spoke about “Have U Seen Her” which features Hit Skrewface, saying: [...] "This is featuring my boy Screwface. SMKA, they produced that. That’s one of them bangers. It’s hard.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will come}} to that second {{difficulty}} all in good time," [...] rejoined the Count. [...] "You may confuse yourself, Percival, {{as much as you}} please, but you shall not confuse me. Let the question of the money be settled first. Have I convinced your obstinacy? have I shown you that your temper will not let you help yourself?--Or must I go back, <b>and</b> (as <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in your dear straightforward English) bully and bluster a little more?" ...|$|R

60|$|That {{is another}} thing I have learnt. Never lend a pencil to a woman {{if you ever want}} to see it again. She has three answers to your request for its return. The first, that she gave it back to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> that <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in your pocket, and that it's there now, and that if it isn't it ought to be. The second, that you never lent it to her.

6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, plumber. I'm sure ye mean well," [...] {{returned}} the Irishman, [...] "but you'd better shut your face, for I'm {{not that kind}} of a man.

6000|$|... "Well, you are {{certainly}} the coolest hand I ever came across," [...] O'Neil said. [...] "You are proposing {{to seize the}} first minister in England, {{as if it were}} merely an affair of carrying off a pretty girl quite willing to be captured.

6000|$|...

Then you can guess that the dog didn't do much smelling of that prickly bunch, for he's nobody's fool; but, after looking at it a minute, turned all his attention to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I'm in some pain," [...] {{she said}} in reply to Seth's anxious questioning; [...] "but now that the house has been saved I {{have no right to}} complain.

6000|$|... "The {{situation}} was far different then.

2500|$|Before {{opening day}} for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1961, talks had already started between the Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies for a {{potential}} trade involving Demeter and Phillies reliever Turk Farrell. A deal was reached on May 4, sending Don and Charley Smith to Philadelphia for Farrell and Joe Koppe. Phillies manager Gene Mauch was glad about the deal, announcing immediately after the trade that Demeter would be a starter immediately. Mauch remarked, [...] "There aren't many better center fielders around than he is, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the book right now that he'll hit more than 20 home runs any year he plays a full season in our park." [...] Don would prove the prophetic manager to be correct, hitting 21, 29, and 22 home runs in 3 seasons with Philadelphia.|$|R
50|$|The last {{of these}} cradles is the leg cradle. This {{is a great}} move to watch, <b>and</b> once <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on an opponent, {{there is almost no}} coming out of it, as your legs are the strongest parts of your body. To get to the leg cradle, you should get to a near side cradle position, and start pulling your arms in {{together}} for the grip to be set. But before you set your grip, throw your legs in on the sides that the leg corresponds to with the hand (you have your right hand on the head, put the right leg on the head, vice versa for the other leg <b>and</b> position).

5000|$|Speaking in February 2009 to noted British R&B writer Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul, Shontelle {{explained}} the significance to {{her of the}} song: [...] "I really like 'T-Shirt' a lot because, {{when you listen to}} the song, there's a lot of elements in there that will definitely appeal to girls. Like even the strongest women at some point can have that guy in their life who, if for some reason you can't be with him, is gonna have that effect on you where you're not gonna feel like going out, hanging out with your girlfriends, partying, or doing ANYTHING. <b>And,</b> if <b>you</b> do miss that person, the best thing to have of theirs is a T-shirt!

[...] "You will speak to Clive now, won't you?" [...] she said, [...] "and come to me this evening, and tell me all {{before you go to}} bed?" [...] I went back, anxious in truth to the messenger of good tidings to my dear old friends.|$|R

6000|$|At the White House one day some gentlemen {{were present}} from the West, excited and troubled about the {{commissions}} and omissions of the Administration.

No, you would hold your breath as well as your tongue, and keep your hands off until he was safe over. The Government are carrying an immense weight. Untold treasures are in their hands.

[...] "The film we made so far is not the film they expected," [...] he said. [...] "But as you edit, you {{learn more about the}} subject matter, and more about the actors, and nothing is set in stone. Movies are made many times -- once in the writing, once in preproduction, once again during the shoot, once again in editing, in post, <b>and</b> again when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the marketplace.
