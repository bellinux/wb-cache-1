40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the development of agricultural credit and its contribution to economic development by supporting increased agricultural output and thereby assisting in the improvement of living conditions of a rural population. The author as a staff member of the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands, from March 1950 to October 1957, served as Chief of the Natural Resources Division with responsibility for the direction of programs for the utilization and development of agriculture, fisheries and forestry. This study is a historical analysis of the development of agricultural credit in the Ryukyu Islands. It was designed to answer the following questions: How was this <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> <b>program</b> initiated? How did this agricultural credit system develop? Is the annual increase of agricultural cooperative loans to farmer members governed by the amount of funds borrowed from the Central Bank for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries or is it dependent on the increase of farmer saving deposits in agricultural cooperatives?

40|$|Summary We {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> <b>program</b> participation on children's school attendance in rural Malawi. Our paired-site sampling survey reveals that credit uptake decreased school attendance by young girl children. This finding raises concerns that young girl children are exploited as child labor, either {{at home or in}} the field, when working adults become more involved in income-generating activities financed by credit. The data, however, do not show clear evidence for young girls staying at home to do household chores or working in the fields in households that obtained credit, but instead find simultaneous occurrence between attending school and taking responsibilities for domestic chores by young children. It would appear, therefore, that credit uptake delays the realization of this concurrence among young girl children and leads to delayed school enrollment. micro-credit education child labor Sub-Saharan Africa Malawi...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general {{picture of the}} difficulties in developing a sustainable lending service geared toward smallholder agriculture. Drawing on {{the experiences of the}} Philippines and other countries, it traces the rethinking of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> policy following the collapse of subsidized <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> <b>programs,</b> and the subsequent rise of microfinance, as pioneered by nongovernmental organizations. Acknowledging that the main challenge is not about the straightforward application of microfinance technologies to agriculture, the paper discusses how crafting an approach to sustainable agriculture microfinance is influenced by myriad of issues. The paper concludes that overcoming the barriers to agricultural microfinance goes beyond the simple provision of credit, extends outside agriculture, and shuns a “one size fits all” approach. To {{be able to deal with}} the complexity and risks in agriculture, rural lenders would have to innovate on their product design, lending technologies and risk management strategies; improve their information base; and strive to have access to market-based risk management products. Moreover, policymakers have to recognize and understand the peculiarities of the rural and agriculture sector, namely: information asymmetry, geographic dispersion, heterogeneity of the population, covariant risks, insecure property rights, and the absence of insurance markets and risk-reducing institutions. microfinance,credit policy,microfinance,collateral...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an economic model of group formation with an application to {{data collected from}} an <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> <b>program</b> in western Honduras. We formulate a simple theory of group formation using the concept of centers of gravity to explain why individuals join a group. According to our theory, prospective members join based on the potential benefits and costs of group membership, and based on their perception of social distance between themselves and other group members. Social distance is unobservable by outsiders but known by the individual: {{if you are in}} then you know who has blue hair. Thus, we argue that social distance helps explain preferences for group formation. To test our theory we analyze data collected from members and non-members of PRODERT, a program that has helped create 188 “Cajas Rurales” (CRs). Using conjoint analysis we test for differences in preferences between members and non-members for the main attributes of the CR. We find that members and non-members exhibit similar preferences for the attributes of the CR; therefore non-membership is not related to supply factors. Using information gathered by executing field experiments, we estimate a proxy for social distance. We use this proxy to run a group formation equation and find that it explains, along with individual characteristics, participation in the CR. Finally we offer suggestions on how to balance performance and coverage in programs in which beneficiaries decide who joins. Small cohesive groups may show exceptional performance at the cost of low coverage, and the opposite may be true. Agricultural Finance, Institutional and Behavioral Economics,...|$|E
40|$|There were {{indications}} of failure of Indonesia's <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> <b>program</b> {{in terms of}} its inability to increase agricultural production, farmers' income, and repayment level. This paper analyses the impact of credit provision on farming activities and proposes strategies for improving livelihood of agricultural producers in Lombok, Indonesia. The analysis is based on two periods of survey conducted in Central Lombok, where the current KKP government credit scheme is provided to agricultural producers. Three villages within the regency were sampled, representing various repayment rates of government credit. Data were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with farmers who had made use of government or other sources of agricultural credit, and with key informants. This study confirmed that credit used by farmers in Lombok had little noticeable impact on increasing agricultural production (11 %) and on income (5 %). This marginal impact of credit use {{may be related to the}} current credit provision system in which credit is made available in limited amounts and intended for a single purpose. The repayment levels of individual farmers were quite satisfactory, in the sense that the majority of farmers have repaid their loans in full. However, their reasons for repayment were not directly related to the levels of income they earned. Rather, farmers made credit repayments for reasons for maintaining eligibility for future credit distribution, borrowers' positive personality (especially to avoid embarrassment), and providers' collection efforts. The little noticeable impact of credit, and farmers' reasons for making credit repayment, point to the need for the current system to be altered, to allow for provision of larger amounts and for multiple purposes. This move requires equipping farmers with entrepreneurship ability so that they can seek and make use of business opportunities. There is a need for education and extension programs that focus on identifying business opportunities on which credit may be used more profitably in the long term rather than just for short term seasonal survival as well as on how to run the identified businesses properly and profitably. This knowledge may help farmers to improve their living standards and allow credit provision to have a more significant impact than the current system. agricultural credit, credit impact, entrepreneurship, Lombok, Indonesia, Agricultural Finance,...|$|E

40|$|Finding {{evidence}} {{for the presence of}} moral hazard is difficult because measures of 2 ̆ 7 unwillingness 2 ̆ 7 are not readily available. For this reason, many theoretical models born out of Information Theory remain untested. In this dissertation I develop two theoretical models and derive empirical tests for the presence of a specific form of moral hazard in credit transactions: diversion of borrowed funds. In the first model, I assess a household 2 ̆ 7 s demographic structure as a source of this specific risk, while in the second model, I explore the possibility that lenders schedule the release of funds to farmers to avoid default risks due to capital diversion. Summaries of these models and test results are included below. ^ Model I. While the fungibility of funds has been recognized as a problem facing <b>agricultural</b> <b>credit</b> <b>programs,</b> {{it is not clear how}} or where funds are diverted by borrowers. Household composition is likely to be an important determinant of the allocation of resources between consumption and production. In particular, given equal resources, households who have to support many dependents relative to others may be more likely to divert funds toward consumption. Evidence from rural South India supports the hypothesis that household composition is one of the determinants of equilibrium input demand, and farmer output. Accordingly, moneylenders consider both wealth and household composition when deciding on the size of loans to offer households. ^ Model II. The existing literature on informal rural credit ignores the timing of loan disbursements as a choice variable in lenders 2 ̆ 7 decisions. This model introduces delayed disbursement as an alternative mechanism lenders use to cope with the most likely type of information asymmetry faced by rural lenders: moral hazard. A model is introduced in which a lender-faced with a limited liability constraint and moral hazard [...] must schedule the disbursement of loans to (a) avoid willful default, and (b) obtain the necessary current production information to assess the farmer 2 ̆ 7 s ability to repay. Empirical findings based on data from South India confirm the model 2 ̆ 7 s predictions that poor farmers with a bad credit history are the most likely targets of delay. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{correlational}} and descriptive {{study was to examine}} the influence of an <b>agricultural</b> dual <b>credit</b> course curriculum on student self-efficacy of college readiness as students matriculate to post-secondary education. To evaluate the personal characteristics, postsecondary plans, program perceptions and college readiness self-efficacy, a quantitative survey and online instrument was used to gather data and analyze information on high school students enrolled in agricultural education in both dual credit and non-dual credit courses primarily in the Middle Tennessee Region. The target population (N = 543) for this study was defined as students at 16 schools where the dual credit course was offered with the Middle Tennessee State University, School of Agribusiness and Agriscience in the 2011 - 2012 academic year. A total of 245 students from 16 secondary agricultural programs in seven different school districts across Tennessee, primarily in the Middle Tennessee region, participated in the study for a response rate of approximately 45 %. This study examined college readiness of student participation in an <b>agricultural</b> dual <b>credit</b> course and sought to determine the relationship between student participation in a dual credit course offering and college readiness self-efficacy as well as student perceptions of the course offering. Course self-efficacy was higher among dual credit participants versus non-dual credit participants. Social self-efficacy was also higher for dual credit participants. Females had higher Course self-efficacy, and there was a positive relationship between GPA and each construct of the college readiness self-efficacy inventory. Participant perceptions of the <b>agricultural</b> dual <b>credit</b> <b>program</b> were also high. This study indicates that dual credit participants can confidently approach post-secondary options, and that they are more likely to be successful in college due to level of self-efficacy as they matriculate into college. Recommendations from the study include: Using the MTSU dual credit model in future dual credit course developments and collaborations; using findings as a basis for training future agricultural education teachers on how to improve CRSE; and additional and longitudinal studies to track dual credit students? success in college...|$|R
