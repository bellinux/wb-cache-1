5|$|In 1980, {{his team}} at NIMH {{admitted}} {{a patient with}} depression who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought previous research regarding melatonin release at night {{may be able to}} help him. Rosenthal and his colleagues treated the patient with bright lights, which helped to successfully manage the depression. They conducted a formal follow-up study to confirm the success. The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. The research on SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and in some ways controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions on the effect of light therapy <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> time of day the light should be administered.|$|E

The fate of the {{building}} was up in the air as the building's owners and the insurance company prepared for ligation on how to proceed with repairs, who would control those repairs, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> cost. E/R Partners were proposing deconstructing the building down to the 19th floor and rebuilding from there. Aetna Corporation, the fire insurer, claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used cutting $115 million in repair costs from the owner's $250 million estimate. Aetna also proposed taking over the reconstruction. E/R Partners spent $50 million securing One Meridian Plaza and spent up to $500,000 a month on security guards, utilities and inspections by engineers as the building stood empty.|$|E
5|$|The Germans quickly {{developed}} {{a series of}} basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar {{at this stage in}} the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the Fernnachtjagd in operations over Britain. Major Kuhlmann, head of the wireless telegraphy interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the North Sea, and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or Räume (areas). Raum A was Yorkshire, bounded by Hull, Leeds, Lancaster and Newcastle. Raum B covered the Midlands and Lincolnshire whilst Raum C encompassed East Anglia bounded by London Peterborough, Luton and The Wash. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.|$|E

25|$|The {{control center}} {{communicates}} with the train using two conductor cables that run between {{the tracks and}} are crossed every 100 m. The control center sends data packets, known as telegrams, to the vehicle which give it its movement authority (how far it can proceed <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> speed) and the vehicle sends back data packets indicating its configuration, braking capabilities, speed, and position.|$|E
25|$|Dentition is {{particularly}} useful in tracking ancient populations' movements, {{because there are}} differences in the shapes of incisors, the number of grooves on molars, presence/absence of wisdom teeth, and extra cusps on particular teeth. These differences can not only be associated with different populations across space, but also change over time so that the study of the characteristics of teeth could say which population one is dealing with, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> point in that population's history they are.|$|E

It is programmed with the track configuration including the location of points, turnouts, gradients, and curve speed limits. With this, it has sufficient information to calculate how far each train may proceed <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> speed.|$|E

25|$|Because Medicare offers statutorily {{determined}} benefits, {{its coverage}} policies and payment rates are publicly known, and all enrollees {{are entitled to}} the same coverage. In the private insurance market, plans can be tailored to offer different benefits to different customers, enabling individuals to reduce coverage costs while assuming risks for care that is not covered. Insurers, however, have far fewer disclosure requirements than Medicare, and studies show that customers {{in the private sector}} can find it difficult to know what their policy covers. <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> cost. Moreover, since Medicare collects data about utilization and costs for its enrollees—data that private insurers treat as trade secrets—it gives researchers key information about health care system performance.|$|E
25|$|Utah's laws {{in regard}} to alcohol, tobacco and {{gambling}} are strict. Utah is an alcoholic beverage control state. The Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control regulates the sale of alcohol; wine and spirituous liquors may only be purchased at state liquor stores, and local laws may prohibit the sale of beer and other alcoholic beverages on Sundays. The state bans the sale of fruity alcoholic drinks at grocery stores and convenience stores. The law states that such drinks must now have new state-approved labels {{on the front of}} the products that contain capitalized letters in bold type telling consumers the drinks contain alcohol <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> percentage. The Utah Indoor Clean Air Act is a statewide smoking ban, that prohibits smoking in many public places. Utah is one of few states to set a smoking age of 19, as opposed to 18, as in most other states.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is {{it to say that}} he ought to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E

25|$|Even {{before the}} end of the war, on 6 October 1918 Estienne had {{proposed}} to phase out all Schneider tanks from operational units, remove their armament and deploy them as instruction and recovery vehicles. These should be distinguished from those vehicles that from the very beginning had been used as supply tanks, with the cannon removed and the hole plated over. Indeed, by the end of 1918, all surviving Schneider tanks had been given the destination of utility vehicles, although it is unknown to what extent <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> rate any rebuilding took place. On 1 December 1918 Groupements I and IV fused with Renault FT units and Groupement II and III, together with AS 9 from Groupement I, reformed into three new Groupements Lourds (I, II and III) equipped with the British Mark V* type. Some of the still serviceable Schneiders were rebuilt as recovery vehicles and tank transporters serving with Renault FT units. In 1928 a project was presented for a Schneider CA Modèle 1928 recovery tank with the upper hull replaced by a motorised crane, that could be stabilised by a large jack at the rear of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The committee's {{conclusions}} were partly {{based on}} a paper by Dr. Wiesław Binienda of the University of Akron, in which the author presented computer simulations that claimed {{to prove that the}} impact with the birch tree could not have severed the plane's wing. The paper, however, was self-published and not peer-reviewed. According to group's scientists - Binienda, Kazimierz Nowaczyk from the University of Maryland and Gregory Szuladziński - the direct cause of the crash was not a collision with an obstacle, but two explosions in the last phase of the flight: first on the left, by which the plane lost part of the left wing, then another inside the hull. Alleged contradictions, errors and manipulations in the official reports has been pointed out. Binienda also claimed that the cut wingtip couldn't fly over 100 m from the tree, the hull couldn't be torn to the outside by a collision with the ground, there should be a crater in the ground {{as a result of the}} crash if the plane wasn't torn in the air before. Szuladzinski's report stated that: any landing (or fall) in a wooded area, no matter how adverse, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> angle, could not in any way result in such fragmentation, which has been documented. Nowaczyk analyzed data from FMS and TAWS system and came to the conclusions that the plane flew over the tree and was torn at a height over 30 m above the ground. Wacław Berczyński, constructor of Boeing pointed to the pulled out rivets of the sheeting and claimed that it could be caused only by an internal explosion.|$|E
25|$|Han poetry as a {{style of}} poetry {{resulted}} in significant poems which are still preserved today, and which have their origin associated with the Han dynasty era of China, 206 BC – 220 AD, including the Wang Mang interregnum (9–23 AD). The final years {{at the end of}} the Han era (known by the name Jian'an, 196—220) often receive special handling for purposes of literary analysis because, among other things, the poetry and culture of this period is less than typical of the Han period, and has important characteristics of its own, or it shares literary aspects with the subsequent Three Kingdoms period. This poetry reflects one of the poetry world's more important flowerings, as well as being a special period in Classical Chinese poetry, particularly in regard to the development of the quasipoetic fu; the activities of the Music Bureau in connection with the collection of popular ballads and the resultant development of what would eventually become known as the yuefu, or as the rhapsodic formal style; and, finally, towards the end of the Han Dynasty, the development of a new style of shi poetry, as the later development of the yuehfu into regular, fixed-line length forms makes it difficult to distinguish in form from the shi form of poetic verse, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> point specific poems are classified as one or the other is somewhat arbitrary. Another important poetic contribution from the Han era is the compilation of the Chuci anthology, which contains some of the oldest and most important poetic verses to be preserved from ancient China, as well as the transmission of the Shijing anthology.|$|E

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives.

500|$|There {{is intense}} {{debate over the}} role the Arabian played in the {{development}} of other light horse breeds. Before DNA-based research developed, one hypothesis, based on body types and conformation, suggested the light, [...] "dry", oriental horse adapted to the desert climate had developed prior to domestication; DNA studies of multiple horse breeds now suggest that while domesticated horses arose from multiple mare lines, there is very little variability in the Y-chromosome between breeds. Following domestication of the horse, due to the location of the Middle East as a crossroads of the ancient world, and relatively near the earliest locations of domestication, oriental horses spread throughout Europe and Asia both in ancient and modern times. There is little doubt that humans crossed [...] "oriental" [...] blood on that of other types to create light riding horses; the only actual questions are at what point the [...] "oriental" [...] prototype could be called an [...] "Arabian", how much Arabian blood was mixed with local animals, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> point in history.|$|E

500|$|In April 1893, Mamie Baxter, a fourteen-year-old girl in Denmark, Barnwell County, {{alleged that}} an African American unknown to her had {{attempted}} to attack her. About twenty black men were detained and paraded before her; she stated that Henry Williams looked something like the man she had seen. Placed on what passed for a trial by the mob that took him from the jail, Williams produced several respected white men to support his alibi. A majority of the mob voted against killing him, and Williams was returned to jail. More searches were made for Baxter's attacker. A suspect in the case, John Peterson, appealed to Tillman for protection, fearing he would be lynched if taken to Denmark, and stating he could prove his innocence. Tillman sent Peterson to Denmark with a single guard. He {{was taken by the}} mob, put on [...] "trial", and after the mob found him guilty, was murdered. There was widespread outrage among both races across the country, both at the actions of the lynchers <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> Tillman had done. The governor said, in response, that he had assumed that, as the mob had been convinced by Williams' defense, it would allow Peterson to prove his innocence as well. He thereafter ignored the issue of the Denmark lynching.|$|E
500|$|Under U.S. law {{and with}} rare exceptions, people (whether {{criminal}} suspects or defendants or not) {{have the right}} to remain silent as part of their right not to incriminate themselves under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Remaining silent is optional—they may speak or be silent as they wish.

Miranda v.

A number of cases such as the present one, refine Miranda by addressing when <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> point a suspect, who is aware that they {{have the right to}} remain silent, is said to have begun to rely on that right, as opposed to when they were aware of the right but were not choosing to rely on it.|$|E

I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E
