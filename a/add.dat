40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} structural changes {{on the distribution of}} net value <b>added</b> and the difference between net value <b>added</b> and agricultural income over time. We present and discuss the changes in the distribution of net value <b>added</b> (land, labor, capital, and farm income) over time. Net value <b>added</b> by U. S. agriculture grew significantly from $ 18 billion in 1960 to $ 95 billion in 1996. We examine regional differences in net value <b>added</b> using the Theil entropy measure. The inequality (dispersion) of net value <b>added</b> increased over time. The increased inequality in net value <b>added</b> represented both increases in regional dispersion in net value <b>added</b> and increases in the average inequality in net value <b>added</b> in each region. Thus, the net value <b>added</b> is becoming less alike across the United States. We also examine the inequality in the components of net value <b>added.</b> The greatest dispersion occurred in returns to land followed by returns to capital. Therefore, changes in the dispersion of net value <b>added</b> by agriculture ar...|$|R
