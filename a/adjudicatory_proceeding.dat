40|$|Using the Mike Nifong {{disciplinary}} case in North Carolina as a focal point, {{the author}} examines the disciplinary rules pertaining to public speech by attorneys during the pendency of an <b>adjudicatory</b> <b>proceeding.</b> The author argues that {{in light of}} the Supreme Court’s 2002 decision in Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, certain provisions of Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rules 3. 6 and 3. 8, may violate the first amendment, at least as applied to an elected prosecutor speaking during a political campaign. While former District Attorney Nifong made several statements to the media during the so-called “Duke Lacrosse” investigation that were clearly overzealous and impermissible even under the narrowest reading of the pertinent disciplinary rules, other public statements that Nifong made and was later disciplined for may have been protected by the first amendment, had the respondent raised a constitutional challenge in his North Carolina Disciplinary Commission proceeding. The author uses the Nifong disbarment case as a lens through which to examine current ethical restrictions on attorney speech, and to highlight provisions that might be vulnerable to a constitutional challenge...|$|E
40|$|Deeply {{rooted in}} Anglo-American Jurisprudence {{is the concept}} that when factual issues arise in an <b>adjudicatory</b> <b>proceeding</b> whether before a court or an {{administrative}} authority, they must be tried impartially i. e. without any interest or bias. Impartiality is essential not only for safeguarding the rights, liberty and property of citizens, but also for maintaining {{their faith in the}} due administration of justice. The rule that "no man shall be a Judge in his own cause"' is a fundamental principle of natural justice and has become the rule against interest and bias. Once it was regarded as immutable, universal and even as being supreme over statute law. Now it is considered as no more than a principle of common law applied in the interpretation of statutes which often authorities or Parliament Itself will try to exclude whenever it frustrates their wishes. English Judges try to uphold this rule by means of prerogative writs and private-law remedies, though the effectiveness of these is limited by technicalities and procedural difficulties. Further, the Judges are powerless when the legislature denies the rule. On the other hand, the Americans who inherited this principle as a part of English common law have preserved its supremacy through their Constitution. Building upon the "due process" concept and strengthened by particular statutes, the American courts have constructed an important edifice of Impartiality. Their statutory procedure and guidelines for disqualification and comprehensive judicial review have added a strength and character to the concept distinct from English law. Despite these differences, English and American courts are producing substantially similar results. The basic principle is the same, the limitations upon it are similar but American procedures are more formalised, and more effective. For the proper development of English law, the existing remedies should be reformed and the introduction of disqualifying statutes on the American model should be considered...|$|E
