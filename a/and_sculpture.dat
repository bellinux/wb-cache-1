5|$|After the war, Raymond's {{practice}} with Tuttle, Seelye and Place was dissolved. He formed {{a new company}} with Slovak architect, Ladislav Leland Rado (1909–1993), and named it Raymond & Rado. Although this company lasted until Raymond's death in 1976, they practised apart, with Rado in the New York office and Raymond in Tokyo. Whilst Raymond explored pottery <b>and</b> <b>sculpture</b> (making friends with Tarō Okamoto and Ade Bethune), Rado pursued an orthogonal rationalism that Raymond would eventually distance himself from.|$|E

5|$|During {{their first}} three appearances, the art {{competitions}} were grouped into five broad categories: architecture, literature, music, painting, <b>and</b> <b>sculpture.</b> The Dutch Organizing Committee for the 1928 Summer Olympics split these into subcategories {{in the hopes}} of increasing participation. Although it was a successful strategy, the 1932 Summer Olympics eliminated several of these subcategories, which led to fewer entries in the broader categories. For the 1936 Summer Olympics, the German government proposed the addition of a film contest to the program, which was rejected.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus, {{the ancient}} Greek historian, {{documented}} women carrying large phallic shaped monuments and ornaments {{the size of}} a human body in villages in ancient Dionysia. On the island of Delos a pillar supports a colossal phallus, the symbol of Dionysus. Phallus reliefs on buildings on such sites are also believed to have been apotropaic devices to ward off evil. The elaborate use of phallic architecture <b>and</b> <b>sculpture</b> in ancient Greek society can also be seen in sites such as Nea Nikomedeia in northern Greece. Archaeologists excavating the ancient town discovered clay sculptures of plump women with phallic heads and folded arms.|$|E

She was awarded a scholarship for the Portland Sculpture Park on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England, by the Arts Council of Great Britain and the National Arts Council (NAC) in 1990. Together with the installation artist S. Chandrasekaran, she helped to transform an old limestone quarry into a sculpture park, creating a work called Flow through the Rocks. In 1993 she received sponsorship from the Singapore International Foundation to attend the International Painting <b>and</b> <b>Sculpture</b> Symposium in Gulbarga (Kalburgi) in Karnataka, India, and served on the NAC's Arts Resource Panel between 1993 and 1994.|$|E

5|$|North of the interchange, M-44 {{passes the}} Frederik Meijer Gardens <b>and</b> <b>Sculpture</b> Park and {{the campus of}} Cornerstone University. The area around the highway is mixed {{businesses}} and office parks north to Knapp Street, and then residential north of there. At Plainfield Avenue, M-44 meets Conn. M-44 and crosses the Grand River. M-44 turns eastward near {{the south side of}} Rockford and runs through suburban residential areas near Lake Bella Vista, Silver and Bostwick lakes. East of here, the environs transition to rural farmland and the highway crosses the Kent–Ionia county line between Grattan and Cooks Corners, where it meets M-91 west of Belding. The highway continues east through town, where it crosses the Flat River, and ends at M-66 north of Ionia.|$|E
5|$|The arts of {{manuscript}} illumination, metalworking <b>and</b> <b>sculpture</b> flourished {{and produced}} treasures {{such as the}} Book of Kells, ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses that still dot the island today. A mission founded in 563 on Iona by the Irish monk Saint Columba began a tradition of Irish missionary work that spread Celtic Christianity and learning to Scotland, England and the Frankish Empire on Continental Europe {{after the fall of}} Rome. These missions continued until the late Middle Ages, establishing monasteries and centres of learning, producing scholars such as Sedulius Scottus and Johannes Eriugena and exerting much influence in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known Irish {{graphic art}} <b>and</b> <b>sculpture</b> are Neolithic carvings found at {{sites such as}} Newgrange and is traced through Bronze age artefacts and the religious carvings and illuminated manuscripts of the medieval period. During {{the course of the}} 19th and 20th centuries, a strong tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as John Butler Yeats, William Orpen, Jack Yeats and Louis le Brocquy. Contemporary Irish visual artists of note include Sean Scully, Kevin Abosch, and Alice Maher.|$|E
