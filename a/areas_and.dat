40|$|This {{article focuses}} on learners’ {{understanding}} and their descriptions of the concepts of <b>area</b> <b>and</b> perimeter, how learners solve problems involving <b>area</b> <b>and</b> perimeter {{and the relationship between}} them and misconceptions, and the causes of these misconceptions as revealed by learners when solving these problems. A written test was administered to 30 learners and clinical interviews were conducted with three of these learners, selected based on their responses in the test. This article shows that learners lack a conceptual understanding of <b>area</b> <b>and</b> they do not know what a perimeter is. Learners also hold misconceptions about the relationship between <b>area</b> <b>and</b> perimeter. It appears that inadequate prior knowledge of <b>area</b> <b>and</b> perimeter is the root cause of these misconceptions.

5|$|Civil parishes {{in their}} modern sense {{date from the}} Local Government Act 1894, which {{abolished}} vestries; established elected parish councils in all rural parishes with more than 300 electors; grouped rural parishes into Rural Districts; and aligned parish boundaries with county and borough boundaries. Urban civil parishes continued to exist, and were generally coterminous with the Urban District, Municipal Borough or County Borough {{in which they were}} situated; many large towns contained a number of parishes, and these were usually merged into one. Parish councils were not formed in urban <b>areas,</b> <b>and</b> the only function of the parish was to elect guardians to Poor Law Unions; with the abolition of the Poor Law system in 1930 the parishes had only a nominal existence. The Local Government Act 1972 retained civil parishes in rural <b>areas,</b> <b>and</b> many former Urban Districts and Municipal Boroughs that were being abolished, were replaced by new successor parishes; urban areas that were considered too large to be single parishes became unparished areas.|$|E
