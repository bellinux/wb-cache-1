5|$|The rector {{is chosen}} by the {{governor}} of the State of São Paulo from a list of 3 candidates elected by the university's community, including students and administrative staff. Traditionally, the governor always selects the candidate with the largest number of votes, but it retains the power to choose a different one should it decide to do so. The rector serves for a term of 4 years before a new election is held, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be reelected in the following term. Zeferino Vaz was the first rector and held the position for 12 years until his mandatory retirement.|$|E
5|$|While Homer {{longs for}} his wife, Moe comes by the Simpsons' house to declare his {{interest}} in Marge, who turns him down. When Homer comes into the house with flowers he picked for Marge, Moe sees him and jumps out the window. Standing before her in rags, Homer professes his total and utter dependency on Marge, and she tells him {{that that is not}} a good thing, but Homer then makes his winning argument: he loves her, he needs her to love him, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> afford to ever lose her trust again or he will end up dead. Marge is won over and allows Homer to return to the house. The family is glad that he has returned, although Moe is less than thrilled.|$|E

If this mixture is within the flammable range, there is risk of ignition which would create fire and thermal radiation hazards.|$|E

Certain specifics, such as the Trinity and the Incarnation, are revealed in the teachings in the Scriptures <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> otherwise be deduced except by special revelation.|$|E
