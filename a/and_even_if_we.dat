500|$|The book {{caused a}} great deal of {{controversy}} among critics, with some calling it [...] "irresponsible", and saying it was [...] "determined to give offense" [...] and [...] "appears to endorse violence". One critic of the book wrote, [...] "The work rapidly becomes an apology for political terrorism and effectively advocates the assassination of the entire American New Right. While the reasons for such a vengeance motif are perhaps evident, can it really be countenanced? Are we still justified in referring to this as art? <b>And</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are, is there a point at which such invective (and such suggestions) become simply counterproductive?" ...|$|E

The conditions in which the urban poor and the professional people used to exist as independent social strata are virtually no longer present ...

2500|$|Succintly, PROUT {{acknowledges}} that the well-being of individuals lies {{in the development of}} the collective, and that the collective depends on the development of individuals [...] Therefore, in order to understand how a progressive society is to be achieved, Sarkar tries to analyze what it means for a human being to grow and develop. He concludes that physical and psychic development render little progress for a human being as they are subject to deterioration and decay. There are multifarious diseases that affect our body and mind, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> stay free of them, eventually time will turn all our physical and mental faculties of no use. Sarkar argues that the only aspect of human life that seems to be subject to no change overtime is it’s transcendental nature, the„supra-emotional values“ intrinsic to the human mind and which exacerbate human multilateral existence.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, in {{response}} to a fallacious news article deemed to slander the nation, Circassian activists ramped up efforts with the scheduling of a mass-protest against the ignorance of the Russian government and the Russian people of their rights in Karachaevo-Cherkessia. However, the government canceled the gathering, saying it would be banning any and all public gatherings for an indefinite period {{to prevent the spread of}} the H1N1 flu virus. However, the head of the Circassian youth movement, Timur Jujuev, said [...] "All the public markets continue working on a regular basis, so where is the emergency? We are going to organize the demonstration even if we will need to wear surgical masks <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> do not have a license from the government.

40|$|Given {{that many}} {{advanced}} democracies can {{claim to have}} moved into the era of valence rather than position politics, the study of leadership may well become a more explicit concern for political scientists across the world.

2500|$|On August 13, 2014, Seth M. Sherwood was {{announced}} {{to write the}} film, under the title Leatherface. On October 31, 2014, Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo were hired to direct the film, who admired its distinction in narrative from the series' previous installments: [...] "When we first received the script, of course it's not everyday {{that you have the}} opportunity to see Leatherface on the front page and we were very surprised, in a good way, that the script was taking a different path, and it's quite original." [...] Producer Whedon elucidated that the directors were chosen because their [...] "perfect vision" [...] and their [...] "edge to their storytelling". Upon signing on to the project, Maury and Bustillo requested rewrites, in which Sherwood gave his support. The general plot structure remained the same, though the directors wanted the screenplay to match their vision. Nearly every death sequence was altered and the ending, originally a mass murder involving Leatherface killing at least thirty people with his chainsaw, was changed, [...] "It was really over the top <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> like blood and gore, we were like, no, that’s not the character, we cannot do that." [...] In March and April 2015, Sam Strike, James Bloor, Stephen Dorff, and Jessica Madsen joined the cast, respectively. On May 5, 2015, Lili Taylor was publicised to replace Angela Bettis, who dropped out due to a scheduling conflict. The following day, Vanessa Grasse joined the cast to play Lizzy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} venture capital on a firm's innovation activities by using a data set of German technology-based firms founded between 1996 and 2005.

The results show that VC financing has a positive impact on both patenting <b>and</b> innovativeness, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> account for endogeneity of VC financing...|$|R

50|$|As a {{philosophical}} school or movement, skepticism originated in ancient Greece. A number Greek Sophists held skeptical views. Gorgias, for example, reputedly argued that nothing exists, that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> there were something we couldn’t know it, <b>and</b> that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could know it {{we could not}} communicate it. Another Sophist, Cratylus, refused to discuss anything and would merely wriggle his finger, claiming that communication is impossible since meanings are constantly changing. The Sophists’ leading critic, Socrates, also had skeptical tendencies, claiming that he knew nothing, or at least nothing worthwhile.|$|R
