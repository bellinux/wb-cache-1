5|$|Ruler 1 is {{depicted}} {{on a couple}} of Early Classic monuments, the better preserved of which is an altar that dates to 514. <b>A</b> <b>ruler</b> known as Jaguar Bird Peccary is represented on a 6th-century stela, which describes him acceding to the throne in 568.|$|E
5|$|Stela 7 {{stands to}} the north of stelae5 and 6. It is in a {{reasonable}} state of preservation and bears the image of <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> dressed as a ballplayer. This monument was probably dedicated in AD 780, although it records the accession of a king of Seibal in AD 771.|$|E
5|$|The first {{church in}} the area was reputedly {{established}} in the 6th century by Elaeth, or Eleth. He was <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> from northern Britain who fled to Anglesey in north Wales when ousted from power, settling at St Seiriol's monastery at Penmon.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> Golomb <b>ruler</b> is <b>a</b> sparse <b>ruler</b> that {{requires}} {{all of the}} differences [...] be distinct. In general, <b>a</b> Golomb <b>ruler</b> with [...] marks will be considerably longer than <b>an</b> optimal sparse <b>ruler</b> with [...] marks, since [...] is a lower bound {{for the length of}} <b>a</b> Golomb <b>ruler.</b> <b>A</b> long Golomb <b>ruler</b> will have gaps, that is, it will have distances which it cannot measure. For example, the optimal Golomb ruler {0, 1, 4, 10, 12, 17} has length 17, but cannot measure lengths of 14 or 15.|$|R

5|$|The small seated {{statue of}} Menkauhor wearing the robe of the Sed festival might suggest a longer reign, since this festival was {{typically}} celebrated only after <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> had spent 30 {{years on the}} throne. However, Egyptologist Hartwig Altenmüller deems this hypothesis unlikely.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deaths}} of Ivan IV and in 1598 of his son Feodor, the last tsars of the Rurik Dynasty, Russia entered a period of severe dynastic, {{economic}} and social crisis and instability. As Boris Godunov encountered resistance from both the peasant masses and the boyar opposition, in the Commonwealth the ideas of turning Russia into a subordinated ally, either through a union, or an imposition of <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> dependent on the Polish–Lithuanian establishment, were rapidly coming into play.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> {{of modest}} {{historical}} significance, Marko {{became a major}} character in South Slavic oral tradition. He is venerated as a national hero by the Serbs, Macedonians and Bulgarians, remembered in Balkan folklore as a fearless and powerful protector of the weak, who fought against injustice and confronted the Turks during the Ottoman occupation.|$|E

5|$|He {{died after}} 22 years as <b>a</b> <b>ruler,</b> due to illness and old age. His {{coat of arms}} was {{represented}} by three black pears against a golden background.

5|$|In 'Empire Mode,' {{the player}} can choose <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> for their forces, {{along with two}} main generals. Three minor lieutenants can also be chosen for support. In battle, the capture of enemy {{officers}} is possible by lowering their morale and defeating them. If, {{at the end of}} the battle, the player is victorious, it is possible to hire the captured officer or, alternatively, release them.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{consider}} this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours {{such as those}} concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight the hypocrisy of <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court. Nevertheless, the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries.|$|E

5|$|Monument 3 {{is broken}} into various fragments, five {{of which were}} {{recovered}} from various locations in Ocosingo and Toniná {{through the course of}} the 20th century and most of which were reunited in the Toniná site museum. Aside from being broken, the stela is largely complete and only lightly eroded, it is a statue of <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> with inscriptions describing the accession of K'inich Baaknal Chaak and the promotion to the priesthood of Aj Ch'aaj Naah.|$|E
5|$|The inner portion {{contained}} {{the arms of}} Sancho I, {{although the number of}} bezants varied between seven, eleven and sixteen (the latter number was used on Afonso's personal standard while he was still Count of Boulogne). This same design was used by the Portuguese kings {{until the end of the}} first dynasty, in 1383; a succession crisis put the country at war with Castile and left it without <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> for two years.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from exile, Æthelbald of Mercia succeeded Coelred and afterwards endowed {{the church at}} Crowland. Ælfwald's friendly stance towards Æthelbald helped to maintain peaceful relations with his more powerful neighbour. The Life of Guthlac, which includes information about Æthelbald during his period of exile at Crowland, is dedicated to Ælfwald. Later versions of the Life reveal the high quality of written Old English produced in East Anglia during Ælfwald's reign. He was a literate and devoutly Christian king: his letter written to Boniface in around 747 reveals his diplomatic skills and gives a rare glimpse {{into the life of}} <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> who is otherwise shrouded in obscurity.|$|E
5000|$|At its simplest, each {{number to}} be multiplied is {{represented}} by a length on <b>a</b> sliding <b>ruler.</b> <b>As</b> the <b>rulers</b> each have <b>a</b> logarithmic scale, {{it is possible to}} align them to read the sum of the logarithms, and hence calculate the product, of the two numbers.|$|R

5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Goldman {{moved with}} her family to the Prussian city of Königsberg (then part of the German Empire), and she {{enrolled}} in a Realschule. One teacher punished disobedient students—targeting Goldman in particular—by beating their hands with <b>a</b> <b>ruler.</b> Another teacher tried to molest his female students and was fired when Goldman fought back. She found a sympathetic mentor in her German-language teacher, who loaned her books and took her to an opera. A passionate student, Goldman passed the exam for admission into a gymnasium, but her religion teacher refused to provide a certificate of good behavior and {{she was unable to}} attend.|$|E
5|$|In 934 Æthelstan invaded Scotland. His {{reasons are}} unclear, and historians give {{alternative}} explanations. The {{death of his}} half-brother Edwin in 933 might have finally removed factions in Wessex opposed to his rule. Guthfrith, the Norse king of Dublin who had briefly ruled Northumbria, died in 934; any resulting insecurity among the Danes would have given Æthelstan an opportunity to stamp his authority on the north. An entry in the Annals of Clonmacnoise, recording the death in 934 of <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> who was possibly Ealdred of Bamburgh, suggests another possible explanation. This points to a dispute between Æthelstan and Constantine over control of his territory. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle briefly recorded the expedition without explanation, but the twelfth-century chronicler John of Worcester stated that Constantine had broken his treaty with Æthelstan.|$|E
50|$|Oedipus at Colonus {{suggests}} that, {{in breaking}} divine law, <b>a</b> <b>ruler’s</b> limited understanding may {{lead him to}} believe himself fully innocent; however, his lack of awareness {{does not change the}} objective fact of his guilt.|$|R
50|$|Chinese civilians greatly {{supported}} King Wu's rebellion. In legend, Di Xin, initially, {{had been}} <b>a</b> good <b>ruler.</b> But after he married Daji, he became <b>a</b> ruthless <b>ruler.</b> Many {{called for the}} end of the Shang dynasty.|$|R

5|$|In {{the battles}} of Modrica and Meçad 7,000 Ottoman forces were left {{dead on the}} {{battlefield}} along with thousands of horses. The Albanians had suffered 1,000 casualties themselves and, in their exhaustion, they refused to pursue the fleeing Ottoman forces. Hamza Pasha and his staff were ransomed to the sultan. Raimon d'Ortafà reported Skanderbeg's victory to Alfonso who received it with great exuberance. Skanderbeg's victory over <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> even more powerful than Murad came as a great surprise to the Albanians. Skanderbeg's reputation among his allies was redeemed and the Dukagjini opted for a reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northwest}} corner of the Khilawat Khana stands the Kala Burj ("Black Pavilion"). The pavilion is the most significant of the Jahangir-era additions to the Lahore Fort. The vaulted ceilings in the pavilion feature paintings in a European-influenced style of angels which symbolize the virtuosity of King Solomon, who is regarded as the ideal ruler in the Quran, and <b>a</b> <b>ruler</b> with whom Jahangir identified. Angels directing djinns are also painted on tiles in the ceiling, which also reference King Solomon. Kala Burj was used as a summer pavilion.|$|E
5|$|Many factors {{contributed to}} the Song's {{repeated}} military blunders and subsequent loss of northern China to the Jurchens. Traditional accounts of Song history held the venality of Huizong's imperial court responsible for {{the decline of the}} dynasty. These narratives condemned Huizong and his officials for their moral failures. Early Song emperors were eager to enact political reforms and revive the ethical framework of Confucianism, but the enthusiasm for reforms gradually died after the reformist Wang Anshi's expulsion as chancellor in 1076. Corruption marred the reign of Huizong, who was more skilled as a painter than as <b>a</b> <b>ruler.</b> Huizong was known for his extravagance, and funded the costly construction of gardens and temples while rebellions threatened the state's grip on power.|$|E
50|$|The {{division}} reflected an {{adherence to}} the old Frankish custom of partible or divisible inheritance amongst <b>a</b> <b>ruler's</b> sons, rather than primogeniture (i.e., inheritance by the eldest son) which would soon be adopted by both Frankish kingdoms.|$|R
