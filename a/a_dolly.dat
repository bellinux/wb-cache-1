5|$|A common {{plot device}} is referenced, where a {{shoulder}} angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, {{as both the}} devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, <b>a</b> <b>dolly</b> zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used {{to show that a}} character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking up at his head as it floats over them).|$|E
5|$|The episodes took {{seventeen}} days to film, where normally crew {{are given}} eight days to film a week's worth of episodes. Between forty and forty-five members of crew were required for filming the fire episode, including assistant directors, a design department, cameras, lighting, sound, make up, costume, visual effects, fire safety officers and a stunt team {{consisting of a}} stunt co-ordinator and stunt doubles. Filming was done with four television cameras, a steadicam and <b>a</b> <b>dolly.</b> The exterior fire scenes were filmed first, in five night shoots lasting until 4a.m., and the real exterior set was burnt. Safety was the top priority for the fire scenes, and fire safety advisors ensured all cast and crew were protected. Stunt doubles wore flame-proof gel on their faces and for the scene where Ryan and Stacey fall from the ladder, several layers of cardboard boxes were stacked {{on the ground for}} the stunt doubles to fall onto. For filming the final explosion scene, all the actors whose characters were involved were filmed separately for their reactions. The explosion had to be delayed due to a power failure at Elstree Studios, two minutes before the explosion was due to be set off, which also affected a live broadcast of Big Brother. The power cut lasted two hours and filming was further delayed due to rain. The explosion was completed in a third take. Despite the delay, the scenes were completed on schedule. Salisbury noted that the demise of such an iconic set as The Queen Victoria left several cast members in tears.|$|E
25|$|The Weihe is {{of wooden}} {{construction}} with fabric covering {{on the wing}} trailing edges and the control surfaces. The spar is built from Baltic Pine, with a birch leading edge D-box, the fuselage and the fixed portions of the tail surfaces. The airfoil is a modified Gö 549-M.2 section. Early versions took off from <b>a</b> <b>dolly</b> and landed on a fixed skid, while later versions has a fixed wheel and skid undercarriage. Originally fitted with DFS-style airbrakes, some were later modified for Schempp-Hirth style brakes instead. The aircraft incorporates a unique rigging system which was widely copied in later gliders.|$|E

25|$|Vertigo {{contains}} a camera technique developed by Irmin Roberts {{that has been}} copied many times by filmmakers {{commonly referred to as}} <b>a</b> <b>dolly</b> zoom. It was premiered in the San Sebastián International Film Festival, where Hitchcock won a Silver Seashell. Vertigo is considered a classic today, but it met with some negative reviews and poor box office receipts upon its release, and was the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock. Its critical reputation grew. In the 2002 Sight & Sound polls, it ranked just behind Citizen Kane (1941); ten years later, in the same magazine, it was voted by critics as the best film ever made. By this time, Hitchcock had filmed {{in many areas of the}} U.S.|$|E
500|$|President Richard Nixon was aboard Hornet to {{personally}} welcome the astronauts back to Earth. He told the astronauts, [...] "As {{a result of}} what you've done, the world has never been closer together before." [...] After Nixon departed, the Hornet was brought alongside the five-ton Command Module where it was placed aboard by the ship's crane, placed on <b>a</b> <b>dolly</b> and moved next to the MQF. The Hornet sailed for Pearl Harbor where Columbia and the MQF were airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center.|$|E
500|$|The use of film, {{rather than}} digital, cameras {{added to the}} [...] "old-fashioned" [...] nature of the production. Two main Panavision cameras, a {{high-speed}} Arri 435 camera capable of shooting at 150 frames per second, a Steadicam, and VistaVision cameras for visual effect shots were among the equipment used to bring the book to the big screen. As {{with the use of}} specific colors, the different cameras and shooting setups would help serve the story points. When Bella was with Edward, the camera was moved on <b>a</b> <b>dolly,</b> in a very rigid, straight line to reflect how their relationship was [...] "perfect". When Bella is with Jacob, the Steadicam provided a fluid and organic style; and when she is with her schoolmates, a slangy visual language was reflected by a handheld.|$|E

500|$|Soderbergh {{shot the}} films {{back-to-back}} {{in the beginning}} of July 2007 with Guerrilla shot first in Spain for 39 days and The Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days. The director conceived The Argentine as [...] "a Hollywood movie" [...] shot in widescreen 'scope aspect ratio, with the camera either fixed or moving on <b>a</b> <b>dolly</b> or a Steadicam. Guerrilla was shot, according to Soderbergh, [...] "in Super-16, 1.85:1. No dollies, no cranes, it's all either handheld or tripods. I want it to look nice but simple. We'll work with a very small group: basically me, the producer Gregory Jacobs and the unit production manager". According to the director, the portion set in Cuba was written from the victor's perspective and as a result he adopted a more traditional look with classical compositions, vibrant color and a warm palette. With Guerrilla, he wanted a sense of foreboding with hand-held camerawork and a muted color palette. Soderbergh told his production designer Antxon Gomez that the first part would have green with a lot of yellow in it and the second part would have green with a lot of blue in it.|$|E
500|$|Spock's {{death was}} shot over three days, during which no {{visitors}} were allowed on set. Spock's death {{was to be}} irrevocable, but Nimoy had such a positive experience during filming that he {{asked if he could}} add a way for Spock to return in a later film. The mind meld sequence was initially filmed without Kelley's prior knowledge of what was going on. Shatner disagreed with having a clear glass separation between Spock and Kirk during the death scene; he instead wanted a translucent divider allowing viewers to see only Spock's silhouette, but his objection was overruled. During Spock's funeral sequence Meyer wanted the camera to track the torpedo that served as Spock's coffin as it was placed in a long trough and slid into the launcher. The camera crew thought the entire set would have to be rebuilt to accommodate the shot, but Sallin suggested putting <b>a</b> <b>dolly</b> into the trough and controlling it from above with an offset arm. Scott's rendition of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] on the bagpipes was James Doohan's idea. Kathleen Nicholson Graham recorded the bagpipes music at Paramount Studio with the orchestra.|$|E
500|$|Captain America: Civil War was {{the first}} film to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras, made in {{partnership}} with Arri, which was a customized version of the Arri Alexa 65. According to Joe Russo, approximately fifteen minutes of the film, the sequence where the two factions fight at Leipzig/Halle Airport, which was described as having [...] "incredible scale to it" [...] and referred to by the directors as the [...] "splash panel", were shot with the cameras. Opaloch noted that there were discussions late in pre-production to shoot the entire film with the Alexa 65 cameras. However, because of how close {{it was to the}} start of shooting as well as the idea being [...] "such a large-scale undertaking", it was decided to only use them for the airport sequence, with the rest of film being shot on Arri Alexa XT digital cameras. For the airport sequence, Opaloch rigged the Alexa 65s to a Technocrane, a Steadicam, <b>a</b> <b>dolly</b> as well as a drone for flyover shots, which had its own dedicated team operating it. Because of the amount of resolution the Aleax 65s offered, Opaloch chose to use medium close-ups instead of close-ups, and for his wide shots, hold the shot a bit longer, [...] "maybe with a slight camera move that allows the viewer to take it all in." ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{effects were}} {{achieved}} {{in ways that}} are not immediately obvious. In one scene, a supernatural force pushes against the parlor door and bends it inward repeatedly. Though the door appears to some viewers to have been made of latex, it was in fact made of laminated wood (with a strong crew member pushing a piece of timber hard against the door). Two physical effects were used to make the spiral staircase in the library appear frightening. In one scene, the camera appears to ascend the staircase at a rapid rate. However, the point of view is backward, looking down the staircase, as the camera used the staircase's handrail as <b>a</b> <b>dolly</b> track, being lowered slowly by means of a wire. When the sequence was run in reverse at high speed, the effect was frightening. In another scene, the staircase appears to become unstable and give way as Luke Sanderson ascends it. Later, Eleanor goes up the staircase in a trance-like state. She is rescued by Dr. Markway, even as the staircase seems ready to collapse. The collapsing staircase effect was designed by a metalworker at the Borehamwood studios. The effect was created by tying portions of the steps and railing to a cable that ran inside the staircase's central pole. When the cable was slackened, these elements moved freely. [...] When tightened, the staircase appeared solid and stable. The effect was so disturbing to the cast that Robert Wise had to ascend the staircase while it was shaking in order to prove it was safe. Other effects also relied on simple cinema tricks. Early in the film, the audience sees Abigail Crain lying in bed, aging from a young child to an old woman. A camera was fixed over the bed, and four different actresses (each a different age) posed in the bed beneath the camera. Dissolves were used to show the aging process. In another scene, the characters come across a [...] "cold spot" [...] in the haunted mansion. To show the physical effect on the characters, the makeup department applied special makeup to the characters that appeared invisible in normal light. To show the effect of cold on the skin, filters were gradually drawn over the lights on the set, revealing the [...] "cold effect" [...] makeup.|$|E
2500|$|Actress Catherine Deneuve has {{provided}} another anecdote illustrating {{this aspect of}} Buñuel's style: while shooting Tristana, {{he had told her}} frequently of the distaste he felt for the [...] "touristy" [...] side of Toledo, where the film was made, so she teased him about one crane shot that brought out the beauty of the surrounding landscape, to which Buñuel responded by re-shooting the entire scene from <b>a</b> <b>dolly</b> with no background whatsoever, all the while inveighing against the [...] "obviously" [...] beautiful.|$|E
2500|$|The filmmaker would paradoxically retain his static {{compositions}} {{even when}} a character was shown walking or riding, by moving the camera with <b>a</b> <b>dolly</b> at the precise speed at which the actor or actors moved. He would drive his devoted cameraman, Yuharu Atsuta, to tears by insisting that actors and technicians count their steps precisely during a tracking shot so that the movements of actors and camera could be synchronized. Speaking of the bicycle ride to the beach early in the story, Peña notes: [...] "It’s almost as if Noriko [...] doesn’t seem to be moving, or Hattori’s not moving because his place within the frame remains constant… These are the sort of visual idiosyncrasies that make Ozu’s style so interesting and so unique in a way, to give us movement {{and at the same}} time to undercut movement." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a street gang of {{children}} who terrorize their impoverished neighborhood, at one point brutalizing a blind man and at another assaulting a legless man who moves around on <b>a</b> <b>dolly,</b> which they toss down a hill. [...] Film historian Carl J. Mora has said of Los olvidados that the director: [...] "visualized poverty in a radically different way from the traditional forms of Mexican melodrama. [...] Buñuel's street children are not 'ennobled' by their desperate struggle for survival; they are in fact ruthless predators who are not better than their equally unromanticized victims". [...] The film was made quickly (18 days) and cheaply (450,000 pesos), with Buñuel's fee being the equivalent of $2,000. [...] During filming, a number of members of the crew resisted the production in a variety of ways: [...] one technician confronted Buñuel and asked why he didn't make a [...] "real" [...] Mexican movie [...] "rather than a miserable picture like this one", the film's hairdresser quit on the spot over a scene in which the protagonist's mother refuses to give him food ("In Mexico, no mother would say that to her son."), another staff member urged Buñuel to abandon shooting on a [...] "garbage heap", noting that there were many [...] "lovely residential neighborhoods like Las Lomas" [...] that were available, while Pedro de Urdimalas, one of the scriptwriters, refused to allow his name in the credits.|$|E
