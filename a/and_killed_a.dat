A sizable force was sent out from Sparta to challenge this force. The forces {{met at the}} dry bed of the Nemea River, in Corinthian territory, where the Spartans won a decisive victory. As often happened in hoplite battles, the right flank of each army was victorious, with the Spartans defeating the Athenians while the Thebans, Argives, and Corinthians defeated the various Peloponnesians opposite them; the Spartans then attacked <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> number of Argives, Corinthians, and Thebans as these troops returned from pursuing the defeated Peloponnesians.

5|$|At 17:00 on 24 September, as Puller's men {{hiked up}} the {{northeast}} slope of Mount Austen, they surprised <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> bivouac of 16 Japanese soldiers. The {{noise from the}} skirmish alerted several companies of Oka's Maizuru Battalion, who were emplaced nearby. The Maizuru troops quickly attacked Puller's Marines, who took cover and returned fire. Acting on Oka's orders, the Japanese slowly disengaged while withdrawing towards the Matanikau River, and the engagement was over by nightfall. The Marines counted 30 dead Japanese and had suffered 13 dead and 25 wounded. Puller radioed headquarters and requested help to evacuate the wounded. Vandegrift replied that he would send the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (2/5) as reinforcements the next day.|$|E

5|$|Estes' {{organization}} {{attracted a}} $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> suspect {{who turned out to be}} a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E

5|$|In Mexico, Kinne and her {{traveling}} companion, Francis Puglise, {{were soon}} {{caught up in}} another criminal case when Kinne, claiming to have been acting in self-defense, shot <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> Mexican-born American citizen named Francisco Parades Ordoñez, who she claimed attempted to rape her. Ordonez {{was shot in the}} back. An employee of the hotel in which the shooting occurred, responding to the sound of gunshots, was also wounded but survived. Investigation into the shootings showed that Ordoñez was shot with the same weapon that killed Patricia Jones. Kinne was convicted in October 1965 of the Mexican crimes and sentenced to ten years in prison, later lengthened to thirteen years after judicial review. Kinne escaped from the Mexican prison during a blackout in December 1969. Despite extensive manhunts, her whereabouts are unknown.|$|E

5|$|Since then Kasahara has {{proposed}} a definition between these two. He agrees with Hata that Chinese soldiers actively engaged in combat were not massacre victims, but he also includes in his definition of the massacre any Chinese soldiers who were killed on the battlefield but not actively resisting, noting that many confrontations between the Chinese and Japanese Armies were more like one-sided slaughters than battles. For instance, after routing the Chinese in Nanking, Japanese soldiers fired upon <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> large number of Chinese soldiers who were attempting to escape the battlefield by swimming across the Yangtze River. Many historians including Kasahara view incidents like these where the Japanese fired upon retreating troops to be atrocities, whereas Hata sees them as extensions of combat and not massacres.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of wind shear and low-level helicity produced moderate convection across central Florida {{in association with}} the precursor low pressure system. Late on September20, a supercell developed near Lake Apopka, and tracking quickly northward it spawned an EF1 tornado near Eustis; the tornado tracked for 1.83mi (2.94km) and reached winds of about 100mph (160km/h). The tornado destroyed 20homes, left 30others severely damaged, injured one person, and caused power outages for about 300people. Damage totaled $6.2million (2007USD). Tornadoes were also reported near Marianna and Chipley. The precursor low pressure system also generated lightning that stuck <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> man in Hendry County, Florida.|$|E

5|$|A celebration {{broke out}} among the miners, who broke into liquor {{warehouses}} and saloons. That night, some of the miners loaded a flatcar with dynamite and attempted to roll it toward the deputies' camp. It overturned short of its goal <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> cow. Other miners wanted to blow up every mine in the region, but Johnson quickly discouraged them. Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a work train and steamed into Victor.

The miners subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who had been present when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 2,254houses were flooded in the country, forcing {{thousands}} of people to evacuate. Overall, 2,694houses were damaged, and another 12 were destroyed. Many houses lost their roofs, and high winds left 608,130buildings without power in Honshu, along with thousands of power on Hokkaido. Two people were electrocuted by downed power lines. High rainfall caused mudslides near Tokyo, which destroyed a few buildings, and caused the Tama River to reach above-normal levels. Across Japan, the typhoon disrupted transportation by forcing highways to be closed. Storm debris injured several people, and a steel window frame struck <b>and</b> <b>killed</b> <b>a</b> man in Yokohama. A tree fell onto a car, injuring one person.
