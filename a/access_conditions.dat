50|$|Catch {{shares have}} been {{proposed}} as a potential solution for the common property challenges found in many fisheries and have typically been implemented after {{a variety of other}} approaches have failed. Most commercial fisheries begin under open <b>access</b> <b>conditions</b> in which any fisherman is able to enter the fishery, put in effort, and catch fish. However, if fish biomass is no longer able to sustain the amount of fishing effort exerted in the fishery, populations begin to decline, and fishing becomes less profitable. Conventional management systems tend to respond using input controls such as limiting the number of entrants to the fishery, restricting boat and gear capacity, limiting the number of days at sea, and applying catch allowances per trip. However, studies show that the approaches are sometimes ineffective in controlling overall harvest, and managers often implement additional effort-based regulations, output controls, to set strict fishery catch limits. Although catch limits have proven sufficient to sustain a fishery, the management approaches alone do not fundamentally eliminate the incentive for fishermen to compete and increase their share of the catch, which can lead to reduced fishery profitability and dangerous fishing conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The Nollans owned beachfront {{property}} in Ventura County, and wished {{to replace a}} 504 sq ft bungalow which had fallen into disrepair with a 2500 sq ft house. As a condition for permits to do so, the California Coastal Commission required that the Nollans dedicate for 20 years a strip of land along the beach {{in front of their}} house to allow the public the right of pass and re-pass along the beach (to be enacted only when a public agency agreed to accept management of the ambulatory lateral-access easement). 43 neighbors had granted such easements without litigation; the Nollans, however, believed that the demand was an unconstitutional taking of their property without just compensation, and filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus asking the Ventura County Superior Court to invalidate the easement stipulation. The CCC argued that the new house would increase blockage of the ocean view and contribute to a “wall of residential structures” which would prevent the public “psychologically from realizing a stretch of coastline exists nearby that they have every right to visit". The Nollans could offset this burden to the public, the CCC argued, by providing additional access to the beach {{in the form of a}} dedicated access easement along the beachfront side of their property. The Superior Court ruled in favor of the Nollans, declaring “the Commission could impose <b>access</b> <b>conditions</b> on development permits for replacement homes only where the proposed development would have an adverse impact on public access to the sea, and this requirement was not met" [...] (Mandelker 124).|$|E
40|$|Snakes and spiders {{constitute}} fear-relevant stimuli for humans, as {{many species}} have deleterious and even fatal effects. However, snakes provoked an older and thus stronger evolutionary pressure than spiders, shaping {{the vision of}} earliest primates toward preferential visual processing, mainly in the most complex perceptual conditions. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, no study has yet directly assessed the role of ecologically-relevant stimuli in preferentially accessing visual awareness. Using continuous flash suppression (CFS), the present study assessed the role of evolutionary pressure in gaining a preferential access to visual awareness. For this purpose, we measured the time needed for three types of stimuli - snakes, spiders (matched with snakes for rated fear levels, but for which an influence on humans but not other primates is well grounded) and birds - to break the suppression and enter visual awareness in two different suppression intensity conditions. The results showed that in the less demanding awareness <b>access</b> <b>condition</b> (stimuli presented to the participants' dominant eye) both evolutionarily relevant stimuli (snakes and spiders) showed a faster entry into visual awareness than birds, whereas in the most demanding awareness <b>access</b> <b>condition</b> (stimuli presented to the participants' non-dominant eye) only snakes showed this privileged access. Our data suggest that the privileged unconscious processing of snakes in the most complex perceptual conditions extends to visual awareness, corroborating the proposed influence of snakes in primate visual evolution. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

5000|$|Environmentalists cry foul {{over this}} provision, stating that various laws {{are bound to}} be {{violated}} if the agreement pushes through. Under the Constitution alone, it is imperative that the State promotes the people's right to health (Article II, Section 15), and right to a balanced and healthful ecology (Article II, Section 16). Other laws that may be violated include Republic Act No. 6969 (Toxic Substance and Hazardous and Nuclear Waste Act of 1990) which prohibits the entry of hazardous wastes into and their disposal within the country for whatever purpose, and Republic Act No. 4653 (An Act to Safeguard the Health of the People and Maintain the Dignity of the Nation by Declaring it a National Policy to Prohibit the Commercial Importation of Textile Articles Commonly Known as Used Clothing and Rags) wherein worn clothing and other worn articles, used or new rags, scrap twine, cordage, rope and cables and worn out articles of twine, cordage, rope or cables, of textile materials are also prohibited from being imported into the Philippines. Aside from local laws, one international treaty is also said to be a direct contradiction to the JPEPA. The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was ratified in 1989 by 133 countries and is currently adopted by 170 countries, including Japan and the Philippines. It is the most comprehensive global environmental treaty on hazardous and other wastes, addressing cleaner production, hazardous waste minimization and controls on the movement of these wastes. One of the main concerns regarding JPEPA is the possibility of having Japan export their waste products and hazardous materials to the Philippines. Such products are included in Article 29 of the agreement, which defines [...] "originating goods. Under Article 18 of the agreement, both Japan and the Philippines shall either [...] "reduce or eliminate its customs duties eliminate other duties or charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with the importation and take part in [...] "improving market <b>access</b> <b>conditions</b> for originating goods.|$|E

40|$|One {{consequence}} of the proliferation of preferential trade agreements is that an increasing share of international trade {{is not subject to}} most favored nation tariffs, but rather enters markets through preferential access. The objective {{of this paper is to}} better investigate to what extent preferential market access affects bilateral trade. In doing so, the paper first provides two indices of market <b>access</b> <b>conditions</b> that take into account the complex structure of tariff preferences. One index summarizes direct market <b>access</b> <b>conditions</b> (the overall tariff faced by exports), while the other measures relative market <b>access</b> <b>conditions</b> (the overall tariff faced by exports relative to that faced by foreign competitors). Then, the paper explores the effects of preferential access on international trade by estimating a gravity model augmented by the two indices. The results indicate that both direct and relative market <b>access</b> <b>conditions</b> affect bilateral trade. Although a large majority of countries benefits from the system of preference because of improved direct market access, some countries see part of their benefits eroded, sometimes substantially, by the deterioration in their relative market <b>access</b> <b>conditions.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{memory for}} goals model (Altmann & Trafton, 2002) posits the {{importance}} of a short delay (the ‘interruption lag’) before an interrupting task to encode suspended goals for retrieval post-interruption. Two experiments used the theory of soft constraints (Gray, Simms, Fu & Schoelles, 2006) to investigate whether the efficacy of an interruption lag could be improved by increasing goal-state access cost to induce a more memory-based encoding strategy. Both experiments used a copying task with three <b>access</b> cost <b>conditions</b> (Low, Medium, and High) and a 5 -s interruption lag with a no lag control condition. Experiment 1 found that the participants in the High <b>access</b> cost <b>condition</b> resumed more interrupted trials and executed more actions correctly from memory when coupled with an interruption lag. Experiment 2 used a prospective memory test post-interruption and an eyetracker recorded gaze activity during the interruption lag. The participants in the High <b>access</b> cost <b>condition</b> with an interruption lag were best at encoding target information during the interruption lag, evidenced by higher scores on the prospective memory measure and more gaze activity on the goal-state during the interruption lag. Theoretical and practical issues regarding the use of goal-state access cost and an interruption lag are discussed...|$|R
