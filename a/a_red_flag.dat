This new flag gained formal legal status replacing the blue ensign at the handover on 1 July 1997.|$|E

5|$|The {{revolution}} in November 1918 led in Württemberg, like everywhere in Germany, {{to the end}} of the monarchy. King William II left Stuttgart on 9November, shortly after a revolutionary crowd had stormed his residence, the Wilhelm Palais and flown <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> above the building. On the very same day the demonstrators were also able to seize some of Stuttgart's barracks, where parts of the garrisons openly joined them. Rau took active part in the events in Stuttgart's streets on this and the following day.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{was again}} fastest in third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, narrowly ahead of Hamilton's Mercedes. Before all drivers {{were able to}} set times on the super-soft tyres, Fernando Alonso coming to {{a stop on the}} start/finish straight brought out <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>flag,</b> halting the session. When practice resumed, rain had started to fall, preventing the drivers from improving on their times. Only Force India driver Sergio Pérez set a lap on the faster tyre compound, ending up fourth in the session.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} various small incidents, three major {{accidents}} led to <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> for the session. The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry, driven by Guillaume Moreau, went {{off at the}} Porsche Curves during the second hour. The car could {{not return to the}} test session due a bent chassis caused by the heavy impact. The second red flag involved the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry going off the track at the same location in the hands of Vitaly Petrov, becoming briefly airborne after contact with the concrete wall. In the final incident, almost in the last hour of the session, the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also went off at the Porsche Curves, and briefly caught fire.|$|E

5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close proximity of the cages increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>flag.</b> Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E

The session saw several incidents: Bottas damaged the floor of his car when he ran over a drain cover on his installation lap and was forced to miss the rest of the session; Felipe Massa made contact with the wall, but was later able to rejoin practice; Räikkönen's track time was limited as well due to a loss of power; and <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> period occurred right after the chequered flag fell as Pérez crashed at turn 15.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of being}} coursed on open land, the Irish form is {{run in a}} secure {{enclosure}} over a set distance. Since 1993, Irish Coursing Club rules have made it compulsory for the greyhounds to be muzzled while they chase the hare. After the coursing event, the hares are transported {{back to where they}} were netted and re-released into the wild. Whereas the UK form of coursing was run with dogs winning points for their running and turning of the hare, the Republic of Ireland form is run on the basis that the first dog to turn the hare wins. This is denoted by either <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> or a white flag, indicating the colours of the respective dogs' collars.|$|E

5|$|Several Muslim {{countries}} {{along the}} south coast of the Mediterranean Sea used <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> similar to {{the flag of the}} Ottoman Empire. After the destruction of the Tunisian naval division at the Battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827, the sovereign Husainid Dynasty leader Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud decided to create a flag to use for the fleet of Tunisia, to distinguish it from other fleets. There are some discrepancies over the date of the flag's adoption, as the government states that it was adopted in 1831, while other sources like Siobhan Ryan's Ultimate Pocket Flags of the World claim that it was adopted in 1835.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of certain signs, termed red flags, indicate {{the need for}} further testing to look for more serious underlying problems, which may require immediate or specific treatment. The {{presence of}} <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> does not mean that there is a significant problem. It is only suggestive, and most people with red flags have no serious underlying problem. If no red flags are present, performing diagnostic imaging or laboratory testing in the first four weeks after the start of the symptoms has not been shown to be useful.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} Parnell's speech in Ennis, a process server and {{seventeen}} {{members of the}} Royal Irish Constabulary began the attempt to serve Boycott's eviction notices. Legally, {{they had to be}} delivered {{to the head of the}} household or his spouse within a certain time period. The process server successfully delivered notices to three of the tenants, but a fourth, Mrs Fitzmorris, refused to accept the notice and began waving <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> to alert other tenants that the notices were being served. The women of the area descended on the process server and the constabulary, and began throwing stones, mud, and manure at them, succeeding in driving them away to seek refuge in Lough Mask House.|$|E

5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>flag.</b> Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E
5|$|Fearing for {{the safety}} of his wife's {{relatives}} in San Antonio, Bowie invited her cousins Getrudis Navarro and Juana Navarro Alsbury, as well as Alsbury's 18-month-old son, Alijo Perez Jr., to stay inside the walls of the Alamo. Bowie also brought several black servants, some of whom worked at the Veramendi Palace, into the security of the Alamo fortress. Bowie had been ill, and twodoctors, including the fort surgeon, were unable to diagnose his illness. Travis became the sole commander of the forces when Bowie was confined to bed. Santa Anna and his army began a siege of the Alamo on February 24. The Mexican army raised <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> to warn the defenders that no quarter would be given.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stikine {{arrived at}} Bombay {{in the early}} morning of 12 April. Having taken on a pilot shortly before 10:00 she was docked at the Victoria Dock at midday. The {{practice}} of flying <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> to signify dangerous cargo on board had been discontinued in wartime as doing so would identify such vessels {{in the event of an}} enemy air raid on a port. Also, the practice on unloading such vessels into lighters offshore had also been discontinued due to the war. At the time, explosives were graded as Category A, B, or C. Category A explosives, such as those carried on board Fort Stikine, were the most dangerous. These were only allowed to be offloaded onto lighters, and not directly to the quayside.|$|E
