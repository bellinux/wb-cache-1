5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its <b>atomic</b> <b>spacing</b> to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its <b>atomic</b> <b>spacing</b> known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{localized}} ("intra-atomic") {{absorption of}} light which causes color for chromium and vanadium impurities, blue color in sapphires comes from intervalence charge transfer, {{which is the}} transfer of an electron from one transition-metal ion to another via the conduction or valence band.

An electron transfer from Fe2+ and Ti4+ can cause {{a change in the}} valence state of both. Because of the valence change there is a specific change in energy for the electron, and electromagnetic energy is absorbed. The wavelength of the energy absorbed corresponds to yellow light.

50|$|Filming {{began on}} The <b>Atomic</b> <b>Space</b> Bug {{in the winter}} of 1999 {{in the small town of}} Bainbridge, New York. The weather {{conditions}} were so harsh that the star of the film, Christopher Englese, was hospitalized twice before the film was completed. Other problems encountered on the set were dodging bullets from the locals who were hunting in nearby woods, and the main actress quitting after just four days of filming, forcing Parisen to put the film on hold for a couple of months until he found a replacement actress. Parisen resumed shooting the film in the summer of 1999, in a wooded area on Staten Island, New York. The summer temperatures of a hundred degrees Fahrenheit (38 °C) and over caused more problems for the cast and crew, mainly for Jason Colucci, who played the role of the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Space</b> Bug. The bug costume (designed and constructed by Scott LoBaido) was made mostly of foam, with little ventilation. Colucci would have to take many breaks from shooting to avoid passing out.

Various properties of these constructions are analyzed. The Krull-Schmidt property first arose in the theory of R-modules, and when valid, it states that each object decomposes in a unique way into a sum of indecomposable objects of the same type.
