5|$|Banagher is most {{associated}} with the game of hurling and is home to St. Rynagh's GAA Club. The club was founded in 1961 and represents the parishes of Banagher and Cloghan, with hurling played at Banagher and football at Cloghan. St. Rynagh's has won 16 Offaly Senior Hurling Championships (Sean Robins Cup) and dominated senior hurling in the county from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s. Outside of the county, St. Rynagh's were the inaugural winners of the Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship, in 1971 and have won the title on a further three occasions, 1973, 1983 and 1994. The club also contested the first All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship final in 1971, losing to Roscrea from County Tipperary. Three St. Rynagh's players have captained the Offaly hurling team to All-Ireland success, Padraig Horan in 1981, Martin Hanamy in 1994 and Hubert Rigney in 1998. A number of St. Rynagh's players have also won <b>All</b> <b>Stars</b> – Martin Hanamy (3), Aidan Fogarty (2), Damien Martin, Padraig Horan, Hubert Rigney and Michael Duignan. Damien Martin was the goalkeeper on the first <b>All</b> <b>Stars</b> team in 1971, effectively making him the first ever GAA All Star.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} great {{distance}} from the Earth, <b>all</b> <b>stars</b> except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points {{in the night sky}} that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is also a star, but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight. Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} a long-held {{assumption}} {{that the majority of}} stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of <b>all</b> <b>stars</b> are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.|$|E

5|$|The {{confirmation}} of HIP 78530 b was reported on January 24, 2011. In imaging the ninety-one stars, HIP 78530 b and 1RXSJ1609-2105b were discovered. The discoveries {{of these two}} orbiting bodies allowed astronomers to predict that bodies with such low planet/brown dwarf-to-star mass ratios (below 0.01) orbiting {{at a distance of}} hundreds of AU exists in the orbits of 2.2% of <b>all</b> <b>stars.</b> However, this number is a lower limit, as astronomers have been unable to detect smaller, low-mass planets that fit this scenario.|$|E
5|$|The triple {{system is}} {{just outside the}} core of the {{globular}} cluster Messier 4. The age of the cluster has been estimated to be about 12.7 billion years, and because <b>all</b> <b>stars</b> in a cluster form at about the same time, and planets form together with their host stars, it is likely that PSR B1620-26 b is also about 12.7 billion years old. This is much older than any other known planet, and nearly three times as old as Earth. It has been undergoing many stages through its lifetime.|$|E

5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma {{held together by}} its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including <b>all</b> <b>stars</b> outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are in{{visible to the naked eye}} from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of <b>all</b> <b>stars</b> occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E

Throughout the summer, Maria and Bennett would {{get involved in}} Matt Hardy's feud with The Briscoes. During the feud, The Kingdom stole Jay Briscoe's title; Matt Hardy customized it as the Iconic Championship. At <b>All</b> <b>Stars</b> Extravaganza 6, Bennett and Maria customized the title as the Championship of Love. They were interrupted by Jay Briscoe's brother, Mark.

5|$|One {{particular}} FFR attack, Poison Kiss, has her blow a large heart-shaped kiss at {{the opponent}} that travels in a sine wave path. If it connects, a quick peep show of Poison in several erotic poses is displayed, and afterwards the opponent is shown stunned with hearts dancing over their head. Defeating an opponent with this attack results in Poison doing a pole dance for her win pose, with her whip {{serving as the}} pole. Though not playable in the beta test of Capcom Fighting <b>All</b> <b>Stars,</b> promotional material released by Capcom for the title show that this move would have been retained for her gameplay. However, in Ultra Street Fighter IV, her Poison Kiss follows up with several slaps and a groin kick when it hits the opponent, similar to her Cross Art move from Street Fighter X Tekken.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is a G-type {{main-sequence star}} (G2V) {{based on its}} {{spectral}} class. As such, it is informally {{referred to as a}} yellow dwarf. It formed approximately 4.6 billion, or 1,000,000,000. years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost <b>all</b> <b>stars</b> form by this process.|$|E
