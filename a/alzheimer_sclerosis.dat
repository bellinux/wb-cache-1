50|$|Treatment is {{dependent}} on the underlying cause, whether it is organic or psychological in origin. If depersonalization is a symptom of neurological disease, then diagnosis and treatment of the specific disease is the first approach. Depersonalization can be a cognitive symptom of such diseases as amyotrophic lateral <b>sclerosis,</b> <b>Alzheimer's,</b> multiple <b>sclerosis</b> (MS), neuroborreliosis (Lyme disease), or any other neurological disease affecting the brain. For those suffering from depersonalization with migraine, tricyclic antidepressants are often prescribed.|$|R

40|$|Pro and {{anti-inflammatory}} cytokines {{are involved}} in disease onset and pathophysiology of multiple <b>sclerosis,</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease and Parkinson's disease. It is likely that panels of multiple cytokines provide a good reflection of disease status {{and can be used}} as biological markers in body fluids. Different multi-plex platforms, Luminex-xMAP and Meso Scale Discovery, are able to detect multiple analytes in the same sample at the same time. In this literature based review, we offer an overview of the multi-plex platforms and compare them with the golden standard ELISA in their ability to accurately and sensitively detect cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood (serum/plasma). The detectability and levels of cytokines in multiple <b>sclerosis,</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease and Parkinson's disease are promising but also show discrepancies between studies. The current immuno-assays lack sensitivity for detection of various cytokines that have low concentrations of cytokines in CSF and blood, and therefore technical improvements are needed. With such improvements the use of large panels of cytokines as inflammatory profiles may offer additional value in diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response in neurodegenerative diseases. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that neuroinflammation {{is involved in}} the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. Microglia and astrocytes are major pathogenic components within this process and known to respond to proinflammatory mediators released from immune cells such as mast cells. Mast cells reside in the brain and are an important source of inflammatory molecules. Mast cell interactions with glial cells and neurons result in the release of mediators such as cytokines, proteases and reactive oxygen species. During neuroinflammation, excessive levels of these mediators can influence neurogenesis, neurodegeneration and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Mast cells are considered first responders and are able to initiate and magnify immune responses in the brain. Their possible role in neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple <b>sclerosis,</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease and autism has gained increasing interest. We discuss the possible involvement of mast cells and their mediators in neurogenesis, neurodegeneration and BBB permeability and their role in neuronal disorders such as cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury, neuropathic pain, multiple <b>sclerosis,</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, migraine, autism, and depression...|$|R

50|$|All {{adenosine}} receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) are G-protein-coupled receptors. The four receptor subtypes {{are further}} classified {{based on their}} ability to either stimulate or inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. The A1 receptors couple to Gi/o and decreases cAMP levels, while the A2 adenosine receptors couple to Gs, which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity. In addition, A1 receptors couple to Go, which has been reported to mediate adenosine inhibition of Ca2+ conductance, whereas A2B and A3 receptors also couple to Gq and stimulate phospholipase activity.Researchers at Cornell University have recently shown adenosine receptors to be key in opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB).Mice dosed with adenosine have shown increased transport across the BBB of amyloid plaque antibodies and prodrugs associated with Parkinson's disease, <b>Alzheimer's,</b> multiple <b>sclerosis,</b> and cancers of the central nervous system.|$|R
