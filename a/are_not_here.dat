[...] The prelate adds afterwards, that there was in his time in Teopixca a great settlement of that diocese, a family of the surname of Votan, who were the reputed descendants of that ancient populator.

Khan, who is known for keeping secrecy for his movies, was quoted saying, [...] "I don`t want to talk much about how the show will be, and about its format. I want everyone to see it directly on TV."

2500|$|In April 2012 PLOS Medicine {{published}} an article by three researchers {{who were involved in}} ongoing updates of a Cochrane Collaboration review of neuraminidase inhibitors for treating influenza, describing their experience of trying to gain access to clinical study reports for the antiviral Tamiflu (oseltamivir) from the drug's manufacturer Roche. The article outlined the need for access to all clinical trial data held by pharmaceutical companies and regulators, and detailed reasons given by Roche for not sharing data on Tamiflu. In a commissioned perspective article published in the same issue of PLOS Medicine, regulators from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other national regulatory bodies outlined a shift in their stance on access to clinical trial data but also highlighted challenges that would need to be overcome. The regulators noted, [...] "e consider it neither desirable nor realistic {{to maintain the status quo}} of limited availability of regulatory trials data" [...] and concluded, [...] "e welcome debate on these issues, and remain confident that satisfactory solutions can be found to make complete trial data available in a way that will be in the best interest of public health". The article marked a move towards the proactive disclosure of clinical trial data and led to the EMA holding a workshop to establish how this could be done. At the workshop Guido Rasi, the EMA’s Executive Director, announced [...] "oday represents the first step in delivering our vision. We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>here</b> to decide if we will publish clinical-trial data, only how. We need to do this in order to rebuild trust and confidence in the whole system".
