5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} as a playing experience that newcomers to the series could come to. Its presentation was compared to that of <b>a</b> <b>fairy</b> tale, as depicting the usual style of the series would have been difficult on the platform. Both Tetsuya Nomura and Yoko Shimomura, veterans from the main series, returned as director and composer respectively. The game received favorable reception from critics.|$|E

The opening video for the game was animated by Makoto Shinkai, {{and a majority of}} the music was produced by Tenmon, who has worked in the past with Shinkai and Minori. Female character design was by Naru Nanao of Da Capo fame, while male character design was by 2C Galore.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, in Middle English {{and early}} modern Scottish evidence, while still {{appearing}} as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and {{particularly with the}} idea of <b>a</b> <b>Fairy</b> Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the source material. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies and replace them with changelings.|$|E
5|$|The Ef series, {{encompassing}} {{the visual}} novels and anime adaptation, {{was the only}} Minori title to receive coverage in an entire issue of Dengeki G's Festival!

5|$|The Queen's castle {{was used}} {{prominently}} in the advertising of the film (acting as {{the backdrop of the}} film's poster). Later Disney fairy tales, including Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, feature similarly fantastical castles and palaces, and often these buildings act as centrepieces or backdrops for the movies' posters. <b>A</b> <b>fairy</b> tale castle stands at the centre of each Disney theme park, and the image of the castle is used in the logo for Buena Vista International.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot {{of a little girl}} {{sleeping}} in her bed. As the music starts, rays of light emanate from the bedside radio with cartoon violins playing the music.

5|$|Crysta is <b>a</b> <b>fairy</b> with {{a curious}} nature living in FernGully, a {{pristine}} rainforest free from human intervention. The fairies of FernGully {{once lived in}} harmony with humans, but believe them to have gone extinct after having been driven away by a dark spirit named Hexxus. Crysta is the apprentice of Magi, a motherly-figure fairy who imprisoned Hexxus in a tree. One day Crysta explores a new part of the forest and meets Batty, a bat {{who claims to have}} been experimented on by humans, giving him an obstreperous and unstable personality. However, fairies refuse to believe him, except for Crysta, who volunteers to investigate the situation. She sees Zak, a young lumberjack whom Crysta accidentally shrinks when she tries to save him from being crushed by a falling tree, though does not know how to restore him to normal size.|$|E
5|$|Kameo {{is known}} for its {{prolonged}} development cycle, which spanned four Nintendo and Microsoft consoles. It was conceived as a Pokémon-style game of capturing and nurturing monsters, but traded its lighthearted Nintendo overtones for darker themes more befitting of Xbox audiences when Microsoft acquired the developer. In this process, Kameo was repurposed from <b>a</b> <b>fairy</b> to an elf—a transition the game's director later concluded was unsuccessful. While nearly finished for the original Xbox console, the title was delayed to become an exclusive launch title for the upcoming Xbox 360. Rare used the extra time to improve the game's audiovisuals, including Rare's first orchestral soundtrack, and add a local cooperative multiplayer mode. Kameo released alongside the Xbox 360 launches: November 2005 in North America and several weeks later in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Link also enters {{this mode}} when {{attacked}} by wandering monsters. Whenever the player traverses the various environments of Hyrule, enemy silhouettes appear and pursue him. Of the three random creatures that appear, {{there are three}} types which correspond to the relative difficulty of the monsters in battle mode: a small, weak blob denoting easy enemies, a large, strong biped denoting harder enemies, and <b>a</b> <b>Fairy,</b> which will put Link on a single screen with a free Fairy to refill his health. This separate method of traveling and entering combat {{is one of many}} aspects adapted from the role-playing video game genre. Stepping onto particular spots in the overworld map will automatically switch the game to a side-scrolling mode for an enemy encounter or item pickup.|$|E

5|$|The {{tree that}} Hexxus is imprisoned in is cut down by Tony and Ralph, Zak's superiors. Hexxus quickly begins {{to regain his}} powers by feeding on pollution. He manipulates the humans to drive to FernGully. In FernGully, Zak meets Pips, <b>a</b> <b>fairy</b> envious of Zak's {{relationship}} with Crysta. Zak begins {{to fall in love}} with Crysta, but hides the true reason that the humans had returned. When the signs of Hexxus's resurrection begin to manifest themselves in poisoned trees and rivers, he finally admits that humans are destroying the forest. The fairies mount an attempt to defend their homes, but knowing their fight is hopeless, Zak convinces Batty to aid him in stopping the machine before it destroys them. When Zak makes his presence known to Tony and Ralph, Hexxus takes over the machine and begins to wildly destroy the forest.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Dawn of Mana {{takes place in a}} full three-dimensional world, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the main character, Keldric, and is followed for almost all of the game by <b>a</b> <b>fairy</b> spirit, Faye. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, Dawn is an action-adventure game, rather than an action role-playing game; as such, gameplay is focused on movement and attacking enemies, rather than leveling-up character statistics. Keldric is able to run, roll, and jump through the game world. Keldric has access to a vine-like plant attached to his arm, which can be used at any time as either a sword, a whip, or a slingshot. The sword can be used to hit enemies and objects, the whip can grab and throw enemies and objects, and the slingshot can throw collectible pebbles as projectiles. Faye can cast magic spells, selectable by the player.|$|E
5|$|Until 19 August {{the weather}} was {{unsuitable}} for photography. Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching, Elsie's mother was persuaded to visit her sister's for tea, leaving the girls alone. In her absence the girls took several photographs, two of which appeared to show fairies. In the first, Frances and the Leaping Fairy, Frances is shown in profile with a winged fairy close by her nose. The second, Fairy offering Posy of Harebells to Elsie, shows <b>a</b> <b>fairy</b> either hovering or tiptoeing on a branch, and offering Elsie a flower. Two days later the girls took the last picture, Fairies and Their Sun-Bath.|$|E
