40|$|A {{soft metal}} with low wear {{resistance}} (6000 series aluminum), {{was used to}} minimize run time while maximizing wear rate. Two paddle configurations were tested, with the first four paddles after the augers replaced by the wear paddles. The first configuration was all flat paddles, with the first paddle not aligned with the augers and is consistent with present SPF mixer. The second configuration had helical paddles {{for the first three}} stages after the augers and a flat paddle at the fourth stage. The first helical paddle was aligned with the <b>auger</b> <b>flight</b> for the second configuration. The all flat paddle configuration wear rate was approximately double the wear rate of the helical paddles for the first two sets of paddles after the augers. For both configurations, there was little or no wear on the third and fourth paddle sets based on mass change, indicating that the fully wetted premix materials are much less abrasive than the un-wetted or partially wetted premix. Additionally, inspection of the wear surface of the paddles at higher magnification showed the flat paddles were worn much more than the helical and is consistent with the wear rates. Aligning the auger discharge flight with the first set of helical paddles was effective in reducing the wear rate as compared to the flat paddle configuration. Changing the paddle configuration from flat to helical resulted in a slight increase in rheological properties. Although, both tests produced grout-like material that is within the processing rage of the SPF, {{it should be noted that}} cement is not included in the premix and water was used rather than salt solution, which does affect the rheology of the fresh grout. The higher rheological properties from the helical wear test are most likely due to the reduced number of shearing paddles in the mixer. In addition, there is variation in the rheological data for each wear test. This is most likely due to the way that the dry feeds enter the mixer from the dry feeder. The premix is discharged from the hopper in an unsteady fashion, where irregular sized clumps were observed leaving the discharge of the auger, though the auger speed is constant...|$|E
40|$|Field {{measurements}} on multi-year {{ice in the}} Canadian Arctic Archipelago are presented, including detailed ice thickness measurements and results of the pilot program to document changes in the temperature of multi-year ice as its drifts through the Arctic. The relevance of monitoring the full thickness temperature of multi-year ice {{in space and time}} is that this information can be used subsequently as a proxy for ice thickness and strength. This work, which will span the next four years, is of interest to Transport Canada because it will provide mariners with information to help them rate the damage potential of multi-year ice. It is of interest to the Canadian Ice Service because the results can be incorporated into thermodynamic models and ice drift predictions of multi-year ice. More than 546 m of ice was drilled on four multi-year ice floes during the program. Comparison of thickness measurements from multi-year ice in Nares Strait (2007) and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (2008) showed that ice upwards of 10 m thick exists in both regions 2 ̆ 013 and, contrary to what one might expect, can be found quite easily. Due to limitations in the amount of <b>auger</b> <b>flight</b> available, the maximum ice thickness measured in Nares Strait during the 2007 season was 16. 6 m, although the ice was often considerably thicker. In comparison, the maximum drill hole thickness measured in the Archipelago during the 2008 season was 16. 9 m. The average floe thicknesses of the multi-year ice in Nares Strait (2007) ranged from 3. 6 to more than 9. 6 m, with standard deviations of 0. 7 to 3. 7 m. The average thickness of the four floes in the Canadian Archipelago (2008) ranged from 7. 3 to 9. 3 m, with standard deviations from 2. 1 to 3. 7 m. It {{should be noted that the}} crests of the more extreme ice ridges were not sampled during either program. Two months of full thickness temperatures for multi-year floe R 02 (10. 2 m thick) and three months of temperatures on multi-year floe R 05 (10. 4 m thick) showed that both floes warmed throughout their full thickness. The rapid warming that occurred at the bottom of Floe R 05 during three weeks in August was interpreted as thinning of the ice 2 ̆ 013 the bottom ice thinned by more than one metre in just three weeks. The same cannot be said of Floe R 02 because the data terminated prematurely in late July, prior to the onset of bottom ablation. The migration of Floe R 02 was documented from 30 May to 20 September, during which time the floe drifted about 1000 km through the Canadian Archipelago. In comparison, Floe R 05 circulated in Wellington Channel until 16 August, when the last positional data were obtained from that floe. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

A linear taper that best fit the square root curve for the inside diameter of the auger was determined by minimizing the integral of the squared area differences between the linear taper and the square root curve. The maximum difference between the auger radii as determined with the square root curve and linear taper functions was less than 0. 3 mm, significantly less than the 4. 7 mm average smallest particle diameter for the screened soybeans used. An auger constructed following this design (linear tapered inside diameter with a minimum flighting height) provided uniform unloading of particulate material from a container with a rectangular cross-section, as evidenced by mean slopes of the top surface of the material being maintained not significantly different from zero, until the top surface dropped to within 30 cm of the top of the <b>auger</b> <b>flighting...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough University. The field of pile design and construction in the United Kingdom is currently {{in a period of}} change. Not only are new processes and techniques being developed but also the legislative landscape is changing with the introduction of new Europe wide normative standards (BSI, 2004, 2007). This project sought to optimise pile design through better understanding and interpretation of ground conditions and of the pile-soil interaction for two pile types, continuous <b>flight</b> <b>auger</b> and bored displacement piles. Quantitative methods for interpreting and summarising previous knowledge and experience have been developed; the strata are divided into discrete bands and properties are represented with summary statistics. Experience and previous knowledge relating to the shear strength of London Clay have been quantified and presented using this approach. Furthermore, a straightforward tool has been provided for the implementation of such data into design; the previous knowledge and new site specific data are combined using Bayesian updating. Through use of this technique, the uncertainty associated with interpreting ground conditions from site data has been demonstrated to be reduced. The techniques described have been adopted into design practice within the sponsoring company. Bored displacement piles are a relatively new pile type. There is little published data or scientific understanding of the processes undergone by the soils during and after construction and the effect that these have on pile performance. This research identified the need for, and developed, a unified framework of descriptors for the various types of bored displacement pile and investigated the installation energy and performance of bored displacement piles in London Clay. The energy to construct the pile was observed to be highly variable and not directly related to capacity. Performance of bored displacement piles was observed to be similar to continuous <b>flight</b> <b>auger</b> piles of similar dimensions; typical values for the adhesion between bored displacement piles and the surrounding soil were established and these were comparable to those achieved by continuous <b>flight</b> <b>auger</b> piles. In addition, to enable the analysis of the probability of failure of a pile, the sources of variation have been investigated and the variability quantified. Besides the soil conditions, the dimensions of the pile, notably pile diameter, were found to be a significant source of variation...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this dissertation examines the physical and chemical changes that occur to in situ soil at the soil-pile interface for continuous <b>flight</b> <b>auger</b> piles installed in the Mercia Mudstone Group. Four Continuous <b>Flight</b> <b>Auger</b> (CFA) piles were installed in the Gunthorpe Member of the Mercia Mudstone Group, central England. The effect on the soil-pile interface of overrotation of the auger during installation, {{and the addition of}} water during installation were investigated. Once the piles had been left to cure, they were excavated and returned to City University, London, with the surrounding soil. The excavated piles and soil were examined using a variety of microscopic and macroscopic techniques including inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) and X-ray diffraction (XRD); with water contents, chemical content (ICP) and mineralogical content (XRD) tested. Plastic index and particle size distribution tests were used to show the physical effects of piling on the host soil and preliminary strength testing was carried out to provide insight into the strength characteristics of the soil surrounding the pile. In all four piles a distinct zone of remoulding was observed around the pile shaft. In each case the remoulded zone was a brown to red, clay rich layer varying between 0 mm and 55 mm in thickness. In almost all cases this remoulded zone had a structure and fabric which was not related to the in situ soil. Around all piles it was further noted that vertical fissures were present, and fanned out from the pile shaft in a clockwise direction. Two of the piles were installed with the addition of water. Around these piles it was noted that the remoulded layer often split into two or three distinct layers, with one of these layers often containing millimetre scale aggregations of green silt. Tests showed a higher percentage of clays present within this remoulded zone, and indicated that SiO 2 (a major rock forming element and considered by some authors to be an aggregating agent within the Mercia Mudstone Group) was more abundant within remoulded than undisturbed soil. The clay fraction showed a low abundance of high swelling clays in all cases. It was concluded that installing piles within the Mercia Mudstone Group causes remoulding of the soil directly adjacent to the pile shaft. The least remoulding occurred when the pile was augered normally with no added water. All four remoulded zones contained fissures, fanning clockwise from the pile, however, these were more pronounced in the dry piles, while the wet piles had a more massive, granular texture to the remoulded zone. For all piles, except the pile which was over-rotated and installed with no added water, the percentage of clays within the remoulded zone was greater than outside the remoulded zone. This indicates that the aggregates of clays found naturally within the Mercia Mudstone Group may be split into their constituent clays during the piling process...|$|R

There is a dramatic fluctuation in pricing of executing this work package within short periods {{as a result of}} unsteady changes in supply-demand equilibrium. Consequently, there is an urgent need for the use of a scientific approach in estimating construction costs. Accordingly, it is crucial to consider the different cost elements of CFA piling construction as a step to reach an accurate and realistic cost estimate to be used by contractors in tendering. This research aims to study these cost elements based on an expert judgment, site observations and statistical analysis in order to develop an effective tool to estimate the total construction cost of the CFA piles in any future project. Expert survey was performed to draw detailed information to construct a cost breakdown structure (CBS) that was used as a basis for developing the proposed cost model. The developed cost model is then validated through the application on fifty two projects. Such projects were carefully selected in different sizes, purposes and locations. Then the collected data were exposed to statistical analysis techniques. An average percentage error of 4. 1 % was observed upon comparing the estimated costs with the actual costs of these projects. A sensitivity analysis was then performed to recognize the most effective cost factors.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} time, cost and transportation difficulties, Irish contractors are seeking {{an alternative to}} conventional static pile load tests. As a result several firms have adopted dynamic testing techniques to supplement {{and in some cases}} to replace conventional static tests. In order to assess the reliability of the systems and to address the concerns of owners and consulting engineers, a database comprising 43 pairs of static and dynamic tests on piles from 24 sites around Ireland has been assembled. The database was limited to medium to large diameter continuous <b>flight</b> <b>auger</b> (CFA) piles, typically 450 mm to 600 mm in diameter. Comparisons between actual measured settlement in static tests and predicted settlement for dynamic tests showed a clear pattern of underestimation of settlement by the dynamic tests, with the ratio between the two values typically varying between 0. 4 and 1. 2, with an average of about 0. 8. This is due to the limited energy being imparted to the pile in the dynamic test. The results were best for piles in rock and worst for piles in clay. Scatter in the results increased with increasing pile load. However as all of the measured settlements were modest, the absolute numerical difference between the actual and predicted values was typically less than 3 mm, which may not be significant in many practical cases. For piles supporting non - sensitive structures, in areas where the ground conditions are well know, and provided the ratio the drop weight to the pile weight and to the pile SWL is at least 50 % and 1. 5 % respectively, it seems possible that static tests can be replaced by dynamic ones. However for structures sensitive to settlement or for those in areas where ground conditions are uncertain, then it is suggested that the dynamic test should be calibrated by at least one static test...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of static loading tests carried out in 3 different types of piles: bored piles with temporary casing, continuous <b>flight</b> <b>auger,</b> CFA, piles (bored and CFA piles with circular section - nominal diameter Ø 600 mm) and driven piles (with square section - width 350 mm). These piles were installed in the CEFEUP/ISC' 2 experimental site, located in the Campus of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (Portugal), in a contact zone between the gneissic rocks and the granite mass. After a brief geological and geotechnical site characterization, the paper presents {{a detailed description of}} the piles and the instrumentation installed in two of them. Previous analyses of the test data are summed up, emphasising the difficulties in determining the residual loads resulting from the installation processes and the unloading and the reloading cycles applied to the static loading tests. This paper aims to quantify these locked-in toe residual loads, using a mathematical model - the Modified Two Straight Lines Method (MDRM) - that allows the interpretation of the pile head load-settlement curve and the determination of the shaft and toe resistances, apart from the toe residual loads. For the shaft and toe resistances, the MDRM led to consistent results with those inferred from both, the previous analysis and the extensometer measurements; the ultimate unit shaft resistance was estimated in 60 kPa. As far as the toe's residual loads are concerned, the estimated values of about 150 kN for the bored piles were also consistent with those measured but very different from that guessed in previous analysis, about 300 kN. For the driven pile, this paper arrived at an upper bound of 500 kN for the residual load and a lower bound of 60 kPa for the ultimate unit shaft resistance...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} of two Osterberg’s cell load tests (OLTs) and three conventional load tests (COLTs) {{in the same}} subsoil conditions on Continuous <b>Flight</b> <b>Auger</b> (CFA) piles carefully monitored during construction stages. The instrumentation along the pile shaft in all the tests allows interesting comparisons of both global behaviour and local load transfer. Significant differences in the stiffness of the soil-pile system with the different test procedures is outlined. The main {{differences between the two}} test procedures occur at the two opposite ends of the pile, as could have been expected, while the observed behaviour in the middle part of the tested piles is close for the two models. A relatively simple FEM model has been calibrated {{on the basis of the}} OLTs results. The same model is capable of accurately matching the experimental results of the COLTs, proving that the observed differences are not due to random factors. Furthermore, the same model has been used to simulate ideal load tests. Such a reliable simulation shows that both the experimental procedures are actually responsible for significant differences in the behaviour of the soil-pile system even in the simple case of a concentrated axial load. Large differences arise in terms of the stiffness of the system with the OLTs providing by far the stiffest response. Despite being intermediate between the OLT and the ILT, the COLTs provide a response of the pile-soil system, which is on the average about two times stiffer than the Ideal test, where the force applied on top of the pile does not depend on a tangible reaction system. Care should be thus taken when considering the results of such tests in the prediction of the settlement of a piled foundation. Correction factors should be applied to the experimentally observed behaviour...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} piles is quit complex and the {{estimation}} of carrying capacity is calculated fro m theoretical formula and load test results. The design resistance may be calculated using conventional static pile design theory. The pile founding depths should be predetermined before installation from a site geotechnical investigation. To ascertain the field per formance and estimate load carrying capacities of piles, in-situ pile load tests should be conducted. In this study, field pile load test data is analyzed to estimate the ultimate load for end bearing piles. The investigated site is about 100 × 110 m located in Alexandria, Egypt. Geotechnical investigations at the site are carried out to a maximum depth of 45 m. Four borings {{have been done in}} field. The tests are conducted at the site for two skelton structure buildings to be con structed on raft foundation rested on piles executed by continuous <b>flight</b> <b>auger.</b> Four pile load tests are performed on 600 mmdiameters and 27 mlengths. Ultimate capacities of piles are determined according to different methods. It i s concluded that the percentage of friction load carried by the shaft along the pile length is about 46 % of total load while the percentage of load carried by the end bearing is 54 % of total load. A new proposed method by the author is pre sented to calculate the ultimate capacity of pile from pile load test. The proposed method depends on the settlement of pile without taken into consideration the elastic deformation. An empirical formula is presented from the relationship between stress and settlement of pile due to friction and end bearing only after deducting the elastic deformation. How ever, the obtained results for the ultimate capacity of end bearing piles are considered to be more accurate than other methods. The proposed method appears to give bitter results that agrees well with the theoretical predictions. The pro posed method is easier, quicker and more reliable. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: This {{project is}} {{a study on the}} various methods used to {{construct}} buildings on soft clays in the Brisbane region which is located in the South Eastern corner of Queensland, Australia. This location enjoys long summers and relatively mild winters, especially compared to those found in the northern hemisphere. The study also compares them to world’s best practice and explains the many different ways of constructing buildings on soft clay. Consideration is also given to new techniques and developments in the area of soft clay foundation design. As the population of the Brisbane region and South East Qld grows the amount of quality land available for buildings declines. This makes the prospect of building in areas once thought too expensive, due to poor soil conditions, more appealing. Large areas of Brisbane, particularly around the mouth of the Brisbane River are underlain by soft clays. The Brisbane region has a diverse range of geology, ranging from volcanic rock formations through to soft estuarine deposits. As would be expected the majority of the soft clay deposits are along the Brisbane River and its tributaries. The objectives of this thesis are to show the various methods for building foundations used in the Brisbane region in soft clays. The advantages and disadvantages of these are discussed as well as other potential methods that could possibly be adopted. The predominant foundation type used in the soft clays in the Brisbane region are deep foundations. These transfer the load from the structure to suitable material beneath the soft clay, typically rock and they generally comprise a concrete pier bored through this upper soft clay material and socketed into the underlying rock. Variations of this method are also found in the form of driven piers and Continuous <b>Flight</b> <b>Auger</b> (CFA) piles. Other methods that are utilised include lime stabilisation, heavy impact, bridging and ground replacement. The testing that is used to determine what foundation option would be suitable usually consists of a borehole with insitu-testing. Cone Penetration Testing (CPT) testing may also be undertaken as another form of insitu-testing. Samples collected from the borehole drilling may be tested for consolidation and strength. There are many techniques that are now readily available {{that can be used to}} support buildings founding in soft clays. This thesis aims to highlight the current techniques used in the Brisbane region and compare them to those used in other areas of the world...|$|R
