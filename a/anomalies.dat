5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital <b>anomalies</b> are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear <b>anomalies</b> because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear <b>anomalies</b> can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear <b>anomalies</b> to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal <b>anomalies</b> are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 2008 found {{the foundations of}} a rectangular building, oriented north-north-west, {{thought to be the}} remains of a large hall, 33 x 13 metres (108 x 43 feet). To the north of the hall the survey found magnetic <b>anomalies</b> representing a complex of living buildings styled as a manor house. The same survey also found large magnetic <b>anomalies</b> {{in the eastern part of}} the site, which could be buried rubble from the demolition of a farmhouse, or the remains of in-filled cellars which are believed to have been built on the site. Evidence of a footpath around the interior of the site was also discovered. Given the evidence found, it is likely that the <b>anomalies</b> represent more than one phase of construction, though this could not be conclusively proven with the methods used.|$|E

30|$|<b>Anomaly</b> {{detection}} {{refers to}} finding inconsistency with the desired pattern in data, {{which is also}} known as novelty detection, <b>anomaly</b> mining, and noising mining. <b>Anomaly</b> detection has many applications, such as credit card fraud detection, medical diagnostics information <b>anomaly</b> detection, industrial equipment fault detection and structural defect detection, network intrusion detection, and a novel theme of text mining.

All the <b>anomaly</b> detection techniques can operate in one of the three modes: supervised <b>anomaly</b> detection which assumed the availability of a training data set that labeled instances for normal as well as <b>anomaly</b> class, semi-supervised <b>anomaly</b> detection which only assumed the availability of a normal data set, and unsupervised <b>anomaly</b> detection which did not require training data.|$|R

5|$|The {{gravitational}} {{field of the}} Moon has been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are mascons, large positive gravitational <b>anomalies</b> associated {{with some of the}} giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins. The <b>anomalies</b> greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon. There are some puzzles: lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature, and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism.|$|E
