40|$|Accelerating {{structures}} {{with strong}} transverse-mode damping are required {{in both the}} 30 GHz CLIC main linac and the 3 GHz CTF 3 drive-beam <b>accelerator.</b> <b>Damping</b> via slotted irises has been investigated for both structures. The transverse wake, {{the effect of the}} slots on the fundamental-mode parameters such as Q, sensitivity to tolerances, and surface-field enhancements have been computed. Terminating loads have been designed and machining studies to obtain rounded slot edges have been made.

40|$|The RDDS (Rounded <b>Damped</b> Detuned Structure) <b>accelerator</b> <b>damps</b> the {{transverse}} wakefield {{excited by}} bunches of electrons traversing thousands of linear accelerator structures. Errors in the fabrication {{of the cells}} which constitute each structure {{can result in a}} wakefield which is resonantly driven by the bunches, leading to BBU (Beam Break Up) and to a substantial growth in the beam emittance. One means to avoid these deleterious effects is to provide additional damping of the manifold, via plating the walls of the manifold with an electrically lossy material such as canthol or by fabricating the wall with stainless steel rather than copper. Results are presented on the wakefield and emittance growth in structures with a moderately lossy manifold. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{nonlinear}} {{theory of the}} weak single bunch instability in electron and positron circular <b>accelerators</b> and <b>damping</b> rings. A nonlinear equation is derived that governs {{the evolution of the}} amplitude of unstable oscillations with account of quantum diffusion effects due to the synchrotron radiation. Numerical solutions to this equation show a large variety of nonlinear regimes depending on the growth rate of the instability and the diffusion coefficient. Comparison with the observation in the SLC Damping Ring at SLAC shows qualitative agreement with the patterns observed in the experiment...|$|R
40|$|The resultspf {{calculations}} and simulations of the vertical emittance in the KEK <b>Accelerator</b> Test Facility <b>damping</b> ring are described. Both systematic and random alignment tolerances and a skew correction scheme are presented which limit the normalized vertical emittance to ~ 6 ~ < 4. 8 x 10 -s m-rad. Finally, {{the effect of}} intrabeam scattering on the vertical emittance is calculated. 1...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods of}} of {{measuring}} field strength in <b>accelerator</b> cavities, heavily <b>damped</b> {{with respect to}} higher order modes (HOM), are presented. From {{the results of the}} field measurements the coupling (damping) factor and thus the quality factor of the damped resonator can be derived. Measurements of a pillbox resonator with heavily damped TM 110 -mode (Q < 20) demonstrate the usefulness of the techniques presented, even in this extreme range...|$|R
40|$|For damping {{rings of}} future linear colliders, {{extremely}} low vertical emittance will be required. In an electron circular accelerator, the dominant {{sources of the}} vertical emittance are the vertical dispersion in arc sections and the x-y orbit coupling, caused by various errors. A systematic method to correct the vertical dispersion and the orbit coupling based on beam position measurement has been developed. In this paper, simulation studies assuming realistic misalignments, performances of monitors, and correctors of the <b>Accelerator</b> Test Facility <b>damping</b> ring at KEK are presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{substantial}} upgrade of {{the beam}} position monitors (BPM) at the ATF (<b>Accelerator</b> Test Facility) <b>damping</b> ring is currently in progress. Implementing digital read-out signal processing techniques in line with an optimized, low-noise analog downconverter, a resolution well below 1 mum could be demonstrated at 20 (of 96) upgraded BPM stations. The narrowband, high resolution BPM mode permits investigation {{of all types of}} non-linearities, imperfections and other obstacles in the machine which may limit the very low target aimed vertical beam emittance of < 2 pm. The technical status of the project, first beam measurements and an outlook to it's finalization are presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{measurement}} results of electron beam emittance in the <b>Accelerator</b> Test Facility <b>damping</b> ring operated in multibunch modes. The measurements {{were carried out}} with an upgraded laser wire beam profile monitor. The monitor has now a vertical wire {{as well as a}} horizontal one and is able to make much faster measurements thanks to an increased effective laser power inside the cavity. The measured emittance shows no large bunch-to-bunch dependence in either the horizontal or vertical directions. The values of the vertical emittance are similar to those obtained in the single-bunch operation. The present results are an important step toward the realization of a high-energy linear collider...|$|R
40|$|The ATF (<b>Accelerator</b> Test Facility) <b>damping</b> ring {{has been}} {{operated}} since January in 1997 at KEK, and several beam studies are in progress. For the beam orbit measurement, button-type beam position monitors (BPMs) are prepared in the damping ring. Clipping modules and charge-sensitive ADCs {{are used in}} the readout system so as to measure the beam position in a single revolution of beam. The position resolution was about 50 µm at a beam intensity of 0. 5 × 1010 electrons. However, higher resolution became increasingly necessary for our beam studies. In this paper, we considered the noise figure of a preamplifier in the clipping module. In addition, we are developing a fast clipping circuit to respond to a high frequency component in a BPM signal. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the first measurement of an electron beam {{size in the}} <b>accelerator</b> test facility <b>damping</b> ring at KEK with a laser wire beam profile monitor. This monitor {{is based upon the}} Compton scattering process of electrons with a laser light target, which is produced by injecting a cw laser beam into a Fabry-Pérot optical cavity. We have observed clear signals of the Compton scattered photons and confirmed that the observed energy spectrum as well as the count rate agree with the expected ones. From the measurement, we have deduced the vertical beam size σ_{b} to be 9. 8 ± 1. 1 ± 0. 4 μm, where the first (second) error represents statistical (systematic) uncertainty. Various improvements are in progress to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, which is essential for the detailed study of the beam dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The {{heart of}} the NLC (Next Linear Collider) will consist of several {{thousand}} X-band <b>accelerator</b> structures which <b>damp</b> the transverse wakefield via detuning the modal frequencies such that the amplitudes of the modes destructively interfere and by four damping Figure 1 : NLC Schematic Compared to the Present SLC manifolds per structure. Errors in the fabrication of the individual cells, which constitute each structure, {{will result in a}} poor cancellation of the modes and here we explore the effects of random errors within a particular structure and errors which are systematically repeated within a given accelerator and are distributed randomly over the whole collider. The beneficial effects of an effective interleaving of cells due to these fabrication errors is discussed together with results of tracking a multi-bunch beam through 11 km of accelerator structures.

40|$|Studies of wiggler{related dynamic {{aperture}} limitations. Two {{classes of}} circular electron <b>accelerators</b> will generate <b>damping</b> almost entirely in wiggler magnets: linear collider damping rings and some low{energy e+e factories, such as CESR-c. Wigglers are unlike typical accelerator magnets {{in that they}} have longitudinal magnetic elds which are comparable to their transverse elds. Also, the design orbit has an angle and a displacement relative to the wiggler axis. The combination of the longitudinal eld and the angle through the wiggler produces an eective eld error, as does {{the combination of the}} eld roll{o near the wiggler edge and the displacement from the wiggler axis. The eective eld nonlinearity is quite strong, severely limits dynamic aperture in linear collider damping ring designs, and may decrease the damping rate for large{amplitude particles. We intend to develop and test a design algorithm for wigglers and lattices which preserves the dynamic aperture, and test this algorithm with beam measurements in CESR-c. We will apply the same techniques to the International Linear Collider (ILC) damping ring designs to demonstrate that they have adequate dynamic aperture and amplitude{dependent damping rate (or optimize those designs until they do) ...|$|R
40|$|In the International Linear Collider, two {{linear accelerators}} will {{accelerate}} bunches of positrons and electrons to {{over a hundred}} billion electron volts and collide them in a central detector. In order to obtain useful collision rates, the bunches, each containing twenty billion particles, must be compressed to {{a cross section of}} a few nanometers by a few hundred nanometers. In order to prepare these ultra high density bunches, damping rings (DRs) are employed before the linear accelerators. The DRs take the high emittance bunches that are provided by the electron and positron sources and, through the process of radiation damping, squeeze them into ultra low emittance beams that are ready for the main linear <b>accelerators.</b> In the <b>damping</b> rings, a number of effects can prevent the successful preparation of the beams. In the electron ring, an effect known as the fast ion instability can lead to beam growth and, in the positron ring, the build-up of an electron cloud (EC), which interacts with the circulating bunches, can produce the same effect. EC build-up and the subsequent interaction of the cloud with the positron beam in the DR have been identified as major risks for the successful construction of a linear collider. The CESRTA research program at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) was developed in order to study the build-up of the EC, the details of its impact on ultra low emittance beams, as well as methods to mitigate the impact of the cloud. In the DR, the EC forms when synchrotron photons radiated from the circulating beam strike the walls of the vacuum chamber, resulting in the emission of photoelectrons. These low energy electrons can be accelerated across the vacuum chamber by the electric field of the beam, and strike the walls, causing the emission of secondary electrons. The secondary electrons are subsequently accelerated into the walls yet again via the same mechanism. The result is that the EC can rapidly begin to fill the vacuum chamber. In an electron DR, the EC build-up is limited by the Coulomb repulsion. But in a positron ring, the electrons are pulled into the potential well of the beam. The resulting interaction of the circulating bunches of positrons with the EC that ultimately limits DR performance. Typically we store long trains of closely space bunches in the damping ring. The interaction of stored beam and the EC that is generated by the long train is manifested by different mechanisms: (1) The cloud focuses the beam, which causes a tune shift that increases along the bunch train as the cloud density increases. (2) The cloud electrons couple the motion of bunches along a train. Transverse motion of a leading bunch is transferred to the cloud, and subsequently to a trailing bunch which can result in a multi-bunch instability. (3) The cloud couples the positrons in the head of the bunch to those in the tail of the same bunch, which can excite a 'head-tail' instability. (4) The nonlinear fields of the EC can lead to emittance growth before the onset of instabilities. The CESRTA collaboration, which includes researchers from Cornell University's Laboratory for Elementary-Particle Physics as well as more than 50 senior staff members from over a dozen accelerator laboratories and universities around the world, has operated CESR as a damping ring {{for the past three years}} to study these EC effects. A range of specialized instrumentation has been deployed to study the local build-up of the cloud in the vacuum chambers as well as the complicated dynamics exhibited when the beam and the EC interact. The program has significantly advanced our understanding of these issues and has helped identify the most promising methods to mitigate the impact of the EC on the DR beams. It has pointed the way towards a DR design that can meet the stringent specifications of the ILC...|$|R
