This study {{aimed to}} {{validate}} the alarm signs used in the 2007 German CEDAP-Plus study for indicating capsule endoscopy in patients who have idiopathic chronic abdominal pain. Patients and Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the cases of all patients who underwent capsule endoscopy at our institution between August 2007 and August 2009 for chronic hitherto undiagnosed abdominal pain, despite previous investigations. The demographic data, indications, findings, and diagnoses were recorded, as were the alarm signs (i. e., 10 % loss of weight within 3 months, suspected small intestinal bleed or chronic anemia, and laboratory indications of inflammation). Results. Alarm signs were found in only 4 of the 62 included patients. Capsule endoscopy revealed findings that led to diagnoses of Crohn's disease (n = 4), tuberculosis (n = 1), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (n = 3), and hookworm (n = 1); these diagnoses included 100 % (4 / 4) of the patients with alarm signs, but only 8. 6 % (5 / 58) of patients without them.

40|$|Late amniocenteses (greater than 20 weeks' gestation) were {{performed}} in 114 pregnancies with no a priori genetic risk, but referred because of abnormal clinical and/or ultrasound findings suggesting fetal malformations. Reasons for referral included polyhydramnios (51 cases), oligohydramnios (15 cases), fetal growth retardation (FGR) (16 cases) and abnormal fetal ultrasound findings excluding anencephaly (32 cases). In 42 of these cases, referral {{was motivated by}} a combination of the above abnormal findings. When polyhydramnios was the sole anomaly (25 cases), 5 fetuses were malformed (20 %), abnormal fetal karyotype and/or elevated amniotic fluid alphafetoprotein (AFP) were demonstrated in 2 cases. Oligohydramnios was the sole anomaly in one case; the infant died of prematurity. Fetal growth retardation was the sole anomaly in 14 cases, 11 otherwise normal newborns were small for date, 2 died at birth and 1 was malformed (1 / 14, 7 %). In this group all fetal karyotypes were normal and in 2 cases amniotic fluid AFP were increased. In the 32 pregnancies without abnormal amniotic fluid volume and/or FGR and with fetal malformation(s) suggested by ultrasound, all malformations except one (ovarian cyst possibly ruptured during birth) were confirmed at birth, amniotic fluid AFP was elevated, and/or karyotype was abnormal in 6 cases. In 42 pregnancies where more than one <b>alarm</b> <b>sign</b> was present, abnormal karyotype and/or elevated amniotic fluid AFP level were recorded in 21 of the 39 cases where amniocentesis was performed, 33 fetuses were malformed (79 %) and 13 died in the perinatal period (31 %). The high incidence of abnormal results of amniocentesis found in this survey of pathological pregnancies, particularly in those with multiple alarm signs, emphasizes the need for amniocentesis in these situations.

40|$|Aim: To report new {{recommendations}} for the primary care management of dyspepsia without <b>alarm</b> <b>signs</b> in England and Wales. Method: An independent, representative group of health care professionals, patient representatives and research-ers developed the guideline using evidence-based and small group-working principles, and incorporated extensive peer-reviewing and feedback from stakeholder organizations. Results: Referral to investigate dyspepsia should be made for <b>alarm</b> <b>signs</b> {{and not on the}} basis of age alone, reflecting the balance of benefit and harm from endo-scopy. Empirical management without formal diagnosis is appropriate for most patients: reviewing patient history, lifestyle, over-the-counter medicines, and pro-viding a course of proton-pump inhibitors and/or Helicobacter pylori test and treatment. Patients with ongoing symptoms require at least annual review to discuss symptoms and lifestyle, and as appropriate, encourage stepping down prescribed medication and returning to self-care. A new strategy included in the step down process is the use of therapies ‘on-demand’. Conclusion: The guideline provides structured and supported {{recommendations for}} both undiagnosed and endoscopically investigated dyspepsia. Some favour increased investigation to detect Barrett’s oesophagus and carcinoma. However, there is inconclusive evidence that patients without <b>alarm</b> <b>signs</b> will benefit subse-quently from endoscopy, while investigation involves a small but real risk of harm...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, coastal sandy {{habitats}} {{are considered}} highly endangered among those {{included in the}} EC Directive 92 / 43 /EEC (Habitats Directive). Among the different threats which affect coastal communities, the spread of alien plants has been claimed to induce changes in community diversity and structure. We therefore set out to analyse diversity patterns of native and focal species (diagnostic and characteristic of coastal dune habitats of European conservation interest) in sandy coastal habitats invaded by Carpobrotus aff. acinaciformis, a widespread alien plant. Focal species are a major conservation target for the Habitats Directive and their decline {{should be considered a}} serious threat for the whole habitat. The study was performed in the Central Western coast of Italy. We randomly sampled the vegetation of the holocenic dune by 2 m x 2 m plots. First we split the collected data in two sets: invaded and non-invaded. We compared overall native and focal species richness patterns of the two sets by rarefaction curves. Then, in order to describe the singular aspects of species diversity (e. g. richness, Shannon index, Simpson index, Berger-Parker index), we also compared Renyi's diversity profiles and we tested the significance of the differences between invaded and non invaded sets using a bootstrap procedure. Rarefaction curves of the non-invaded set rise quickly and reach higher accumulation values than the invaded set, but differences between the two curves were not significant. With respect to Renyi's profiles, the profile for the invaded dataset was always below the non-invaded one, but differences in diversity were significant only when specifically considering the focal species (Shannon, Simpson and Berger-Parker indices). In the analysed case, the invasion is significantly associated with changes in focal species diversity, instead those differences are not evident on the all native species pool. In the case of recent invasions, a consistent decline on focal species diversity may represent an early <b>alarm</b> <b>sign</b> of diversity loss and may help define specific conservation actions to prevent the decrease of overall diversity.

We aimed to validate the predictive rule-in value of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) most severe <b>alarming</b> <b>signs</b> or symptoms to identify SI in children. Design, Setting and Participants: The 16 most severe ("red") features of the NICE traffic light system were validated in seven different primary care and emergency department settings, including 6, 260 children presenting with acute illness. Main Outcome Measures: We focussed on the individual predictive value of single red features for SI and their combinations. Results were presented as positive likelihood ratios, sensitivities and specificities. We categorised "general" and "disease-specific" red features. Changes in pre-test probability versus post-test probability for SI were visualised in Fagan nomograms. Results: Almost all red features had rule-in value for SI, but only four individual red features substantially raised the probability of SI {{in more than one}} dataset: "does not wake/stay awake", "reduced skin turgor", "non-blanching rash", and "focal neurological signs". The presence of >= 3 red features improved prediction of SI but still lacked strong rule-in value as likelihood ratios were below 5. Conclusions: The rule-in value of the most severe <b>alarming</b> <b>signs</b> or symptoms of the NICE traffic light system for identifying children with SI was limited, even when multiple red features were present.

40|$|CONTEXT: Febrile {{children}} {{in primary care}} have a low risk for serious infection. Although several <b>alarming</b> <b>signs</b> and symptoms are proposed to have predictive value for serious infections, most are based on research in secondary care. The frequency of alarming signs/symptoms has not been established in primary care; however, in this setting differences in occurrence may influence their predictive value for serious infections. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of alarming signs/symptoms in febrile {{children in}} primary care. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. Clinical information was registered in a semi-structured way and manually recoded. SETTING: General practitioners' out-of-hours service. SUBJECTS: Face-to-face patient contacts concerning children (aged ≤ 16 years) with fever were eligible for inclusion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of 18 <b>alarming</b> <b>signs</b> and symptoms {{as reported in the}} literature. RESULTS: A total of 10, 476 patient contacts were included. The frequency of alarming signs/symptoms ranged from n =  1 (ABC instability; 40 °C as reported by the parents; 12. 9 %) to 8, 647 contacts (parental concern; 82. 5 %). CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of specific alarming signs/symptoms is low in primary care, ≥ 50 % of children have one or more alarming signs/symptoms. There is a need to determine the predictive value of alarming signs/symptoms not only for serious infections in primary care, but as well for increased risk of a complicated course of the illness...|$|R
40|$|Background Although fever in {{children}} is often self-limiting, antibiotics are frequently prescribed for febrile illnesses. GPs may consider treating serious infections by prescribing antibiotics. Aim To examine whether <b>alarm</b> <b>signs</b> and/or symptoms for serious infections {{are related to}} antibiotic prescription in febrile children in primary care. Design and setting Observational cohort study involving five GP out-of-hours services. Method Clinical information was registered and manually recoded. Children (< 16 years) with fever having a face-to-face contact with a GP were included. Children who were already using antibiotics or referred to secondary care were excluded. The relation between <b>alarm</b> <b>signs</b> and/or symptoms for serious infections and antibiotic prescription was tested using multivariate logistic regression. Results Of the 8676 included patients (median age 2. 4 years), antibiotics were prescribed in 3167 contacts (36. 5 %). Patient characteristics and <b>alarm</b> <b>signs</b> and/or symptoms positively related to antibiotic prescription were: increasing age (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 03; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] = 1. 02 to 1. 05), temperature measured by GP (OR = 1. 72; 95 % CI = 1. 59 to 1. 86), ill appearance (OR = 3. 93; 95 % CI = 2. 85 to 5. 42), being inconsolable (OR = 2. 27; 95 % CI = 1. 58 to 3. 22), shortness of breath (OR = 2. 58; 95 % CI = 1. 88 to 3. 56), duration of fever (OR = 1. 31; 95 % CI = 1. 26 to 1. 35). Negative associations were found for neurological signs (OR = 0. 45; 95 % CI = 0. 27 to 0. 76), signs of urinary tract infection (OR = 0. 63; 95 % CI = 0. 49 to 0. 82), and vomiting and diarrhoea (OR = 0. 65; 95 % CI = 0. 57 to 0. 74). These variables explained 19 % of the antibiotic prescriptions. Conclusion Antibiotics are often prescribed for febrile children.
