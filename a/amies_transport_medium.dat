For complete control of the disease in regions where more {{that one of the}} serovars of the different serogroups occurs, it is essential that the bacterium causing the problem be isolated and serotyped.

In this study, a CO 2 - environment chamber, the Jembec chamber, was used for transport of clinical speciments requiring examination for gonococci. The survival of N. gonorrhoeae present in clinical speciments when placed in <b>Amies</b> charcoal <b>transport</b> <b>medium</b> was compared to their survival when inoculated into Jembec chambers containing either modified Thayer-Martin medium (MTM) or modified New York City <b>transport</b> <b>medium</b> (MNYC). For a period of up to 2 days in transit, the three systems were not significantly different. However, after 3 days in transit, MNYC/Jembec chambers preserved significantly more gonococci than <b>Amies</b> charcoal <b>transport</b> meduim (P less than 0. 0001) or MTM/Jembec chambers (P= 0. 006). MNYC/Jembec chambers withstood 241 miles (386 km) of postal transit during winter months; 80 % of the gonococci present in clinical specimens remained viable from 2 to 5 days under these conditions. The CO 2 generated by the tablet in the Jembec chamber was suggicient to support the growth of N. gonorrhoeae if the chambers were incubated at 36 C immediately after inoculation. However, if delayed in transit, the chambers had to be incubated in 5 to 10 % CO 2 to promote the growth of N. gonorrhoeae.

Study design: Clinical isolates of GBS (n = 103), were inoculated into the <b>Amies</b> <b>transport</b> <b>medium</b> with charcoal in a concentration of 100 colony-forming units (cfu) /ml (10 cfu/swab). Swabs were then transferred to an enrichment broth (NPC) at time intervals of 0, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours. Broths were then incubated for 18 – 24 hours at 35 °C in air, before being transferred to New Granada Medium Modified (NGM) for GBS detection and incubated for a further 18 – 24 hours at 35 °C in air. If the characteristic orange pigmented colonies were observed after this period, the specimen was recorded as + (1 – 10 colonies) or ++ (more than 10 colonies). Results: Overall 92. 2 % (95 / 103) of isolates were detected in all tubes and at all times. An additional two isolates were non-hemolytic, non-pigment forming GBS. Of note, 3. 9 % (4 / 103) were negative until 2 hours delayed inoculation and 1. 9 % (2 / 103) gave inconsistent results, likely due to the low inoculum used. Conclusion: Delayed inoculation into selective enrichment broth following a period in transport medium, even with a low inoculum, gave a similar and acceptable GBS detection rate to direct inoculation. Hence, <b>Amies</b> <b>transport</b> <b>medium</b> with charcoal is an appropriate transport medium to use, where it is not practical for clinical specimens to be directly inoculated into selective enrichment broth and as endorsed in the Center...|$|E

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of group B streptococcus in pregnant women by a rapid and easy culture method. It seems that in cases in which GBS carriage is not suspected until the time of labor, using such a quick and specific culture method would be valuable.

After initial incubation at room temperature (RT) or 4 °C, GT were placed at 37 °C. GT were scored for the presence of orange pigment. GT and AT were subcultured on blood agar (BA). Pigment was observed in 98 % of GT incubated at 37 °C. GBS could be cultured in 91 %, 73 %, and 55 % of GT incubated at 37 °C, RT, or 4 °C, respectively. For AT, these percentages were only 20 % at 37 °C, 52 % at RT, and 59 % at 4 °C. When GT initially incubated at RT or 4 °C were subsequently incubated at 37 °C, the sensitivity improved significantly. We conclude that GT is a more sensitive GBS transport and culture medium than the conventional method, especially for low inocula and prolonged transport/incubation times.

We collected 1, 000 cervical specimens from young women (age range, 15 to 25 years) during routine Pap smear tests. Only specimens with normal cytology and in which the gynecologist found no clinical evidence of urogenital infections were selected.
