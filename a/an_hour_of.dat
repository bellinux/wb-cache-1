After {{little more than}} <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> fighting, however, the Canadians were forced to call the attack off. In the afternoon, the two heavily depleted companies of the Royal 22e Régiment fought off a large German counterattack on Casa Berardi, with the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery firing 5,398 rounds in support of Canadian forces.|$|E
5|$|During closing arguments, {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane. The trial lasted thirteen days, {{and despite the}} absence of any physical evidence, including a murder weapon, the jury returned a guilty verdict after only <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> deliberation on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|E

The low budget combined with a dozen commercial spots sold at $35,000 each meant that Our World generated an estimated $4 million in profit for ABC during its original run and summer repeats.|$|E

5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used within <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E

5|$|At 00:00 on 5 December, two {{companies}} of the PPCLI crossed the Moro River, moving towards Villa Rogatti. Within an hour, vicious fighting had erupted throughout the town as the {{two companies}} of Canadian infantry struggled to break the German defensive lines. As B Company broke through the German defences, A Company attacked to the northeast, continuing to engage 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment (200. Panzergrenadier_Regiment) near Villa Rogatti. Although two Canadian infantry companies now occupied Villa Rogatti, German Panzergrenadier forces still maintained substantial defences {{on the outskirts of}} the town. However, C Company continued to advance steadily along the eastern side of the town, encountering significant resistance from the 361st Panzergrenadier Regiment (361. Panzergrenadier-Regiment). After approximately <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> fighting by C and D Companies, Villa Rogatti had been occupied by Canadian forces shortly before dawn.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00, {{with the}} {{detached}} division rapidly approaching from astern, Hallowell turned his ship towards the ships sailing ahead of Swiftsure {{and attempted to}} pass across {{the stern of the}} rearmost ship in an effort to rake and disable it, creating enough confusion to mask an escape. The manoeuvere was recognised by the French captains, and all three vessels turned to face the British ship as it approached. By 15:30 the ships of the line had opened a mutual fire, during which the faster French warships were able to easily outmanoeuvere the lumbering Swiftsure. At 16:37, after more than <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> fruitless firing at long range, the arrival of Jean Bart and Constitution within gunshot convinced Hallowell that further resistance was hopeless and he struck his flag to signal his surrender.|$|E
5|$|By 1935, {{unbeknownst to}} the public, Piłsudski had {{for several years}} been in declining health. On 12 May 1935, he died of liver cancer at Warsaw's Belweder Palace. The celebration of his life began spontaneously within half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> the {{announcement}} of his death. It was led by military personnel — former Legionnaires, members of the Polish Military Organization, veterans of the wars of 1919–21 — and by his political collaborators from his service as Chief of State and, later, Prime Minister and Inspector-General.|$|E

5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} the dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{financial}} expertise and {{his friendship with}} Hayes made him a natural choice for Treasury Secretary in 1877. Like Grant before him, Hayes had not consulted party leaders about his cabinet appointments, and the Senate took the then-unusual step of referring {{all of them to}} committee. Two days later, senators approved Sherman's nomination after <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> debate, and he began lobbying his former colleagues to approve the other nominations, which they eventually did. Hayes and Sherman became close friends in the next four years, taking regular carriage rides together to discuss matters of state in private. In the Treasury, as in the Senate, Sherman was confronted with two tasks: first, to prepare for specie resumption when it took effect in 1879; second, to deal with the backlash against the diminution of silver coinage.|$|E
5|$|Spider-Man follows Dr. Octopus to TriCorp, {{where he}} {{attempts}} to steal a power pack from a vault. Spider-Man swoops in and gets to the power source before him.

They reach Coney Island through their ensuing brawl and Octopus, aware of Spider-Man's desire to save innocent lives, kidnaps Liz. With only <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> energy left, he climbs {{to the top of a}} roller coaster, forcing Spider-Man to choose between the power pack and Liz. Spider-Man throws the pack in the air before rescuing Liz; he gets close to Dr. Octopus as the latter scrambles for the power pack and is able to take it away from him, successfully defeating the doctor.|$|E
