50|$|<b>Fast</b> returnThe <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> is {{probably}} the most simple and common form of passing shot. Because the opponent has a shorter reaction time when they are at the net as compared to the baseline, a <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> can catch them off-guard or render them unable to react quickly enough. A <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> is usually played with great power as angled as possible either cross-court or down-the-line. To be able to hit such a shot, a player must have either a very strong and flat forehand or backhand, and not all players are able to execute such a passing shot well. Players who are adept at using pace to execute passing shots include Andre Agassi, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams.|$|R

Unlike most a priori grid generation systems for the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations, the strand meshing paradigm is <b>automatic,</b> <b>fast</b> and requires little memory to provide boundary-layer coverage. In addition, the stacks of elements implied by the strands {{can be used to}} the simulation’s advantage, where they naturally provide a line direction for semi-implicit solving...|$|R

These systems strictly interact with each other; more precisely, the affective, evocative system enters the space of deliberation, introduces new dimensions on goals (value) and beliefs (strength), and alters the process and result of our reasoned decisions. 24 [...]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} problem of {{detecting}} some commonly occurring kinds of race conditions in Erlang programs using static analysis. Our analysis is completely <b>automatic,</b> <b>fast</b> and scalable, and avoids false alarms by taking language characteristics into account. We have integrated our analysis in dialyzer, a commonly used tool for detecting software defects in Erlang programs which is part of Erlang/OTP, and evaluate its effectiveness and performance on a suite of widely used industrial and open source programs of considerable size. The analysis has detected a significant number of previously unknown race conditions. ...|$|R

In addition, we propose an ap-proach to estimate tree diameter at breast height (dbh) that was tested off-line {{on a variety of}} ground laser scanner data. Results are also presented for detection of tree trunks in aerial laser data. The underlying techniques using in all cases rely on 3 -D geometry analysis of point clouds and geometric primitives fitting. CONTENTS II...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{determinants}} of job-related fast repeat migrations {{of the labor force}} of Taiwan, based on the linked microdata of national migration surveys from 1980 through 1989. The main findings are as follows. First, the propensity to make <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> migration is negatively affected by the level of education and positively affected by the duration of unemployment, which suggests that those with a limited labor-market knowledge and an unsuccessful job search are more prone to make a return migration. Second, the propensity to make fast onward migration is strongly enhanced by the number of previous moves and negatively affected by the duration of unemployment, which suggests that more experienced and more successful previous migrants are more prone to make an onward migration. Third, those whose reason for the previous migration was job search are more likely to make a <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> migration than those whose reason for the previous migration was job change or job transfer, which suggests that those who have secured a job at the destination before moving {{are less likely to be}} disappointed and to make a <b>fast</b> <b>return</b> migration than those who migrated before securing a job. Fourth, gender selectivity in fast onward migration is very strong in terms of both overall level and age pattern, which reflects the strong dominance of patriarchal ideology on Taiwanese society. ...|$|R
40|$|Basic {{ideas for}} a method where the active power {{production}} is rescheduled in an <b>automatic</b> (<b>fast)</b> {{way to increase}} the loadability of the power system during a voltage instability are presented. Active power production is a parameter that is controllable during this instability phase {{and it may have}} a positive influence on the system vulnerability to collapse, especially when current limitations of the generators are involved. Depending on the strength of the system, two major objectives can be distinguished: to strengthen a local area from collapsing or to avoid an increase of the voltage depressed area. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} <b>automatic,</b> <b>fast</b> and parametrizable {{algorithm}} {{to perform the}} virtual insertion of a cochlear electrode array into a pre-existent mesh of the human cochlea. Our method reorients the electrode according to the parallel transport frame, a local parameterization of the cochlear centerline directions, robust to the centerline curvature changes. It allows to control the initial roll angle and the extension of insertion from full to partial. Such a virtual insertion, chained with finite element simulations on the electrical activity of the electrode and the cochlear nerves, will enable to test in silico the effects of implant design and positioning on a given patient, and optimize these parameters accordingly...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{critically}} examines Apperly and Butterfill's parallel ‘two systems’ {{theory of}} mindreading and argues instead for a cooperative multi-systems architecture. The minimal mindreading system (system 1) described by Butterfill and Apperly {{is unable to}} explain the flexibility of infant belief representation or fast and efficient mindreading in adults, and there are strong reasons for thinking that infant belief representation depends on executive cognition and general semantic memory. We propose that schemas, causal representation and mental models help to explain the representational flexibility of infant mindreading and give an alternative interpretation of evidence that has been taken to show <b>automatic,</b> <b>fast</b> and efficient belief representation in adults. ...|$|R
