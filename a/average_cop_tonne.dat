40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} coefficient of performance (COP) of a mesoscopic thermoelectric refrigerator realized by using a tunnel junction. We analyze the influence of particle and heat current fluctuations on the COP out of the equilibrium regime. We calculate the <b>average</b> <b>COP</b> by using full counting statistics and find that {{it depends on the}} measurement time τ. The deviation from the macroscopic COP value can be expressed with the Skellam distribution at all times. This result enables us to improve the Gaussian approximation valid within the linear response regime, which cannot predict the <b>average</b> <b>COP</b> in the limit of τ→ 0. We illustrate the time dependence of the <b>average</b> <b>COP</b> and find that in the short-time regime, the <b>average</b> <b>COP</b> possesses a minimum. In order to confirm the physical consistency far from equilibrium, we propose checking the correlation coefficient between the particle and the heat currents in addition to the positivity of the entropy production rate.

30|$|As {{previously}} stated, {{heat pump}} performance is also {{critical to the}} operating cost comparison. Operating costs are reduced in proportion to seasonal performance. The cost of electricity can be divided by the seasonal <b>average</b> <b>COP</b> (approximately 3). The <b>average</b> <b>COP</b> is calculated yearly because technology improves every year, and for each city because weather conditions vary across the province. Furnace efficiencies (typically between 0.78 and 0.96) increase the cost of using natural gas and especially oil, whose efficiencies are typically lower. It is the balance of these operating costs {{that is used to}} calculate economic feasibility and subsequently adjust the rate of adoption.|$|R
30|$|The third {{parameter}} is {{the price}} of energy, in particular the relative cost of electricity with respect to competing fossil fuels. Furnace oil and natural gas prices are typically far less than the price of electricity per unit of energy (see Fig. 3). While this is a disadvantage for electrification, high <b>average</b> <b>COPs</b> over the heating season can still make heat pumps economically viable.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{a system}} which {{delivers}} an HSPF of 7.7 will transfer 2.25 times as much heat as electricity consumed over a season. In Europe the term Seasonal Performance Factor ("SPF") is used to mean {{the same as the}} <b>average</b> <b>COP</b> over the heating season. Thus {{a system which}} transfers 2.25 times as much heat as the electricity consumed is said to have an SPF of 2.25. A well designed ground source heat pump installation should achieve an SPF of 3.5, or over 5 if linked to a solar-assisted thermal bank.|$|R
40|$|Performance of {{desiccant}} {{evaporative cooling}} (DEC) system configurations is {{strongly influenced by}} the climate conditions and varies widely in different climate zones. Finding the optimal configuration of DEC systems for a specific climatic zone is tedious and time consuming. This investigation conducts performance analysis of five DEC system configurations under climatic conditions of five cities from different zones: Vienna, Karachi, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, and Adelaide. On the basis of operating cycle, three standard and two modified system configurations (ventilation, recirculation, dunkle cycles; ventilatedrecirculation and ventilated-dunkle cycles) are analyzed in these five climate zones. Using an advance equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling and simulation approach, optimal configurations of a DEC system are determined for each climate zone. Based on the hourly climate data of each zone for its respective design cooling day, performance of each system configuration is estimated using three performance parameters: cooling capacity, COP, and cooling energy delivered. The results revealed that the continental/micro-thermal climate of Vienna, temperate/mesothermal climate of Sao Paulo, and drysummer subtropical climate of Adelaide favor the use of ventilated-dunkle cycle configuration with <b>average</b> <b>COP</b> of 0. 405, 0. 89 and 1. 01 respectively.

40|$|Heating {{capacity}} of an air-source heat pump (ASHP) system often decreases {{when it is}} operated in winter. This is because of frosting significantly affects the heat transfer efficiency of evaporator, and thus the airflow passage blocked. In order to solve this problem, a novel frost-free ASHP system, integrated with dehumidification and thermal energy storage, has been developed. In this paper, to further investigate the dynamic characteristics of the system working at low temperature, a mathematical model of the novel frost-free ASHP system was constructed. The mathematical model was verified by comparison with experimental data that showed that the measured results were in good accordance with the numerical ones. According to the mathematical model, the research results indicated that, at relatively humidity (RH) of 80 %, the system <b>average</b> <b>COP</b> increased by 56. 2 % when ambient temperature increased from − 10 °C to 0 °C.

40|$|In {{people with}} Multiple Sclerosis (MS) balance {{impairments}} {{may lead to}} increased falls and mobility loss. In quiet stance, people with MS display greater postural sway than healthy controls. Tai Chi is a Chinese martial art that has decreased the risk of falling in frail elderly individuals (Wolf et al., 1996). The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if a three week Tai Chi intervention would improve postural stability in people with MS. Seven participants (6 F/ 1 M, age 48. 5 ± 10. 8 years, height 1. 66 ± 0. 08 m, mass 68. 6 ± 19. 8 kg) attended nine one hour training sessions to practice two types of Tai Chi: standing meditation and slow walking. Postural stability was assessed before and after training using average center of pressure (CoP) velocity, total excursion and time to contact (TtC) for the static trials, and dual and single limb support times for the walking trials. To measure postural stability trials of quiet stance (QS), Tai Chi standing meditation with (SMA) and without arms (SM), tandem stance (TS), preferred speed walking (PW) and slow speed walking (SW) were assessed. Kinematic data recorded by a 12 camera motion capture system (Qualysis AB), and kinetic data collected from a single forceplate (AMTI) were used to compute net CoP. Because functional parameters can influence stability, strength obtained from a chair rise test and neural drive obtained from a foot tapping test were obtained. All results were assessed with paired t-tests (p. 05). For SMA, <b>average</b> <b>CoP</b> velocity (p=. 006) and excursions (p=. 023) increased, and average TtC (p=. 020) was reduced.

The thermal performance of slinky heat exchangers for the horizontal-coupled GSHP system for different coil diameters and slinky interval distances was investigated using a validated 3 D model. Results from a two month period of monitoring the performance of the GSHP system showed that the COP decreased with the running time. The <b>average</b> <b>COP</b> of the horizontal coupled GSHP was 2. 5. The numerical prediction showed that {{there was no significant difference}} in the specific heat extraction of the slinky heat exchanger at different coil diameters. However, the larger the diameter of coil, the higher the heat extraction per meter length of soil. The specific heat extraction also increased, but the heat extraction per meter length of soil decreased with the increase of coil central interval distance...|$|R
40|$|Geothermal {{heat pumps}} are broadly used in {{developed}} countries but scarcely in Brazil, in part {{because there is a}} lack of Brazilian soil temperature data. The aims of this work are: to present soil temperature measurements and to compare geothermal heat pump system performances with conventional air conditioning systems. Geothermal temperature measurement results are shown for ten Paraná State cities, representing different soil and climate conditions. The measurements were made yearlong with calibrated equipment and digital data acquisition system in different measuring stations. Geothermal and ambient temperature data were used for simulations of the coeficient of performance (COP), by means of a working fluid pressure-enthalpy diagram based software for vapor-compression cycle. It was verified that geothermal temperature measured between January 13 to October 13, 2013, varied from 16 to 24 °C, while room temperature has varied between 2 and 35 °C. <b>Average</b> <b>COP</b> values for conventional system were 3. 7 (cooling mode) and 5. 0 kW/kW (heating mode), corresponding to 5. 9 and 7. 9 kW/kW for geothermal system. Hence it was verified an average eficiency gain of 59 %with geothermal system utilization in comparison with conventional system...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{performance}} simulation of some hydrocarbon refrigerants (R 290, R 600 and R 600 a) as alternatives to R 134 a in refrigeration system with sub-cooling is conducted by thermodynamic calculation of performance parameters using the REFPROP software. The results obtained {{showed that the}} saturated vapour pressure and temperature characteristic profiles for R 600 and R 600 a {{are very close to}} that of R 134 a. The three hydrocarbon refrigerants exhibited very high refrigerating effect and condenser duty than R 134 a. The best of these parameters was obtained using R 600. The discharge temperatures obtained using R 600 and R 600 a were low, while that of R 290 was very much higher. The highest coefficient of performance (COP) and relative capacity index were obtained using R 600. <b>Average</b> <b>COPs</b> of R 600 and R 600 a are 4. 6 and 2. 2 % higher than that of R 134 a, respectively. The performances of R 600 and R 600 a in system were better than those of R 134 a and R 290. The best performance was obtained using R 600 in the system...|$|R
40|$|Trials were {{conducted}} to determine {{the performance of a}} commercial (Rotartica 045 v) 4. 5 -kW air-cooled, single effect LiBr/H 2 O absorption chiller for residential use. The experiments were run at La Poveda, Arganda del Rey, Madrid, in August 2005. Three typical August days, with different outdoor temperatures, were chosen for the study. The hot water inlet temperature in the generator varied throughout the day from 80 to 107 °C. Thermal demand was calculated, along with period energy balance and COP. Variations in machine component temperatures were recorded and chilling power and the daily COP calculated {{for each of the three}} days. The results for the period as a whole showed that cooling power tended to decline with rising outdoor dry bulb temperatures. At temperatures from 35 to 41. 3 °C the chilled water outlet temperature in the evaporator climbed to over 15 °C. The <b>average</b> <b>COP</b> for the period, when auxiliary equipment was included into the calculations, was 0. 37. This study was funded by the National Research Plan 2005 – 2007, under Research Project ENE 2005 - 08255 -CO 2 - 01. Peer reviewe...|$|R
