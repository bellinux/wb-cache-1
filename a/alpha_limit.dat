40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} 3 D cosmic shear to constrain massive neutrino parameters. We find that if the total mass is substantial (near the upper limits from LSS, but setting aside the Ly <b>alpha</b> <b>limit</b> for now), then 3 D cosmic shear + Planck is very sensitive to neutrino mass and one may expect that a next generation photometric redshift survey could constrain the number of neutrinos N_nu and the sum of their masses m_nu to an accuracy of dN_nu ~ 0. 08 and dm_nu ~ 0. 03 eV respectively. If in fact the masses are close to zero, then the errors weaken to dN_nu ~ 0. 10 and dm_nu~ 0. 07 eV. In either case there is a factor 4 improvement over Planck alone. We use a Bayesian evidence method to predict joint expected evidence for N_nu and m_nu. We find that 3 D cosmic shear combined with a Planck prior could provide `substantial' evidence for massive neutrinos {{and be able to}} distinguish `decisively' between many competing massive neutrino models. This technique should `decisively' distinguish between models in which there are no massive neutrinos and models in which there are massive neutrinos with |N_nu- 3 | > 0. 35 and m_nu > 0. 25 eV. We introduce the notion of marginalised and conditional evidence when considering evidence for individual parameter values within a multi-parameter model.

40|$|Fluid {{flows in}} nature and {{applications}} are frequently subject to periodic velocity modulations. Surprisingly, even for the generic case of flow through a straight pipe, there is little consensus regarding the influence of pulsation on the transition threshold to turbulence: while most studies predict a monotonically increasing threshold with pulsation frequency (i. e. Womersley number, alpha), others observe a decreasing threshold for identical parameters and only observe an increasing threshold at low alpha. In the present study we apply recent advances {{in the understanding of}} transition in steady shear flows to pulsating pipe flow. For moderate pulsation amplitudes we find that the first instability encountered is subcritical (i. e. requiring finite amplitude disturbances) and gives rise to localized patches of turbulence ('puffs') analogous to steady pipe flow. By monitoring the impact of pulsation on the lifetime of turbulence we map the onset of turbulence in parameter space. Transition in pulsatile flow can be separated into three regimes. At small Womersley numbers the dynamics is dominated by the decay turbulence suffers during the slower part of the cycle and hence transition is delayed significantly. As shown in this regime thresholds closely agree with estimates based on a quasi-steady flow assumption only taking puff decay rates into account. The transition point predicted in the zero <b>alpha</b> <b>limit</b> equals to the critical point for steady pipe flow offset by the oscillation Reynolds number (i. e. the dimensionless oscillation amplitude). In the high frequency limit on the other hand, puff lifetimes are identical to those in steady pipe flow and hence the transition threshold appears to be unaffected by flow pulsation. In the intermediate frequency regime the transition threshold sharply drops (with increasing alpha) from the decay dominated (quasi-steady) threshold to the steady pipe flow level...|$|E

40|$|It {{is assumed}} that cool star chromospheres are heated by {{mechanical}} energy dissipation that depends quasilinearly on density and cooled by radiation loss and it is shown that the basic properties of chromospheres {{are determined by the}} ionization of hydrogen. It is hydrogen ionization that provides the freedom for chromospheres to adjust their radiation losses to balance the prescribed heat input, resulting in an extended region of low temperature gradient. Chromospheric radiation losses in cool stars occur mainly in the strongest spectral lines at wavelengths greater than about 2000 A and the fraction of the chromosphere is effectively thin. The most important lines include Ca II H and K and the infrared triplet and Mg II h and k. The strong lines of other abundant species, are less important because their high excitation energies reduce the collisional excitation rates.

40|$|Commercially {{available}} lactose {{is generally}} {{available in the}} form of alpha lactose monohydrate. The dissolution of this is slow in comparison to other sugars due to lactose existing in solution as alpha and beta lactose. When alpha lactose monohydrate has dissolved up to the <b>alpha</b> lactose solubility <b>limit,</b> no more can dissolve until some of the alpha lactose in solution has mutarotated to beta lactose. This makes mutarotation and the solubility of alpha lactose the two main limiting factors in lactose dissolution. A variety of factors can affect the mutarotation rate and solubility of lactose. Temperature and pH affect both significantly. The effect of carbohydrates in solution on the solubility of alpha lactose is particularly important as it has been found that beta lactose inhibits the solubility of alpha lactose. Dissolution of alpha lactose may be considered to consist of three steps; surface disintegration from the crystal, dissolution into the bulk of solution, and mutarotation of alpha to beta in solution. Attempts to model this process have previously been unsuccessful. For dissolution to total lactose concentrations above the <b>alpha</b> lactose solubility <b>limit,</b> {{it was found that the}} effect of beta lactose on the solubility of alpha lactose had a significant effect on the dissolution of lactose.

We give a unified analysis of the entire three-parameter family using only abstract mapping properties of the principle dissipation and smoothing operators, and then use specific parameterizations to obtain the sharpest results. We first establish existence and regularity results, and under appropriate assumptions show uniqueness and stability. We then establish results for singular perturbations, including the inviscid and <b>alpha</b> <b>limits.</b> Next we show existence of a global attractor for the general model, and give estimates for its dimension.
