Premium examples are often blended with Malbec and produce full, tannic wines with leather and tobacco notes. In recent years, there have been increased plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon in the Uco Valley of the Mendoza Province; the wines coming from vineyards planted at higher altitudes garner some international attention.|$|E

In particular non native Turkey Oaks, which provide a habitat for damaging Gall wasps, are being removed. Cattle are also being used to manage the scrub and encourage the growth of flowers such as orchids.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{about six}} million people lived within the Columbia's {{drainage}} basin. Of this total about 2.4million {{people lived in}} Oregon, 1.7million in Washington, 1million in Idaho, half a million in British Columbia, and 0.4million in Montana. Population in the watershed has been rising for many decades and is projected to rise to about 10million by 2030. The highest population densities are found west of the Cascade Mountains along the I-5 corridor, especially in the Portland-Vancouver urban area. High densities are also found around Spokane, Washington, and Boise, Idaho. Although much of the watershed is rural and sparsely populated, areas with recreational and scenic values <b>are</b> <b>growing</b> rapidly. The central Oregon county of Deschutes is the fastest-growing in the state. Populations have also been growing {{just east of the}} Cascades in central Washington around the city of Yakima and the Tri-Cities area. Projections for the coming decades assume growth throughout the watershed, including the interior. The Canadian part of the Okanagan subbasin is also growing rapidly.|$|E
5|$|In 2020, the Jaeger Gipsy Danger, piloted by {{brothers}} Raleigh and Yancy Beckett, defends Anchorage {{from the}} Kaiju Knifehead. They both engage in combat, with Gipsy gaining {{the upper hand}} and defeating the Kaiju by blasting it with its plasma cannon. Unknown to them, the Kaiju is still alive. Knifehead then reemerges, ambushes them, critically damages Gipsy Danger by severing its left arm and throws Yancy out of the cockpit, killing him. Raleigh manages to pilot Gipsy alone, activating the remaining plasma cannon and finally killing Knifehead. Traumatized by Yancy’s death, Raleigh quits the Jaeger Program. In 2025, the world governments decide to end funding for the continuous construction of Jaegers, in favor of building massive coastal walls, but the Kaiju <b>are</b> <b>growing</b> more powerful, their attacks more frequent and Jaegers are being destroyed faster than they are built. The remaining four Jaegers are relocated to Hong Kong {{under the command of}} Marshal Stacker Pentecost, who plans to end the Kaiju War by destroying The Breach using a nuclear weapon.|$|E

In 2015, Silicon Alley generated over US$7.3 billion in venture capital investment, most based in Manhattan, as well as in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region. High technology startup companies and employment <b>are</b> <b>growing</b> in Manhattan and across New York City, bolstered by the city's emergence as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social tolerance, and environmental sustainability, as well as New York's position as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center in North America, including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines, the city's intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity. Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City.

5|$|The three remain undetected for two days, {{even as a}} {{probe and}} a group of the Martians {{themselves}} explore the basement. They also soon discover that the Martians <b>are</b> <b>growing</b> strange red-colored alien vegetation across the landscape and is quickly growing, covering trees and spreading into the basement, thus explaining the Martians' motives: to colonise Earth for their species, therefore making Earth a Mars-like planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing a Tripod harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the Martians to their location, Ray reluctantly kills him. The basement hideout is eventually exposed when a second probe catches them sleeping. Rachel is soon abducted by a nearby Tripod; Ray allows himself to be abducted, and is placed in the same cage with Rachel {{and a number of other}} prisoners. As the Tripod selects him for harvesting, Ray takes a belt of grenades into the machine in his place, having pulled out the pins. The Tripod is destroyed and releases the cage, with Ray and Rachel, and the other prisoners, making it out alive.|$|E
