5|$|BP in its 2017 Energy Outlook {{forecasts}} {{that the}} number of plug-in electric cars will rise from 1.2 million in 2015 to around 100 million by 2035 representing about 5.5% of the global fleet of passenger cars. Around 25% of these plug-in electric vehicles will be plug-in hybrids and 75% will be pure battery electric cars. The oil company also projects that <b>automotive</b> <b>fuel</b> demand for use in cars will continue to rise, despite efficiency improvements in conventional internal combustion engines and increased plug-in car adoption due to growth in demand for car travel from the growing middle class in emerging economies.|$|E

25|$|Ethanol {{was used}} as lamp fuel in the United States as early as 1840, but a tax levied on {{industrial}} alcohol during the Civil War made this use uneconomical. The tax was repealed in 1906.

25|$|In {{order to}} realize the {{benefits}} provided, such as adsorption, by MOFs hydrogen cannot be stored in them at densities greater than its liquid-phase density. The {{extent to which a}} gas can adsorb to a MOF's surface depends on the temperature and pressure of the gas. In general, adsorption increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure (until a maximum is reached, typically 20-30bar, after which the adsorption capacity decreases)., However, MOFs to be used for hydrogen storage in <b>automotive</b> <b>fuel</b> cells need to operate efficiently at ambient temperature and pressures between 1 and100 bar, as these are the values that are deemed safe for automotive applications.|$|E

25|$|It {{was thought}} {{that most of the}} nationalised {{railways}} (excluding some freight services) would cease to operate like other unprofitable privatised businesses in the UK, and British Rail's profitability was questioned. Although the company was considered the sole public-transport option in many rural areas, the Beeching cuts made buses the only public transport available in some rural areas. Despite increases in traffic congestion and <b>automotive</b> <b>fuel</b> prices beginning to rise in the 1990s, British Rail remained unprofitable. Following sectorisation, InterCity became profitable. This sector became the first long distance passenger railway in the UK to go into profit.

500|$|The {{design of}} the Pinto fuel system was {{complicated}} by the uncertain regulatory environment during the development period. [...] The first federal standard for <b>automotive</b> <b>fuel</b> system safety, passed in 1967, known as Section 301 in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, initially only considered front impacts. [...] In January 1969, 18 months into the Pinto's development cycle, the NHTSA proposed expanding the standard to cover rear-end collisions. [...] The proposed standard {{was based on a}} 20mph moving-barrier rear impact test. Ford publicly announced it supported the standard. In August 1970, the month the Pinto went into production, the NHTSA changed the proposal to a more stringent 20mph fixed-barrier standard which car companies were to meet in 18 months. The fixed-barrier standard was seen by the auto industry as a significant increase in test severity. At the same time the NHTSA announced a long-term goal of setting a 30-mph fixed-barrier standard. [...] Due to the confusion related to the various proposed standards and an expectation that the NHTSA would not select the more stringent 30mph fixed-barrier standard, Ford elected to voluntarily meet the 20mph moving-barrier standard for all cars by 1973. [...] Ford and other automobile manufacturers objected to the more stringent fuel system safety standard and filed objections during the required comment periods of the proposed regulations.|$|E
