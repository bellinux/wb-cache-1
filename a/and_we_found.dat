25|$|In {{addition}} to claims of bias, researchers and investigators have {{found evidence of}} fraud. In 1995, the state of Oklahoma conducted {{an investigation into the}} WHD-provided prevailing wages being used in state projects. Oklahoma had a Little Davis-Bacon law that, in an attempt to save on administrative costs, adopted the federal standards. When the state office was notified that some rates had increased 162%, it requested information from the WHD. The WHD denied the Oklahoma Department of Labor access to the survey forms used to determine the wages, so the Oklahoma Department of Labor undertook a criminal investigation. According to Brenda Reneau, then-Commissioner of the Oklahoma Department of Labor, “This investigation found that grossly inaccurate information had been reported to the Federal Government by what the U.S. Department of Labor calls interested third parties. We found inflated numbers of employees on projects, inflated wage rates reported for these same non-existent workers <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> projects that were never built. We also noticed {{what appears to be a}} pattern in the reporting method on many of the wage survey forms, as our visual presentation will show here today.” In response to this, “a follow-up investigation conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor confirms that not only was a great deal of inaccurate information reported, as we had alleged, but U.S. Department of Labor documents show certain unions in Oklahoma City as the parties who submitted that information. It appears that false information may have been submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor in an attempt, purposefully, to inflate Davis-Bacon wage rates.” In the wake of the state investigations, the WHD withdrew many prevailing wage findings for the state, and the Oklahoma Supreme Court found their Little Davis–Bacon statute to be in violation of the state constitution.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{elected to}} push on and record 1997's Aftertaste as a three-piece. A {{first version of}} the album was {{withdrawn}} at last minute {{in the fall of}} 1996 when promotional activities had already begun. Eventually, release was delayed to March 1997 for a new audio mix, and the guitarist Chris Traynor (formerly of Orange 9mm) was recruited for the supporting tour. Although the song [...] "Exactly What You Wanted" [...] became a moderate radio hit, the album spent only a few weeks on the Billboard 200 and has sold 135,000 copies as of April 2006. The Aftertaste Tour in 1997–98 would prove to be the band's last. Amid long-standing private disputes, the members decided to call it quits. Asked about the breakup, Hamilton replied, [...] "9 years, 1,600 shows, 5 albums, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> it hard to look at each other anymore" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{wreckage}} {{was spread}} over two miles, {{with a cold}} north wind and ice and {{snow on the ground}} combined with a narrow access road made rescue difficult. The fire brigade station officer said it had taken them half an hour to find the wreckage. The National Trust chief ranger with four of his staff were first on the scene reported [...] "Ten bodies were scattered about <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> two men alive. One was outside the aircraft and {{did not seem to be}} very badly hurt. The other was pulled from inside the smashed fuselage and was only semi-conscious." [...] Two passengers were rescued but one died in hospital later; [...] all the others on board were killed. [...] The location was close to the same spot a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress had crashed during World War II.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kerouac, On the Road [...] "was {{really a}} story about two Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> him. I found him in the sky, in Market Street San Francisco (those 2 visions), and Dean (Neal) had God {{sweating}} out of his forehead all the way. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT FOR THE HOLY MAN: HE MUST SWEAT FOR GOD. And once he has found Him, the Godhood of God is forever Established and really must not be spoken about." [...] According to his [...] biographer, historian Douglas Brinkley, On the Road has been misinterpreted as a tale of companions out looking for kicks, {{but the most important}} thing to comprehend is that Kerouac was an American Catholic author – for example, virtually every page of his diary bore a sketch of a crucifix, a prayer, or an appeal to Christ to be forgiven.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, she {{starred in}} the Joyce Bernal-directed comedy-drama Don't Give Up on Us, her first film in nearly a year. The film was the fourth {{appearance}} of Santos and Pascual after Kahit Isang Saglit, Bakit 'Di Totohanin, and Till There Was You. Santos' character – Abby Trinidad – a competitive and ambitious over-achiever who journeys La Trinidad, Benguet and Baguio City with a ruthless determination to persuade her best friend from not withdrawing the engagement to her brother. The film was a commercial success with revenue of Php129million. It received mixed to positive reviews, with Santos' performance earning praise; FemaleNetwork.com remarked, [...] "If there's one thing we love about her [...] acting, it's that she always makes her characters approachable and believable. Abby was no exception, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> ourselves appreciating her determined and steadfast character as she went on a journey.". Following Don't Give Up on Us, Santos appeared opposite Pascual in the television drama Sa Piling Mo, the former portrayed Jennifer Limbaga, a street-smart cockfighting expert forced to assume a new identity as wife of a prominent magnate. The show won a PMPC Star Award for Television and received a nomination at the 36th International Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series.|$|E

2500|$|After Kerouac {{dropped out}} of Columbia University, he served on several {{different}} sailing vessels before returning to New York to write. [...] He met and mixed with Beat Generation figures Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, and Neal Cassady. Between 1947 and 1950, while writing what would become The Town and the City (1950), Kerouac engaged in the road adventures that would form On the Road. Kerouac carried small notebooks, in which much of the text was written as the eventful span of road trips unfurled. He started working {{on the first of}} several versions of the novel as early as 1948, based on experiences during his first long road trip in 1947. However, he remained dissatisfied with the novel. Inspired by a 10000-word rambling letter from his friend Neal Cassady, Kerouac in 1950 outlined the [...] "Essentials of Spontaneous Prose" [...] and decided {{to tell the story of}} his years on the road with Cassady as if writing a letter to a friend in a form that reflected the improvisational fluidity of jazz. In a letter to a student in 1961, Kerouac wrote: [...] "Dean and I were embarked on a journey through post-Whitman America to [...] that America and to [...] the inherent goodness in American man. [...] It was really a story about 2 Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God. [...] <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> him." ...|$|E
