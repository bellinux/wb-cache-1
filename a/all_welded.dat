25|$|MV Okanagan {{was built}} in 1946 by West Coast Ltd. Shipbuilders. It was <b>all</b> <b>welded</b> steel with a diesel engine, and had 800 horsepower. The vessel was {{designed}} and built at Vancouver, then broken into pieces and shipped to the Okanagan Landing shipyard to be reassembled. It was 110ft. long, 24ft. wide, 12ft. 6 in. deep, and had a draft of 10ft. The Okanagan had an eight-cylinder diesel engine and electric pumps. The engine had two Vivian backups, which were generators {{that were used to}} prestart the engine, preheat oil, provide electricity, and fill the air compressor tanks. Everything except for the hull, engine, and motors was made in British Columbia.|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} settlers (of Thanjavur) {{included both}} Brahmins and Marathas, and {{by reason of}} their isolation from their distant home, the sub-divisions which separated these castes in their mother-country were forgotten, and they were <b>all</b> <b>welded</b> together under the common name of Deshasthas. The Brahmin migrants and the Maratha migrants both call themselves [...] "Deshasthas" [...] as both groups migrated to Tanjore from the Desh region of Maharashtra, but till today maintain their separate identities, despite the common [...] "Deshastha" [...] tag. Today's Marathi speaking Thanjavur population are descendants of the Marathi speaking immigrants who immigrated to Tamil Nadu in the 17th and 18th centuries. The isolation from their homeland has almost made them culturally and linguistically alien to Brahmins in Maharashtra.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} project was the optimization of matching welding consumables for the GTAW (as tungsten arc welding), SMAW (shield metal-arc welding) and SAW (submerged-arc welding) process. Principally, the long-term properties should be ascertained in comparison with both of the parent metals. The staring point of the investigations were the ranges of chemical composition and minimum requirements for mechanical properties of both the parent metals E 911 and P 92. To ensure sufficient toughness, the analyses of the consumables were slightly modified {{in comparison with the}} parent metals. Having ensured sufficient toughness of the <b>all</b> <b>weld</b> metal after welding (at least 41 J at room temperature with as short as possible post weld heat treatment), the long-term properties in not only that <b>all</b> <b>weld</b> metal but also the weld joint were ascertained. At the time of reporting, trial results for long-term investigations up to 18, 000 hours for the <b>all</b> <b>weld</b> metal and 30, 000 hours for the weld joints were available. (orig.)

500|$|The submariners had {{won over}} Navy strategists, but their {{equipment}} {{was not yet}} capable of handling their secret mission. [...] The challenge of designing appropriate new boats became a high priority by 1934, and was solved in 1936 as the first new long-range, <b>all</b> <b>welded</b> submarines were launched. Even better were the S-class Salmon class (launched in 1937), and its successors the T-class or Tambor submarines of 1939 and the Gato class of 1940. The new models cost about $5–6 million each. At 300 feet in length and 1500 tons, they were twice {{as big as the}} German U-boats, but still highly maneuverable. In only 35 seconds they could crash dive to 60 feet. The superb Mark 3 TDC Torpedo Data Computer (an analog computer) took data from periscope or sonar readings on the target's bearing, range and angle on the bow, and continuously set the course and proper gyroscope angle for a salvo of torpedoes until the moment of firing. Six forward tubes and 4 aft were ready for the 24 Mk-14 [...] "fish" [...] the subs carried. Cruising on the surface at 20 knots (using 4 diesel engines) or maneuvering underwater at 8-10 knots (using battery-powered electric motors) they could circle around slow-moving merchant ships. New steels and welding techniques strengthened the hull, enabling the subs to dive as deep as 400 feet in order to avoid depth charges. Expecting long cruises the 65 crewmen enjoyed good living conditions, complete with frozen steaks and air conditioning to handle the hot waters of the Pacific. The new subs could remain at sea for 75 days, and cover 10,000 miles, without resupply. The submariners thought they were ready—but they had two hidden flaws. The penny-pinching atmosphere of the 1930s produced hypercautious commanders and defective torpedoes. Both would have to be replaced in World War II.|$|E
