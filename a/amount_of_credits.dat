A 2007 law stated the tax credits {{could be used by}} any company that established itself in the Eastern region of the city, providing a credit of R$0.60 per R$1.00 invested. A new law was passed by the city legislature to deal specifically with this stadium and reduce the incentives, linking the concession of the credits to hosting the World Cup opening match and limiting the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> to R$420million. The concession was justified by the expectation that the stadium will generate R$950 million in city taxes during the six years after its opening. R$530 million in excess of the tax credits were given. The financing contract with BNDES was signed on 29 November 2013, under their ProCopas Arenas World Cup program.

40|$|Rural {{financing}} in Thailand {{is heavily}} dependent on bank lending. Therefore, understanding the determinants of bank lending in the rural sector is an important element for promoting the development <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> accessibility to Thai farmers in the rural regions. Appropriate bank lending decisions would reduce lending costs and increase repayment rate and profits to the banks. Thus, a well-developed rural financial market would lead to sustainable development in the rural sector. The purpose {{of this research is}} to identify critical factors in the bank lending decision and to investigate what factors affect the credit availability and loan price in rural lending in Thailand. This research also investigates the impact of the relationship lending (i. e., the relationship between the bank and the borrower) and the predictive power among the different estimation techniques in predicting the bank lending decision, <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> granted, and interest rate charged. The data used in this research are obtained from the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative (BAAC). During the period of 2001 to 2003, a total <b>of</b> 18, 798 <b>credit</b> files under the normal loan scheme are made available. The credit files are analyzed using the logistic regression (Logit), multiple linear regression (MLR), and four different types of the artificial neural networks (ANN), namely multi-layer feed-forward neural networks (MLFN), Ward networks (WD), general regression neural networks (GRNN), and probabilistic neural networks (PNN). The results show that the total asset value (Asset), value of collateral (Collateral), and the length of the bank-borrower relationship (Duration) are crucial factors in determining bank lending decision, <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> granted, and interest rate charged. As expected, Asset has a positive impact on the bank lending decision and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> granted, while Collateral has a positive and a negative influence on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> granted and the interest rate charged, respectively. However, Collateral has no significant impact on the bank lending decision, while Asset has a significant negative impact on the loan price in some specifications. Duration has a significant negative impact on bank lending decision, <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> granted, and interest rate charged, which implies the importance of relationship lending in the Thailand rural financial market. However, the negative relationships between Duration and the bank lending decision, and between Duration and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> granted, contradict the postulated hypothesizes. The results imply that the bank uses information from the borrowers and monitors the lending risk via the lending decision and <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> granted. On the other hand, the relationship lending benefits the borrowers via loan pricing since the borrowers with a long term relationship with the bank receive a lower lending rate. The predictive results of both in-sample and out-of-sample on bank lending decision, <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> granted, and interest rate charged show that in terms of predictive accuracy, most of the artificial neural networks models outperform the logistic and the multiple regression models. The empirical results also show the superiority of using the PNN model to classify and screen the loan applications, and the GRNN model to determine the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> granted and interest rate charged...|$|R

While generous state-level bankruptcy exemptions are probably viewed by most policymakers as benefitting less-well-off borrowers, our results {{using data from the}} 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances suggest they increase the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> held by high-asset households and reduce the availability and <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> to low-asset households, conditioning on observable characteristics. We also find evidence that interest rates on automobile loans for low-asset households are higher in high exemption states. Thus, bankruptcy exemptions redistribute credit toward borrowers with high assets. ...|$|R

50|$|The actual {{computational}} difficulty {{needed to}} run a given work unit {{is the basis for}} the number <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> that should be granted.

In so doing, BOINC uses benchmarks to measure the speed of a system, combining that figure with the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time required for a work unit to be processed. The interface then can “guess” at the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> a user should receive. Since systems have many variables, including the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> RAM, the processor speed, and specific architectures of different motherboards and CPUs, there can be wide discrepancies in the number <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> that different computers (and projects) judge a user to have earned.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the use <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> derivatives by US bank holding companies with assets {{in excess of}} one billion dollars from 1999 to 2005. Using the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Bank Holding Company Database, we find that in 2005 the gross notional <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> derivatives held by banks exceeds the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> loans on their books. Only 23 large banks out <b>of</b> 395 use <b>credit</b> derivatives and most of their derivatives positions are held for dealer activities rather than for hedging of loans. The net notional <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> derivatives used for hedging of loans in 2005 represents less than 2 % of the total notional <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> derivatives held by banks and less than 2 % of their loans. Banks hedge less risky loans more than riskier ones. The banks {{are more likely to}} be net protection buyers if they have lower capital ratios, a lower net interest rate margin, engage in asset securitization, originate foreign loans, have more commercial and industrial loans in their portfolio, and have fewer agricultural loans. We conclude that the use <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> derivatives by banks to hedge loans is limited because of adverse selection and moral hazard problems and because of the inability of banks to use hedge accounting when hedging with credit derivatives. Our evidence raises important questions about the validity of the often-held view that the use <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> derivatives makes banks sounder. ...|$|R
