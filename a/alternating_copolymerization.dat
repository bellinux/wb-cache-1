50|$|In {{recent years}} many {{industrial}} efforts {{have focused on}} tuning the color of lights using polyfluorenes. It was found that by doping green or red emitting materials into polyfluorenes one could tune the color emitted by the polymers. Since polyfluorene homopolymers emit higher energy blue light, they can transfer energy via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to lower energy emitters. In addition to doping, color of polyfluorenes can be tuned by copolymerizing the fluorene monomers with other low band gap monomers. Researchers at the Dow Chemical Company synthesized several fluorene-based copolymers by <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerization</b> using 5,5-dibromo-2,2-bithiophene which showed yellow emission and 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, which showed green emission. Other copolymerizations are also suitable; researchers at IBM performed random copolymerization of fluorene with 3,9(10)-dibromoperylene,4,4-dibromo-R-cyanostilbene, and 1,4-bis(2-(4-bromophenyl)-1-cyanovinyl)-2-(2-ethylhexyl)-5-methoxybenzene. Only {{a small amount of}} the co-monomer, approximately 5%, was needed to tune the emission of the polyfluorene from blue to yellow. This example further illustrates that by introducing monomers that have a lower band gap than the fluorene monomer, one can tune the color that is emitted by the polymer.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{two major}} topics: the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of bulky monomers and the radical-mediated hydrophosphonation of olefins. The {{research into the}} ROMP of bulky monomers is further divided into three chapters: wedge-shaped monomers, the <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerization</b> of 1 -methyloxanorbornene derivatives with cyclooctene, and the kinetic resolution polymerization of 1 -methyloxanorbornene derivatives. The wedge-shaped monomers can be polymerized into diblock copolymers that possess photonic crystal properties.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of heterodinuclear complexes, especially those comprising early-late transition metals coordinated {{by a simple}} or symmetrical ancillary ligand, represents a fundamental challenge {{and an opportunity to}} prepare catalysts benefitting from synergic properties. Here, two new mixed titanium(IV) -zinc(II) complexes, [LTi(OiPr) 2 ZnEt] and[LTi(OiPr) 2 ZnPh], both coordinated by a diphenolate tetra(amine) macrocyclic ligand (L), are prepared. The synthesis benefits from the discovery that reaction of the ligand with a single equivalent of titanium tetrakis(iso-propoxide) allows the efficient formation of a mono-Ti(IV) complex, [LTi(OiPr) 2]. All new complexes are characterized by a combination of single crystal X-ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry techniques. The two heterobimetallic complexes, [LTi(OiPr) 2 ZnEt] and [LTi(OiPr) 2 ZnPh], feature trianionic coordination by the macrocyclic ligand and bridging alkoxide groups coordinate to both the different metal centres. The heterodinuclear catalysts are compared to the mono-titanium analogue, [LTi(OiPr) 2], in various polymerization reactions. In the <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerizations</b> of carbon dioxide and cyclohexene oxide, the mono-titanium complex is totally inactive whilst the heterodinuclear complexes show moderate activity (TOF = 3 h- 1); it should be noted the activity is measured using just 1 bar pressure of carbon dioxide.

40|$|Over {{the last}} couple of years, {{replacing}} of petroleum-based products by biodegradable and biorenewable plastics has been burgeoning interests in polymer science. Large portions of trash in landfills are mostly petroleum based polymer materials, such as plastic bags and bottles. The degradability of these petroleum based materials takes a very long time, like thousands of years. Polyglycolic acid (PGA) {{is one of the most}} known biodegradable polymer, which is traditionally synthesized through anionic polymerization of glycolide (mostly with tin ocatanoate catalyst). Despite this route has been the best option for having higher yields and molecular weights; the need to use very expensive glycolide monomer is the limitation for the larger scale production of PGA for industry. The main objective of this research is to find an alternative way to synthesize Polyglycolic acid (PGA) and its copolymers that derive from sustainable C 1 feedstocks, particularly formaldehyde and carbonmonoxide. The idea of the project consisted of the cationic <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerizations</b> of trioxane (as a formaldehyde resource) and carbonmonoxide (CO) to produce PGA. This method constitutes cost-effective and efficient path for the synthesis of PGA from perfectly <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerizations</b> of formaldehyde and CO. PGA was successfully synthesized up to 92 % of yield by using triflic acid (TfOH) catalyst under 800 psi CO pressure at 170 oC in three days. Although very high conversion was observed from the copolymerization, the number average molecular weights of the products exhibited oligomeric glycolic acid (GA) structures. Therefore, polycondensation of oligoGA was applied by Zn(OAc) 2. 2 H 2 O catalyst, and Mn was raised up to 700 KDa. The polymer from CO and H 2 CO is sufficiently similar to that prepared from glycolide that it can be readily substituted for the PGA prepared from glycolide. The products show nearly identical 13 C NMR spectra, free of acetal carbon signals, are observed for commercial PGA and the PGA from the C 1 feedstocks. To improve on the physical properties of PGA (such as melting temperature and appearance) terpolymerizations of trioxane, CO and a minor amount of epoxides were performed at the same reaction condition as PGA synthesis. By controlling the comonomer feed ratios and the polymerization temperatures, high quality PGA can be prepared. The method is extended to copolymers of PGA where alkylene oxides or cyclic ether comonomers are included into the polymerization mixture with the C 1 monomers to yield polyester-ether thermoplastics. The melting temperatures of all terpolymers are also lower, and the colors have become lighter than the commercial PGA. Polymer solubility increased by increasing length of the side chains of epoxides. One of the products has indicated similar thermal properties to isotactic polypropylene. The PGA based copolymers will not only replace existing petroleum based materials, but will do so with improved thermal characteristics. The needs of applying very high CO pressure and high temperature for the polymerization directed us to discover transition metal assisted copolymerization of formaldehyde and CO. There is a need to find new catalyst systems that exhibit higher activity to decrease polymerization time, temperature or CO pressure. Some of our efforts involved Co 2 (CO) 8 / 3 -hydroxypyridine catalyst system for this copolymerization, but this catalyst system seems to be not an effective catalyst for the copolymerization. After testing several catalyst systems, scandium triflate [Sc(OTf) 3] catalyst exhibited very good activity towards the cationic copolymerization of trioxane with carbonmonoxide (CO) for the production of PGA from up to 78 % of yield. Sc(OTf) 3 is an environmentally friendly catalyst and can be recycled from the reaction media. These present important advantages for a catalyst system, and polymerization will be a very convenient alternative way to produce PGA...|$|R
40|$|This thesis adapted {{tools of}} organic and {{organometallic}} chemistry to achieve control over synthetic macromolecular architectures, {{with a focus}} on the systematic incorporation of polar and nonpolar chemical entities into polymers, and test these amphiphilic polymers for their interactions with living cells, bacterial and mammalian. ^ The development of highly active well-defined catalyst systems for olefin metathesis, and their influence on the development of ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) has been a major inspiration behind our synthetic strategy towards the preparation of model amphiphilic polymer architectures {{with a high level of}} structural control. The first synthetic approach was the investigation of ring-opening metathesis copolymerization of polar and nonpolar cyclic olefins as monomers. This study leads to the discovery of <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerizations</b> of a series of polar cyclic olefins with nonpolar cyclic olefins using ruthenium-based homogeneous catalyst system. Mechanistic studies revealed that steric factors induced from comonomer structures and catalyst type affect the degree of alternation on the polymer backbone. This novel technique allows for the strictly alternating incorporation of polar and nonpolar monomeric units into polymer chains of various lengths, and facilitates the polymerization of sterically encumbered monomers and modification of final material properties. ^ In a second synthetic approach, a general strategy was developed for the assembly of polar and nonpolar domains into a modular monomer structure. The character and size of each domain can be tuned independently and locked into the repeating unit of the amphiphilic polymers resulting from ROMP of the modular norbornene derivatives. Living ROMP of these monomers provided access to a large range of molecular weights with narrow molecular weight distributions. ^ Lipid membrane disruption activities, a key feature of amphiphilic polymers used in many biomedical applications, were investigated for amphiphilic polynorbornene derivatives against liposomes. Water-soluble amphiphilic cationic polynorbornene derivatives, which exhibited the highest level of activities against liposome membranes, were then probed for their antibacterial activities in growth inhibition assays and hemolytic activities against human red blood cells in order to determine the selectivity of the polymers for bacterial over mammalian cells. By tuning the overall hydrophobicity of the polymer, highly selective, non-hemolytic antibacterial activities were obtained. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAfter an {{introduction}} reporting the properties and the applications of fluoropolymers, {{the advantages and}} uses of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are presented. According to the nature {{and the amount of}} the comonomer, the copolymers of VDF can be thermoplastic 1, 2, elastomeric 2 or thermoplastic elastomers 3. Usually, they exhibit a random structure. This presentation, illustrated by numerous examples, shows a browse of copolymers of VDF with non-halogenated, fluorinated 4, commercially available or synthesized 4 - 6 comonomers. The interest of these last ones lies on their structure and on their functionality that enable these comonomers to be more or less easily incorporated in the copolymer. Consequently, they introduce reactive side groups that greatly improve the crosslinking of the obtained copolymers. This is the case of monomers exhibiting a F 2 C=CFX(CF 2) x(CH 2) y- structure where X, x, y and stand for O, «-»; 0, 1, 2; 1 - 10 and a function such as OH, OAc, SAc, CO 2 R 6, SF 5 5, Si(OR) 3 7, respectively. In addition, recent investigation on the unexpected <b>alternating</b> radical <b>copolymerization</b> of VDF with -trifluoromethacrylic acid was achieved, in emulsion, even without any surfactant 6. The kinetics of copolymerization 3 of (VDF, M) couples where M designates a commercial or synthesized comonomer led to the assessment of the reactivity ratios.

The aluminum salen complex exhibits exceptional selectivity against transesterification and epimerization side reactions, which allows these copolymerizations to be run to full conversion. The resulting polyesters are highly alternating and have high molecular weights and narrow polydispersities. Finally, we report an optimized process for the copolymerization of less bulky tricyclic anhydrides with excess PO that achieves full monomer conversion with minimal side reactions to produce well-defined aliphatic polyesters. The rates of undesirable transesterification and epimerization are controlled by i) the ratio of aluminum salen complex to cocatalyst and ii) the Lewis acidity of the aluminum salen complex. Optimal selectivity and activity are achieved through a careful balance of these two parameters. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} {{and use of}} abundant naturally occurring com-pounds for chemical synthesis is an important strategy for reducing our dependence on petroleum-derived raw materials. 1, 2 The use of carbon dioxide as an inexpensive C 1 feedstock is of particular note, especially for the <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerization</b> with epoxides. 3 While the use of CO 2 does carry several benefits, such as low toxicity and general abundance, most epoxide/CO 2 copolymerization systems focus on petroleum derivatives such as propylene oxide or cyclohexene oxide. 3 While new substrates have been explored, 4 the use of epoxides based on biorenewable resources has not been reported. Given our previous work on the copolymerization of epoxides and CO 2 using â-diiminate (BDI) zinc complexes, 5 we focused on limonene oxide (1), derived from the naturally occurring cyclic monoterpene, limonene. Produced by more than 300 plants, limonene is the most commo...|$|E

The presentation of the results will be arranged into the following sections: (1) hydroxyl containing polyesters, that comprise polymerization products based on racemic and optically active glyceric acid, or attained by polyaddition reactions among cyclic anhydrides, including also carbon dioxide, with monoglycidyl ethers of reversibly protected polyols. In this class are also presented the related polyhydroxylated systems obtained by selective grafting functional epoxides on cyclodextrins. (2) Bioerodible carboxyl containing plolymeric systems as derived from the <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerization</b> of maleic anhydride with alkyl vinyl ethers followed by partial esterification of maleic anhydride groups. (3) Linear and cross-linked functional polymers of synthetic and semisynthetic origin with hydrogel forming capability.

40|$|Synthetic {{routes to}} new (salen) CoX (salen = N,N'-bis(salicylidene) - 1, 2 -diaminoalkane; X = halide or carboxylate) epoxide/CO 2 {{copolymerization}} catalysts are described, and the X-ray crystal structures of (R,R) -(salen- 1) CoCl (2. 4) and rac-(salen- 1) CoI are presented. The (salen) CoX series are highly active catalysts for the <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerization</b> of propylene oxide (PO) and CO 2, yielding poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) with no detectable propylene carbonate byproduct. The PPC generated using these catalyst systems is highly regioregular with 92 - 99 % carbonate linkages and a narrow molecular weight distribution. Inclusion of organic-based, ionic or Lewis basic cocatalysts with (salen) CoX catalysts {{results in a}} remarkable activity enhancement for the copolymerization. In the case of (R,R) -(salen- 1) CoOBzF 5 (2. 3) with [PPN][OBzF 5] (3. 1), an unprecedented catalytic activity exceeding 700 turnovers per hour is achieved for the copolymerization of rac-PO and CO 2, yielding iso-enriched, regioregular PPC. When the rac-PO/CO 2 copolymerization is carried out with catalyst system 2. 3 /[PPN]Cl at - 20 C, a krel of 9. 7 for (S) - over (R) -PO is observed. The stereochemistry of the monomer and catalyst used in the copolymerization has dramatic effects on catalytic activity and the PPC microstructure. Using catalyst (R,R) -(salen- 1) CoBr (2. 5) with (S) -PO/CO 2 generates highly regioregular, isotactic PPC, whereas using (R) -PO/CO 2 with the same catalyst gives an almost completely regiorandom copolymer. The rac-PO/CO 2 copolymerization catalyzed by rac-(salen- 1) CoBr (2. 30) yields syndio-enriched PPC, a novel PPC microstructure. 	The (salen) CoX systems are also successful catalysts for the <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerization</b> of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and CO 2, yielding syndiotactic poly(cyclohexene carbonate) (PCHC), a previously unreported PCHC microstructure. Variation of the salen ligand and reaction conditions, {{as well as the}} inclusion of organic-based, ionic cocatalysts, has dramatic effects on the polymerization rate and the resultant PCHC tacticity. Catalyst rac-(salen- 2) CoBr (4. 6) has the highest activity for CHO/CO 2 copolymerization, yielding syndiotactic PCHCs with 81 % r-centered tetrads. Using Bernoullian statistical methods, PCHC tetrad and triad sequences were assigned in the 13 C{ 1 H} NMR spectra of these polymers in the carbonyl and methylene regions, respectively...|$|E

The norbornyl palladium complexes in the formula of {[RHNCH 2 (o-C 6 H 4 N) ]Pd(C 7 H 10 Me) (NCMe) }(BF 4) (R = iPr (2 a), tBu (2 b), Ph (2 c), 2, 6 -Me 2 C 6 H 3 (2 d), 2, 6 -iPr 2 C 6 H 3 (2 e)) were synthesized via single insertion of norbornene into the corresponding methylpalladium complexes 1 a– 1 e, respectively. Both square planar methyl and norbornyl palladium complexes exhibit facile equilibria of geometrical isomerization, via sterically-controlled amino decoordination–recoordination of amino–pyridine. Kinetic studies of E-insertion, N-insertion of complexes 1 and 2, and the geometric isomerization reactions have been examined by means of VT-NMR, and found in excellent agreement with the results estimated by DFT calculations. The more facile N-insertion in the cis-isomers, and ready geometric isomerization, cooperatively lead to a new mechanism that accounts for the novel catalytic formation of alternating COC...|$|E
40|$|The {{copolymerization}} reaction between N-tert-butylacrylamide (NTBA) and {{maleic anhydride}} (MA) in p-dioxane solution at 65 °C using 2, 2 ′-azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator in nitrogen atmosphere was carried out. The chemical {{structure of the}} obtained copolymers {{from a wide range}} of monomer feeds was determined by elemental analysis (content of N for NTBA units), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. Also, the amounts of MA units in the copolymers were found using the chemical titration method. An observed tendency toward <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerization</b> at ≤ 50 mol% NTBA concentration in monomer feed and relatively high activity of NTBA growing radical was explained by H-bond formation between C=O (anhydride) and NH (amide) fragments during chain growth reactions. Intrinsic viscosity and the molecular weights of the synthesized copolymers depend on the type of comonomer and the amount of NTBA units in the copolymers. The synthesized poly(NTBA-MA) s containing a functional amphiphilic group show both temperature and pH sensitivity and can be used for biological proposes as a physiologically active macromolecular system...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{series of}} novel {{symmetric}} and asymmetric salphen cobalt (III) complexes with different counteranions (trichloroacetate, dinitrophenolate, pentafluorobenzoate and acetate) was synthesized {{and used as}} catalysts in copolymerization of CO 2 with propylene oxide (PO) and cyclohexene oxide (CHO). Hexacoordinated structure of complexes adducts was found in solid phase. The effect of catalyst structure, temperature, CO 2 pressure, catalyst/cocatalyst ratio on overall activity and selectivity was investigated. Synthesized salphen-Co (III) complexes were effective for both PO/CO 2 and CHO/CO 2 highly <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerization.</b> Substitution of phenylene framework of salphen ligand by chlorine atom led to decrease of activity in PO/CO 2 copolymerization. Complexes with trichloroacetate counteranion were shown {{to be the most}} active and selective in PO/CO 2 copolymerization leading to poly(propylenecarbonate) with highest molar mass. On contrary, catalytic performance of salphen Co (III) complexes in CHO/CO 2 copolymerization was almost independent on ligand structure and counteranion. Excellent selectivity to poly(cyclohexenecarbonate) was achieved even at 0. 1 MPa CO 2. MALDI-TOF analysis of polycarbonates was used to investigate the initiation step of the copolymerization...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{high-resolution}} electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (HR ESI MS) access route leading to in-depths {{insight into the}} spontaneous zwitterionic copolymerization mechanism between cyclic imino ethers (i. e. 2 -methyl- 2 -oxazoline (MeOx), 2 -ethyl- 2 -oxazoline (EtOx) or 2 -ethyl- 2 -oxazine (EtOz)) with acrylic acid (AA), exploiting the characteristic species accumulating during the copolymerization as well as tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). We demonstrate preferences in α,ω-end group formation by screening various feed ratios of cyclic imino ethers and acrylic acid (e. g. MeOx:AA = 1 : 1; MeOx:AA = 2 : 1; MeOx:AA = 1 : 2). Critically, a calibration curve – based on AA-MeOx-AA dimer – was established allowing for semi-quantitative determination of the end group ratios with different feed ratios of acrylic acid. The formation of, previously suggested, alternating copolymers was confirmed by MS/MS experiments. Deviations from an ideal alternating composition were found to decrease from MeOx to EtOx to EtOz. The results of (semi-quantitative) HR ESI MS and MS/MS measurements suggest, {{for the first time}} presented in such precision, a polymerization mechanism for the spontaneous zwitterionic (<b>alternating)</b> <b>copolymerization</b> indicating optimal monomer ratios and pairings...|$|E
40|$|Different poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) microstructures {{have been}} {{synthesized}} from the <b>alternating</b> <b>copolymerization</b> of CO 2 with both racemic propylene oxide (PO) and various mixtures of PO enantiomers using chiral salen catalysts. The microstructures of the obtained copolymers {{as a function}} of polymerization time have been analyzed by a combination of chiral GC and high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. The 13 C NMR spectra of selected poly(propylene carbonate) samples were recorded using a 900 MHz (1 H) spectrometer, showing a previously unreported fine splitting of the carbonate resonances. This allowed a detailed assignment of signals for various copolymer microstructures taking into account the specifics in their stereo- and regioirregularities. For example, the enantioselectivity preference of the (R,R-salen) Co catalyst for (S) -PO {{at the beginning of the}} copolymerization leads predominantly to (S) -PO insertion, with any (R) -PO misinsertion being followed by incorporation of (S) -PO, so that the microstructure features isolated stereoerrors. K rel calculations for the copolymerization showed around 5 -fold enantioselectivity for (S) -PO over (R) -PO at short reaction time. Analysis of the copolymer microstructures obtained under various reaction conditions appears to be an additional approach to differentiate the occurrence of bimetallic and bifunctional copolymerization mechanisms that are widely discussed in the literature. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|E
