50|$|The main {{business}} of the arsenal during {{the last months of}} the war was the trans-shipment of <b>ammunition</b> (<b>paper</b> and metal cartridges), the receipt and issuance of Springfield rifles, and sets of equipage for 10 regiments to be formed at Camp Chase in Columbus.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most American Civil War reenactments, {{skirmish}} {{events are}} composed of individuals and teams that fire live <b>ammunition</b> at <b>paper</b> and breakable targets. Competitors can shoot firearms that are either original (e.g., date from 1861-65) or are N-SSA approved reproductions of firearms issued to soldiers from that period. Individual events are usually composed of paper bullseye targets at varying ranges, with five or ten shots for score.|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} {{extinction cross}} section {{is an important}} parameter of the cold smoke infrared <b>ammunition.</b> This <b>paper</b> discusses the calculation of the maximal effective extinction {{cross section of the}} smoke produced by several smoke ammunitions and gives the optimal distance between the centres of the two adjacent smoke spheres. This study can provide theoretical basis for proper use of the smoke ammunition and the optimisation of the discharger...|$|R
50|$|Also {{produced}} was 6.5mm gallery <b>ammunition,</b> {{incorporating a}} <b>paper</b> or wood bullet; and dummy rounds, which were issued to Japanese forces. These were either all brass rounds or were more commonly red varnished wood {{with a metal}} base and rim. Ammunition used in the spigot-type Japanese grenade launchers often has paper bullets and can be identified by the staked primers.|$|R
5000|$|Chemical primers, {{advanced}} metallurgy {{and manufacturing}} techniques all {{came together in}} the 19th century to create an entirely new class of firearm [...] - [...] the cartridge arm. Flintlock and caplock shooters had long carried their <b>ammunition</b> in <b>paper</b> cartridges, which served to hold a measured charge of powder and a bullet in one convenient package; the paper also served to seal the bullet in the bore. Still, the source of ignition was handled separately from the cartridge. With the advent of chemical primers, {{it was not long}} before several systems were invented with many different ways of combining bullet, powder, and primer into a single package which could be loaded quickly from the breech of the firearm. This greatly streamlined the reloading procedure and paved the way for semi- and fully automatic firearms.|$|R
50|$|From May 1787, a {{detachment}} of four companies of marines, under Major Robert Ross, accompanied the First Fleet {{to protect a}} new colony at Botany Bay (New South Wales). Due to an administrative error the Fleet left Portsmouth without its main supply of <b>ammunition,</b> cartridge <b>paper</b> and tools to repair their flintlocks. The omission was noted early during the voyage and, in July 1787, a request {{was sent back to}} the British Home Office from Santa Cruz that the missing supplies be sent out in William Bligh's ship HMS Bounty. Ten thousand rounds of ammunition were also obtained when the Fleet called into Rio de Janeiro en route to Botany Bay. However, despite the Home Office receiving the request, the full resupply was never sent and consequently, after 12 months, the marines ended up in difficult circumstances.|$|R
6000|$|Later {{victims of}} this view of duty were Margaret Lauchleson and Margaret Wilson--an old woman and a young girl--cruelly drowned by the local {{authorities}} at Wigtown (May 1685). A myth represents Claverhouse as having been present. The shooting of John Brown, [...] "the Christian Carrier," [...] by Claverhouse in the previous week was an affair of another character. Claverhouse did not exceed his orders, and <b>ammunition</b> and treasonable <b>papers</b> were in Brown's possession; he was also sheltering a red-handed rebel. Brown was not shot merely [...] "because he was a Nonconformist," [...] nor was he shot by the hand of Claverhouse.|$|R
40|$|Artificial ground {{freezing}} (AFG) {{is a well}} established technique first practised in South Wales in 1862. Since then many different temporary and permanent applications have been developed. AFG is mostly used in tunnels and for stabilising excavations, {{but there is an}} increasing interest in using AFG for environmental protection and for using freeze/thaw cycles for remediation of contaminated soil. Freeze dredging is a novel dredging technique developed at Luleå University of Technology in co-operation with industrial partners. The contaminated sediment is first stabilised by freezing, and then the frozen sediment is lifted up above the water with a minimum of disturbance of the surrounding soil. Full-scale field tests have been performed with very good results. It has been hypothesised that underwater freezing can be used also for removal or radioactive material, fragile containers with hazardous content, and <b>ammunition.</b> This <b>paper</b> describes the basic principles of the technology and lessons learned from the full scale tests. It also deals with considerations necessary for designing a system for underwater freezing of different materials. Godkänd; 2003; 20090814 (svek...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{identification}} of aerodynamic coefficients, based on free-flight measurements, remains complex and challenging for vehicles such as space probes, unmanned aerial vehicles, or <b>ammunition.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> a detailed procedure for the {{identification of}} the drag, pitching moment slope, and pitch damping coefficients of a reentry space vehicle is presented. New models of these aerodynamic coefficients, based on polynomial functions of Mach numbers and incidence angles, are proposed, and an estimation strategy using multiple data series is applied. The free-flight data correspond to three-axis magnetometer and radar measurements for different experimental conditions. The resulting model is tested with new data sets to ascertain the model validity. The results show that the proposed description of the three aerodynamic coefficients and the estimation strategy are relevant...|$|R
50|$|Musketeers {{often used}} paper cartridges, which served a purpose {{similar to that}} of modern {{metallic}} cartridges in combining bullet and powder charge. A musket cartridge consisted of a pre-measured amount of black powder and ammunition such as a round ball, Nessler ball or Minié ball all wrapped up in paper. Cartridges would then be placed in a cartridge box, which would typically be worn on the musketeer's belt during a battle. Unlike a modern cartridge, this paper cartridge was not simply loaded into the weapon and fired. Instead, the musketeer would tear open the paper (usually with his teeth), pour some of the powder into the pan and the rest into the barrel, follow it with the <b>ammunition</b> (and the <b>paper</b> as wadding if not using a Minié ball), then use the ramrod as normal to push it all into the barrel. While not as fast as loading a modern cartridge, this method did significantly speed up the loading process since the pre-measured charges meant that the musketeer did not have to carefully measure out the black powder with every shot.|$|R
500|$|Antequera rallied the Paraguayan militia in response, while Zavala {{sent his}} {{lieutenant}} governor Baltasar García Ros to marshall both Jesuit mission Indians, his own troops from Buenos Aires, and reinforcements from Villa Rica. [...] Zavala had hoped {{a peaceful resolution}} might still be possible, but García Ros was not well received by the Paraguayans. [...] He had briefly served as interim governor of Paraguay from 1706-1707, and {{was known to be}} a great supporter of the Jesuits. [...] He had worked with the Jesuit armies of mission Indians before in fighting the Portuguese, where the Jesuits gained his admiration with their support; he had also allegedly ignored a royal award of 300 mission Indians to the settlers in the encomienda while interim governor to please the Jesuits. [...] Meanwhile, in Asunción, the Jesuits were run out of their college by a mob of citizens, and given 3 hours to leave by the cabildo. [...] The armies exchanged hostile letters, and it seemed briefly that a show of force might persuade the other side to back down. [...] However, on August 25, 1724, the Paraguayans misinterpreted Indians celebrating the feast of St. Luis as preparations for a military attack. [...] The Paraguayans attacked the dancing and parading Indians, and won a complete victory with the element of surprise. [...] Hundreds of Indians were killed, all of the arms, <b>ammunition,</b> and <b>papers</b> were taken, and the royal army was forced into full retreat. [...] A band of citizens of Villa Rica who arrived late as reinforcements surrendered immediately, and saw their leader executed. [...] The victory came unexpectedly cheap, as well; only five settlers were killed, and 20 wounded. [...] 150 captured mission Indians were distributed to the settlers in encomienda servitude.|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of modern fuzes includes micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), which have such advanced devices as micro-accelerometers and micro-switches, being triggered at a specified level of setback. Independent power source (PS), as an inherent {{part of the}} MEMSfuze, charges an energy storage unit during the shot and triggers the fuze firing circuit when the shell encounters the target. Operating level of the control signal should be achieved within the time of remote arming, determined {{by the type of}} <b>ammunition.</b> The <b>paper</b> considers a possibility to develop PS as a thermoelectric generator (TEG) with aerodynamic heating of hot junctions due to friction of the projectile body on the incoming airflow. The initial temperature is determined by the driving band cutting into the rifling and friction during the movement of projectile through the tube bore. The paper presents a technique for calculating the temperature field along the body of the projectile from the critical point, located {{at the top of the}} shell head. The solution of the equation of heat balance reveals the temporal development of the projectile body temperature. The proposed mathematical model of the TEG describes the process of converting heat into electrical output signal (thermo-EMF). An example of calculation for a specific artillery system – 57 -mm anti-aircraft gun S- 60 is given. Calculation of the TEG output signal was limited by the time, which is necessary to reach the top of the projectile trajectory. It is shown that at high altitude the temperature difference may drop to zero, thus cutting off the TEG output signal. Selection of capacitive storage parameters can be based on the reliability test conditions of the fuze firing circuit actuators, taking into account the partial storage discharge on the trajectory before the projectile encounters the target...|$|R

5000|$|... "The breech-loading carbine {{was invented}} and {{patented}} in Greensboro, N.C. by Jere H. Tarpley. He received a C.S.A. patent on February 14, 1863, {{and his name}} appears on the barrel tang. He joined J. &F. Garrett & Co. to make carbines {{for the state of}} North Carolina. The carbines were made for about one year with their production amounting to only a few hundred. The carbine had a unique design which enabled this arm to be made with a file. The frame was unfinished brass with a copper color. The barrel was blued and the hammer was case hardened. The major flaw in the carbine was that it does not have a gas seal to prevent the escape of highly erosive gases between the breech-block and the barrel when fired. With each firing, the gap between the breech-block and the barrel would be larger. The carbine used <b>paper</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Although the carbine was made mainly for the state, it was also sold commercially. It is the only Confederate firearm sold to the public. The Tarpley was attractive in appearance, but it was not very serviceable. Clap, Gates & Co. was ten miles from the Garrett operation in Greensboro. The hammer and other parts could have been supplied by Clapp, Gates & Co."
