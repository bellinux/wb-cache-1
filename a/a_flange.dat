5|$|Skulls of P. mongoliensis {{are flat}} on top, {{especially}} {{over the back}} of the skull, with a triangular depression, the antorbital fossa, on the outside surface of the maxilla (an upper jaw bone). <b>A</b> <b>flange</b> is present on the lower edge of the dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw), although it is not as prominent as in P. meileyingensis or P. major (=P. lujiatunensis). P. mongoliensis is among the largest known species. The skull of the type specimen, which is probably a juvenile, is 15.2centimetres (6in) long, and the associated femur is 16.2centimetres (6.4in) in length. Other specimens are larger, with the largest documented femur measuring about 21centimetres (8.25in) long.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, the American Budd Company, at {{the time}} a {{relatively}} obscure auto-frame supplier, developed an extensive working relationship with the French firm Michelin, which was best known for its tires. In 1929, Michelin built its first rail car, and by 1932 nine of its cars were in operating service, all of which featured innovative and distinctive pneumatic tires. The company claimed that its application of tires on its rail cars afforded both a substantially more cushioned ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%. The design of Michelin's tired wheels included an aluminum safety ring and <b>a</b> <b>flange</b> that were only used {{in the event of a}} puncture or other type of tire failure; during normal operation, only the rubber tire made contact with the rail.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus manavi is a {{diminutive}} species with fur of medium length. The upperparts are blackish or reddish brown. Other small Malagasy Miniopterus are lighter. The ears mostly lack hair and {{end in a}} rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is thin for most of its length, ends in an angular tip, and has <b>a</b> <b>flange</b> at the medial side (towards the midline of the animal). The tragus is differently shaped in other species. The wings and uropatagium (tail membrane) are blackish and are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is densely haired above and more sparsely below, as in M.mahafaliensis and M.brachytragos; M.griveaudi and M.aelleni have more nearly naked uropatagia.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> {{weld neck}} <b>flange</b> (also known as <b>a</b> high-hub <b>flange</b> and tapered hub <b>flange)</b> is <b>a</b> type of <b>flange.</b> There are two designs. The regular type is used with pipes. The long type is {{unsuitable}} for pipes {{and is used}} in process plant. <b>A</b> weld neck <b>flange</b> consists of <b>a</b> circular fitting with a protruding rim around the circumference. Generally machined from <b>a</b> forging, these <b>flanges</b> are typically butt welded to a pipe. The rim has a series of drilled holes that permit the flange to be affixed to another flange with bolts.|$|R
5|$|P. sibiricus is {{the largest}} known species of Psittacosaurus. The skull of the type {{specimen}} is 20.7centimetres long (8.25in), and the femur is 22.3cm (8.75in) in length. It is also distinguished by its neck frill, which is longer than any other species, at 15 to 18% of skull length. A very striking feature of P. sibiricus {{is the number of}} 'horns' around the eyes, with three prominences on each postorbital, and one in front of each eye, on the palpebral bones. Similar horns found on the postorbital of P. sinensis are not as pronounced but may be homologous. The jugal has extremely prominent 'horns' and may contact the premaxilla, both features also seen in the possibly related P. sinensis. There is <b>a</b> <b>flange</b> on the dentary of the lower jaw, similar to P. mongoliensis, P. meileyingensis, and P. sattayaraki. It can be told apart from the other species of Psittacosaurus by a combination of 32 anatomical features, including six that are unique to the species. Most of these are skull details, but one unusual feature is the presence of 23 vertebrae between the skull and pelvis, unlike the 21 or 22 in the other species where the vertebrae are known.|$|E
5|$|P. xinjiangensis is {{distinguished}} by a prominent jugal 'horn' that is flattened {{on the front}} end, {{as well as some}} features of the teeth. The ilium, one of the three bones of the pelvis, also bears a characteristically long bony process behind the acetabulum (hip socket). An adult femur has a published length of about 16centimetres (6.3in). P. meileyingensis has the shortest snout and neck frill of any species, making the skull nearly circular in profile. The orbit (eye socket) is roughly triangular, and there is a prominent flange on the lower edge of the dentary, a feature also seen in specimens of P. lujiatunensis, and to a lesser degree in P. mongoliensis, P. sattayaraki, and P. sibiricus. The complete type skull, probably adult, is 13.7centimetres (5.5in) long. The dentary of P. sattayaraki has <b>a</b> <b>flange</b> similar to that found in P. mongoliensis, P. sibiricus, P. lujiatunensis and P. meileyingensis, although it is less pronounced than in those species. The material appears to be roughly the same size as P. sinensis. The frontal bone of P. neimongoliensis is distinctly narrow compared to that of other species, resulting in a narrower skull overall. The ischium bone of the pelvis is also longer than the femur, which differs from other species in which these bones are known. The type specimen has a skull length of 13.2centimetres (5.2in) and a femoral length of 13centimetres (5.1in), but is not fully grown. An adult P. neimongoliensis was probably smaller than P. mongoliensis, with a proportionately longer skull and tail. P. ordosensis can be distinguished by numerous features of the jugals, which have very prominent 'horns'. It is also the smallest known species. One adult skull measures only 9.5centimeters (3.75in) in length.|$|E

25|$|On 14 October 2010, {{engineers}} at {{the launch pad}} first discovered a small leak in a propellant line for Discoverys orbital maneuvering system (OMS) engines. The leak was detected after they noticed a fishy smell coming from the aft of the shuttle, {{thought of as a}} sign of fuel vapor in the air. Upon inspection, the leak was found at <b>a</b> <b>flange</b> located at the interface where two propellant lines met in Discoverys aft compartment. The line carried monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) propellant, one of two chemicals (the other is an oxidizer, nitrogen tetroxide) used to ignite the OMS engines. Engineers replaced an Air Half Coupling (AHC) flight cap. However, the new cap failed to solve the problem since vapor checks still showed signs of a leak. An aspirator was activated to collect the vapor at the leak-site allowing work to continue in other locations around the aft segment of Discovery.|$|E
25|$|The bowl {{in which}} the drink is {{prepared}} is called a tanoa or laulau. The former word is the more frequently used. The bowls vary in size from twelve to thirty inches and they stand on short rounded legs varying in number from four to twentyfour. It is unusual to find a bowl that has a greater depth than six inches and the majority are perhaps not more than three or four inches deep. A brim of a width varying according {{to the size of}} the bowl runs round the top of the tanoa, and <b>a</b> <b>flange</b> or sometimes a projecting piece of the original wood is left under the bowl. This is pierced by a hole through which a piece of afa (native sennit) is threaded for suspending the bowl from a house post. The tanoa is usually made from the wood of the ifilele tree (Intsia bijuga), a hard-grained timber of a reddish-brown colour. When the bowl was finished it was soaked in fresh water for a considerable time to remove the woody smell. 'Ava often was also allowed to remain indefinitely in the tanoa in order that the inside might acquire an enamelled appearance. This enamel or sheen is called tane. In earlier bowls the legs were tapered towards the bottom and reduced there to about a half an inch in diameter. Chiefs and orators, high and low, use the same type of tanoa. At ceremonies, the bowl used is that belonging to the chief or orator at whose house the ceremony is being held.|$|E
500|$|The {{skull of}} Heterodontosaurus was small but robustly built. The two most {{complete}} skulls measured [...] (holotype specimen SAM-PK-K337) and [...] (specimen SAM-PK-K1332) in length. The skull was elongated, narrow, and triangular {{when viewed from}} the side, with the highest point being the sagittal crest, from where the skull sloped down towards the snout tip. The back of the skull ended in a hook-like shape, which was offset to the quadrate bone. The orbit (eye opening) was large and circular, and a large spur-like bone, the palpebral, protruded backwards into {{the upper part of}} the opening. Below the eye socket, the jugal bone gave rise to a sideways projecting boss, or horn-like structure. The jugal bone also formed a [...] "blade" [...] that created a slot together with <b>a</b> <b>flange</b> on the pterygoid bone, for guiding the motion of the lower jaw. Ventrally, the antorbital fossa was bounded by a prominent bony ridge, to which the animal's fleshy cheek would have been attached. The proportionally large lower temporal fenestra was egg-shaped and tilted back, and located behind the eye opening. The elliptical upper temporal fenestra was visible only looking at the top of the skull. The left and right upper temporal fenestrae were separated by the sagittal crest, which would have provided lateral attachment surfaces for the jaw musculature in the living animal.|$|E
50|$|The flange {{nuts are}} {{sometimes}} provided with <b>a</b> swivel <b>flange</b> which helps {{in creating a}} more stable structure without affecting finished product like <b>a</b> serrated <b>flange</b> nut.

500|$|... "Northern Lites" [...] is 3 {{minute and}} 31 seconds long {{and is in}} the key of E minor. The song begins with an intro with steel drums, {{featuring}} a flanging effect, before a brass section enters after 6 seconds playing a melody line accompanied by a güiro, sparse drums and an acoustic guitar playing the chords Em7 and A. The melody line plays twice after which Gruff Rhys begins singing the first verse alongside the güiro, guitar and steel drums which no longer have <b>a</b> <b>flange</b> effect. Towards the end of the verse a distorted guitar melody line plays alongside Rhys's vocal and harmony backing vocals enter. The song's first chorus begins at 48 seconds with Rhys singing [...] "There's a distant light, a forest fire burning everything in sight". During the second verse the brass section rejoins, playing the same melody line from the intro. After another chorus the song's extended [...] "play-out" [...] section begins at 2 minutes and 13 seconds with Rhys repeating the lines [...] "Don't worry me, or hurry me, blow me far away to the Northern Lites" [...] accompanied by harmony backing vocals. The track breaks down to just drums and vocals at 2 minutes and 40 seconds after which the band and brass section rejoin. A prominent lead guitar melody begins after 2 minutes and 47 seconds and plays alongside the vocals, acoustic guitar, brass and drums until the track fades out and ends at 3 minutes and 31 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Smilodon {{was around}} the size of modern big cats, but was more robustly built. It had a reduced lumbar region, high scapula, short tail, and broad limbs with {{relatively}} short feet. Smilodon is most famous for its relatively long canine teeth, which are the longest found in the saber-toothed cats, at about [...] long in the largest species, S. populator. The canines were slender and had fine serrations {{on the front and}} back side. The skull was robustly proportioned and the muzzle was short and broad. The cheek bones (zygomata) were deep and widely arched, the sagittal crest was prominent, and the frontal region was slightly convex. The mandible had <b>a</b> <b>flange</b> {{on each side of the}} front. The upper incisors were large, sharp, and slanted forwards. There was a diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars of the mandible. The lower incisors were broad, recurved, and placed in a straight line across. The p3 premolar tooth of the mandible was present in most early specimens, but lost in later specimens; it was only present in 6% of the La Brea sample. There is some dispute over whether Smilodon was sexually dimorphic. Some studies of S. fatalis fossils have found little difference between the sexes. Conversely, a 2012 study found that, while fossils of S. fatalis show less variation in size among individuals than modern Panthera, they do appear to show the same difference between the sexes in some traits.|$|E
2500|$|Whether of the klappvisor or double pivot type, the visors of {{the first}} half of the 14th century tended to be of a {{relatively}} flat profile with little projection from the face.

From around 1380 the visor, by this time considerably larger than earlier forms, was drawn out into a conical point like a muzzle or a beak, and was given the names [...] "hounskull" [...] (from the German hundsgugel– [...] "hound's hood") or [...] "pig faced" [...] (in modern parlance). From about 1410 the visor became progressively more rounded, and by 1435 it gave an [...] "ape-like" [...] profile to the helmet; by 1450 it formed a sector in the, by then, almost globular bascinet.|$|E

2500|$|However, Ken Heard, Consultant Museologist, Canadian Museums Association, was {{reported}} to say: [...] "One {{of the terms of}} these agreements was that the track gauge was to accommodate wagons. As horse car rail was step rail, the horse cars, equipped with iron wheels with flanges on the inside, ran on the outer, or upper step of the rail. Wagon wheels naturally did not have <b>a</b> <b>flange.</b> They were made of wood, with an iron tire. Wagons would use the inner, or lower step of the rail. The upper step of the rail guided the wagons on the track. In order to accommodate this arrangement, the track gauge had to be 4 feet, 11 inches. As the streets themselves were not paved, this arrangement permitted wagons carrying heavy loads a stable roadbed." [...] In support of Heard's statement about the pre-TTC gauge, the Charter of the Toronto Railway Company said [...] "the gauge of system (4 ft. 11 in.) is to be maintained on main lines and extensions thereof".|$|E
2500|$|Kroehl {{applied for}} a patent around March 1854 for <b>a</b> <b>flange</b> forming machine. [...] It is {{described}} in Scientific American as an improvement in machinery for bending flanges on wrought iron beams. [...] There {{is a pair of}} horizontal, and a pair of vertical rollers; the former pair has one roller with a face of the full depth of the beam, and the other has its face the depth of the beam minus the thickness of the flanges. [...] The vertical rollers are both alike, and are of a width a little greater than the extreme width of the flanges. [...] They are arranged opposite the space between the horizontal ones, and work in close contact with the sides of the roller. [...] In order to give the flanges and their beams, a taper or an elliptic, or other curved form, the vertical rollers have flanges, whose faces bear on the edges of the flanges of the beam, and cause the said rollers to receive such a movement in the direction of their axes, and apply such a force I that direction as bends the flanges of the beam to the desired form. [...] Kroehl secured the patent as #12,133 on January 2, 1855.|$|E
