5|$|In one of {{his last}} acts as governor, he {{appointed}} Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The lame duck <b>appointment</b> <b>was</b> occasioned by the sudden resignation of Otis Lord, a Republican who may have resigned in order to deny the appointment opportunity to the incoming Democratic Governor, Benjamin Butler. The <b>appointment</b> <b>was</b> made on December 8, 1882, the last day of Long's term when the Governor's Council (which had to approve the <b>appointment)</b> <b>was</b> scheduled to meet.|$|E

5|$|In January 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the Secretary of State position, which Sherman, {{facing a}} {{difficult}} reelection campaign in 1898, quickly accepted. His <b>appointment</b> <b>was</b> swiftly confirmed when Congress convened that March. The <b>appointment</b> <b>was</b> {{seen as a}} good one, but many in Washington soon began to question whether Sherman, at age 73, still had the strength and intellectual vigor to handle the job; rumors circulated to that effect, but McKinley did not believe them. Asked for advice on the inaugural address, Sherman offered a draft threatening intervention in Cuba, then in rebellion against Spain; the suggestion was ignored.|$|E

5|$|After Bahá'u'lláh died on 29 May 1892, the Will and Testament of Bahá'u'lláh {{named his}} son `Abdu'l-Bahá as Centre of the Covenant, {{successor}} and interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings, and the <b>appointment</b> <b>was</b> readily accepted by almost all Bahá'ís, since the <b>appointment</b> <b>was</b> written and unambiguous, and `Abdu'l-Bahá had proved himself a capable and devoted assistant. However, the appointment given to `Abdu'l-Bahá was {{a cause of}} jealousy within Bahá'u'lláh's family. Bahá'u'lláh had also stated that another {{one of his sons}} Mírzá Muhammad `Alí was to be subordinate and second in rank after `Abdu'l-Bahá. Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí, however, insisted that `Abdu'l-Bahá was exceeding his powers, and started a rebellion, at first covert, and then public to discredit `Abdu'l-Bahá. Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí's actions, however, were rejected by the majority of the Bahá'ís. Due to this conflict, `Abdu'l-Bahá later ex-communicated his brother as a covenant-breaker. The conflict was not long lived; after being alienated by the Bahá'í community, Muhammad Ali died in 1937 with a handful of followers.|$|E
5|$|After a brief postponement, an {{announcement}} was made on 1 February 1942, detailing how the cabinet had elected Quisling to the post of Minister-President of the national government. The <b>appointment</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by a banquet, rallying and other celebrations by the Nasjonal Samling members. In his first speech, Quisling committed the government to closer ties with Germany. The only change to the Constitution was the reinstatement of the ban on Jewish entry into Norway, which had been abolished in 1851.|$|E
25|$|His <b>appointment</b> <b>is</b> {{controversial}} {{largely because}} of the long periods that he has spent outside the country. His <b>appointment</b> <b>is</b> seen as a recognition of the importance of various Western nations' support of the revolts.|$|R

5|$|Allen became Jamaica's sixth {{appointed}} governor-general (eighth overall, {{including two}} acting governors-general). He replaced Sir Kenneth O. Hall, who resigned for health reasons. Allen's <b>appointment</b> <b>was</b> controversial {{due to his}} strong ties to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and because of concerns {{that he would be}} unable to attend functions on Saturdays due to his faith's strict observation of the sabbath. Allen resigned from his leadership of the West Indies Union prior to becoming governor-general, however.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole {{became one}} of the {{founding}} Fellows of the Royal Society in 1661, but he was not very active in the society.

In this position he devoted himself {{to the study of the}} history of the Order of the Garter, which had been a special interest of his since the 1650s, and he proposed a design for the Royal Society's coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of World War II, Woodruff returned to Melbourne to continue his surgical training. During his studies, he served as the surgical associate to Albert Coates.

5|$|During this period, Thơ was the Secretary of State for the National Economy. In November, Diệm {{appointed}} Thơ as {{vice president}} {{in an effort to}} widen the regime's popular appeal. The <b>appointment</b> <b>was</b> endorsed by the National Assembly in December 1956, in accordance with the constitution. The move was widely seen as an attempt to use Thơ's Mekong Delta roots to increase the government's popular appeal among southern peasants, because Diệm's regime was dominated by family members, Catholics from central Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Having {{passed his}} exam, Middleton was {{recommended}} for a commission by President Howard Taft in November 1912, but it wasn't {{until after the}} new President, Woodrow Wilson, was sworn in the following March, and the new congress convened, that the 56 successful candidates were confirmed by the Senate.

At the time Ginsburg entered academia, she was one of fewer than twenty female law professors in the United States. She was a professor of law, mainly civil procedure, at Rutgers from 1963 to 1972, receiving tenure from the school in 1969.|$|E
5|$|In July 1918 Vasey was {{assigned}} to 3rd Division Headquarters as a staff officer (GSO3) but this <b>appointment</b> <b>was</b> brief; his successor at the 11th Infantry Brigade was wounded and Vasey returned to his former post.

He served for a time as GSO2 of the 3rd Division before embarking for Australia on 14 September 1919.|$|E

50|$|Rejection by the {{commission}} of the president's <b>appointment</b> <b>is</b> very rare.
