It served as an advisory board to the Roosevelt administration on issues facing black people in America. It was composed of numerous talented blacks, mostly men, who had been appointed to positions in federal agencies. This was the first collective of black people working in higher positions in government. It suggested to voters that the Roosevelt administration cared about black concerns. The group gathered in Bethune's office or apartment and met informally, rarely keeping minutes.

40|$|Abstract Incidence {{rates for}} renal cell cancer, which {{accounts}} for 85 % of kidney cancers, have been rising more rapidly <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> than whites, almost entirely accounted for by an excess of localized disease. This excess {{dates back to the}} 1970 s, despite less access <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> to imaging procedures in the past. In contrast, mortality rates for this cancer have been virtually identical <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites since the early 1990 s, despite the fact that nephrectomy rates, regardless of stage, are lower <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> than <b>among</b> whites. These observations suggest that renal cell cancer may be a less aggressive tumor in blacks. We have reviewed the epidemiology of renal cell cancer, with emphasis on factors which may potentially {{play a role in the}} observed differences in incidence and mortality patterns of renal cell cancer <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites. To date, the factors most consistently, albeit modestly, associated with increased renal cell cancer risk in epidemiologic studies among whites - obesity, hypertension, cigarette smoking - likely account for less than half of these cancers, and there is virtually no epidemiologic evidence in the literature pertaining to their association with renal cell cancer <b>among</b> <b>blacks.</b> There is a long overdue need for detailed etiologic cohort and case-control studies of renal cell cancer <b>among</b> <b>blacks,</b> as they now represent the population at highest risk in the United States. In particular, investigation of the influence on renal cell cancer development of hypertension and chronic kidney disease, both of which occur substantially more frequently <b>among</b> <b>blacks,</b> is warranted, as well as investigations into the biology and natural history of this cancer <b>among</b> <b>blacks.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{rhetoric of}} W. E. B. Du Bois contributed both {{to a sense}} of group failure <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> and a sense of {{individual}} failure. Du Bois also created a need to explain the reasons for the failure of the group, {{as well as that of}} individuals within the group, specifically those within a segment of the black population deemed the talented tenth. Today the talented tenth is more generally spoken of as those occupying positions within the black middle class. Explanations for failure <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> as a group are generally of two kinds. The first posits that the failure blacks experience as a group is due to the failure of the talented tenth to provide adequate leadership of the race. The second posits that the failure blacks experience as a group is due to the failure of American society to commit itself to establishing not only legal equality but also social, political, and economic equality for all Americans. Members of the talented tenth, not understanding that the root of the problem lies with the impossible situation Du Bois placed them in as saviors of the race begin to attribute perceived failures <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> to American society. Instead of questioning Du Bois 2 ̆ 7 s goal and the possibility for complete 2 ̆ 7 racial uplift, 2 ̆ 7 members of the talented tenth begin to question American society 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to realize the goals of the civil rights movement.

40|$|AbstractEffects {{of race or}} {{ethnicity}} on survival after high-dose chemoradiation followed by stem cell transplantation (SCT) have not been thoroughly evaluated. We analyzed survival according to racial/ethnic categories for 3587 consecutive patients who had SCT at a single US institution between July 1992 and December 2000. Among 1366 patients who received autologous SCT, race {{or ethnicity}} was not significantly associated with survival. In contrast, among 2221 patients who received allogeneic SCT from HLA-matched unrelated or sibling donors, blacks had a significantly greater mortality than whites (unadjusted hazard ratio, 1. 65; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 21 – 2. 25). Mortality among other racial or ethnic groups was {{not significantly different from}} that among whites. The greater mortality hazard <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> persisted after controlling for donor type, pretransplantation risk category, patient age, donor/patient sex, and cytomegalovirus exposure (hazard ratio, 1. 71; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 25 – 2. 34). SCT from both HLA-matched unrelated and HLA-identical sibling donors was associated with more severe acute graft-versus-host disease and higher nonrelapse mortality <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> compared with whites. Furthermore, blacks who received SCT for chronic myeloid leukemia had longer diagnosis-to-transplantation intervals than whites. A matched-cohort analysis showed that the higher mortality <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> could not be explained by obvious socioeconomic differences. The higher incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> compared with whites, both with HLA-identical sibling donors, might be related to yet-unidentified “immune-enhancing” genetic polymorphisms. We cannot exclude the possibility that the increased mortality risk <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> after discharge from the transplant center might in part be related to unidentified sociocultural differences that influence medical care...|$|R
