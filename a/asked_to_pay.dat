5|$|Questions {{were asked}} in the House of Commons {{about the cost of}} {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the Daily Mail that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would be <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the policing costs themselves.|$|E
5|$|Evans and {{his agents}} set about aggressively {{collecting}} royalties from those using his designs. Furthermore, Evans significantly raised the license fees for {{his use of}} his patented technology, raising claims of extortion from those being <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> and a great many cases ended up in court. The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans's technologies from 1805 to 1808, but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual (as defendants argued) {{or whether it was}} only for the three years in question (as Evans argued). Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance. Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional, but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case.|$|E

He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing some of the things on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family.

5|$|The National Hurricane Center began issuing {{hurricane}} warnings {{early on}} August 14, anticipating that Beryl would reach hurricane strength. The warnings were issued along the Texas coast from Baffin Bay to the United StatesMexico border. The Government of Mexico issued hurricane warnings from the borderline south to La Pesca. The hurricane warnings issued stretched for 230miles (370km) along the coast. Mexico also issued {{a tropical storm}} warning south of La Pesca to Tampico. A storm surge of 2 to 5feet (0.6m to 1.5m) was expected along the coast near and {{to the north of}} Beryl’s center. Rainfall between 5 and 10inches (125 to 250mm) were also expected. Thousands of residents in coastal areas of southern Texas and northern Mexico were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> attention to the hurricane warnings and to move towards higher ground. The National Weather Service warned the cities of Cameron and Kenedy, and Willacy County in southern Texas that severe flooding is the deadliest threat associated with the storm. In low-lying rural areas near the mouth of the Rio Grande, an estimated 20,000 residents were urged to seek shelter, as the inadequate drainage in these areas make them in danger to severe flooding. The National Weather Service also warned of possible tornadoes forming when associated with thunderstorms and tropical storm generated winds. Authorities in southern Texas filled 20,000 sandbags along the shores, and closed government offices. Residents nailed plywood on windows, parks were temporarily closed, and documents were transferred to waterproof storage areas.|$|E

Chief Minister Zeliang said that there had been administrative lapses and that relaxing the Section 177 of the CrPC, which prohibits unlawful assembly, in Nagaland was a mistake. He also said that the social media was responsible for inciting the incident. Later, Nagaland government restricted telecom services in the region.

500|$|In 2008, the UK {{broadcast}} {{moved to}} rival channel Channel 5 following the BBC's {{decision not to}} keep the show after being <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> £300m over eight years by FremantleMedia (three times the show's usual fee). Both Channel 5 and FremantleMedia were owned at that time by the German RTL Group. The first episode to be shown on Channel 5 in February 2008 was watched by 2.2million viewers (an audience share of 14.2%), a drop of 300,000 from the BBC's average. However, the move boosted Channel 5's usual share for the 5.30pm slot by {{three and a half}} times. On 4 February 2009, Neighbours 5:30pm showing was seen by 1.94million viewers and by 2012, the teatime showing had averaged 1million viewers. UK viewers are able to catch up with episodes with Channel 5's video catch up service, Demand 5, similar to the catch up service in Australia. Channel 5 also have a deal with YouTube, allowing viewers to watch episodes for free on the video sharing site after they have been transmitted. From 4 January 2016, Channel 5 began broadcasting episodes on the same day as Australia. Channel 5's commissioning editor Greg Barnett explained that closing the transmission gap would reduce spoilers and the number of viewers watching the show illegally online. From mid-2016, the show also began airing every week-night on Nickelodeon as part of their Nick at Nite programming block, broadcasting the same episode that was earlier seen on Channel 5. In March 2017, it was reported that negotiations to continue Neighbours on Channel 5 had become [...] "very fraught", and it was possible that the show could stop airing in Britain. The following month, it was reported that a deal had been reached between FremantleMedia and Channel 5, keeping the show on British television for at least another four years.|$|E
