5|$|In {{addition}} to the main quest of defeating the Gym Leaders, there are side quests in which the player can aid NPCs by fulfilling tasks (usually obtaining items); other side quests involve catching legendary Pokémon. The most prominent subplot involves Team Aqua and Team Magma, crime syndicates who want to use Pokémon to alter the climate of Hoenn. In Ruby, the villains, Team Magma, {{want to use the}} legendary Pokémon Groudon to dry up the oceans of Hoenn and increase the region's landmass; in Sapphire, the Team Aqua are the villains and they try to use Groudon's counterpart, Kyogre, to increase the region's water levels. The player's father also introduces the player to Wally, a sickly young boy whom the player helps capture a Pokémon to be his companion <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> away from the big city. Wally eventually overcomes his illness and becomes a successful Pokémon trainer, ultimately becoming the final challenger the player must face before the Elite Four.|$|E
5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E
5|$|Dot {{receives}} a police visit, informing her that Nick has died. One {{of the police}} officers returns later {{to tell her that}} he is actually her grandson Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), a child of Nick's Dot had not known existed. A devastated Dot holds a funeral for Nick and grows close to Charlie in the aftermath <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> in with Dot, causing Fatboy to move out. However, it is later revealed that Charlie is being dishonest and although he is Nick's son, he is not a policeman but a caretaker and that he has helped Nick stage his own death to avoid being arrested following a robbery. Nick reappears in Walford to Dot's shock and persuades his mother to hide him at her house. Although horrified that Charlie and Nick lied to her, she forgives Charlie and agrees to aid Nick's escape from the UK, this time for good. However, Nick later realises that {{he does not want to}} leave and gets embroiled in a feud with Charlie's fiancée Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) who tries and fails to ensure his departure. This leads to Nick tampering with the brakes of Charlie's car and the resulting crash leaves a pregnant Ronnie comatose in hospital. When Charlie discovers this, he demands that Nick leave, and as Charlie moves out to live at Ronnie's flat, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. However, Dot, unwilling to give up on her son, hides Nick in a derelict neighbouring house.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{seasons in the}} games {{represents}} the maturation of the Hero <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> from story to story. It's a critical component in a series that – {{from the very beginning}} – was designed to be a defined quartet of stories, representing an overall saga with a distinct beginning, middle, and end.|$|E
25|$|In {{traveling}} {{across the}} sky, Ra brings {{light to the}} earth, sustaining all things that live there. He reaches {{the peak of his}} strength at noon and then ages and weakens <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> toward sunset. In the evening, Ra takes the form of Atum, the creator god, oldest of all things in the world. According to early Egyptian texts, {{at the end of the}} day he spits out all the other deities, whom he devoured at sunrise. Here they represent the stars, and the story explains why the stars are visible at night and seemingly absent during the day.|$|E
25|$|The {{spin-off}} series {{centers on}} Reverend Boyce (Cedric) <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> from Cleveland to St. Louis {{and has to}} balance his wild past as an R singer with the expectations of his congregation and his family. On January 12, 2012, TV Land officially picked up the pilot to series, under the title Have Faith; with the first season set to have 12 episodes. On March 11, 2012, {{it was announced that}} the series' title was changed from Have Faith to The Soul Man. The series premiered on June 20, 2012. In the March 27, 2014 premiere of Hot in Cleveland, Cedric the Entertainer reprises his role as Reverend Boyce; however, he doesn't appear to recognize the characters from his appearance in Season 2 of Hot in Cleveland. Betty White also reprises her role as Elka on The Soul Man.|$|E

500|$|Bastion is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game developed by independent developer Supergiant Games {{and published by}} Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. In the game, the player controls [...] "the Kid" [...] <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> through floating, fantasy-themed environments and fights enemies of various types. It features a dynamic voiceover from a narrator, and {{is presented as a}} two-dimensional game with an isometric camera and a hand-painted, colorful art style. Bastions story follows the Kid as he collects special shards of rock to power a structure, the Bastion, in the wake of an apocalyptic Calamity.|$|E
500|$|Whedon used {{a variety}} of cinematographic {{techniques}} to achieve the dreamlike quality of [...] "Restless". He used tracking shots with a Steadicam to follow the characters from place to place, creating a flow in the way of real dreams, where there are no logical connections between places and things. In Giles' dream, he walks from a carnival grounds into Spike's crypt, then through a corridor and straight into The Bronze, three locations not related to one another. Whedon was able to do this by simply having actor Anthony Stewart Head walk through the sets as they were built; this effortlessly created a sense of dreamlike dislocation. Another example of this occurs when, in Xander's dream, he walks {{from the front of the}} moving ice cream van towards the back, crawls up and over some boxes, through a window, and drops into his basement. In the theater scene during Willow's dream, a Frazier lens was used to provide a large depth of field, allowing both the foreground and background to be in focus at the same time, while in Xander's dream, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> from room to room in Buffy's house to the university dorm rooms, Whedon used a 17mm lens to give a sense of motion as the camera passes by walls. Whedon also used unusual framing for shots, often leaving much of the frame empty, with a character being placed near the bottom or off to the side. The scenes in Spike's crypt, part of Giles' dream, were shot in black-and-white to emphasize that Spike is seen as [...] "an old 30s movie villain".|$|E

2500|$|Jim Emerson {{describes}} how the Coens introduced Chigurh {{in one of the}} first scenes when he strangles the deputy who arrested him: [...] "A killer rises: Our first blurred sight of Chigurh's face ... <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> forward, into focus, to make his first kill, we still don't {{get a good look at}} him because his head rises above the top of the frame. His victim, the deputy, never sees what's coming, and Chigurh, chillingly, doesn't even bother to look at his face while he garrotes him." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, their rearguard is attacked, and Crüniac mortally wounded. With {{his dying}} words, he reveals the undead {{are led by}} Soulblighter. The rest of The Legion make it to a World Knot and {{teleport}} to Madrigal, where they inform Alric of Soulblighter's return. Alric fears {{he is trying to}} find [...] "The Summoner", who, it is foretold, will resurrect the Myrkridia. News soon arrives that Soulblighter has sacked several cities <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> towards Madrigal, and that Shiver, a Fallen Lord killed during the Great War, has been resurrected. Alric is soon forced to abandon Madrigal, fighting his way through a Myrkridian assault led by Shiver.|$|E

2500|$|In 1762, Catherine the Great {{ascended to}} the Russian throne {{and started the}} {{politics}} of enlightened absolutism. She {{was aware of the}} importance of science and ordered to offer Leonhard Euler to [...] "state his conditions, as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> to St. Petersburg without delay". Soon after his return to Russia, Euler suggested that the director of the Russian Academy of Science should invite mathematics professor Anders Johan Lexell to study mathematics and its application to astronomy, especially spherical geometry. The invitation by Euler and the preparations that were made at that time to observe the 1769 transit of Venus from eight locations in the vast Russian Empire made Lexell seek the opportunity to become a member of the St. Petersburg scientific community.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} the protagonist sitting alone in a room, while a [...] "flower spirit", played by dancer and {{choreographer}} Yoko Honaga, dances around him. Yamaguchi picks up a pot plant and moves in an anti-clockwise circle. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves,</b> the protagonist encounters obstacles he tries to save the pot plant, such as dancers dressed as train commuters, or the flower being blown away. Occasionally the protagonist returns to his room, where {{the other members of}} Sakanaction are performing the song in beige clothing. At the end of the video, dancers steal the pot plant and cut off its leaves and flower. The protagonist crumples to the floor as the lotus flower dancer stands next to him, and he frantically runs away. The final scene shows the protagonist looking at the stand where the pot plant used to be.|$|E
2500|$|The Gears of War {{television}} ad reveals Marcus Fenix {{alone in}} the ruined streets of Sera <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> to avoid threats that appear throughout a dark and deserted city. The spot was widely praised and {{has been described as}} one of the most iconic game trailers of the last decade. The spot, set to the Gary Jules' cover of [...] "Mad World" [...] and directed by Joseph Kosinski, is melancholy and reflective in tone and was a significant departure for videogame advertising at the time, especially a fast-paced shooter game. Visual effects company Digital Domain created the visuals inside the Unreal Engine 3 game engine, the same engine that powered Gears of War on the Xbox 360. While the spot was pre-rendered, the production method gave consumers an accurate preview of the game's textures and subtle facial expressions.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the visual}} novel, the main protagonist is Chris, whom the player controls. Chris is a slacker who roams {{from town to}} town until he comes across the unnamed town that is the setting of Popotan. The story centers on him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>moves</b> in with three sisters and their maid (all of whom become the protagonists for the anime) and his {{transformation}} in his lifestyle. In the anime, the primary protagonists of the series are the three sisters, Ai, Mai and Mii. Ai is a compassionate, motherly figure whose overly compassionate nature often causes problems. Mai is a tomboy who wishes for the quest to end and to live a normal life. Mii is an energetic child who likes to cosplay and help people in trouble. Early on, the series explored the characters' personalities by focusing on a single character per episode. The sisters' maid, Mea, is portrayed as a secondary protagonist in the anime, but is portrayed as a primary protagonist in the [...] radio drama that is a continuation of the anime.|$|E
2500|$|On {{a desolate}} pier, the Phantom, Christine, and Madame Giry find the distraught Meg {{seemingly}} about to drown Gustave {{in the ocean}} ("Please Miss Giry, I Want to Go Back!..."). Meg brandishes a gun to make the Phantom finally pay attention {{to her as she}} describes the lengths the Girys have gone to over the years to ensure the success of Phantasma, including Meg's offering herself to men in high places to [...] "grease the wheels of [...] high-flying deals". The Phantom apologizes for his failure to truly see Meg and her contributions, but when he unthinkingly mentions Christine, Meg becomes enraged and accidentally fires the gun, shooting Christine. The Phantom rushes to Christine and orders Madame Giry to go for help while Meg looks on in stunned horror at what she has done.
