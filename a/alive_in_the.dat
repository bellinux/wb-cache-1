It was later replaced with a symbolic release of doves after the flame has been lit.|$|E

5|$|The {{frustrated}} English devise {{another way}} to have Joan executed by the church. English soldiers go into Joan's cell room, rip her clothes and give her men's clothing to wear.

5|$|Traditionally, animal {{husbandry}} {{was part of}} the subsistence farmer's way of life, producing not only the food needed by the family but also the fuel, fertiliser, clothing, transport and draught power. Killing the animal for food was a secondary consideration, and wherever possible its products, such as wool, eggs, milk and blood (by the Maasai) were harvested while the animal was still <b>alive.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> traditional system of transhumance, people and livestock moved seasonally between fixed summer and winter pastures; in montane regions the summer pasture was up in the mountains, the winter pasture in the valleys.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still <b>alive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

As the stricken Cloudbase loses altitude, Green is killed by another explosion, which also cripples Blue and leaves him unable to save himself.

5|$|From around 1840, architects {{started to}} design wooden {{buildings}} {{in a new}} style, the so-called Swiss chalet style. The style and its name originated in Germany, where Swiss popular culture was much admired by the romanticists. Elements such as projecting roofs, verandas and emphasis on gables were inspired from Alpine vernacular buildings. But the style may more correctly be termed historicism in wood, a term introduced by Jens Christian Eldal. A number of residential, institutional, and commercial buildings were built in this style, characterized by ornate, projecting details. Railway stations and churches, designed by trained architects, were distributed all in rural districts and helped to make this style popular and to keep it <b>alive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vernacular tradition long after it went out of fashion among architects.|$|E
30|$|Two hundred four TTEs were {{performed}} on the 78 patients. The initial echocardiogram was performed in all 78 patients.

Due to the inherent limitations of TTE, not all patients had evaluable diastolic dysfunction. Nonetheless, complete diastolic function was evaluable in 74 of 78 patients (94.8 %) on <b>the</b> first echocardiogram, <b>in</b> 67 of 69 patients (97.1 %) on <b>the</b> second, and <b>in</b> 53 of 57 patients (93.0 %) on the third.|$|R

5|$|Matilda's {{position}} was transformed by her defeat at the Rout of Winchester. Her alliance with Henry of Blois proved short-lived and they soon fell out over political patronage and ecclesiastical policy; the Bishop transferred his support back to Stephen's cause. In response, in July Matilda and Robert of Gloucester besieged Henry of Blois in his episcopal castle at Winchester, using the royal castle {{in the city}} as the base for their operations. Stephen's wife, Queen Matilda, had kept his cause <b>alive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south-east of England, and the Queen, backed by her lieutenant William of Ypres and reinforced with fresh troops from London, {{took the opportunity to}} advance on Winchester. Their forces encircled Matilda's army. Matilda decided to escape from the city with Fitz Count and Reginald of Cornwall, while the rest of her army delayed the royal forces. In the subsequent battle the Empress's forces were defeated and Robert of Gloucester himself was taken prisoner during the retreat, although Matilda herself escaped, exhausted, to her fortress at Devizes.|$|E

5|$|The Colts {{suffered}} their largest {{margin of}} defeat, 34–14, against the Green Bay Packers the following week.

The next week the Colts went into Tennessee on Monday Night Football to face the 6–0 Titans. They led 14–6 in the third quarter, but Tennessee scored 25 unanswered for a 31–21 victory and almost assured the Colts they would not win the AFC South division title {{for the first time in}} six seasons. At 3–4, the Colts opened up November with their annual showdown against the New England Patriots on Sunday Night Football. Tied at 15 in the 4th quarter, Manning set up Adam Vinatieri for a 52-yard field goal that proved to be the winning points in an 18–15 victory. Manning completed 21-of-29 passes for 254 yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. The Colts were 4–4 halfway through the season and still <b>alive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> AFC playoff race.|$|E
