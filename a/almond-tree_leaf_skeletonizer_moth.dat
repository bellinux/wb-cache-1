50|$|Four-o'-clock is host to {{the larvae}} (caterpillars) of several micromoths: Embola ionis is a stem borer, Neoheliodines cliffordi and N. nyctaginella are <b>leaf</b> <b>skeletonizers,</b> and Aetole tripunctella is a leaf miner.|$|R
50|$|Adult ermine moths {{are mostly}} nocturnal. The larvae are leaf-webbers, <b>leaf</b> <b>skeletonizers,</b> leafminers or needleminers and are {{found on a}} variety of host plants. Some cause {{economic}} damage to crops and trees.|$|R

50|$|Cotesia urabae was {{introduced}} in New Zealand in 2011 as a biological control agent against the eucalyptus pest Uraba lugens, {{commonly known as the}} gum leaf skeletoniser (Avila et al. 2013). The biological control of the gum <b>leaf</b> <b>skeletonizer</b> is a novel biocontrol program, being the first attempt at control of this invasive moth in New Zealand. It has been predicted that C. urabae will lead to a considerable decrease on the existing population of U. lugens, along with providing several social and economic benefits (Avila et al. 2013).|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Fraxinus velutina. The {{first two}} larval instars are <b>leaf</b> <b>skeletonizers</b> that remove patches of leaf tissue {{from the lower}} leaf surface. Middle and late instars feed from a leafedge, always from the {{underside}} of a blade. Last instar larva reach a length of about 26 mm. They are waxy green with a pale green head. Prior to pupation, the larvae tunnel into punky wood (when available) to form a pupal crypt. This crypt is largely free of silk, {{with the exception of}} that used to weave the frass-silk cover.|$|R
40|$|Two sex {{pheromone}} {{components of}} the gum <b>leaf</b> <b>skeletonizer,</b> Uraba lugens (Lepidoptera: Nolidae), recently established in New Zealand, were identified. Gas chromatography (GC) electroantennographic detection analyses of female pheromone gland extracts gave three compounds that consistently elicited antennal responses. Chemical analyses, using GC and GC–mass spectrometry, in conjunction with 4 -methyl- 1, 2, 4 -triazoline- 3, 5 -dione and dimethyldisulfide derivatizations, identified these compounds as (10 E, 12 Z) -hexadecadien- 1 -yl acetate (E 10,Z 12 – 16 :Ac), (10 E, 12 Z) -hexadecadien- 1 -ol (E 10,Z 12 – 16 :OH), and (Z) - 11 -hexadecen- 1 -yl acetate (Z 11 – 16 :Ac). A trapping trial in Queensland, Australia, in 2002, indicated that a blend {{of the two major}} components E 10,Z 12 – 16 :Ac and E 10,Z 12 – 16 :OH could attract gum <b>leaf</b> <b>skeletonizer</b> males. In the same trial, E 10,Z 12 – 16 :Ac alone trapped large numbers of an unidentified nolid, Nola spp. Further trials in Auckland, New Zealand established that these two components were sufficient and necessary for trap catch of males; adding minor gland components, (10 E, 12 E) -hexadecadien- 1 -yl acetate (E 10,E 12 – 16 :Ac), Z 11 – 16 :Ac, or octadecan- 1 -ol (18 :OH), to the two-component lure did not result in increased trap catches. Behavioral observations and gland analyses of the Auckland population revealed that female moths begin calling soon after emergence, with peak calling and pheromone production occurring 7 hr into the scotophase. Analysis of gland extract at two-hourly intervals during the first activity period showed that the ratio of E 10,Z 12 – 16 :Ac to E 10,Z 12 – 16 :OH (mean of 86 : 14, respectively) and pheromone titer were fairly constant. No qualitative or quantitative differences in pheromone components were detected between gland extracts from Tasmanian univoltine and Auckland bivoltine populations of U. lugens...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} between 1993 and 2000 in different regions of Oman to collect and identify insect and mite pests affecting date palms and of dates. The results indicated that 24 species of insects and 3 species of mites attack date palms. The red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier, dubas bug Ommatissus lybicus Bergevin, lesser date moth Batrachedra amydraula Meyrick and old world date mite Oligonychus afrasiaticus McGregor were identified to be of major economic importance, quantitatively and qualitatively affecting growth and yield of date palms. Some new date palm pests were also recorded comprising of Aphis gossypill Glover, Holathrothrips Josephi Bhatti, Amitermes stephensoni Harris, a micro Lepidoptera <b>leaf</b> <b>skeletonizer</b> (unidentified), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier, frond date borer phonapate frontalis., Fahraeus, Arenipses sabella Hampson, Anacridium melanorhodon arabafrum Dirsh and Schistocerca gregaria Forskal. In stores, seven insect species were found to attack dates, the most economic insect pests attacking dates during storage, being Ephestia cautella Walker and Oryzaephilus surinamensis Linnaeus...|$|R
50|$|Schreckensteinia festaliella, the {{blackberry}} <b>skeletonizer,</b> is a <b>moth</b> of the Schreckensteiniidae family. It is {{native to}} Eurasia, but introduced to North America and now widespread from California and Alberta to at least Quebec and the north-eastern United States.|$|R
