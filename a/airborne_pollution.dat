5|$|Situated on {{the border}} with Manchester, Stretford became a fashionable place to live in the mid-19th century. Large {{recreation}} areas were established, such as the Royal Botanical Gardens, opened in 1831. The gardens were sited in Old Trafford on the advice of scientist John Dalton, because the prevailing southwesterly wind kept the area clear of the city's <b>airborne</b> <b>pollution.</b> In 1857, the gardens hosted the Art Treasures Exhibition, the largest art exhibition ever held in the United Kingdom. A purpose-built iron and glass building was constructed at a cost of £38,000 to house the 16,000exhibits. The gardens were also chosen as a site for the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887, celebrating Queen Victoria's 50-year reign. The exhibition ran for more than sixmonths and was attended by more than 4.75million visitors. The gardens were converted into an entertainment resort in 1907, and hosted the first speedway meeting in Greater Manchester on 16 June 1928. There was also greyhound racing from 1930, and an athletics track. The complex was demolished in the late 1980s, and all that remains is the entrance gates, close to what is now the White City Retail Park. The gates were designated a Grade II listed structure in 1987.|$|E

40|$|The fate of {{airborne}} metal pollutants in soils is still relatively unknown. We studied {{the incorporation of}} such <b>airborne</b> metal <b>pollution</b> in two soils under long-term permanent pasture (PP) and conventional arable land (CA). Both soils were located at an almost equal distance from a former zinc smelter complex and developed under comparable pedogenetic conditions. Profiles of total concentrations of Zn, chosen as a mobile, and Pb as a little- or non-mobile element, were examined and compared with macro- and micromorphological soil characteristics (soil colour, biological activity). The two soils showed different profiles of total Zn and Pb concentrations, with a marked decrease of concentrations of both elements under the plough layer in CA, whereas the decrease was more progressive in PP. However, the stocks of Zn and Pb for the 1 -m soil profiles of CA and PP were comparable. Correlation of Zn and Pb concentration at different depths with total Fe contents and comparison with estimated data for the local geochemical background (LGCB), suggests transport of Zn from the surface to depth in CA and PP, and Pb movement in PP. In CA, 53 % of Zn and 92. 5 % of Pb stocks derived from <b>airborne</b> metal <b>pollution</b> were located at depths 50 cm. Studies of the composition of gravitational water collected in soils from the same study area suggest two mechanisms for metal movement. First, mobile metal ions (Zn 2 +) move in the soil solution and are intercepted by iron-clay complexes in deeper soil horizons. Second, observed only in PP, simultaneous movement of Zn and Pb is ascribed to bioturbation by earthworms...|$|R

Residents of Riyadh reported that cars and outdoor furniture were covered daily with a coating of oily soot. The ultimate effects of the <b>airborne</b> <b>pollution</b> from the burning wells have yet to be determined, but samples of soil and vegetation in Ras al Khafji in northern Saudi Arabia revealed high levels of particles of oily soot incorporated into the desert ecology. The UN Environmental Programme warned that eating livestock that grazed within an area of 7,000 square kilometers of the fires, or 1,100 kilometers {{from the center of the}} fires, an area that included northern Saudi Arabia, posed a danger to human health. The overall effects of the oil spill and the oil fires on marine life, human health, water quality, and vegetation remained to be determined as of 1992. Moreover, to these two major sources of environmental damage must be added large quantities of refuse, toxic materials, and between 173 million and 207 million liters of untreated sewage in sand pits left behind by coalition forces.|$|E
50|$|Great Lakes is {{the largest}} U.S. methyl bromide {{supplier}} in the U.S. producing more than 40 million pounds annually at their El Dorado, Arkansas plants. Great Lakes Chemical's involvement in the bromine business {{has its roots in}} leaded gasoline. When tetraethyl lead (TEL) was invented as a gasoline additive back in the 1920s, it was found to leave a corrosive byproduct in the engine. Adding ethylene dibromide (EDB) to TEL solved the problem. As leaded gasoline began to be phased out in the U.S., Great Lakes developed international markets for its products. Globalization of leaded gasoline makes TEL responsible for nearly 90 percent of <b>airborne</b> lead <b>pollution</b> in Third World cities. Some EDB in leaded gasoline converts to methyl bromide when burned. The World Meteorological Organization has determined that the continuing exhaust from automobiles using leaded gasoline is one of the three potentially major sources of atmospheric methyl bromide.|$|R
50|$|When a crop {{is matched}} to its well-managed environment, a {{monoculture}} can produce higher yields than a polyculture. In the last 40 years, modern {{practices such as}} monoculture planting {{and the use of}} synthesized fertilizers have reduced the amount of additional land needed to produce food. However, planting the same crop in the same place each year depletes the nutrients from the earth that the plant relies on and leaves soil weak and unable to support healthy plant growth. Because soil structure and quality is so poor, farmers are forced to use chemical fertilizers to encourage plant growth and fruit production. These fertilizers, in turn, disrupt the natural makeup of the soil and contribute further to nutrient depletion. Monocropping also creates the spread of pests and diseases, which have to be treated with yet more chemicals. The effects of monocropping on the environment are severe when pesticides and fertilizers make their way into ground water or become <b>airborne,</b> creating <b>pollution.</b>|$|R

Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry revealed higher concentrations of As, B, Ba, Cd, Ga, Pb, Se, Cr, Cu, Fe, In, Li and/or Ni in peripheral, younger, parts and Ba, K, Tl, Mg, Na and/or Zn in central, older parts of lichens. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to identify the relationship among metals in samples and their possible sources. Significant correlations were found among Ni-Cr, Cd-Ga-In-As-Se, Zn-Ba, Cu-Pb-B, suggesting a common source of pollution. Given the location of sampling, these findings probably reflect <b>airborne</b> metal <b>pollution</b> in relation to the main wind directions and vicinity of the roads and industrial complexes.

40|$|Soot {{from the}} {{combustion}} of coal dominated the <b>airborne</b> particulate <b>pollution</b> {{of the towns}} and cities of Britain prior to the 1960 s. During the 1950 s the most severe cases of pollution were reported in central London. Exceptionally low temperatures led to the meteorological phenomenon known as temperature inversion — a cold layer of air trapped by a warmer layer above. During such episodes the cold, stagnant layer trapped smoke from the city’s many chimneys, which, when combined with water drople ts, formed smogs. During the most severe episodes the mass of total suspended particulate (TSP) was estimated at between 2000 and 4000 μg/m 3 (Ministry of Health, 1954); however, later theories suggested that these were underestimations and the actual values were probably {{in the region of}} 7000 μg/m 3. These severe episodes led to the introduction of the clean air act in 1956 to control the burning of coal in UK cities, and the smogs were slowly eradicated.

40|$|People {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time indoors mostly in the domestic environment, where their health may be effected by significant <b>airborne</b> particulate <b>pollution.</b> The indoor/outdoor air quality at six homes in Wales and Cornwall was investigated, based on different locations (urban, suburban, rural) and household characteristics (smokers, non-smokers). The spatial and temporal variations in PM 10 mass were monitored for a calendar year, including ambient weather conditions. The activities of individuals within a household were also recorded. Monitoring of PM 10 took place inside (kitchen, living room, bedroom) homes, along with concomitant collections outdoors. Samples were subjected to gravimetric analysis to determine PM 10 concentrations and examined by scanning electron microscopy to identify the types of particles present on the filters. The results of the study show there are greater masses of PM 10 indoors, and that the composition of the indoor PM 10 is controlled by outdoor sources, {{and to a lesser extent}} by indoor anthropogenic activities, except in the presence of tobacco smokers.

40|$|A {{positive}} correlation {{has been established}} between increased levels of <b>airborne</b> particulate <b>pollution</b> and adverse health effects, the toxicological mechanisms of which are poorly understood. For toxicologists to unambiguously determine these mechanisms, truly representative samples of ambient PM 10 are required. This presents problems, as PM 10 collecting equipment commonly employed, such as the Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM), heat the inflow to exclude moisture or use fibrous filters, resulting in a PM 10 sample that may have undergone significant chemical change on the filter surface or is contaminated by filter fibres. Other systems (i. e. Negretti and Partisol) can successfully collect PM 10 without chemical alteration or filter contamination. Comparative collections from Port Talbot, S. Wales suggest that TEOMs and Negretti/Partisol systems collect different PM 10 's; the principle difference arising from the TEOM's heating chamber, which precipitates water-soluble ions and volatilises some organic components. This results in both the mass and composition of the PM 10 's being altered. Particle size distributions for Negretti and Partisol collections highlighted differences mainly attributed to different flow rates. The results of this work demonstrate that simple correlations between PM 10 mass and adverse health effects are problematic. Furthermore, elucidation of the complex fractionation and chemical changes in different collectors is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{pollution}} {{is an important}} part of the environmental impact of ships. The noise inside the vessel (affecting crew and passengers) has been regulated since a few decades, while the impact of emissions in water on the marine fauna has been under consideration at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) only in the last few years. No specific effort seems to be in place towards a regulatory framework for external airborne noise emissions from sea going commercial ships. Only the particular cases of inland vessels and pleasure crafts are partially covered by rules. The <b>airborne</b> noise <b>pollution</b> from commercial ships, on the other hand, does affect people living near channels, in coastal areas with intense traffic or near ports, where ships enter and stay at wharf for loading/unloading processes. The actual dimension of the problem is remarked by several cases of complaints sent out by citizens living in the urban areas affected. Within the SILENV project (Ships oriented Innovative soLutions to rEduce Noise & Vibrations, funded by the E.

40|$|Exposure to <b>airborne</b> {{particulate}} <b>pollution</b> {{is associated}} with premature mortality {{and a range of}} inflammatory illnesses, linked to toxic components within the particulate matter (PM) assemblage. The effectiveness of trees in reducing urban PM 10 concentrations is intensely debated. Modeling studies indicate PM 10 reductions from as low as 1 % to as high as ∼ 60 %. Empirical data, especially at the local scale, are rare. Here, we use conventional PM 10 monitoring along with novel, inexpensive magnetic measurements of television screen swabs to measure changes in PM 10 concentrations inside a row of roadside houses, after temporarily installing a curbside line of young birch trees. Independently, the two approaches identify > 50 % reductions in measured PM levels inside those houses screened by the temporary tree line. Electron microscopy analyses show that leafcaptured PM is concentrated in agglomerations around leaf hairs and within the leaf microtopography. Iron-rich, ultrafine, spherical particles, probably combustion-derived, are abundant, form a particular hazard to health, and likely contribute much of the measured magnetic remanences. Leaf magnetic measurements show that PM capture occurs on both the road-proximal and -distal sides of the trees. The efficacy of roadside trees for mitigation of PM health hazard might be seriously underestimated in some current atmospheric models...|$|R
