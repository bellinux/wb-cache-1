40|$|The {{process by}} which store-operated Ca 2 + {{channels}} (SOCs) deliver Ca 2 + to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) {{and the role of}} (Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +) <b>ATP-ases</b> of the ER in the activation of SOCs in H 4 -IIE liver cells were investigated using cell lines stably transfected with apo-aequorin targeted to the cytoplasmic space or the ER. In order to measure the concentration of Ca 2 + in the ER ([Ca 2 +](er)) cells were pre-treated with 2, 5 -di-tert-butylhydroquinone (DBHQ) to deplete Ca 2 + in the ER before reconstitution of holo-aequorin. The addition of extracellular Ca 2 + (Ca-o(2 +)) to Ca 2 +-depleted cells induced refilling of the ER, which was complete within 5 min. This was associated with a sharp transient increase in the cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +](cyt)) of about 15 s duration (a Ca-o(2 +) -induced [Ca 2 +](cyt) spike) after which [Ca 2 +](cyt) remained elevated slightly above the basal value for a period of about 2 min (low [Ca 2 +](cyt) plateau). The Cao -induced [Ca 2 +](cyt) spike was inhibited by Gd 3 +, not affected by tetrakis-(2 -pyridymethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), and broadened by ionomycin and the intracellular Ca 2 + chelators BAPTA and EGTA. Refilling of the ER was inhibited by caffeine. Neither thapsigargin nor DBHQ caused a detectable inhibition or change in shape of the Ca-o(2 +) -induced [Ca 2 +](cyt) spike or the low [Ca 2 +](cyt) plateau whereas each inhibited the inflow of Ca 2 + to the ER by about 80 %. Experiments conducted with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP) indicated that thapsigargin did not alter the amount of Ca 2 + accumulated in mitochondria. The changes in [Ca 2 (+) ]cyt reported by aequorin were compared with those reported by fura- 2. It is concluded that (i) there are significant quantitative differences between the manner in which aequorin and fura- 2 sense changes in [Ca 2 +]cyt and (ii) thapsigargin and DBHQ inhibit the uptake of Ca 2 + to the bulk of the ER but this is not associated with inhibition of the activation of SOCs. The possible involvement of a small sub-region of the ER (or another intracellular Ca 2 + store), which contains thapsigargin-insensitive (Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +) <b>ATP-ases,</b> in the activation of SOCs is briefly discussed.

To prevent the consequences of the excess or deficit of copper, living organisms have developed molecular mechanisms that regulate the uptake, efflux, storage and use of the metal. However, the limits of homeostatic regulation are not known. Here, we take advantage of a simple biological mechanism involved in copper metabolism of Enterococcus hirae, to explore how the regulation is achieved by using a set of four proteins codified in the cop operon: two P-type <b>ATP-ases</b> copper transporters, one copper chaper-one and one Cu-response transcription factor. We propose a mathematical model, based on differential equations and the power-law formalism (see M. A. Savageau, Chaos 11 (1) (2001) 142 - 159), for the behavior of the cop operon and we show that homeostasis is a result of transient dynamics.

This is particularly true of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (or sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in muscle cells); such organelles serve as the main sources of releasable Ca 2 + for cytosolic cellular signalling. Calcium pumps of the SERCA family (sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium <b>ATP-ases)</b> import calcium into the organelle lumen. The other mechanism that is responsible for the steady state calcium level within the lumen of ER or SR is a calcium leak that balances the influx created by the pumps. The leak remains the most enigmatic of the processes involved in calcium regulation. The molecular nature of the leak mechanism is not known. The basal leak is a relatively slow process, which is difficult to investigate and which is easily outmatched (both in the amplitude of calcium responses and in attractiveness to experimenters) by substantially faster second messenger-induced release.

Our goal was to test the utility of wheat-reference genes for qPCR normalization when species carrying the following gen-omes (A, B, D, R, Hv and Hch) are compared either simultaneously or in smaller subsets of samples. Wheat/ barley/rye consensus primers outperformed wheat-specific ones which indicate that consensus primers should be considered for data normalization in comparative trans-criptomics.

Therefore, we studied <b>ATP-ase</b> activity using the cerium–based method in kidneys from ADR-treated rats without proteinuria (48 hr after ADR injection), or with proteinuria (∼ 150 mg/ 24 hr) several weeks after ADR injection. Also kidneys from rats rendered nephrotic by surgical ablation and from non-nephrotic rats treated with local X-irradiation (2000 rads) as well as from normal control rats were studied.

5000|$|An {{increase}} in the pH of the blood (alkalosis) can cause temporary hypokalemia by causing a shift of potassium out of the plasma and interstitial fluids into the urine via a number of interrelated mechanisms. 1) Type B intercalated cells in the collecting duct reabsorb H+ and secrete HCO3. Protons are reabsorbed via both H+-K+ATPases and H+ <b>ATP-ases</b> on the apical/luminal surface of the cell. By definition, the H+-K+ATPase reabsorbs one potassium ion into the cell for every proton it secretes into the lumen of the collecting duct of a nephron. In addition, when H+ is expelled from the cell (by H+ATP-ase), cations—in this case potassium—are {{taken up by the}} cell in order to maintain electroneutrality (but not through direct exchange as with the H+-K+ATPase). [...] In order to correct the pH during alkalosis, these cells will use these mechanisms to reabsorb great amounts of H+, which will concomitantly increase their intracellular concentrations of potassium. This concentration gradient drives potassium to be secreted across the apical surface of the cell into the tubular lumen through potassium channels (this facilitated diffusion occurs in both Type B intercalated cells and Principal cells in the collecting duct). 2) Metabolic alkalosis is often present in states of volume depletion, such as vomiting, so potassium is also lost via aldosterone-mediated mechanisms. 3) During metabolic alkalosis, the acute rise of plasma HCO3− concentration (caused by vomiting, for example) will exceed the capacity of the renal proximal tubule to reabsorb this anion, and potassium will be excreted as an obligate cation partner to the bicarbonate.|$|R

Against 1 mM EGTA Na+,K+-AТРase and Mg 2 +-АТРase activities of GMOK and kidneys are equally insensitive to effect of hydrogen peroxide in concentration up to 1 mM. But in the presence of 20 µM FeSO 4 in the concentration range of 1 nМ – 1 mM of Н 2 О 2 the Na+,K+-AТРase is inhibited to greater extent, than Mg 2 +-АТРase activity. NEM sensitivity of the two АТР-hydrolase systems corresponds to prooxidant sensitivity that indicates the distinct importance of SH-groups for their functioning. It is concluded that Na+,K+-AТРase can serve as a marker of membrane sensitivity to oxidation, Mg 2 +-АТРase is resistant to oxidation and can be considered as criterion of the oxidation resistance when comparing membrane enzyme complexes, especially in GMOK...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that metals are able {{to play a role}} in the genesis and {{development}} of many neurodegenerative diseases. It was recently found that Park 9 encoded protein can protect cells from manganese poisoning, an environmental risk factor for a Parkinson’s disease-like syndrome [1, 2]. Park 9 belongs to a family of <b>ATP-ases</b> involved in metal coordination and transportation, and the familial mutations of this gene may result in early development of Parkinson Disease. We tested for Mn(II), Zn(II) and Cu(II) binding two peptide sequences from Park 9, P 1 D 2 E 3 K 4 H 5 E 6 L 7 (1) and F 1 C 2 G 3 D 4 G 5 A 6 N 7 D 8 C 9 G 10 (2). These fragments are located from 1165 to 1171 and from 1184 to 1193 residues in Park 9 sequence, and are highly conserved in a number of organisms, from yeasts to humans. We have carried out our experiments at different pH values and ligand/metal molar ratios with both potentiometric and spectroscopic (NMR, UV-vis) techniques, showing that the three metals are able to effectively bind the examined peptides. With peptide (1) Mn(II) and Zn(II) coordination involves the imidazole ring of His 5 and the carboxyl γ-O of Asp 2, Glu 3 and Glu 6 residues, in a distorted octahedral geometry, possibly involving bidentate interaction of carboxyl groups; four donor atoms participate in Zn(II) binding, resulting in a tetracoordinated geometry. With peptide (2) on the other hand Mn(II) and Zn(II) coordination involves the two cysteines; Mn(II) accepts additional ligand bonds from Asp 4 and Asp 8 to complete the coordination sphere, together with some water molecules [3, 4]. Details of Cu(II) coordination are under study...|$|R
40|$|Pecten 'actomyosin' as {{prepared}} by the usual dilution-precipitation procedure is reasonably pure only when obtained from the striated adductor; when prepared from the smooth tonic adductor it consists of a protein mixture of about 1 / 3 actomyosin (AM) † and 2 / 3 tropomyosin A (TMA; paramyosin). This admixture accounts for the previously reported differences in adenosine triphosphatase (<b>ATP-ase)</b> activity of crude 'AM' from {{the two types of}} adductor muscles, since, afterpurification, all the biological activity characteristic of contractile proteins (<b>ATP-ase</b> activity, ATP-sensitivity and 'contractility') is associated with AM alone. In presenceof ATPthislatter can also be dissociated into actin and myosin. After purification by salting out, the myosinis quite distinct from TMA in its solubilityproperties and sedimentation constant, and, unlike tropomyosin but like rabbit myosin, it possesses <b>ATP-ase</b> activity and combineswith rabbit actin to form a synthetic or 'hybrid' actomyosinwith anATP-sensitivity of 45 %. The presence in adductor muscles of a conventional actomyosin and myosin in addition to TMA makes it unlikely that the latter protein replaces the classical contractile proteins functionally in 'catch' muscle...|$|E
40|$|Generally it is {{accepted}} that X-ray irratiation in vivo, attacking H(2) O molecules, produces OH, O(2) H, H(2) O(2) etc., and the oxydation invoked by these by-products inhibits the enzymatic {{activity of the}} SH group and others. Bearing this point in mind, changes of <b>ATP-ase</b> activities in the liver, spleen, heart, kidney, and peripheral blood as well as bone marrow have been examined along with the lapse {{of time in the}} rabbits irradiated with a quite substantial amount of X-ray irradiation, namely, 2, 000 γ each. Chemical estimation proved that myosin <b>ATP-ase</b> activities of cardiac muscle and bone marrow are increased immeadiately after irradiation while the activities of all other excepting these two are considerably reduced. The <b>ATP-ase</b> activities of the liver, spleen, kidney, and Peripheral blood increase gradually 1 - 3 hours after irradiation while on the contrary the activities of cardiac muscle and bone marrow are found to have decreased markedly 3 - 6 hours afterwards. Later on the activities of the liver, spleen, kindney and peripheral blood decrease again and after 6 - 12 hours they show the values below the normal, whereas after 12 - 24 hours, they recover close to the normal value excepting three cases in perihperal blood. The activities of cardiac mucle and bone marrow decrease for the first 3 - 6 hours but later increasing gradually, they recover almost to the normal 12 - 24 hours afterwards. However, after 12 hours the activity of bone marrow declining Gradually, continues its descent without ever recovering. Although the activity of mitochondrial <b>ATP-ase</b> behaves more or less in similar manner as that of myosin <b>ATP-ase,</b> its absolute value is lower than the latter observed {{at the same time and}} the former has a tendency to fluctuate prior to the latter. In histochemical observations the intensity of reactions fluctuates rather identically with the fluctuations observed in biochemical study. The reaction of cardiac muscle is markedly reduced for the first three hours after irradiation but it can be somewhat reactivated with cysteine. After six hours the reactions of liver parenchymal cells, biliary tubules, and basillar part of epithelial cells of renal urinary tubules decrease to a certain degree; and this decrease seems to be due to the true <b>ATP-ase</b> activities controlled by the SH group. The reaction of phosphomonoesterase like <b>ATP-ase</b> receiver no conceivable influence with X-ray irradiation. A decrease in the numbers of leukocytic cells is responsible for the striking reduction in the activity of the spleen 12 hours after irradiation. When the liver, kidney and heart in normal conditions are made to react in the absence of substrate, they show extremely slight reaction; whereas after X-ray irradiation, invariably they reveal no such reaction...|$|E
40|$|When {{subcellular}} {{fractions of}} rat liver are isolated by differential centrifugation, about 60 % of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -dephos-phorylating activity is recovered in the mito-chondrial fraction (6, 8). Since this fraction is relatively uncontaminated by other structures, the localization of the enzyme {{activity in the}} mitochondria may be considered established. Whether the enzyme is also localized in the nuclei is considerably less certain, since the nuclear fraction is highly impure. Among the contaminants in the fraction are fragments of the bile canaliculi (7), and bile canaliculi are strongly reactive in the in situ staining methods for <b>ATP-ase</b> proposed by Wachstein and Meisel (14) and Padykula and Herman (11). These staining methods try to avoid difficulties of earlier attempts to visualize <b>ATP-ase</b> activity in tissue sections (see 3, 10). Padykula and Her-man use unfixed frozen sections {{in the presence of}} cysteine or other sulfhydryl compounds to inhibit non-specific alkaline phosphatase while stimulating ATP-a. se. Wachstein and Meisel use unfixed or formalin-fixed frozen sections at pH 7. 2, and they substitute lead for calcium ion as the precipitant for the phosphate released during incubation. It appeared desirable to assess both staining methods by direct chemical analysis. Rat liver seemed a favorable tissue for this purpose. In this organ, <b>ATP-ase</b> and alkaline phosphatase differ markedly in the distribution patterns which they show among isolated subcellular fractions (8). Furthermore, there is evidence that with homogenates of this tissue the chemical assay system is a reliable measure of true <b>ATP-ase,</b> i. e., the enzyme hydrolyzing the terminal phos-phate from ATP (6). Such evidence is highly desirable since increasing numbers of reaction...|$|E
40|$|Two peptide {{sequences}} from Park 9 Parkinson’s disease (PD) gene, -P 1 D 2 E 3 K 4 H 5 E 6 L 7 - (1) and -F 1 C 2 G 3 D 4 G 5 A 6 N 7 D 8 C 9 G 10 - (2) {{have been}} tested for Mn(II), Zn(II) and Cu(II) binding. Park 9 encoded protein can protect cells from manganese poisoning, which is an environmental risk factor for a Parkinson’s disease-like syndrome [1 - 4]. In fact, Park 9 belongs to a family of <b>ATP-ases</b> involved in metal coordination and transportation; familial gene mutations may result in early development of PD. The chosen fragments are located from 1165 to 1171 and from 1184 to 1193 residues in the Park 9 sequence, and are highly conserved {{in a number of}} organisms, going from yeasts to humans. Potentiometric, UV-vis experiments together with mono- and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy have been used to understand the details of metal binding sites at different pH values and at different ligand to metal molar ratios, showing that the three metals are able to effectively bind the examined peptides. From NMR measurements Mn(II) and Zn(II) coordination with peptide 1 involves imidazole N ε or N δ of His 5 and carboxyl γ-O of Asp 2, Glu 3 and Glu 6 residues. Six donor atoms participate in Mn(II) binding, resulting in a distorted octahedral geometry, possibly involving bidentate interaction of carboxyl groups; four donor atoms participate in Zn(II) binding, resulting in a tetracoordinated geometry. Potentiometric data show that soluble, hydroxylated Zn(II) species are formed in the alkaline pH range. The formation of Cu(II) complexes with peptide 1 starts below pH: only mononuclear complexes have been potentiometrically detected also in the presence of excess of ligand. Imidazole nitrogen of His residues acts as first Cu(II) anchoring site; as pH is raised, ligand coordination proceeds with deprotonation and binding of neighbouring amide nitrogens of the peptidic backbone. UV-vis spectra agree that the main species at neutral pH is a N im, 2 N -, O complex, where the oxygen atom most likely belongs to an equatorially coordinated water molecule. Cu(II), Mn(II) and Zn(II) coordination involves the cysteine residues with peptide 2 and complex-formation invariably starts at lower pH with respect to ligand 1. Mn(II) accepts additional ligand bonds from D 4 and D 8 to complete the coordination sphere; the unoccupied sites may contain solvent molecules. When the ligand is in excess, both Zn(II) and Cu(II) ions form bis-complexes. The two metal ions behave in a very similar way and the stoichiometry of main species at physiological pH depends on the metal/ligand ratio: [ML] 2 - in equimolar solution or [MHL 2] 5 - for the 1 : 2 ratio. Potentiometric data suggest for the former a 2 S, 2 O and for the latter a 3 S, 1 O coordination without any participation of amide nitrogens, as usually found for Cu(II) /peptide complexes...|$|R
40|$|The {{creatine}} kinase system, the central regulatory system of cellular energy metabolism, provides ATP in situ at <b>ATP-ases</b> involved in ion transport and muscle contraction. Furthermore, the enzyme system provides relative protection from tissue ischaemia and acidosis. The system could therefore {{be a target}} for pharmacologic intervention. To systematically evaluate evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions directly targeting the {{creatine kinase}} system as compared to placebo control in adult patients with essential hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Electronic databases searched: Medline (1950 - Feb 2011), Embase (up to Feb 2011), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (issue 3, Aug 2009), Latin-American/Caribbean databank Lilacs; references from textbooks and reviews; contact with experts and pharmaceutical companies; and searching the Internet. There was no language restriction. Randomized controlled trials comparing creatine, creatine phosphate, or cyclocreatine (any route, dose or duration of treatment) with placebo; in adult patients with essential hypertension, heart failure, or myocardial infarction. We did not include papers on the short-term use of creatine during cardiac surgery. The outcomes assessed were death, total myocardial infarction (fatal or non-fatal), hospitalizations for congestive heart failure, change in ejection fraction, and changes in diastolic and systolic blood pressure in mm Hg or as percent change. Full reports or abstracts from 1164 papers were reviewed, yielding 11 trials considering treatment with creatine or creatine analogues in 1474 patients with heart failure, ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction. No trial in patients with hypertension was identified. Eleven trials (1474 patients, 35 years or older) comparing add-on therapy of the creatine-based drug on standard treatment to placebo control in patients with heart failure (6 trials in 1226 / 1474 patients), or acute myocardial infarction (4 trials in 220 / 1474 patients) or 1 in ischemic heart disease (28 / 1474 patients) were identified. The drugs used were either creatine, creatine phosphate (orally, intravenously, or intramuscular) or phosphocreatinine. In the trials considering heart failure all three different compounds were studied; creatine orally (Gordon 1995, Kuethe 2006), creatine phosphate via intravenous infusion (Ferraro 1996, Grazioli 1992), and phosphocreatinine orally (Carmenini 1994, Maggi 1990). In contrast, the acute myocardial infarction trials studied intravenous creatine phosphate only. In the ischemic heart disease trial (Pedone 1984) creatine phosphate was given twice daily through an intramuscular injection to outpatients and through an intravenous infusion to inpatients. The duration of the study intervention was shorter for the acute patients, from a two hour intravenous infusion of creatine phosphate in acute myocardial infarction (Ruda 1988, Samarenko 1987), to six months in patients with heart failure on oral phosphocreatinine therapy (Carmenini 1994). In the acute myocardial infarction patients the follow-up period varied from the acute treatment period (Ruda 1988) to 28 days after start of the symptoms (Samarenko 1987) or end of the hospitalization period (Zochowski 1994). In the other trials there was no follow-up after discontinuation of treatment, except for Gordon 1995 which followed the patients until four days after stopping the intervention. Only two out of four trials in patients with acute myocardial infarction reported mortality outcomes, with no significant effect of creatine or creatine analogues (RR 0. 73, CI: 0. 22 - 2. 45). In addition, there was no significance on the progression of myocardial infarction or improvement on ejection fraction. The main effect of the interventions {{seems to be on}} improvement of dysrhythmia. This review found inconclusive evidence to decide on the use of creatine analogues in clinical practice. In particular, {{it is not clear whether}} there is an effect on mortality, progression of myocardial infarction and ejection fraction, while there is some evidence that dysrhythmia and dyspnoea might improve. However, it is not clear which analogue, dose, route of administration, and duration of therapy is most effective. Moreover, given the small sample size of the discussed trials and the heterogeneity of the population included in these reports, larger clinical studies are needed to confirm these observation...|$|R
