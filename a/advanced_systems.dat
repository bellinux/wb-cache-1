The OptiCem cement modelling system, used by Halliburton in April 2010, played a crucial part in cement slurry mix and support decisions. These decisions became a focus for investigations into the explosion on the rig that month.|$|E

Benzoyl peroxide has been used since 1934 to kill Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium that causes acne. Several over-the-counter acne treatments contain it, including Clean & Clear, Clearasil, Doctor's Dermatologic Formula, Neutrogena <b>Advanced</b> <b>Systems,</b> PanOxyl and Stridex.|$|E
5|$|Simon Keynes saw Æthelstan's law-making as his {{greatest}} achievement. His reign predates the sophisticated {{state of the}} later Anglo-Saxon period, but his creation of the most centralised government England had yet seen, with the king and his council working strategically to ensure acceptance of his authority and laws, laid the foundations on which his brothers and nephews would create {{one of the wealthiest}} and most <b>advanced</b> <b>systems</b> of government in Europe. Æthelstan's reign built upon his grandfather's ecclesiastical programme, consolidating the local ecclesiastical revival and laying the foundation for the monastic reform movement later in the century.|$|E

5|$|The Altair 8800 {{was modeled}} after early 1970s {{minicomputers}} {{such as the}} Data General Nova. These machines contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the data storage and display terminal were external devices. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and data storage on punched paper tape. More <b>advanced</b> <b>systems</b> would have 8-inch floppy disks and a video terminal that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a front panel with toggle switches for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.|$|E

25|$|The {{measured}} {{amounts of}} water and semolina are mixed together in pre-mixer to form a crumbly dough. The traditional type of pre-mixer is a trough with a cylindrical section inside which rotates a mixing shaft with blades. More <b>advanced</b> <b>systems</b> use a high-speed (centrifuge) pre-mixer in which water and semolina are sprayed into the chamber, so that each particle of semolina absorbs the correct amount of water.|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} defense {{strategy of the}} late 19th century focused mainly on the defense of Lisbon, as the major populational, economical and political center {{of the country and}} its only part considered defendable against a possible aggression from a major power. Lisbon was so transformed in a national redoubt, with a modern system of fortifications built around the city, equipped with <b>advanced</b> <b>systems</b> of armament and communications. This fortified system protected the city against both land and sea attacks and became known as the Lisbon Entrenched Camp.|$|E
25|$|In the Victorian {{era in the}} United Kingdom, {{a common}} design for the home {{aquarium}} was a glass front with the other sides made of wood (made watertight with a pitch coating). The bottom would be made of slate and heated from below. More <b>advanced</b> <b>systems</b> soon began to be introduced, along with tanks of glass in metal frames. During {{the latter half of}} the 19th century, a variety of aquarium designs were explored, such as hanging the aquarium on a wall, mounting it as part of a window, or even combining it with a birdcage.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{amount of}} water needed for the dough depends on the final shape of the pasta. Long pastas should have less {{moisture}} content (and therefore less water) so {{they will be able}} to stretch during the extrusion. Short pastas need less moisture content due to rapid cutting. Various dosing systems are used to pump the water to the mixture. The most common ones are piston pumps in which the water flow rate is controlled by adjusting the piston stroke, screw feeder, and gear and lobe pumps where the speed of the rotation determines the water flow. In more <b>advanced</b> <b>systems,</b> electronic devices are used to regulate the water flow.|$|E
25|$|Windows Media Audio (WMA) is {{the name}} of a series of audio codecs and their {{corresponding}} audio coding formats developed by Microsoft. It is a proprietary technology that forms part of the Windows Media framework. WMA consists of four distinct codecs. The original WMA codec, known simply as WMA, was conceived as a competitor to the popular MP3 and RealAudio codecs. WMA Pro, a newer and more advanced codec, supports multichannel and high resolution audio. A lossless codec, WMA Lossless, compresses audio data without loss of audio fidelity (the regular WMA format is lossy). WMA Voice, targeted at voice content, applies compression using a range of low bit rates. Microsoft has also developed a digital container format called <b>Advanced</b> <b>Systems</b> Format to store audio encoded by WMA.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{light rail}} {{vehicles}} can travel in multi-car trains carrying a theoretical ridership up to 20,000 passengers per hour in much narrower rights-of-way, {{not much more}} than two car lanes wide for a double track system. They can often be run through existing city streets and parks, or placed in the medians of roads. If run in streets, trains are usually limited by city block lengths to about four 180-passenger vehicles (720 passengers). Operating on two-minute headways using traffic signal progression, a well-designed two-track system can handle up to 30 trains per hour per track, achieving peak rates of over 20,000 passengers per hour in each direction. More <b>advanced</b> <b>systems</b> with separate rights-of-way using moving block signalling can exceed 25,000 passengers per hour per track.|$|E

25|$|According to Helmut Schmidt, Willy Brandt's {{domestic}} reform programme had accomplished {{more than any}} previous programme for a comparable period. Levels of social expenditure were increased, with more funds allocated towards housing, transportation, schools, and communication, and substantial federal benefits were provided for farmers. Various measures were introduced to extend health care coverage, while federal aid to sports organisations was increased. A number of liberal social reforms were instituted whilst the welfare state was significantly expanded (with total public spending on social programs nearly doubling between 1969 and 1975), with health, housing, and social welfare legislation bringing about welcome improvements, {{and by the end}} of the Brandt Chancellorship West Germany had one of the most <b>advanced</b> <b>systems</b> of welfare in the world.|$|E

25|$|The MIPS MT {{architecture}} {{also allows}} {{the allocation of}} processor cycles to threads, and sets the relative thread priorities with an optional Quality of Service (QoS) manager block. This enables two prioritization mechanisms that determine {{the flow of information}} across the bus. The first mechanism allows the user to prioritize one thread over another. The second mechanism is used to allocate a specified ratio of the cycles to specific threads over time. The combined use of both mechanisms allows effective allocation of bandwidth to the set of threads, and better control of latencies. In real-time systems, system-level determinism is very critical, and the QoS block facilitates improvement of the predictability of a system. Hardware designers of <b>advanced</b> <b>systems</b> may replace the standard QoS block provided by MIPS Technologies with one that is specifically tuned for their application.|$|E
