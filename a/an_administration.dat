His government financed the building of rural high schools and extended financial assistance to Dalhousie University's schools of medicine and law. Macdonald also appointed Nova Scotia's first minister of education, Henry Hicks, in 1949 to oversee $7.6million in spending, about a fifth of the provincial budget.|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{aimed at}} characterizing the aging gingiva analyzing: i) {{collagen}} content and turnover in human gingival tissues and fibroblasts obtained from healthy young and aging subjects. ii) {{the effect of}} cyclosporin <b>A</b> <b>administration</b> in human cultured gingival fibroblasts obtained from aging compared to young subjects. Methods: Morphological analysis was performed on haematoxylin-eosin and Sirius red stained paraffin-embedded gingival biopsies from young and aging healthy subjects. The expression of the main genes and proteins involved in collagen turnover were determined by real time PCR, dot blot and SDS-zymography on cultured young and aging gingival fibroblasts, and after cyclosporin <b>A</b> <b>administration.</b> Results: Our results suggest that in healthy aged people, gingival connective tissue {{is characterized by a}} similar collagen content and turnover. Collagen turnover pathways are similarly affected by cyclosporin A treatment in young and aging gingival fibroblasts. Conclusions: Cyclosporin <b>A</b> <b>administration</b> affects gingival collagen turnover pathways in young and aging fibroblasts at the same extent, suggesting that during aging cyclosporin <b>A</b> <b>administration</b> is not related to relevant collagen turnover modifications...|$|R
5|$|The Northwest Territory {{was formed}} by the Congress of the Confederation on July 13, 1787, and {{included}} all land between the Appalachia and the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the Ohio River. This single territory became the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and eastern Minnesota. The Northwest Territory act had all the newly acquired territory surveyed according to The Land Ordinance of 1785 for future development by the United States.

5|$|The Sovereign still {{exercised}} a {{power to}} be reckoned with in the eighteenth century. The Court remained the centre of the political world. The King was limited in that he had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of <b>an</b> <b>administration</b> still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.|$|E

The followers of such divisions are regarded as Covenant-breakers and shunned, essentially excommunicated.|$|E

5|$|On March 3, 1918, Germany and the now-Bolshevik Russia {{signed the}} Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. It {{declared}} that the Baltic nations were in the German interest zone and that Russia renounced any claims to them. On March 23, Germany recognized independent Lithuania {{on the basis of}} the December 11 declaration. However, in substance, nothing had changed either in Lithuania or in the Council's status: any efforts to establish <b>an</b> <b>administration</b> were hindered. This situation changed when the German Revolution started and Germany lost the war in the fall of 1918 – it was no longer in a position to dictate terms. The Council of Lithuania adopted the first provisional constitution on November 2. The functions of government were entrusted to a three-member presidium, and Augustinas Voldemaras was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers of Lithuania. Complete international recognition took several years; the US affirmed it on July 28, 1922.|$|E
5|$|Tension grew {{between the}} Pelham {{ministry}} and George, {{as he continued}} to take advice from Carteret and rejected pressure from his other ministers to include William Pitt the Elder in the Cabinet, which would have broadened the government's support base. The king disliked Pitt because he had previously opposed government policy and attacked measures seen as pro-Hanoverian. In February 1746, Pelham and his followers resigned. George asked Lord Bath and Carteret to form <b>an</b> <b>administration,</b> but after less than 48 hours they returned the seals of office, unable to secure sufficient parliamentary support. Pelham returned to office triumphant, and George was forced to appoint Pitt to the ministry.|$|E
5|$|The Northwest Territory {{was formed}} by the Congress of the Confederation on July 13, 1787, and {{included}} all land between the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the Ohio River. This single territory became the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and part of eastern Minnesota. The act established <b>an</b> <b>administration</b> to oversee the territory and had the land surveyed in accordance with The Land Ordinance of 1785. At the time the territory was created, {{there were only two}} American settlements in what would become Indiana: Vincennes and Clark's Grant. The population of the northwest included fewer than 5,000 Europeans. The Native American population was estimated to be near 20,000, but may have been as high as 75,000.|$|E

40|$|In populations with vitamin A deficiency, vitamin <b>A</b> <b>administration</b> in {{addition}} to supplemental iron {{has been shown to}} further improve blood indicators of iron status. To obtain clues to associated changes at the level of organ indicators of iron status, we have attempted to mimic previous human studies in a rat model. The influence of vitamin A on selected indices of iron metabolism was studied during iron repletion of rats with mild iron deficiency combined with either vitamin A deficiency or normal vitamin A status. In the vitamin A-deficient rats, but not in those with normal vitamin <b>A</b> status, the <b>administration</b> of vitamin <b>A</b> raised body weight and liver weight. Vitamin <b>A</b> <b>administration</b> also raised the total iron-binding capacity and plasma iron concentrations but depressed iron concentrations in liver, kidney, spleen, and bone in the vitamin A-deficient rats.

5|$|Work on {{establish}} <b>an</b> <b>administration</b> {{was initiated}} by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld in 1871. After contacting the invested governments, {{he concluded that}} only Russia and Norway would object to an annexation of the island. Fridtjof Nansen's endeavors raised the Norwegian public's consciousness of the Arctic, which again brought forth public support for annexation of Svalbard. Industrialization and permanent settlements on Svalbard began in the 1900s {{with the introduction of}} coal mining. This resulted in the need for jurisdiction. Firstly, there was no means to make a mining claim legal. Secondly, there was a need for conflict resolution, particularly regarding labor conflicts, which often saw the mining company and the workers have different nationalities.|$|E
5|$|By late 1940 {{there were}} severe {{shortages}} of pilots and wireless operators/gunners, with 100 pilots and 200 other personnel required. In {{the short term}} the OTU course was reduced to get the crews out to operational commands faster. It now took no longer than a month compared with the {{six to eight weeks}} considered necessary. This reduced the number of fit pilots, and the quality of pilots overall. The number of unfit pilots was recorded at 374. To cope with the shortening of training, it had to have a well-stocked general training programme. Coastal Command did not possess such <b>an</b> <b>administration.</b> Only 24 pupils were graduating when the minimum requirement was 64. This was compensated by the removal of gunnery and bombing training and a reduction in night and formation flying. Still, Bomber Command received most of the 36,000 aircrew between 1940 and 1942. Entry requirements for crews were relaxed and the programmes found more recruits that way. Manpower was also supplemented by the Commonwealth with Canada providing some of the 6,500 personnel sought by the Air Ministry. By the end of 1941, the operational strength of Coastal Command increased by seven squadrons.|$|E
5|$|In 1754, Pelham died, to be {{succeeded by}} his elder brother, the Duke of Newcastle. Hostility between France and Britain, {{particularly}} over the colonization of North America, continued. Fearing a French invasion of Hanover, George aligned himself with Prussia (ruled by his nephew, Frederick the Great), {{the enemy of}} Austria. Russia and France allied with their former enemy Austria. A French invasion of the British-held island of Minorca led to {{the outbreak of the}} Seven Years' War in 1756. Public disquiet over British failures {{at the start of the}} conflict led to the resignation of Newcastle and the appointment of the Duke of Devonshire as prime minister and William Pitt the Elder as Secretary of State for the Southern Department. In April the following year, George dismissed Pitt, in an attempt to construct <b>an</b> <b>administration</b> more to his liking. Over the succeeding three months attempts to form another stable ministerial combination failed. In June, James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave, held the seals of office for only four days. By the start of July, Pitt was recalled, and the Duke of Newcastle returned as prime minister. As Secretary of State, Pitt guided policy relating to the war. Great Britain, Hanover and Prussia and their allies Hesse-Kassel and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel were pitted against other European powers, including France, Austria, Russia, Sweden and Saxony. The war involved multiple theatres from Europe to North America and India, where British dominance increased with the victories of Robert Clive over French forces and their allies at the Battle of Arcot and the Battle of Plassey.|$|E

5|$|King Pandukabhaya, {{the founder}} and first ruler of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, fixed village {{boundaries}} {{in the country and}} established <b>an</b> <b>administration</b> system by appointing village headmen. He constructed hermitages, houses for the poor, cemeteries, and irrigation tanks. He brought {{a large portion of the}} country under the control of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. However, it was not until the reign of Dutthagamani (161–137 BC) that the whole country was unified under the Anuradhapura Kingdom. He defeated 32 rulers in different parts of the country before he killed Elara, the South Indian ruler who was occupying Anuradhapura, and ascended to the throne. The chronicle Mahavamsa describes his reign with much praise, and devotes 11 chapters out of 37 for his reign. He is described as both a warrior king and a devout Buddhist. After unifying the country, he helped establish Buddhism on a firm and secure base, and built several monasteries and shrines including the Ruwanweli Seya and Lovamahapaya.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 Winter Olympics {{had been}} awarded in 1970 to Denver, United States, but in November 1972 {{the voters of}} the state of Colorado voted against public funding of the games by a 3 to 2 margin. The IOC turned to offer the Games to Vancouver-Garibaldi, British Columbia, which had been a {{candidate}} for the 1976 Games. However, a change in provincial government brought in <b>an</b> <b>administration</b> which did not support the Olympic bid, so the offer was rejected. Salt Lake City, a candidate for the 1972 Games, offered itself, but the IOC opted to ask Innsbruck, which had maintained most of the infrastructure from the 1964 Games. Despite only having half the time to prepare for the Games, Innsbruck accepted the invitation to replace Denver in February 1973. Two Olympic flames were lit because it was the second time the Austrian town had hosted the Games. The 1976 Games featured the first combination bobsleigh and luge track, in neighbouring Igls. The Soviet Union won its fourth consecutive ice hockey gold medal.|$|E
5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair, <b>an</b> <b>administration</b> scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E

40|$|Clostridium difficile, the causative {{agent of}} antibiotic-associated colitis, mediates {{inflammatory}} diarrhea by releasing toxin A, a potent 308 -kDa enterotoxin. Toxin A-induced inflammatory diarrhea involves many steps, including mucosal release of substance P (SP) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and neutrophil transmigration. Here we demonstrate that, compared with wild type, mice genetically deficient in CRH (Crh-/-) have dramatically reduced ileal fluid secretion, epithelial cell damage, and neutrophil transmigration 4 h after intraluminal toxin <b>A</b> <b>administration.</b> This response {{is associated with}} diminished mucosal activity of the neutrophil enzyme myeloperoxidase {{compared with that of}} wildtype mice. In wild-type mice, toxin A stimulates an increase in intestinal SP content compared with buffer administration. In contrast, toxin <b>A</b> <b>administration</b> in Crh-/- mice fails to result in an increased SP content. Moreover, immunohistochemical experiments showed that CRH and SP are colocalized in some enteric nerves of wild-type mice, and this colocalization is more evident after toxin <b>A</b> <b>administration.</b> These results provide direct evidence for a major proinflammatory role for CRH in the pathophysiology of enterotoxin-mediated inflammatory diarrhea and indicate a SP-linked pathway...|$|R
5|$|The Antankarana were {{originally}} {{a branch of}} the Sakalava royal line called the Zafin'i'fotsy (children of silver). This group split off from the Sakalava in the 16th century following a dispute with the Zafin'i'mena (children of gold) that ended with the latter's exclusive right to the kingship. Having been refused the right to the throne, the Zafin'i'fotsy left the Sakalava homeland on the southwestern coast to settle just north of the boundaries of Sakalava control. The first Antankarana king, Kozobe (1614–39), claimed {{a large part of the}} island's north as his territory, which he split into five provinces each ruled by one of his sons. This territory was rapidly reduced from the south by Zafin'i'mena prince Andriamandisoarivo, who led violent campaigns into bordering Antankarana territory to expand the frontiers of what was to become the Sakalava Kingdom of Iboina at the end of the 17th century. Many Zafin'i'fotsy nobles were killed or quickly surrendered to the advancing Sakalava armies, but oral history celebrates several who resisted, including Andriamanpangy, a descendent of Kozobe. His son Andriantsirotso (1692–1710) founded the Antankarana kingdom, leading the Zafin'i'fotsy further north into the area now protected as Ankarana Reserve and declaring his sovereignty over the north. He was accepted as king both by his own people and by the communities already living in the north, who united together under the name Antankarana (people of the Ankarana rocks). The Sakalava warred with the nascent Antankarana kingdom in its continued effort to claim sovereignty over the territory, but the Antankarana hid themselves in natural shelters formed by the rocks and caves of Ankarana. Eventually they were forced to take refuge at Maroantsetra, a town ruled by a relative named Raholo; Andriantsirotso was able to repel the Sakalava three years later with the support of Raholo's soldiers. Throughout this period Andriantsirotso established the foundations for the kingdom by organizing military cooperation among clans, establishing <b>an</b> <b>administration,</b> developing economic regulations and introducing customs that reinforced a hierarchical social order. According to oral history, at the point when Andriantsirotso was preparing to return to his own capital, a mysterious eight-year-old girl named Tsimatahodrafy arrived in Maroantsetra. She revealed herself to be a sorceress and instructed Andriantsirotso on the rituals to perform en route to ensure his safe return and the establishment of a strong kingdom, including the continuing practice of tying a mat to two tsitakonala trees planted outside the king's house to indicate a royal residence and symbolize the indivisibility of the kingdom.|$|E
