5|$|Leonardo's fame {{within his}} own {{lifetime}} was such that the King of France carried him <b>away</b> <b>like</b> a trophy, and was claimed to have supported him in his old age and held him in his arms as he died. Interest in Leonardo and his work has never diminished. Crowds still queue to see his best-known artworks, T-shirts still bear his most famous drawing, and writers continue to hail him as a genius while speculating about his private life, as well as about what one so intelligent actually believed in.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s {{with the}} {{emergence}} of the United States's first political parties. Throughout the 1780s, few Americans knew or cared who wrote the Declaration. But in the next decade, Jeffersonian Republicans sought political advantage over their rival Federalists by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author. Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson's authorship or originality, and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole Congress, with Jefferson as just one member of the drafting committee. Federalists insisted that Congress's act of declaring independence, in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role, was more important than the document announcing it. But this view faded <b>away,</b> <b>like</b> the Federalist Party itself, and, before long, the act of declaring independence became synonymous with the document.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the Pawnee parks {{department}} {{prepares for}} a visit by park department officials from Boraqua, Pawnee's Sister City in Venezuela. Leslie warns her co-workers the Venezuelan government officials will likely be poor, simple people. Later, the Venezuelan delegation arrives, headed by their parks department vice director Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Morana, the Vice-director Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departmento de Parques, L.G.V. (Fred Armisen), Antonio, Jhonny and Elvis. There are cultural clashes right <b>away,</b> <b>like</b> when they mistake Tom (Aziz Ansari) for a servant and order him to get their bags. They also mistakenly believe they can choose any woman to have sex with; they all favor Donna (Retta). Raul and Leslie exchange gifts during a meet-and-greet party, where Raul and the Venezuelans act condescending toward the Pawnee residents, making offensive remarks about the town and mocking the gifts Leslie gives them. They continue to give orders to Tom, who follows along because they give him large cash tips.|$|E

5|$|The Vedic goddess Nirriti is {{associated}} with death, decay, bad luck, anger, and need. Hymns emphasize offerings to keep her <b>away.</b> <b>Like</b> Nirriti, Dhumavati {{is associated}} with unpromising things and hardship. Jyestha, also an early Hindu goddess, has similarities in iconography with Dhumavati. Like Dhumavati, she is dark, ugly and {{is associated with}} the crow. Jyestha is described as being unable to tolerate any auspiciousness. Also like Dhumavati, Jyestha dwells in quarrels, inauspicious places, and has a bad temper. Lakshmana Desika, the commentator on the Saradatilaka-Tantra, identifies Dhumavati with Jyestha. Both Alakshmi, the sister and antithesis of Lakshmi (Shri), the goddess of wealth, luck and beauty, and Dhumavati are described as old, carrying a broom and having a crow banner. Both symbolize hunger, thirst, need, and poverty.|$|E
5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on {{the back}} of his neck {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten <b>away</b> <b>like</b> the other man. His condition proves that he did not kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E

Everything went in slow motion. I could almost feel the bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I felt like I was a million miles <b>away,</b> <b>like</b> this was all a dream.|$|E

25|$|It is {{that single}} word “usual” that brings you up short {{and lets the}} poem fan out. It points {{not just to the}} {{regularity}} of Robinson’s own days and years but to the engulfing possibility of a thousand Robinsons out there, in the subway and on the streets, all ticking their lives <b>away</b> <b>like</b> his soundless watch. The poem, entitled “Aspects of Robinson,” is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, at first blush, looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He is everything that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as everything that he suspected he ought to be.|$|E
25|$|The changes it {{had already}} {{undergone}} since the Indépendants of 1911 could leave people in no doubt as to its nature. Cubism was not a school, distinguished by some superficial variation on a generally accepted norm. It was a total regeneration, indicating {{the emergence of a}} wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed <b>away,</b> <b>like</b> a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realised that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it.|$|E

Zhang Liang was buried at Dragon Head Plains (龍首原) after his death. In legend, Zhang Liang's tomb was raided when the Red Brows Army revolted, and the robbers saw a yellow stone pillow inside his tomb. The pillow transformed swiftly and flew <b>away</b> <b>like</b> a shooting star, and nothing else was found in the tomb, not even Zhang Liang's body. Zhang Liang became an immortal and served Laozi as an assistant. Zhang Liang's grandson, Zhang Daoling, became an immortal, too, and he went with his grandfather to meet the Queen Mother of the West on Mount Kunlun.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{reasons why the}} Cynics are so named. First because of the {{indifference}} of their way of life, for they make a cult of indifference and, like dogs, eat and make love in public, go barefoot, and sleep in tubs and at crossroads. The second {{reason is that the}} dog is a shameless animal, and they make a cult of shamelessness, not as being beneath modesty, but as superior to it. The third reason is that the dog is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophy. The fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies. So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive <b>away,</b> <b>like</b> dogs, by barking at them.|$|E
25|$|Gundelia {{is a low}} to high (20–100cm) thistle-like {{perennial}} {{herbaceous plant}} with latex, spiny compound inflorescences, reminiscent of teasles and eryngos, that contain cream, yellow, greenish, pink, purple or redish-purple disk florets. It is assigned to the daisy family. Flowers can be found from February to May. The stems of this plant dry-out when the seeds are ripe and break free from the underground root, and are then blown <b>away</b> <b>like</b> a tumbleweed, thus spreading the seeds effectively over large areas with little standing vegetation. This plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle-East. Opinions differ {{about the number of}} species in Gundelia. Sometimes the genus is regarded monotypic, Gundelia tournefortii being a species with a large variability, but other authors distinguish up to nine species, differing in floret color and pubescence. Young stems are cooked and eaten in the Middle-East and are said to taste like a combination of artichoke and asparagus. The plant also contains compounds that have been demonstrated to be effective against a range of ailments. A large quantity of pollen assigned to Gundelia has been found on the Shroud of Turin, which may suggest that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia, but this finding has been contested.|$|E

Lady Pole, who is taken away into the fairyland of Lost-Hope every night, appears insane to those around her. She is hidden <b>away,</b> <b>like</b> the character type examined by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in their seminal book The Madwoman in the Attic (1979).
