25|$|The time of {{departure}} for the accident flight was from Sorong to Kaimana at 12:45 P.M and estimated arrival at 13:54 P.M with the Second in Command (SIC) as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) as Pilot Monitoring (PM). The aircraft dispatch release from Sorong indicated that the flight was planned under the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).

25|$|The {{final report}} was {{released}} in November 2008, {{one year after the}} crash. It was determined that the accident was caused by pilot error {{as a result of the}} condition known as spatial disorientation. The Turkish Transport minister Binali Yıldırım stated that the crash was a “normal controlled flight into terrain by the fault of the crew.” The report states that the GPWS was not able to produce audible alarms due to a defect. Both the captain and the first officer were rather inexperienced and it was their first approach to Isparta. They did neither enter the Standard Instrument Departure of Istanbul nor the Standard Terminal Arrival Route and <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> of Isparta into the flight management system.|$|E
25|$|Flight 5719 {{was cleared}} {{for a landing}} on runway 31 at Hibbing, but the flight crew {{requested}} an approach to runway 13 instead {{because there was a}} tailwind on the approach to runway 31 and 31 was covered with precipitation. The flight crew initiated the <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> by joining the HIB 20 DME arc from the HIB VOR and intercepting the localizer at 8000 feet MSL.This delayed the start of the descent and thus required an excessive rate of descent. The aircraft descended at 2250 ft/min and was 1200 feet above the minimum altitude when overhead the KINNY final approach fix. The Jetstream BA-3100 was not equipped with a Ground Proximity Warning System that was required on larger aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigation}} report {{stated that the}} weather conditions were a cause of the accident. During the approach to the runway the aircraft was operated slightly above the stall speed and {{a major change in}} wind speed could cause a stall. The aircraft experienced windshear. The altitude, the reaction time of the pilot, and the responsiveness of the aircraft combined to prevent the arrest of decent in time to avoid the accident. The crew did not adhere to any published <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> and they possibly misinterpreted the altimeter and airspeed indicator. During the descent, the pilot in command did not check his approach chart and did not continually consult the first officer on the altitude and course. There was inadequate communication between crew, deficient Crew Resource Management, and no approach briefings were made for either of the two approaches. The aircraft was configured for landing with flaps fully down at a very long distance from the runway without having it in sight. The aircraft will not respond well to windshear in such a configuration. Both approaches require a circling procedure.|$|E
25|$|The <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> in use {{for this}} flight {{in the low}} clouds and low {{visibility}} conditions that night required the pilot to fly over the MAC VOR at 3,900 feet, then turn west-northwest to fly out over the water, descend to 1,540 feet and level off within nine miles, then make a left base turn to fly east, back toward the airport (a teardrop procedure turn), and descend for final approach {{with the use of}} the MAC VOR. The pilot was not allowed to descend below 1,540 feet until the turn was completed, and then not below 1,045 feet unless he had the runway in sight. Once the pilot could see the airport from that altitude, he would be allowed to circle and land on the runway of his choice. This is called a circle-to-land manoeuvre, or sometimes a cloud break procedure. The pilot elected to attempt this circling approach to land on runway 29 instead of landing straight in on runway 11, though the reported clouds at the time would have made a circling approach impossible at the minimum altitude of 1,045 feet.|$|E
25|$|After {{successfully}} transporting {{the patient}} from Tingwall Airport in the Shetland Islands to Inverness, the pilot, nurse, and physician were {{returning to their}} home base in Tingwall. There was a strong and gusting right crosswind at the runway. The pilot's <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> required him to make right turns to line up with the runway. However, these right turns obscured the pilot's view of the runway, and when the pilot made his final right turn, the aircraft had been blown {{to the left of}} the runway, too far to make a safe landing. The pilot executed a go-around procedure and attempted another approach. Again, the aircraft was blown far {{to the left of the}} runway centreline, and during the final approach turn, the aircraft lost a great deal of altitude, striking the ground 1.5km short of the runway and approximately 0.3km to the left of the runway centreline. The AAIB determined that nighttime visibility of the airport environment was inadequate, especially during right crosswind conditions, and recommended the Tingwall Airport add additional ground lighting to aid pilots' ability to acquire the runway during nighttime approaches.|$|E

500|$|Final {{approach}} {{segments of}} LFR instrument approaches were normally flown near the range station, which ensured increased accuracy. When the aircraft {{was over the}} station, the audio signal disappeared, {{since there was no}} modulation signal directly above the transmitting towers. This quiet zone, called the [...] "cone of silence", signified to the pilots that the aircraft was directly overhead the station, serving as a positive ground reference point for the <b>approach</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
500|$|The LFR {{also allowed}} {{air traffic control}} to {{instruct}} pilots to enter a holding pattern [...] "on the beam", i.e. {{on one of the}} LFR legs, with the holding fix (key turning point) over the LFR station, in the cone of silence or over one of the fan markers. The holds were used either during the en route portion of a flight or as part of the <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> near the terminal airport. LFR holds were more accurate than NDB holds, since NDB holding courses are predicated on the accuracy of the on-board magnetic compass, whereas the LFR hold was as accurate as the LFR leg, with an approximate course width of 3°.|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} fuel {{efficient}} flight paths which include shorter routes and routes {{adapted to the}} prevailing terrain {{as well as the}} aim to reduce the perceived noise {{on the ground in the}} terminal area of airports lead to the development of curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures.</b> To be able to conduct curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures,</b> an aircraft is on the one hand required to be able to determine its position very precisely. On the other hand, it is required to be able to follow the required flight path very accurately. The first is usually archived with satellite navigation or a combination of different navigation systems and the latter can be achieved by an autopilot which has to be rather sophisticated when intending to follow a curved approach path. This indicates that an aircraft has to be highly equipped with navigation and guidance avionics systems. To fully exploit the advantages of curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures,</b> it is desired that the majority of aircraft are able to conduct curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> even with a less sophisticated degree of equipage. A key enabler for curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> is a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS). It broadcasts pseudorange corrections for all satellites in view to enable airspace users to augment their own position. In addition, it broadcasts desired flight paths. Next to standard “straight-in” Final Approach Segments (FAS), GBAS messages are defined in the RTCA standard DO- 246 D that provide the possibility to broadcast curved precision approach paths. This Terminal Area Path (TAP) functionality in combination with the augmentation of the user’s position can be used as a sole means to conduct a curved approach. The advantage of this setup is that a high accuracy and a high integrity in the lateral as well as in the vertical position domain can be achieved and the aircraft does not have to be equipped with a current database for the published <b>approach</b> <b>procedures.</b> Different ways to present flight path data were investigated and flight tested in this work. ...|$|R

40|$|Pre-defined curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> {{represent}} an essential for noise abatement and {{may reduce the}} risk of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) for today’s aviation considerably. In addition, a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) supports accuracy and precision of the desired flight path. While the lateral guidance during current curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> is usually based on a position solution provided by satellite navigation systems in conjunction with inertial navigation systems, the vertical guidance is still based on measurements of a barometric altimeter. This type of approach with vertical guidance is supposed to enhance the situational awareness for pilots compared to non-precision <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> and reduce the risk for controlled flight into terrain. However, the accuracy of the barometric vertical guidance is inferior compared to precision <b>approach</b> <b>procedures,</b> temperature dependent and require the correct pressure setting for each approach in the aircraft. Therefore, novel curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> are supposed to rely solely on satellite navigation augmented by either a ground based or satellite based system and only optionally by inertial measurement systems. Such coupled (hybrid INS and GNSS) systems are usually highly integrated and monitored by a flight management system. Therefore, the requirements for the equipment of aircraft that are conducting such <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> are very stringent. Using only GBAS could relax those requirements. In this work, an option for precision curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> was investigated and tested in flight trials. This option is based on a GBAS. In general, different possibilities are imaginable to enable GBAS based curved approaches. For instance, GBAS could only serve as means to enhance the navigation performance to achieve stringent RNP requirements. Or GBAS could serve as the sole means to enable a curved approach. This option is described in this paper. Others include the Microwave Landing System or are conducted as a visual approach. The option which utilizes the GBAS functionality to broadcast desired (curved) flight paths, the Terminal Area Path (TAP) functionality was investigated in this work. For this, simulator trials were performed to evaluate different means of flying these procedures in terms of guidance displacement sensitivity and means of displaying deviation information. Based on the results of the simulator trials flight trials were conducted. Results from flight trials are presented in this manuscript to show how this method for conducting curved approaches can be applied...|$|R
