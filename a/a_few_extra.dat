5|$|Although the French {{troops would}} have a higher {{proportion}} of motorised units than their German adversaries, in view of the respective distances to be covered, they could not hope to reach their assigned sector advancing in battle deployment before the enemy did. Their only prospect of beating the Germans to it lay in employing rail transport. This implied they would be vulnerable in the concentration phase, building up their forces near Breda. They needed the Dutch troops in the Peel-Raam Position to delay the Germans for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>extra</b> days to allow a French deployment and entrenchment, but French rapid forces also would provide a security screen. These consisted of the reconnaissance units of the armoured and motorised divisions, equipped with the relatively well-armed Panhard 178 armoured car. These would be concentrated into two task forces named after their commander: the Groupe Beauchesne and the Groupe Lestoquoi.|$|E

50|$|The {{gameplay}} {{experience of}} Bloody Roar {{is a combination}} of classic and current style side scrolling fighting games, such as Tekken, Soulcalibur, Guilty Gear and Street Fighter.

25|$|The {{building}} {{was designed as}} a functional work space and home for the treatment of insane paupers, rather than a residence or civic building.
