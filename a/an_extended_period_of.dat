40|$|Freezing {{is one of}} the {{excellent}} methods for the preservation of foods. If freezing and thawing processes and frozen storage method are carried out correctly, the original characteristics of the foods can remain almost unchanged over <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time. It is very important to determine the freezing and thawing time <b>period</b> <b>of</b> the foods, as they strongly influence the both quality of food material and process productivity and the economy. For developing a simple and effectively usable mathematical model, less amount of process parameters and physical properties should be enrolled in calculations. But it is a difficult to have all of these in one prediction method. For this reason, various freezing and thawing time prediction methods were proposed in literature and research studies have been going on...|$|R

The moisture from Paine produced the highest daily rainfall for any station in Oklahoma. Severe river flooding occurred along the Osage and Arkansas Rivers. The overall flooding event caused $350 million in damage, of which half came from crop losses.|$|E
40|$|Real time systems must {{respect their}} {{temporal}} con-straints both in nominal and degraded conditions. Envi-ronment disturbances cause faults which are revealed by errors during task execution. Therefore, schedulers must be fault tolerant to guarantee no missed deadline. Phe-nomena like electromagnetic fields disturb real-time sys-tems on <b>a</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. It {{is difficult to}} fore-cast faults and their consequences to build efficient fault-tolerant systems. The classical fault models deal with pseudo-periodic faults. They are not made for phenomena extended in time. This paper intends to describe electro-magnetic disturbances in a new fault model, named fault burst model. In adequation with the fault burst model, we provide error recovery strategies. Finally, we {{study the effects of}} strategies on the schedulability analysis to guar-antee fault tolerance when fault bursts occur. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Batch {{sorption}} {{tests were}} conducted using 3, 4 -DCP and cellulose triacetate as the sorbate/sorbent pair. Sorbate concentrations in the liquid were sampled with time and analyzed by electron capture detector gas chromatography. Sorption {{was found to be}} a two stage process characterized by a rapid initial uptake followed by <b>a</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> slower sorption. <b>A</b> fully reversible two step sorption model was applied to the results of batch sorption tests and sorption rate constants were determined. Although sorption equilibrium was not reached during the time scale of this study, it appears that the equilibrium partition coefficient, Kp, was not dependent upon sorbent concentration. Due to the <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> needed to reach sorption equilibrium, the kinetic approach to modeling sorption in subsurface environments may be more accurate than the use of local equilibrium assumptions...|$|R
