40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the operating efficiency of <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in Langao which is remote city in North East of China. Based on the Farrell’s concept of efficiency, this paper selected inputs and output factors for <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> by using fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), there are four input factors among them, namely the number of employment, assets, operating expenses and management costs, but there are two output factors, namely the number of members and operating income. Furthermore, this paper used data envelopment analysis to establish efficiency boundary function and obtained the operating efficiency of <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> In terms of all of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> there are total 14 <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in the 104 DMU, and their values of operating efficiency are both one. In addition, business entities and models of various types of <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> are not the same, so this study fit vegetables and fruit and livestock farming cooperatives, which was proposed by Golany and Roll in 1989. In the terms of efficiency of vegetables and fruits of <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> the operating efficiency values of ten ones are one, however, the livestock operators with the operating efficiency who have twelve. Finally, the use of AHP further distinguished the efficient operation of <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in order to select the best business model. On all of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> Lin-Xiang pig production cooperatives in Langao area were the best operating efficiency.

40|$|Japanese <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> were {{established}} driven by postwar government policy, and {{have now become}} a system. In recent years, however, the definition {{is about to change}} significantly. The study group installed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in 2003 stated that <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> should not be given special treatment in future administrative management. This symbolizes a transformation from the complementary administrative organization. A policy for improvement must be taken for those <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> whose farming-related services - including sales, procurement and farming guidance services - are in the red. These farming-related deficits are covered by profits from credit and mutual aid services in many <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> By doing so, their services have continued to exist, and the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> have continued to provide services to the members. There is a possibility that comprehensive services like these {{will not be able to}} be maintained in the future. Although strictly calculating profits and losses in business is important for management, it may dissolve comprehensive Japanese <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> into <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> specializing only in credit and mutual aid. Comprehensiveness is targeted for restructuring. Should this occur, problems will come to the fore regarding who will be responsible for sales and procurement services for farm households. In addition, there is an increasing number of farm households that have become large in scale, incorporated, and withdrawn from the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> And they started independently conducting sales and procurement activities. Under these circumstances, the system of agricultural cooperatives' sales and procurement services is about to be forced to undergo restructuring. This is tantamount to a shift from the all-encompassing principles. As mentioned above, characteristics of Japanese <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> such as a function to complement government's policy, comprehensiveness, and multifunctionality are now at stake. In order to protect food and agriculture in Japan, it is necessary to establish a new system and business activities based on the principle of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives...</b>|$|R

25|$|In the 2000s, some {{chocolate}} producers began {{to engage in}} fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fair trade seeks {{to establish a system}} of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system. One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an <b>Agricultural</b> <b>cooperative.</b> Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees. One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but {{this does not mean that}} the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.|$|E
25|$|One {{suggestion}} {{for the reason}} that laborers in Africa are marginalized in world trade is because the colonial division of labor kept Africa from developing its own industries. Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fair trade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system. Most cocoa comes from small family-run farms in West Africa. These farms have little market access and thus rely on middlemen to bring their products to market. Sometimes middlemen are unfair to farmers. Farmers do not get a fair price for their product despite relying on cocoa sales for the majority of their income. One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an <b>Agricultural</b> <b>cooperative.</b> Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees. One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but {{this does not mean that}} the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. In reality, much of this money goes to community projects such as water wells rather than to individual farmers. Nevertheless, cooperatives such as fair trade-endorsed Kuapa Kokoo in Ghana are often the only Licensed Buying Companies that will give farmers a fair price and not cheat them or rig sales. Farmers in cooperatives are frequently their own bosses and get bonuses per bag of cocoa beans. These arrangements are not always assured and fair trade organizations can't always buy all of the cocoa available to them from cooperatives.|$|E

Factors affecting the probability of joining the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> were determined using binary logit model.

Small farmers are likely expected to join the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> than the wealthier farmers are. Small farmers may wish to benefit cash at hand, input subsidies, and services provided by the <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> since the risks associated with intensive high-returning crops are high. Some important factors playing pole role in abstention of farmers towards <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> are gross income and some social status variables. In addition, conservative or orthodox farmers are less likely to join <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> than moderate farmers are.

On 7 April 1931, he married Maria Pilecka née Ostrowska (19066 February 2002), a local school teacher originally from [...] Kupa (Narach, Belarus). They had two children, born in Wilno: Andrzej (16 January 1932) and Zofia (14 March 1933). Pilecki and his family would later take up residence at Sukurcze.

In 1932 Pilecki established a cavalry training school in Lida. Shortly afterward he was appointed commander of the newly-established 1st Lidsky Squadron, a position he would hold until 1937, when this unit was absorbed into the Polish 19th Infantry Division.

500|$|Noriega {{proved to}} be a very capable head of intelligence. In that position, he had 1300 Panamanians exiled whom he viewed as threats to the government. He also kept files on several {{officials}} within the military, the government, and the judiciary, later allowing him to blackmail them. He also held the positions of head of the political police, and head of immigration. His tenure was marked by intimidation and harassment of opposition parties and their leaders. He was described as doing much of Torrijos [...] "dirty work". Journalist Frederick Kempe wrote in 1990 that Noriega had been linked to a series of bombings targeting U.S. territory that followed the administration of U.S. President Gerald Ford stepping back from negotiations about the Panama Canal during the prelude to the U.S Presidential election in 1976. The bombings highlighted to the U.S. government the difficulty of holding on to the Panama Canal Zone in the face of hostility within Panama. Kempe stated that the U.S. knew of Noriega's involvement in the bombings but decided to turn a blind eye toward them. In a December 1976 meeting with George H. W. Bush, then the director of Central Intelligence, Noriega flatly denied involvement, instead suggesting that the CIA was responsible. Noriega also ordered the death of Hector Gallegos, a priest whose work at an <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperative</b> was seen as a threat by the government: Gallegos's body is reported to have been thrown from helicopter into the sea.|$|E
500|$|The {{name change}} of the {{legislation}} reflected Brownlee's growing belief that farmers' financial troubles were due to factors more systemic than lack of rain. [...] Angry over the federal government's decision to allow the first incarnation of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) to lapse, many Albertan farmers began to advocate the [...] "pooling" [...] of their wheat, which would render individual farmers less susceptible to the machinations of grain speculators by introducing collective marketing, with each farmer receiving an averaged, identical price. Farmers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba were more adamant about {{the return of the}} CWB; Prime Minister King eventually agreed to its re-creation, provided that at least two of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba passed enabling legislation and found the personnel necessary to sit on the Board. [...] By June 1923, the provinces had not found anybody suitable. Interest in pooling experienced a resurgence. [...] In July, a UFA meeting, which Brownlee attended as the government's representative, endorsed the creation of a wheat pool as soon as practicable. Brownlee and his cabinet colleague Richard Gavin Reid undertook an investigation of how soon this might be, which included a trip to San Francisco to meet with Aaron Sapiro, an American <b>agricultural</b> <b>cooperative</b> leader. Sapiro proclaimed that a wheat pool could be organized in a few weeks, though both Brownlee and Reid disagreed and returned to Canada committed to caution. [...] However, in their absence the Edmonton Journal and Calgary Herald had invited Sapiro to tour Alberta, and his speeches stirred up extravagant expectations among UFA members for immediate action, in time for the new organization to market the 1923 crop.|$|E
40|$|The {{intention}} of rural development is {{to guarantee the}} population of an agricultural environment a set of living conditions that are {{comparable to those of}} urban areas. This is why it is so important that there are agents capable of creating initiatives that {{contribute to the development of}} rural communities.

40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>cooperatives</b> {{have been}} an {{important}} way for farmers to organise themselves.
