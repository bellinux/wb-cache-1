40|$|Abstract: Quartz-monzodioritic dykes have intruded the Hercynian {{continental}} lower {{crust of}} Calabria at 323 ± 5 Ma. Pseudosection and average PT calculations {{have been performed}} using THERMOCALC. The obtained P (average PT) and T (pseudosection and average PT) values indicate that the quartzmonzodioritic dykes have intruded the 750 °C hot metapelitic-migmatitic country-rocks {{at a depth of}} about 32 km, with a temperature of ca. 850 °C. Microstructural analysis suggests that deformation of the dykes started at hypersolidus conditions during emplacement and continued after cooling at subsolidus granulite facies conditions together with the country rocks. During this deformation event, which started not later than 323 ± 5 Ma ago, the main Sn+ 1 schistosity evolved. Vorticity analysis of the quartz-metadioritic dykes and of the metapelitic country rocks shows that the Sn+ 1 schistosity evolved during a general shear deformation characterized by 60 to 70 percent of pure shear. This high percentage of pure shear suggests that the main Sn+ 1 schistosity evolved in the hot lower crust undergoing extension during vertical shortening. A horizontal attitude of this extensional schistosity is confirmed by retro-deformation of the today obliquely SE-ward dipping Sn+ 1 schistosity. Extension continued with time and propagated upwards within the crust, affecting the middle crust in a time interval of 306 ± 1 to ca. 300 Ma when huge masses of granitoid rocks intruded it. The deepest batches of these granitoid bodies show a gneissic schistosity which developed under ductile conditions, while granitoids at higher levels became deformed in a brittle fashion. Our whole data set is consistent with a late Hercynian evolution in Calabria characterized by a progressively crust overlying a mantle that gradually rose during lithospheric extension. This extension was <b>asynchronous,</b> <b>starting</b> at 323 ± 5 Ma in the lower crust and affecting higher crustal levels at progressively later times...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: According to the European Community plan POWER III, the {{rehabilitation}} of the power system of Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) and its reconnection with Croatian power system should {{be completed by the}} end of 2005. Use of available resources under constraints imposed by actual and prospective states of the power systems of BiH and Croatia (particularly Adriatic lines) leads to operational problems: violation of (n- 1) criteria, high voltages, voltage instability, thermal power plants (TPPs) operating below minimum, etc. Having outstanding capabilities, pumped storage HPP Čapljina (2 x 240 MVA) could contribute to mitigating some of those problems while fully exploiting its advantages on the open electricity market. Two system services should be provided for HPP Čapljina: <b>asynchronous</b> <b>start</b> (with and/or without phase reactors at the generator starpoint) and transmission capacity for pumping. To find out if these services are available before rehabilitation of the power system a study was done and results are outlined in this paper. Regarding voltage / reactive power dynamics, <b>asynchronous</b> <b>start</b> of units at HPP Čapljina with phase reactors is possible, but reactive capability of nearby generators is fully used. With the other machine at HPP Čapljina operating as generator voltage/reactive power conditions {{in this part of the}} system are significantly improved. Two variants of supplying power for pumping were considered, from TPPs in BiH and from UCTE.

The security risks of online contest also include eavesdropping during data transmission without intended rights, and false start by malicious competitors, which also means asynchrony in contests.

40|$|In this article, {{we study}} {{algorithms}} for dynamic networks with <b>asynchronous</b> <b>start,</b> i. e., each node may start running the algorithm {{in a different}} round. Inactive nodes transmit only heartbeats, which contain no information but can be detected by active nodes. We make no assumption {{on the way the}} nodes are awakened, except that for each node u there is a time $s_u$ in which it is awakened and starts to run the algorithm. The identities of the nodes are not mutually known, and the network size is unknown as well. We present synchronization algorithms, which guarantee that after a finite number of rounds, all nodes hold the same round number, which is incremented by one each round thereafter. We study the time complexity and message size required for synchronization, and specifically for simultaneous synchronization, in which all nodes synchronize their round numbers at exactly the same round. We show that there is a strong relation between the complexity of simultaneous synchronization and the connectivity of the dynamic graphs: With high connectivity which guarantees that messages can be broadcasted in a constant number of rounds, simultaneous synchronization by all nodes can be obtained by a deterministic algorithm within a constant number of rounds, and with messages of constant size. With a weaker connectivity, which only guarantees that the broadcast time is proportional to the network size, our algorithms still achieve simultaneous synchronization, but within linear time and long messages. We also discuss how information on the network size and randomization may improve synchronization algorithms, and show related impossibility results. Comment: 17 page...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{topic in}} wireless networking {{is the development}} of reliable algorithms for environments suffering from adversarial interference. This term captures any type of channel disruption outside the control of the algorithm designer-from contention with unrelated devices to malicious jamming. In this thesis, we provide four contributions toward a comprehensive theoretical treatment of this topic. First, we detail a formal modeling framework. This framework is general enough to describe almost any radio network studied to date in the theory literature. It can also precisely capture the often subtle details of adversarial behavior. In addition, we prove a pair of composition results that allow a layered strategy for designing radio network algorithms The results can be used to combine an algorithm designed for a powerful channel with an implementation of this channel on a less powerful channel. Next, we formalize adversarial interference with the definition of the t-disrupted channel. We then define the more powerful (t, b, p) -feedback channel, and provide both a randomized and deterministic implementation of the latter using the former. To emphasize the utility of this layered approach, we provide solutions to the set agreement, gossip, and reliable broadcast problems using the powerful feedback channel. Combined with the implementation algorithms and composition results, this automatically generates solutions to these problems for the less powerful, but more realistic, t-disrupted channel. Finally, we define a variant of the modeling framework that captures the attributes of an ad hoc network, including <b>asynchronous</b> <b>starts</b> and the lack of advance knowledge of participating devices. (cont.) Within this new framework, we solve the wireless synchronization problem on a t-disrupted channel. This problem requires devices to agree on a common round numbering scheme. We conclude by discussing how to use such a solution to adapt algorithms designed for the original model to work in the ad hoc variant. by Calvin Newport. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Within species, interindividual, interpopulational and interannual vari-ation have been documented. Thermal seasonality, changing between sites and years, determines not only the length of the reproductive season but also the intensity of variation for several reproductive parameters.

Similarity means that robots must be disposed as F regardless of translations, rotations, reflections, uniform scalings. Initially, each robot occupies a distinct position. When active, a robot operates in standard Look-Compute-Move cycles. Robots are asynchronous, oblivious, anonymous, silent and execute the same distributed algorithm. So far, {{the problem has been}} mainly addressed by assuming chirality, that is robots share a common left-right orientation. We are interested in removing such a restriction. While working on the subject, we faced several issues that required close attention. We deeply investigated how such difficulties were overcome in the literature, revealing that crucial arguments for the correctness proof of the existing algorithms have been neglected. Here we design a new deterministic distributed algorithm that solves PF for any pattern when <b>asynchronous</b> robots <b>start</b> from asymmetric configurations, without chirality. The focus on asymmetric configurations might be perceived as an over-simplification of the subject due to the common feeling with the PF problem by the scientific community.

The systematic lack of rigorous arguments with respect to necessary conditions required for providing correctness proofs deeply affects the validity as well as the relevance of strategies proposed in the literature.

These circuits are similar to quasi delay-insensitive (QDI) circuits, but the normal four-phase QDI handshake is replaced with a simpler two-phase pulsed handshake. While a delay-insensitive two-phase handshake requires complicated decoding circuits, the pulsed handshake maintains the simpler, electrically beneficial signaling senses of four-phase handshaking by using timing assumptions that are easy to meet. We cover many aspects of designing moderately large digital systems out of STAPL circuits, from the communicating-process level to the production-rule and transistor level. We study the theory of operation of pulsed <b>asynchronous</b> circuits, <b>starting</b> with simple pulse repeaters; hence we progress to a general theory of operation for pulsed asynchronous circuits. This theory is a generalization of the theory of operation of synchronous digital circuits. We then develop the family of STAPL circuits. This is a complete family of dataflow processes: the presented circuits can compute unconditionally as well as conditionally; they can also store state and arbitrate. Next, we present some aspects of automatic design-tools for compiling from a higher-level description to STAPL circuits. Many of these aspects apply equally well to tools for QDI circuits; in particular, we study boolean-simplification operations that may be used for improving the performance of slack-elastic asynchronous systems. Finally, a simple 32 -bit microprocessor is presented as a demonstration that the circuits and design methods work as described.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new, domain-specific specification language called CONCEPTUAL. CONCEPTUAL enables {{the expression of}} sophisticated communication benchmarks and network validation tests in comparatively few lines of code. Besides helping programmers save time writing and debugging code, CONCEPTUAL addresses the important— but largely unrecognized—problem of benchmark opacity. Benchmark opacity refers to the current impracticality of presenting performance measurements {{in a manner that}} promotes reproducibility and independent evaluation of the results. For example, stating that a performance graph was produced by a “bandwidth ” test says nothing about whether that test measures the data rate during a round-trip transmission or the average data rate over a number of back-toback unidirectional messages; whether the benchmark preregisters buffers, sends warm-up messages, and/or pre-posts <b>asynchronous</b> receives before <b>starting</b> the clock; how many runs were performed and whether these were aggregated by taking the mean, median, or maximum; or, even whether a data unit such as “MB/s ” indicates 106 or 220 bytes per second. Because CONCEPTUAL programs are terse, a benchmark’s complete source code can be listed alongside performance results, making explicit all of the design decisions that went into the benchmark program. Because CONCEPTUAL’s grammar is English-like, CONCEPTUAL programs can easily be understood by non-experts. And because CONCEPTUAL is a high-level language, it can target a variety of messaging layers and networks, enabling fair and accurate performance comparisons. 1...|$|R

V. started the Tomation project in 2002 to automate the task of cutting off the leaves of tomato plants. Cutting off the leaves of tomato plants is one of the crop handling tasks done on a regular basis to ensure optimal growth and ripening of the tomatoes. This report presents research concerning the Tomation Project of Priva B. V., aimed at solving the problem of autonomous movement of the leaf-cutting robot in the greenhouse. The robot has to move autonomously in the path and periodically change from path to path. The focus in this report is on the path-to-path movement in the greenhouse. This is a movement where the vehicle rides off the rail, moves to the next path and finally drives back on the rail again to continue with the leaf cutting process. The robot platform is a vehicle equipped with omni-directional mecanum wheels and powered by stepper motors from Nanotec®. These mecanum wheels are omnidirectional wheels and are able to move the vehicle in a lateral direction. The vehicle will move with mecanum wheels on the concrete path and with flanged wheels on the rail. The vehicle with the mecanum wheels encountered difficulties driving sideways at a critical weight on the platform. Undesired movements occur at these weights, because the stepper motor is not performing all the steps. The scope of the project includes the autonomous path-to-path movement of the robot. The vision system for navigational purposes is not installed yet on the platform. Hence, the inputs from the system are entered manually in this project. It has to be taken into account that the vision system can only look at the front. The path-to-path movement should meet requirements on accuracy, time, speed and the payload of the vehicle. Furthermore, the vehicle has to be able to cope with cracks and obstructions on the road during the movement. Finally, it has to deal with rails that are shifted, because they are not fixed properly on the concrete path. Using the positional feedback of the encoders of the available stepper motor and inputs of a vision system a proper control system is required. To get a good starting point to develop the autonomous movement of the platform, it was important to have a good understanding of the stepper motor and a clear view on the possibilities and modes of use of the motor. The working principle of the stepper motor is explained by describing the common step modes: the full step, the half step and the micro step mode. The difference between the stepper motor and a servo motor is explained. Based on the differences between these motors, the choice on the stepper motor has been reasoned. The technical specifications and the Software Development Kit of the motors are presented. These were needed to learn the possibilities in controlling and using the motors. The mecanum wheels of the vehicle of the Tomation Project serve for omnidirectional purposes. The possibility to move in a lateral direction with these wheels was the main reason for using them. The wheels offer a way to do compact movements on the path, without obstructing the path more than necessary to avoid possible conflicts with other (moving) objects. The omnidirectional movement is realized by appropriately controlling the angular velocity of each wheel separately. Depending on each individual wheel rotation direction and velocity, the resulting combination of the wheels produces a total movement in the desired direction without changing the orientation of the wheels. The navigational purposes of the Tomation project required a proper kinematic model of the vehicle. The equations of motion are used to derive the ideal kinematic model to reach a desired position and orientation. The measured position errors are dealt with by adjusting the kinematic model with experiments. The sources of these errors were slippage, bearing friction and point contact friction. A comprehensive research on rollers of the wheels during omnidirectional movements is performed. This was needed to understand the motion of the rollers and its contribution to the omnidirectional movements. The analyses have shown that as the movement with the vehicle gets more lateral, the rollers will contribute more to the movement. This was also observed during movements of the vehicle. These observations and analyses on the rollers are used to explain the dynamics of the wheels. To understand why the lateral movement of the vehicle needs more phase current than the forward movement, the dynamics of the mecanum wheels are investigated. A misconception in the literature on the dynamic model is explained. The literature neglects the force perpendicular to the rollers without a proper reasoning. The aspect of motion in the rollers is not taken into account. Hence, it is decided to reject the theory in the literature on the dynamics of these vehicles. With observations and analyses on the wheels a new dynamic model has been developed. This model takes also the friction in the rollers into account. This friction causes the main difference between the required force for the forward and lateral movement. It is seen that as the movement gets more lateral, the rollers will have more contribution, so the movement will be more affected by friction. Hence, the lateral movement needs more force to overcome the friction compared to a forward movement. The vehicle of the Tomation project encountered practical problems related to the navigational features of the vehicle. The effects of these problems are analysed and solutions are presented when needed. To navigate properly in the greenhouse a function is developed that provides the number of steps needed per wheel for a given omnidirectional movement. Furthermore, the undesired effects, caused by rounding the target speed of the motor, are dealt with by looking for the nearest movement without these errors. Next, the <b>asynchronous</b> <b>start</b> of the motors caused by the serial connection is solved with an Arduino board that generates a signal to start all the motors simultaneously. Finally, an ultrasonic proximity sensor is used to detect the concrete path when riding off the rail backwards. The vision system could not be used here, since the cameras are facing forward. These functions and additions improve the reliability and robustness of the movement in the greenhouse. With the aforementioned functions and findings from the analyses a reliable and proper path to path movement in the greenhouse is ensured. The movement is split into three separate movements: riding off the rail, moving across to the next path and driving on the rail of the new path. After analysing alternatives for these movements, it has been decided that the vehicle will move just with two motors in the area where transition from the mecanum wheels to the flanged wheels occurs. A lateral movement with the current setup was not feasible for the required payload. If we disregard the payload of the robot, the remaining conditions did meet the requirements of the movement. The research in this project has contributed to the autonomous movement for the vehicle of the Tomation Project of Priva. The path-to-path movement of the vehicle is realized in a reliable way, provided that the motors are strong enough to deliver the required force for the movements. The results will be used for further steps in the project. Mechanical EngineeringDelft Center for Systems and ControlMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
