5|$|Hurricane Iris was {{the ninth}} named storm and fifth {{hurricane}} of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Iris {{was the first}} of three tropical cyclones to affect the Lesser Antilles in a three-week period, preceding the more destructive hurricanes Luis <b>and</b> <b>Marilyn.</b> It developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles on August22 and attained hurricane status within 30hours. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm before crossing the islands of the eastern Caribbean from August26 through August28. During that time, Iris became one of four active tropical storms in the Atlantic basin. Earlier it had interacted with Hurricane Humberto, and beginning on August30, Iris interacted with Tropical Storm Karen. Iris re-intensified into a hurricane and attained peak sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h) while moving slowly across the central Atlantic. The hurricane accelerated to the north and absorbed a dissipating Tropical Depression Karen on September3. Iris weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical on September4, though its remnants reattained hurricane-force winds before affecting western Europe on September7.|$|E
