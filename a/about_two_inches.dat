25|$|According {{to local}} lore, the Sunken Garden sinks by <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> every year. Though {{this has not}} been {{verified}} in any study, some have posited reasons for the sinking: one is that it is because of underground trenches over the campus' sewer system that connect to the Marikina Fault Line, an active geologic structure that runs across the east of Metro Manila. Another theory is that the depression was due to the emptying of former streams in the Sunken Garden that were prominent in the 1950s. These streams formerly run from the Katipunan Avenue, going to the garden itself and leaves the campus for the Commonwealth Avenue.|$|E
25|$|The submandibular glands are a pair {{of major}} salivary glands located beneath the lower jaws, {{superior}} to the digastric muscles. The secretion produced {{is a mixture of}} both serous fluid and mucus, and enters the oral cavity via the submandibular duct or Wharton duct. Approximately 65-70% of saliva in the oral cavity is produced by the submandibular glands, even though they are much smaller than the parotid glands.You can usually feel this gland, {{as it is in the}} superficial cervical region and feels like a rounded ball.

Patton commanded the battle from a shell hole for another hour before being evacuated. He stopped at a rear command post to submit his report before heading to a hospital. Sereno E.

500|$|Viking art avoided naturalism, favouring stylised animal motifs {{to create}} its {{ornamental}} patterns. Ribbon-interlace was important and plant motifs became fashionable in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Most Scottish artefacts come from 130 [...] "pagan" [...] burials {{in the north}} and west from the mid-ninth to the mid-tenth centuries. These include jewellery, weapons and occasional elaborate high status items. Amongst the most impressive of these is the Scar boat burial, on Orkney, which contained an elaborate sword, quiver with arrows, a brooch, bone comb, gaming pieces and the Scar Dragon Plaque, made from whalebone, most of which were probably made in Scandinavia. From the west, another boat burial at Kiloron Bay in Colonsay revealed a sword, shield, iron cauldron and enamelled scales, which may be Celtic in origin. A combination of Viking and Celtic styles can be see in a penannular brooch from Pierowall in Orkney, which has a Pictish-style looped pin. It is <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> in diameter, with traces of gilding, and probably housed a piece of amber surrounded by interweaving ribbons. After the conversion to Christianity, from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, stone crosses and cross-slabs in Viking occupied areas of the Highlands and Islands were carved with successive styles of Viking ornament. They were frequently mixed with native interlace and animal patterns. Examples include the eleventh-century cross-slab from Dóid Mhàiri on the island of Islay, where the plant motifs {{on either side of the}} cross-shaft are based upon the Ringerike style of Viking art. The most famous artistic find from modern Scotland, the Lewis Chessmen, from Uig, were probably made in Trondheim in Norway, but contain some decoration that may have been influenced by Celtic patterns.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{sightings}} of fish as far downstream as Manchester city centre {{were reported in}} local newspapers.

[...] In 1983 over 100canal and river boats rode the flooded river for the Greater Manchester Waterways Festival, an event aimed at demonstrating how pleasure boating could [...] "transform the bleak waterway in the heart of Manchester". By 1984 two local men felt the waters were clean enough for them to brave a ten-mile (16km) charity fund-raising swim from Clifton to Manchester, although they were warned by a spokesman for the North West Water Authority that the cocktail of effluent and occasional untreated sewage meant that the Irwell was still [...] "a class 4 river– top of the pollution chart". [...] During 1985 the Croal–Irwell Valley local plan was launched, listing 187proposals for the improvement of the valley and in 1986 the Mersey Basin Campaign was announced. [...] The campaign was to cover a large area, from Rossendale in the north to Crewe in the south, and it was promised that £67m would be made available in the first three years for water- and land-based projects. [...] In September 1987 plans were revealed for a mile-long landscaped walkway in Manchester city centre and developers announced plans to develop three bricked-up railway arches {{on the side of the}} river, opposite Manchester Cathedral, into a wine bar and restaurant. In 1988 Manchester's first water bus made its maiden voyage from the New Bailey Landing Stage, then known as the Mark Addy Quay, on a five-mile (8km) inaugural round trip to Salford Quays By the end of the 1980s ambitious plans had been announced to turn Manchester into a top international tourist centre [...] "mainly based on the derelict areas around the waterways of Manchester, Salford and Trafford– the Irwell, the Irk, the ship canal and the Bridgewater Canal...bringing £500m of investment and 13,000newjobs over the next 10years".

It is ornamented with six small, black crosses distributed about the shoulders, breast and back, and is fixed in place by three golden pins, symbolic of the nails with which Christ was crucified. Only the pope wears the pallium by right, and he may wear it at all ecclesiastical functions without restriction. In the Latin/Western rite of the church, metropolitans (that is, archbishops who are the senior bishops of an ecclesiastical province) also wear a form of the pallium within their own province, and which they must receive from the pope, either personally or in a ceremony at which another bishop delegated by the pope presides. Pope Benedict XVI, for his inauguration in 2005, introduced a special type of pallium that is worn only by the pope. The new papal pallium is based upon the earlier form of the pallium, similar to the omophorion which is still worn by Eastern Christian bishops. The papal pallium is wider and longer than the ordinary pallium, and has red crosses on it. [...] On the Feast of Sts. Peter and Paul in 2014, Pope Francis returned {{to the use of the}} usual black pallium.|$|E

News of the approaching army reached Zhao Yurong in Qizhou, and despite being outnumbered nearly eight to one, he decided to hold the city. Qizhou's arsenal consisted of some three thousand thunderclap bombs, twenty thousand [...] "great leather bombs" [...] (皮大炮), and thousands of gunpowder arrows and gunpowder crossbow bolts. While the formula for gunpowder had become potent enough to consider the Song bombs to be true explosives, {{they were unable to}} match the explosive power of the Jin iron bombs. Yurong describes the uneven exchange thus, [...] "The barbaric enemy attacked the Northwest Tower with an unceasing flow of catapult projectiles from thirteen catapults. Each catapult shot was followed by an iron fire bomb , whose sound was like thunder. That day, the city soldiers in facing the catapult shots showed great courage as they maneuvered [...] catapults, hindered by injuries from the iron fire bombs. Their heads, their eyes, their cheeks were exploded to bits, and only one half [...] was left." [...] Jin artillerists were able to successfully target the command center itself: [...] "The enemy fired off catapult stones ... nonstop day and night, and the magistrate's headquarters [...] at the eastern gate, as well as my own quarters ..., were hit by the most iron fire bombs, {{to the point that they}} struck even on top of [...] sleeping quarters and [...] nearly perished! Some said there was a traitor. If not, how would they have known the way to strike at both of these places?"

They are made with pig iron, <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>inches</b> thick, and they cause the city's walls to shake." [...] Houses were blown apart, towers battered, and defenders blasted from their placements. Within four weeks all four gates were under heavy bombardment. Finally the Jin made a frontal assault on the walls and scaled them, after which followed a merciless hunt for soldiers, officers, and officials of every level. Zhao managed an escape by clambering over the battlement and making a hasty retreat across the river, but his family remained in the city.
