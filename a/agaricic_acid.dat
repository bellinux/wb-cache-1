40|$|Some {{antitumor}} agents {{known to}} specifically inhibit certain tumor cell enzymes were examined for activity against glycolytic enzymes {{and growth of}} the insect trypanosomatid, Crithidia fasciculata. The cytoplasmic enzymes hexokinase, α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, malic dehydrogenase, and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase were tested. <b>Agaricic</b> <b>acid</b> (2 -hydroxy- 1, 2, 3 -nonadecane tricarboxylic acid) was highly inhibitory (50 to 100 %) to malic and α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenases at ∼ 3 × 10 − 5 m; 2 -(p-hydroxyphenyl) - 2 -phenylpropane (2 × 10 − 4 m), and 5, 6 -dichloro- 2 -benzoxazolinone (5 × 10 − 4 m) were less effective (50 % inhibition) against them. The antiprotozoal agents primaquine (4 × 10 − 4 m) and Melarsoprol (8 × 10 − 4 m) were 30 to 40 % inhibitory. <b>Agaricic</b> <b>acid,</b> 2 -(p-hydroxyphenyl) - 2 -phenylpropane, and 5, 6 -dichloro- 2 -benzoxazolinone inhibited growth of Crithidia at less than 10 − 4 m. Eight other test compounds from the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center (CCNSC) were not toxic to cell growth, although two (4 -biphenylcarboxylic acid and 1 -[p-chlorobenzyl]- 2 -ethyl- 5 -methyl-indole- 3 -acetic acid) inhibited Crithidia α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase below 1 mm. All of the compounds used specifically inhibited cancer cell α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. The corresponding enzyme in pathogenic African trypanosomes is important in their terminal respiration. C. fasciculata {{may be useful in}} preliminary evaluation of chemotherapeutic agents as potential trypanocides...|$|E
40|$|The {{protozoan}} haemoflagellate Trypanosoma brucei has two NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, {{each with}} a different localization within the cell. One isoenzyme {{is found in the}} cytosol, as in other eukaryotes, while the other is found in the glycosome, a microbody-like organelle that fulfils an essential role in glycolysis. The kinetic properties of the purified glycosomal and cytosolic isoenzymes were compared with homologous enzymes from other organisms. Both trypanosome enzymes had pH/activity profiles similar to that of other glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenases, with optimal activity around pH 8. 5 - 9. Only the yeast enzyme showed its maximal activity at a lower pH. The glycosomal enzyme was more sensitive to changes in ionic strength below 0. 1 M, while the cytosolic enzyme resembled more the enzymes from rabbit muscle, human erythrocytes and yeast. The affinity for NAD of the glycosomal enzyme was 5 - 10 -fold lower than that of the cytosolic, {{as well as the other}} enzymes. A similar, but less pronounced, difference was found for its affinity for NADH. These differences are explained by a number of amino acid substitutions in the NAD-binding domain of the glycosomal isoenzyme. In addition, the effects of suramin, gossypol, <b>agaricic</b> <b>acid</b> and pentalenolactone on the trypanosome enzymes were studied. The trypanocidal drug suramin inhibited both enzymes, but in a different manner. Inhibition of the cytosolic enzyme was competitive with NAD, while in the case of the glycosomal isoenzyme, with NAD as substrate, the drug had an effect both on K(m) and V(max). The most potent inhibitor was pentalenolactone, which at micromolar concentrations inhibited the glycosomal enzyme and the enzymes from yeast and Bacillus stearothermophilus in a reversible manner, while the rabbit muscle enzyme was irreversibly inhibited...|$|E
40|$|In Trypanosoma brucei {{the enzyme}} glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase, {{like most other}} enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, resides in a microbody-like organelle, the glycosome. Here we report a {{detailed}} study of this enzyme, involving a determination of its kinetic properties and the cloning and sequence analysis of its gene. The gene codes for a polypeptide of 606 amino acids, with a calculated Mr of 67280. The protein predicted from the gene sequence has 54 - 58 % positional identity with its yeast and mammalian counterparts. Compared to those other glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerases the trypanosomal enzyme contains an additional 38 - 49 amino acids in its N-terminal domain, {{as well as a}} number of small insertions and deletions. The additional amino acids are responsible for the 5 -kDa-larger subunit mass of the T. brucei enzyme, as measured by gel electrophoresis. The glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase of the trypanosome has no excess of positive residues and, consequently, no high isoelectric point, in contrast to the other glycolytic enzymes that are present in the glycosome. However, similar to other glycosomal proteins analyzed so far, specific clusters of positive residues can be recognized in the primary structure. Comparison of the kinetic properties of the T. brucei glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase with those of the yeast and rabbit muscle enzymes did not reveal major differences. The three enzymes have very similar pH profiles. The affinity for the substrate fructose 6 -phosphate (Km = 0. 122 mM) and the inhibition constant for the competitive inhibitor gluconate 6 -phosphate (Ki = 0. 14 mM) are in the same range as those of the similar enzymes. The Km shows the same strong dependence on salt as the rabbit muscle enzyme, although somewhat less than the yeast glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase. The trypanocidal drug suramin inhibits the T. brucei and yeast enzymes to the same extent (Ki = 0. 29 and 0. 36 mM, respectively), but it had no effect on the rabbit muscle enzyme. <b>Agaricic</b> <b>acid,</b> a potent inhibitor of various glycosomal enzymes of T. brucei, has also a strong, irreversible effect on glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase, while leaving the yeast and mammalian enzymes relatively unaffected...|$|E
