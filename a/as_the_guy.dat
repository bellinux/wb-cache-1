His {{character}} was initially described as [...] "a handsome and masculine but sensitive therapist who loves his family but has hurt his wife." [...] McDermott stated {{that he wanted to}} do the role to break away from his previous role as Bobby Donnell in the ABC series The Practice. [...] "This was exactly why I wanted to do this show – to change it up and do a different kind of character. People think of me <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> from The Practice... I wanted to turn that [...] on its head and hopefully I'm doing that [...] ", he said.|$|E
500|$|He {{began the}} 1981 season with five {{consecutive}} 100-yard games, including a 253-yard effort. [...] Woolfolk's best {{game as a}} Wolverine was the October 10, 1981 contest against Michigan State. The Wolverines beat the Spartans, 38-20, and Woolfolk rushed for 253 yards in 39 carries. After the game, Coach Bo Schembechler said: [...] "I wondered what a kid like that would do if he ran as much <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> on the West Coast (Marcus Allen). I didn't plan on this, but he proved he can do it. Butch {{is going to be}} our all-time leading ground gainer. There isn't any way they're going to stop him now. And so be it." [...] His 1981 rushing performance against the Spartans still stands as the fifth best single-game performance by a Wolverine running back.|$|E

[...] Fawkes was transferred to the Tower of London. [...] The King composed a list of questions to be put to [...] "Johnson", such as [...] "as to what he is, For I can never yet hear of any man that knows him", [...] "When and where he learned to speak French?", and [...] "If he was a Papist, who brought him up in it?"

500|$|Gary Anderson's missed kick {{has been}} singled out as the main {{contributing}} factor to the Vikings' loss, as the Falcons were able {{to capitalize on the}} late shift in momentum produced by an unexpected opportunity to tie and eventually win the game. Considering this impact on the game's outcome and the historic performances of Anderson and the 1998 Vikings team, the miss has since been noted as a memorable moment in the greater history of the NFL. Paul Allen, the play-by-play radio announcer for the Vikings, and Dan Barreiro both consider the miss {{as one of the most}} devastating moments in the history of Minnesota sports. According to Chad Hartman, another sports radio host based in Minneapolis, [...] " [...] will always be known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who was a part of screwing up the Vikings' trip to the Super Bowl, even though he had this magnificent season." [...] ESPN voted the miss as the most memorable play in Vikings history, and ESPN contributor Ben Goessling believes that the miss influenced misfortunes that the franchise faced in subsequent years, including two further NFC Championship losses in 2000 and 2009. Cunningham concurred by claiming, [...] "With that kick, it just seemed like the whole franchise went wide left." ...|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to record a lead single, Yankovic once again turned his {{attention}} to Michael Jackson. Jackson had just released his album Bad, a follow-up to 1983's immensely successful album Thriller. After Yankovic first heard the lead single, [...] "Bad", he immediately envisioned a parody entitled [...] "Fat". Initially, Yankovic didn't want to record another Michael Jackson parody. He later said, [...] "I was still primarily known as the 'Eat It' guy and I didn't want to become known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who just rides Michael's coattails." [...] He later relented and sought out Jackson for permission. Jackson, a fan of Yankovic's work, had already let Yankovic parody his 1983 hit single [...] "Beat It". When presented with the new potential parody, Jackson not only approved it, but let Yankovic use his own Moonwalker subway set for the music video. Yankovic later presented Jackson with a gold record of Even Worse after the album sold over 500,000 copies. Jackson was so pleased with the song and video, he ordered twelve copies to give to his friends. [...] Yankovic later said, [...] "He doesn't have to let me do this kind of stuff. [...] The only reason he would let me is because he has a great sense of humor." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of Star Trek, Roddenberry felt typecast as a producer of science fiction, despite his background in Westerns and police stories. He later described the period, saying, [...] "My dreams were going downhill because I could not get work after the original series was cancelled." [...] He {{felt that he was}} [...] "perceived <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who made the show that was an expensive flop." [...] Roddenberry had sold his interest in Star Trek to Paramount Studios in return for a third of the ongoing profits. However, this did not result in any quick financial gain; the studio was still claiming that the series was $500,000 in the red in 1982. He wrote and produced Pretty Maids All in a Row (1971), a sexploitation film directed by Roger Vadim, for MGM. The cast included Rock Hudson, Angie Dickinson, Telly Savalas, and Roddy McDowall alongside Star Trek regular James Doohan, and William J. Campbell, who had appeared as a guest in two Star Trek episodes, [...] "The Squire Of Gothos" [...] and [...] "The Trouble With Tribbles". Variety was unimpressed: [...] "Whatever substance was in the original [...] or screen concept has been plowed under, leaving only superficial, one-joke results." [...] Herbert Solow had given Roddenberry the work as a favor, paying him $100,000 for the script.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the vast stores of {{information}} made accessible on the web, one hundred critics pointed to a decrease in the desire to recall certain types of information, indicating, they believed, a change in the process of recalling information, as well as the types of information that are recalled. According to Ben Worthen, a Wall Street Journal business technology blogger, the growing importance placed on the ability to access information instead of the capacity to recall information straight from memory would, in the long term, change the type of job skills that companies who are hiring new employees would find valuable. Due to an increased reliance on the Internet, Worthen speculated that before long [...] "the guy who remembers every fact about a topic may not be as valuable <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who knows how to find all of these facts and many others". Evan Ratliff of Salon.com wondered if the usage of gadgets to recall phone numbers, as well as geographical and historical information, had the effect of releasing certain cognitive resources that in turn strengthened other aspects of cognition. Drawing parallels with transactive memory — a process whereby people remember things in relationships and groups — Ratliff mused that perhaps the web was [...] "like a spouse who is around all the time, with a particular knack for factual memory of all varieties". Far from conclusive, these ruminations left the web's impact on memory retention an open question.|$|E

2500|$|Jasikevičius's father Linas {{always was}} a sports lover {{and along with}} him, he {{followed}} practically everything, together they cheered for USSR national teams or any athlete who had USSR written across his or her chest. Not surprisingly, his dad {{took him to the}} first basketball workout when he was 6 years old. His first coach was Feliksas Mitkevičius in Kaunas basketball school, who was strict and not once was chasing Šarūnas when he was trying to run away from the workouts. According to Mitkevičius, when Šarūnas was 12 years old, he was so sick of basketball that he wished to drop it. He visited his parents, outlined the situation and stated {{that it would be a}} huge loss to Lithuania. Following it, his dad had a strong conversation with Šarūnas and forbade to drop basketball, which he wished to replace with tennis. In Kaunas basketball school he met with the future NBA star Žydrūnas Ilgauskas with which he was meeting practically every day, at school, in the gym or elsewhere for the next eleven years. Tomas Masiulis was another notable player in his team. Jasikevičius remembers that at first he was seen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who was [...] "talented but lazy" [...] as he was no devotee of the gym; all he did was joke around and try to work as little as possible. Consequently, once his dad stopped him from going on a trip to Minsk with the team, a trip of kind which happens only once a year, as his marks were disastrous and it was a punishment: [...] "No school? So no basketball". Though, his parents were happy to see him venting his hyperactivity in basketball, and this made them urge him on towards the sport, as it also helped him avoid bad company in the area. They played in the gym, and also in the street using scrap metal instead of real baskets, and their favorite pastime was called minus, a kind of forerunner of little game that can be seen today during the NBA All-Star Game called [...] "horse". It was far from ideal, but his parents preferred to see him play with the scrap metal hoops in front of their home rather than down at the pitch, where it would have taken him less than five minutes to pick a fight with the wrong person. His childhood dream was to become a Žalgiris Kaunas player about which he was so crazy that he knew everything about every player, even the players’ shoe sizes. Following the Žalgiris' victory in 1986 Intercontinental Cup, he begged his father to take him to the airport to welcome home the players, where hundreds of people were waiting in the freezing cold. His father knew some of the players, and managed to get signed posters and photos that he used to decorate all the walls of his room.|$|E

Darling, have you in your more {{material}} moments ever toyed with a Boyd's Premier Breakfast-Sausage or kept body and soul together with a slice off a Boyd's Excelsior Home-Cured Ham? My father makes them, and the tragedy of my life is that {{he wants me to}} help him at it. This was my position. I loathed the family business as much as dad loved it. I had a notion--a fool notion, as it has turned out--that I could make good in the literary line. I've scribbled in a sort of way ever since I was in college. When the time came for me to join the firm, I put it to dad straight. I said, [...] "Give me a chance, one good, square chance, to see if the divine fire is really there, or if somebody has just turned on the alarm as a practical joke." [...] And we made a bargain. I had written this play, and we made it a test-case. We fixed it up that dad should put up the money to give it a Broadway production. If it succeeded, all right; I'm the young Gus Thomas, and may go ahead in the literary game. If it's a fizzle, off goes my coat, and I abandon pipe-dreams of literary triumphs and start in <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who put the Co. in Boyd & Co. Well, events have proved that I am the guy, and now I'm going to keep my part of the bargain just as squarely as dad kept his. I know quite well that if I refused to play fair and chose to stick on here in New York and try again, dad would go on staking me. That's the sort of man he is. But I wouldn't do it for a million Broadway successes. I've had my chance, and I've foozled; and now I'm going back to make him happy by being a real live member of the firm. And the queer thing about it is that last night I hated the idea, and this morning, now that I've got you, I almost look forward to it.' ...|$|E
