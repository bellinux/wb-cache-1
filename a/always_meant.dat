5|$|In {{an attempt}} to better {{conditions}} for the farmer (by which Tillman <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> white males only), in 1884 he founded the Edgefield Agricultural Club. It died for lack of members. Undeterred, Tillman tried again in January 1885, beginning the Edgefield County Agricultural Society. Its membership also dwindled, but Tillman was elected one of three delegates to the August joint meeting of the state Grange and the state Agricultural and Mechanical Society at Bennettsville, and was invited {{to be one of}} the speakers.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the fourth}} Silent Hill game by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo's {{development}} group Team Silent began shortly {{after the release of}} Silent Hill 2 and alongside Silent Hill 3, with the intentions of creating a new style of game that would take the series in a different direction than the previous games. Despite what has been popularized around the Internet, Silent Hill 4 was <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> to be connected to Silent Hill and not an unrelated separate horror game that later became a Silent Hill title, although different gameplay mechanics and change were intended. News of the game's development was made public by October 2003, and official announcements by Konami followed at Gamers' Day 2004. The game was produced by the series' recurring sound designer and composer Akira Yamaoka. Its working title, prior to its incorporation into the rest of the series, was simply Room 302.|$|E

5000|$|Since the Ringstraße had <b>always</b> been <b>meant</b> {{primarily}} for show, a parallel Lastenstraße (cargo road) {{was built on}} the outside of the former glacis. This street is commonly known as 2-er Linie, named after the number [...] "2" [...] in the identifiers of the various streetcar or tram lines which used it. It is still an important traffic thoroughfare.|$|R
5|$|Nhill was <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> to be a {{temporary}} location for No.1 OTU, whose home {{was to be}} East Sale, also in Victoria. As accommodation at East Sale would not be available until October 1942, the school's 1,630 personnel were relocated to Bairnsdale in June and July. The base's living quarters, recreational buildings and 88 tents could not fully accommodate this influx, so the RAAF rented hotels in Bairnsdale for 320 airmen. On 10December 1942, No.1 OTU Detached Flight, consisting of 15 Hudsons and 108 personnel including air and maintenance crews, was sent to North-Eastern Area Command to help fulfill urgent transport requirements in New Guinea. This force joined a military Douglas DC-2 and eleven civil aircraft pressed into service to form RAAF Special Transport Flight, which operated out of Wards Airfield from 14December 1942 to 11January 1943. The Hudsons flew 645 sorties, carrying some 1,100 troops and almost 800 tons of equipment. Two of the Hudsons were lost, one to enemy action and one to friendly fire, and several were damaged.|$|E
25|$|Meir {{stated in}} the 1975 edition of her {{autobiography}} My Life that “It {{is not only a}} matter, I believe, of religious observance and practice. To me, being Jewish means and has <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> being proud {{to be part of a}} people that has maintained its distinct identity for more than 2,000 years, with all the pain and torment that has been inflicted upon it.” Meir strongly identified with Judaism culturally, but when it came to her religious beliefs she was an atheist.|$|E
25|$|Kate and Sawyer {{travel to}} Hydra Island via Desmond's boat Elizabeth, {{to the site}} of the Ajira Airlines plane where Lapidus, Richard and Miles have been quickly trying to make it air-worthy. Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus {{successfully}} gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and walks toward the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly closes his eyes as he dies.|$|E
5000|$|Slava (Cлава, meaning [...] "Glory") watches were classic [...] "civil" [...] Russian watches {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "Slava Lava!". The Slava factory (known originally as the Second Moscow Watch Factory) was the second non-military watch maker established in the Soviet Union, in 1924. The watches of this brand have <b>always</b> been <b>meant</b> for civilian consumption, without military or aerospace pretensions.|$|R
50|$|This {{struggle}} {{eventually led}} to the point on the timeline occupied by the book called Ascension. While the entire metaplot has <b>always</b> been <b>meant</b> to be altered as each play group sees fit, Ascension provided multiple possible endings, with none of them being definitive (though one was meant to resolve the metaplot). Thus, there is no definitive canonical ending. Since the game is meant to be adapted to a group's tastes, the importance of this and the preceding storyline is largely a matter of personal preference.|$|R

500|$|According to Steinman, [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" [...] was {{inspired}} by Wuthering Heights, and {{was an attempt to}} write [...] "the most passionate, romantic song" [...] he could ever create. In interviews, Meat Loaf has said that, in his mind, the song was <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> to be a duet. Norwegian artist Marion Raven, who had been working on her solo album with Child, was chosen because the timbre of her voice starkly contrasts to Meat Loaf's.|$|E
500|$|Written and {{directed}} by series co-creator and executive producer Michael Schur, [...] "Time Capsule" [...] was one of six episodes filmed early after second season to accommodate Amy Poehler's pregnancy. Although <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> as the third episode of the season, {{it was the last}} of the six filmed because it had the highest amount of props that could conceal Poehler's belly. Saturday Night Live star Will Forte guest starred as Kelly Larson, a Pawnee citizen who passionately argues for including the Twilight books in the time capsule.|$|E
500|$|In interviews, Meat Loaf {{has said}} that, in his mind, {{the song was}} <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> to be a duet.

5000|$|Even {{though the}} {{transmitters}} {{were set up}} under tents, they often experienced problems with short-circuiting caused by the moisture that constantly surrounded them. Back-up units were not <b>always</b> available, which <b>meant</b> that often transmitters had to be [...] "jury-rigged" [...] {{in order to get}} anything out of them. The hot and humid air also warped the discs (records) containing the recorded programming.|$|R
60|$|I {{had made}} a little map in my pocket-book of the various {{twists and turns of}} the road through that vast Slough of Despond, marking them from hour to hour as we {{followed}} its devious wanderings. On studying this {{at the end of that}} part of our journey I realised afresh how utterly impossible it would have been for us to thread that misty maze where a few false steps would <b>always</b> have <b>meant</b> death by suffocation, had it not been for the spoor of those Amahagger travelling immediately ahead of us who were acquainted with its secrets. Had they been friendly guides they could not have done us a better turn.|$|R
500|$|Early Concepts for the Gravemind {{were done}} by Bungie artist Robert McLees. McLees is known at Bungie as the [...] "architect of the Flood", and {{had done the}} early {{concepts}} for the Flood forms in Halo: Combat Evolved. McLees' original drawings were then added to by Juan Ramirez. The Gravemind's form and design constantly changed during development. Early versions of the creature had a basic shape of a mass of tentacles, with a jagged tear in one large appendage forming a rudimentary mouth. Later on, the mouth was studded with the skulls of human and Covenant corpses for teeth. This design was later revised due to practical considerations about lip syncing the character for speech. Despite these design changes, the Gravemind's size was <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> to be huge; early concepts showed the Master Chief dwarfed by the Flood intelligence.|$|E
500|$|... "Papa's Cabin" [...] {{was written}} by John Enbom and {{directed}} by Michael Fields, marking Enbom's sixteenth and penultimate writing credit and Fields's seventh and penultimate directing credit for the series. [...] "Papa's Cabin" [...] features the final appearance of Hank Landry, played by Patrick Fabian, making it the closing installment of an eight-episode arc. The episode reveals that Tim Foyle (James Jordan) was the actual killer of Dean O'Dell, a mystery which had {{been the focus of}} the show for six episodes. Jordan had perviously played a janitor named Lucky in season two; his new character was <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> to act as a foil to Veronica. In fact, scripts had initially named Tim Foyle as simply [...] "Foil" [...] for this reason. The nickname stuck, and his full name was chosen as a pun on tin foil. The episode was the final installment of the series to air before a two-month hiatus, temporarily losing its time slot to Pussycat Dolls Present. Ain't It Cool News considered the CW's short description of the episode to be evidence that Veronica and Keith would continue working together, {{despite the fact that he}} recently became interim Sheriff.|$|E
500|$|... 10 was {{released}} {{to commemorate the}} tenth anniversary of MercyMe's single [...] "I Can Only Imagine". In 1999, the band was working on an independent record, The Worship Project, and needed one more song {{to fill out the}} project. Lead singer Bart Millard wrote the song while reminiscing about his father's death. Although the band was aiming to produce a worship record of easy-to-sing songs, they included it because it was important to Millard. It was later included on the band's major-label debut, 2001's Almost There, where it became a hit on Christian radio before crossing over and becoming successful on mainstream radio in 2003. Around eight months before the release of 10, the band had been approached by their label about producing a greatest-hits record. The band was initially against the idea, and according to Millard, they felt it had <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> a band was near the end of their career. However, Millard later remembered he had written the song in 1999, and the idea shifted from a greatest-hits record to a celebration of the song's ten-year anniversary, a concept the band was more comfortable with.|$|E

50|$|Richard {{visits the}} Berglunds' home in Washington, D.C., ostensibly {{to help in}} Walter's {{planning}} for the anti-overpopulation campaign, which they call Free Space. Richard tries to convince Patty to leave her husband, but she shows Richard the autobiography she wrote as therapy (‘Mistakes Were Made’), trying {{to convince him that}} she still loves Walter. After reading it, Richard recognizes that Patty has <b>always</b> been <b>meant</b> for Walter, but he deliberately leaves the manuscript on Walter's desk, and Walter finds the document, which was never meant for him to see. Enraged, he throws out Patty despite her claims that her affair with Richard is done and it is Walter whom she truly loves. Richard returns to Jersey City where, a few days later, he finds Patty on his apartment doorsteps.|$|R

500|$|The Court {{held that}} despite not {{mentioning}} the words [...] "straw buyers", the federal gun law that regulates transactions with “persons” or “transferees” considers the “persons” or “transferees” {{to be the}} ones getting the gun {{at the end of the}} day, not the straw persons completing the transaction on their behalf. Failure to interpret the law in such way, the Court held, would undermine the purpose of the law, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. [...] "Deliverymen, after all, are not so hard to come by." [...] The majority found Abramski's theory, that the federal law only cares about the person that is buying the gun and not the final buyer not to be true. The Court's majority opinion, written by Justice Kagan, held that if you interpret the terms “person” and “transferee,” to mean “the man at the counter”, you would undermine the purpose of the statutes, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. The Court therefore preferred to interpret the terms “person,” and “transferee,” to mean “the man getting, and <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> to get, the firearm”.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Jillian was altered several {{times by the}} show producers before its original airing; however, the final character personality {{was designed to be}} that of [...] "a bulimic cheerleader." [...] The {{character of}} Jillian was also designed to be [...] "not the brightest bauble on the tree," [...] but this too was repeatedly changed. The description of Jillian's voice being that of a bulimic cheerleader somewhat relates to a future episode plot, where Stewie calls Jillian fat, to which she responds by leaving the room and throwing up. When Stewie exclaims [...] "it's like she's fucking five," [...] this was not set to broadcast at its original air date, but rather added in at a later date for unknown reasons. When Stewie is entertaining the elderly citizens by singing a song entitled [...] "there's a hole {{in the bottom of the}} sea," [...] this is actually Seth MacFarlane's father playing the guitar, as he used to sing it to Seth when he was a child. During the making of this episode, not much thought was put into the character of Jillian, despite the fact she was <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> to be recurring character; although her regular appearances throughout season 5 were described as [...] "a big thing for Family Guy." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Omega taking over Bullet Club's leadership, he and The Young Bucks formed their own subgroup within the stable, called [...] "The Elite". Omega and The Young Bucks {{came up with the}} idea for The Elite themselves, feeling the need to create something new after being forced by NJPW into Bullet Club and what Omega called a [...] "Too Sweet", [...] "Suck it" [...] parody of the nWo. Omega stated that he and The Young Bucks were The Elite, but accepted if NJPW continued calling them Bullet Club [...] "in parentheses" [...] as the stable was their [...] "cash cow". He explained the name change by stating that following Anderson, Gallows and Styles' departures from NJPW, [...] "Bullet Club [...] so much the Bullet Club anymore", adding that the stable [...] "had all sorts of wrestlers come and go. Some were good, some were bad, some were god-awful", but that [...] "there's a place you can go to watch the most ridiculous and entertaining stuff in pro wrestling, and it's The Elite". Omega later added his opinion that Anderson, Gallows and Styles' departures had [...] "watered down" [...] Bullet Club's ranks, which is why he wanted to push The Elite to the forefront, claiming that when people said that [...] "Bullet Club [...] been doing some really cool stuff", they <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> him and The Young Bucks and not the other members of the group.|$|E
5000|$|The {{nominal rate}} is a target {{set by the}} {{governors}} of the Federal Reserve, which they enforce by open market operations and adjusting the interest paid on required and excess reserve balances. That nominal rate is almost <b>always</b> what is <b>meant</b> by the media referring to the Federal Reserve [...] "changing interest rates." [...] The actual federal funds rate generally lies within a range of that target rate, as the Federal Reserve cannot set an exact value through open market operations.|$|R
60|$|As {{this was}} the first {{resolution}} that involved a principle on which we had been required to vote, I suggested to Noah the propriety of our going round to the brigadier, and inquiring what might be the drift of so singular a proposition. Our colleague answered the question with great good-nature, giving us to understand that the Perpendiculars and the Horizontals had long been at variance on the mere coloring property of various important questions, and the real matter involved in the resolution was not visible. The former had always maintained (by <b>always,</b> he <b>meant</b> ever since the time they maintained the contrary) the doctrine of the resolution, and the latter its converse. A majority of the Riddles, just at this moment, are Perpendiculars; and, as it was now seen, they had succeeded in getting a vote on their favorite principle.|$|R
6000|$|Colonel Bury was {{the most}} open-hearted old {{bachelor}} in the country. His imagination never could conceive the possibility of everybody not being glad to meet everybody, his house could never be too full, his dinner-parties of 'a few friends' overflowed the dining-room, and his 'nobody' <b>meant</b> <b>always</b> at least six bodies. Every season was fertile in occasions of gathering old and young together to be made happy, and little Mary Ferrars, at five years old, had told her mamma that 'the Colonel's parties made her quite dissipated.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Another similar {{convention}} to denote base-2 exponents {{is using a}} letter P (or p, for [...] "power"). In this notation the significand is <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> to be hexadecimal, whereas the exponent is <b>always</b> <b>meant</b> to be decimal. This notation can be produced by implementations of the printf family of functions following the C99 specification and (Single Unix Specification) IEEE Std 1003.1 POSIX standard, when using the %a or %A conversion specifiers. Starting with C++11, C++ I/O functions could parse and print the P-notation as well. Meanwhile, the notation has been fully adopted by the language standard since C++17. Apple's Swift supports it as well. It is also required by the IEEE 754-2008 binary floating-point standard. Example: 1.3DEp42 represents 1.3DEh×242.|$|E

5000|$|Elizabeth I of England, {{primarily}} {{interested in}} {{trade with the}} east, collaborated with English merchants to form the first trading companies to the far-flung regions, using their own jargon. Their goals were to obtain trading concessions by treaty. The queen chartered the Company of Merchants of the Levant, shortened to Levant Company, and soon known also as The Turkey Company, in 1581. In 1582, the ship The Great Susan transported the first ambassador, William Harebone, to the Ottoman Porte (government of the Ottoman Empire) at Constantinople. Compared to Anatolia, Levant also means [...] "land of the rising sun," [...] but where Anatolia <b>always</b> only <b>meant</b> the projection of land currently occupied by the Republic of Turkey, Levant meant anywhere in the domain ruled by the Ottoman Porte. The East India Company (short for a much longer formal name) was chartered in 1600 for trade to the East Indies.|$|R

By lap 45, Villeneuve and Pironi were contesting the lead, with Villeneuve in front, when their Ferrari team signalled them to slow down. Villeneuve did so and was passed by his team-mate; they swapped the lead again several times before Pironi passed Villeneuve on the final lap for the win. After the race, Villeneuve said that the [...] "Slow" [...] sign at Ferrari had <b>always</b> {{previously}} <b>meant</b> that the drivers should hold their positions, adding [...] "People seem to think we had the battle of our lives! ...
