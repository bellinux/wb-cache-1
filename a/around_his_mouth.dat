25|$|Nowell {{was married}} to Troy Dendekker on May 18, 1996. Seven days later, {{on the morning of}} May 25, Sublime was {{supposed}} to begin a five-day tour through Northern California, followed by a European and East Coast tour. However, while the band was staying at the Ocean View Motel in San Francisco, drummer Bud Gaugh woke up to find Nowell lying {{on the floor next to}} his bed. His dalmatian, Lou Dog, was curled up on the bed whimpering. Bradley had tried waking up his fellow band-mates to go to the beach with him that morning, but they were too hung-over and tired to get out of bed. Initially, Gaugh assumed Nowell was too intoxicated to get into bed; however, he noticed a green film <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and it became apparent he had overdosed on heroin. Gaugh called for paramedics, but Nowell had died several hours earlier, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Nowell was cremated and his ashes were spread over his favorite surfing spot in Surfside, California. A headstone was placed at Westminster Memorial in Westminster, California in his memory.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} a guest at the tanning-party which Stewie is hosting was {{provided}} by Mike Barker. David A. Goodman comments on the DVD commentary that [...] "It's nice to hear Mike Barker back on Family Guy.," [...] as Barker had performed multiple voices of characters in previous episodes. Peter asking [...] "I'm going to prison, aren't I?" [...] when hiding in the tree after beating up Chris's bully caused {{a little bit of}} trouble for the show, though it was never edited when aired on TV. A sketch had been created showing Brian falling asleep when watching Late Night with Bib Fortuna while Stewie was still in the tanning booth, but it did not seem good enough to air, so it was never broadcast. When Stewie is being sprayed by Brian with sun-screen, Ralph Furley enters the room and mistakenly thinks he sees Brian ejaculating on Stewie. The cream was originally intended to keep squirting out of the bottle as if Brian were continuing to ejaculate despite Mr. Furley's presence, but the animation didn't look right and was removed. MacFarlane comments that he was amazed that broadcasting standards allowed them to get away with the scene, even though Brian's line, [...] "This isn't what it looks like" [...] was edited to keep the ejaculation illusion from being blatant (the TV version goes from Mr. Furley yelling, [...] "Brian" [...] and Brian reacting to Mr. Furley running out and saying, [...] "Never mind, I'll come back later!"). A deleted scene was made and designed to happen directly after Peter sickens Meg by farting in her face in which Peter steals Chris's lunch money and runs for the bus. The gag showing Dick Cheney as a Wal-Mart greeter had Cheney's greeting, [...] "Go fuck yourself" [...] bleeped out on TV, but not DVD. Peter falling to the floor after being pushed away from hitting Randy by Chris was very difficult to do, as it is difficult to do slow-motion in animation. The DVD version includes an extra scene in the car, in which Peter shows Chris how he looks like an anus by wearing a hoodie, pulling the hood on the drawstring tight <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and pushing a chocolate candy bar out of the hole to simulate defecation.|$|E
2500|$|Kurnaz accuses US {{forces of}} {{poisoning}} three rebellious prisoners. [...] "One evening, {{out of the}} blue, the guards had brought us baklava", saying it was to celebrate the release of some prisoners. One of Kurnaz's neighbors fell asleep in his cage, and lay unmoving with a white froth <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Kurnaz learned two others were removed from their cages dead in a similar state. US authorities said the three prisoners simultaneously committed suicide by taking pills. Kurnaz said in his memoir {{that this was a}} lie, since [...] "o one had any pills, and we were searched, orally as well, three times a day." ...|$|E

2500|$|Baphomet {{appears in}} Dungeons & Dragons as a {{powerful}} demon lord, and {{is also known as}} the [...] "Horned King", or the [...] "Prince of Beasts". Baphoment is followed by minotaurs and other savage creatures. He desires the end of civilizations so all creatures may embrace their most basic, brutal instincts. He is described as a massive, black minotaur, with blood <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and red eyes. He wears an iron crown topped with the heads of his enemies, along with spiked armor. He wields a huge glaive, named [...] "Heartcleaver", but commonly fights with his hooves, claws, and horns. He rules of the 600th layer of The Abyss, known as the [...] "Endless Maze", and is the sworn enemy of Yeenoghu, another demon lord.|$|E
2500|$|Dawson and Blakey left Alder lying {{face down}} on the floor, where the CCTV showed a pool of blood forming <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> One of the {{officers}} commented on the blood, but no attempt was made to examine Alder. PS Dunn was heard on the CCTV footage saying that Alder should be taken to the hospital, to which Dawson and Blakey reply that they had just come from there and that they believe Alder is feigning unconsciousness. Dawson said: [...] "This is acting now" [...] and [...] "This is just an acting thing," [...] while Blakey said: [...] "He's right as rain... This is a show, this" [...] and [...] "He kept doing dying swan acts falling off the [...] trolley." [...] A/PS Ellerington also stated later that he believed Alder was [...] "feigning deep sleep." [...] PS Dunn stated that he: [...] "formed the opinion, from what I was told, that the man's behaviour at the present time may be play-acting or attention seeking." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Game {{released}} a controversial artwork {{of the album}} via Instagram on October 21, 2012 and also announced the release date will be December 11. The cover portrays a dark-skinned Jesus in a stained glass window with a teardrop tattoo, a red bandanna <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and wearing a Jesus piece. The stained glass-inspired image shows Jesus sitting on a throne adorned with gang-related symbols. In the artwork, Jesus is holding a gold [...] "Jesus Piece" [...] chain and pointing to a symbol on his breast plate. The red bandana over his mouth is {{a reference to the}} Cedar Block Piru Bloods gang, to which Game is allegedly a member. The artwork has a slightly altered logo on the top, which features on all of Game's previous studio albums. The album's title Jesus Piece is stylized as Je5us Piece, depicting that it is Game's fifth studio album. Je5us Piece logo is styled after the iconic Louis Vuitton. The cover was designed by Mike Saputo. The religious imagery of the art has gained mixed reactions and the ire of some fans who deem the work as blasphemous. Several celebrities praised the artwork, including Busta Rhymes, Mac Miller and Kevin Hart. However, The Game decided to make this cover for the deluxe edition after the Roman Catholic Church complained to Interscope Records about it. Complex named the album cover the fifteenth best cover of 2012. On November 12, an alternative cover for the standard edition of the album was released. This cover paid homage to one of The Game's older brothers, Jevon Danell Taylor, who was shot and killed at the age of 20 on May 21, 1995.|$|E

60|$|When Sim Burns woke {{the next}} morning he felt a sharper twinge of remorse. It was not a broad or {{well-defined}} feeling--just a sense that he had been unduly irritable, not that on the whole he was not in the right. Little Pet lay with the warm June sunshine filling his baby eyes, curiously content in striking at flies that buzzed <b>around</b> <b>his</b> little <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|The old {{man turned}} <b>around</b> angrily; opened <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> {{as if to}} speak, and then, repenting of his purpose, faced the on-coming {{officers}} once more, much {{as if to say}} that such a question from such a questioner was not worthy of regard.|$|R
2500|$|The Creatures' {{most famous}} and long-standing chant {{is known as the}} roll call. In the top of the first inning, when the Yankees are on the field and their {{starting}} pitcher is getting ready to throw the first pitch, everyone in the section stands and begins clapping. After the pitch is thrown, Creature [...] "Bald" [...] Vinny Milano gestures for the crowd to calm down, then cups his hands <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and shouts out the name of the center fielder (e.g.: [...] "Yo, Aaron!", for Aaron Hicks). The whole group proceeds to chant the name until there is a response, usually {{in the form of a}} wave or a point; some Yankees respond with extra enthusiasm, such as Johnny Damon (who typically dropped to one knee and pointed at the Creatures with both hands) and Nick Swisher (who came to attention, faced the Creatures, and saluted). The Creatures move through the lineup, going from the center fielder to the left fielder, right fielder, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop and third baseman, in that order. (With the exception of a few rare instances, the pitcher and the catcher are not a part of the roll call.) Anti-obscenity laws were exercised in 2007, but are not always strictly enforced; if they are able, the Creatures will turn to the right field box seats at the completion of the Roll Call and chant [...] "Box seats suck!" [...] During the days of the bleachers' no-alcohol-sales policy, fans in the right-field box seats occasionally replied with a chant of [...] "We've got beer!" [...] If the Yankees are playing the Red Sox, the intensity of the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry takes hold; the Creatures then cut the 'box seats' chant short and instead chant [...] "Boston sucks!" [...] until that dissipates. If police cut this short, the Creatures resort to chanting [...] "No fun allowed!", or nothing at all. If a non-pitcher is replaced in a defensive position, the replacement is given the same chant. Sometimes, after a long rain delay, the Creatures will start another Roll Call just for fun. Also, until the Red Sox won the World Series in , the Creatures would chant [...] "1918!" [...] and hold up signs saying [...] "CURSE OF THE BAMBINO!" [...] and pictures of Babe Ruth to remind the Red Sox of the last time they won a championship.|$|E
60|$|As soon as Geddie {{reached this}} {{conclusion}} a wrinkle came between his brows and a stubborn look settled <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> He sat looking {{out through the}} doorway at the gigantic fire-flies traversing the quiet streets.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but they}} can't git through on that road," [...] {{put in the}} customer, wiping the lather from <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> so he could talk. [...] "The bridge is shut off--they're fixin' it--went at the work this morning." ...|$|E

50|$|Reproductive {{strategies}} are also known to vary among the species. At least one species, the Careproctus ovigerus of the North Pacific, {{is known to}} practice mouth brooding; that is, the male of the species carries the developing eggs <b>around</b> in <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> All species are known to lay a small number (about 300) of relatively large eggs (4.5-8 mm in diameter). Other species of the genus Careproctus lay their eggs in the gill cavities of king crabs.|$|R
60|$|Wheelock gripped {{a chicken}} leg imperturbably, {{and left it}} bare as a {{toothpick}} {{with one or two}} bites at it.

60|$|There {{he would}} be met by Theodore, who would bind him comfortably but {{securely}} to a chair, put a shawl <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and finally lock the door on him. Theodore would then go to his mother's and there remain quietly until I needed his services again.|$|E

60|$|The reddleman's {{walk across}} the vale, and over into the next where his cart lay, was not sprightly for a slim young fellow of twenty-four. His spirit was perturbed to aching.

60|$|We {{sat down}} to our supper of corn and beans and venison, of all of which our guest ate sparingly. He, too, was a silent man, and {{scarcely}} a word was spoken during the meal. Several times {{he looked at me}} with such a kindly expression in his blue eyes, a trace of a smile <b>around</b> <b>his</b> broad <b>mouth,</b> that I wished he might stay with us always. But once, when my father said something about Indians, the eyes grew hard as flint. It was then I remarked, with a boy's wonder, that despite his dark hair he had yellow eyebrows.|$|R
5000|$|Plný also {{engages in}} {{performance}} art and long-term projects {{in which he}} explores the process of his own aging. Over the course of many years, he has photographed himself in identical positions, and he then combined these photographs in collages {{to create a new}} artistic artifacts. His mental and physical suffering, but also physical pleasure, are transformed into art projects through which he tries to understand the limits of his own physical existence. He is not afraid to endure pain, which has a cathartic effect for him. In one series of photographs, he recorded a performance during which he sewed shoe thread <b>around</b> <b>his</b> eyes, <b>mouth,</b> and both forearms without anesthesia.|$|R
50|$|Some {{amphibians}} brood their eggs. The female salamander Ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii) curls {{around the}} clutch of eggs and massages individual eggs with her pulsating throat. Some aquatic frogs {{such as the}} Surinam toad (Pipa pipa) have pouches in their skin into which the eggs are inserted. Other neotropical frogs in the family Hemiphractidae also have pouches in which the eggs develop, in some species directly into juvenile frogs and in others into tadpoles that are later deposited in small water bodies to continue their development. The male Darwin's frog carries the eggs <b>around</b> in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> until metamorphosis, and the female stomach-brooding frog of Australia swallows the eggs, which develop in her stomach.|$|R
6000|$|... "You young devil, {{what are}} you doing?" [...] said a stifled voice behind me.

[...] "Go to the masthead--up with you, sir!" [...] he repeated sternly to Briggs.|$|E
6000|$|Already he was {{peering out}} of the window into the darkness. I could not help {{wondering}} whether it was sea-sickness alone which was responsible for his haggard features, for that grim look of covert fear which seemed to have settled <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and eyes. To me he seemed like a man who is about to face the unknown, and who fears! ...|$|E

60|$|Reassured, Barker {{no longer}} hesitated, but dashed {{with his old}} impetuousness into his former partner's room. Stacy, already deeply absorbed in other business, was sitting with his back towards him, and Barker's arms were {{actually}} encircling his neck before the astonished and half-angry man looked up. But when his eyes met the laughing gray ones of Barker above him he gently disengaged himself with a quick return of the caress, rose, shut the door of an inner office, and returning pushed Barker into an armchair in quite the old suppressive fashion of former days. Yes; {{it was the same}} Stacy that Barker looked at, albeit his brown beard was now closely cropped <b>around</b> <b>his</b> determined <b>mouth</b> and jaw in a kind of grave decorum, and his energetic limbs already attuned to the rigor of clothes of fashionable cut and still more rigorous sombreness of color.|$|R

60|$|But an {{unexpected}} circumstance occurred. Coming back, his chestnut mare refused a ten-foot wall. She reared and fell backward. Again {{he led her}} up to it lightly; again she refused, falling heavily from the coping. Guy started to his feet. The old pitiless fire shone in his eyes; the old stern look settled <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Seizing the mare by the tail and mane he threw her over the wall. She landed twenty feet on the other side, erect and trembling. Lightly leaping the same obstacle himself, he remounted her. She did not refuse the wall the next time.|$|E
60|$|Gabriel {{gazed at}} Ah Fe intently--possibly {{because he was}} the last person who had spoken to his missing wife. Ah Fe {{returned}} the gaze, discharging all expression from his countenance, except a slight suggestion of the habitual vague astonishment always seen {{in the face of a}} newborn infant. Perhaps this peculiar expression, reminding Gabriel as it did of the phenomenon in the Welch family, interested him. But the few vague wandering questions he put were met by equally vague answers. Arthur rose in some impatience; Lawyer Maxwell wiped away the smile that had been lingering <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> The interview was ended.|$|E
60|$|Herr Freudenberg sat quite {{still in}} his place. His eyes seemed fixed upon a cluster of the roses which hung down {{from the other side}} of the sweet-smelling barrier by which they were surrounded. Yet {{something}} had gone out of his face, something fresh had arrived. The half contemptuous curl of the lips was finished. His mouth now was straight and hard, his eyes set, the deep lines upon his forehead and <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> were suddenly insistent. He sat so motionless that his face for a moment seemed as though it were fashioned in wax. Then his lips moved, he spoke in a whisper which was almost inaudible.|$|E
50|$|Several {{years before}} the present, when Takeru was ten years old, his family dojo was {{challenged}} by Tesshin Kushiya. His mother, Atsuma, was killed by Tesshin before his eyes. Takeru has resented his father and uncle for not being around to protect them. As a result, he tends to take the girl's side whenever a girl fights a guy. His abilities originally manifest under extreme stress {{as in the case}} where he protected Azuki. When he defended Kodama, he used Blood Pointer, which was later described as absorbing Element from the people <b>around</b> him through <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Following the battle with the Venus unit, he underwent extra training with Minori {{in order to try to}} control and to increase his powers. Takeru later learned that he is blood related to Kodama's brother.|$|R

60|$|He was {{powerless}} to utter another syllable. A strong {{pair of arms}} were <b>around</b> <b>his</b> neck, and a handkerchief thrust into <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> He only looked towards Reist, but the look was such that Reist felt the shameful colour flood his cheeks.|$|R
