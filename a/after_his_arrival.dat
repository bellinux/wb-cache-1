5|$|A {{few days}} <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrival</b> in Buenos Aires in the United Provinces (formally named the Argentine Republic in 1826), San Martín {{was interviewed by}} the First Triumvirate. They {{appointed}} him a lieutenant colonel of cavalry, {{and asked him to}} create a cavalry unit, as Buenos Aires did not have good cavalry. He began to organize the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers with Alvear and Zapiola. As Buenos Aires lacked professional military leaders, San Martín was entrusted with the protection of the whole city, but kept focused in the task of building the military unit.|$|E

5|$|Boycott's {{regiment}} {{transferred to}} Belfast shortly <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrival.</b> Six months later, it {{was sent to}} Newry before marching to Dublin, where it remained for a year. In 1852, Boycott married Anne Dunne in StPaul's Church, Arran Quay, Dublin.

He leased a farm in County Tipperary, where he acted as a landlord on a small scale.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011 Nolan joined West Ham United on a five-year contract, joining up again with Sam Allardyce, his former manager at Bolton.

In January 2017, he took the same position at Notts County.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh's first Antarctic {{experience}} was as second officer on Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition, 1907–09. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrival</b> in the Antarctic, a shipboard accident destroyed his right eye, {{and he was}} sent back to New Zealand. He returned in 1909 to participate in the later stages of the expedition; his will and determination in adversity impressed Shackleton, and led to his Ross Sea party appointment in 1914.|$|E
50|$|Although {{speculation}} ran rampant {{about where}} Silva would sign next, the UFC announced in late April 2006 {{that they had}} signed him to a multi-fight contract.

5|$|Soon <b>after</b> <b>his</b> second <b>arrival</b> to power, Tătărescu became {{noted for}} the {{enthusiastic}} support {{he gave to}} the modernist sculptor Constantin Brâncuși, and directed state funds to finance the building of Brâncuși's The Endless Column complex in Târgu Jiu (completed in October 1938).|$|R
60|$|It bore {{date the}} day <b>after</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>arrival,</b> {{but it had}} evidently been {{continued}} at many different times; and as the handwriting became more feeble, the style grew more earnest, so that, but for her hoarse, indifferent voice, Sophy could hardly have accomplished the reading.|$|R
5|$|Malone {{immigrated to}} New Zealand in January 1880. His older brother, Austin, had {{previously}} moved to New Zealand and was {{serving in the}} New Zealand Armed Constabulary.

5|$|Shortly <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrival</b> in Australia, it was {{reported}} in the British media that Fowler would be making a swift return to his homeland and sign for League One side Tranmere Rovers, who had just appointed Fowler's former Liverpool teammate John Barnes as manager. However, Fowler was quick to dismiss talk of a quick return to England. When Barnes was dismissed three months later, it {{was reported}} that Tranmere had approached Fowler about becoming player-manager, but these reports too were dismissed.|$|E
50|$|Finding {{nothing of}} interest, Hartog {{continued}} sailing northwards along this previously uncharted coastline of Western Australia, making nautical charts {{up to about}} 22° latitude south.

50|$|Born a {{short time}} <b>after</b> <b>his</b> parents' <b>arrival</b> in Barbados, Greaves became the servant of a kindly master.

5|$|Since Andros' {{commission}} included Connecticut, {{he asked}} Connecticut Governor Robert Treat to surrender the colonial charter not long <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrival</b> in Boston. Unlike Rhode Island, whose officials readily acceded to the dominion, Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros' authority, but {{did little to}} assist him. They continued to run their government according to the charter, holding quarterly meetings of the legislature and electing colony-wide officials, while Treat and Andros negotiated over the surrender of the charter.|$|E
5|$|Soon <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrival</b> at Sigeberht's court, Felix {{established}} a church at Dommoc, his episcopal see, which is widely taken to mean Dunwich, on the Suffolk coast. Dunwich {{has since been}} almost totally destroyed by the effects of coastal erosion. Other historians have suggested as an alternative site for Felix's see the coastal Walton, Suffolk near Felixstowe, where {{there was once a}} Roman fort. A church and priory were dedicated to him there by Roger Bigod in 1105.|$|E
5|$|Soon <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrival,</b> Augustine {{founded the}} monastery of Saints Peter and Paul, which later became St Augustine's Abbey, on land {{donated by the}} king. This {{foundation}} has often been claimed as the first Benedictine abbey outside Italy, and that by founding it Augustine introduced the Rule of St. Benedict into England, {{but there is no}} evidence that the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule at the time of its foundation.|$|E
50|$|Though the {{commissions}} {{of the officers}} were dated {{in the month of}} August, the Sutherland Fencibles was raised several weeks before that of Argyle Fencibles, 1,100 men having assembled at the call of the earl of Sutherland, on the lawn before Dunrobin Castle, within nine days <b>after</b> <b>his</b> lordship's <b>arrival</b> in Sutherland with his letters of service.|$|R

50|$|On 2 March 1840 Coates {{arrived in}} Australia, having sailed from Bristol {{on the ship}} Chelydra. The Colonist {{newspaper}} reported rumours that Coates was related to Governor Sir George Gipps, and that Gipps had appointed Coates as the Colonial Secretary for New Zealand. Coates denied both rumours, stating {{that he had not}} had the honour of meeting the Governor until <b>after</b> <b>his</b> (Coates') <b>arrival</b> in Australia.|$|R
5|$|According to Glajar, this is {{the world}} of the narrator's mother, who writes of her sicknesses in her letters in the hope of keeping her {{daughter}} emotionally connected to her home village. The narrator's father {{was a member of the}} SS (as were Müller's father and uncle), and is a troubling example of Germanness. The novel proposes a tension inside Romania between the culturally totalitarian atmosphere of the Banat-Swabian community and the politically totalitarian world of Timişoara, where the main characters attend college—between German and Romanian. But the main characters who move to Germany quickly discover that although they were German in Romania, they are Romanian in Germany. They face new social, cultural and linguistic difficulties. Georg commits suicide a few weeks <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrival</b> in Frankfurt.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrival</b> in 2006, Carrick {{formed an}} {{effective}} partnership with Paul Scholes, with Carrick {{playing in a}} holding role and Scholes as a deep playmaker. This midfield partnership contributed to a change towards a continental playing style embraced by manager Alex Ferguson and assistant Carlos Queiroz, which relied on passing and keeping possession {{in contrast to the}} more traditionally direct and all-action style of English football. His unassuming style, however, has also led to a lack of attention from successive England national football team managers in favour of all-action midfielders such as Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, a fact noted by Carrick's club and national team captain Wayne Rooney.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} <b>after</b> <b>his</b> <b>arrival,</b> Hess began exhibiting amnesia, {{which may}} have been feigned in the hope of avoiding the death sentence. Medical personnel who examined Hess reported he was not insane and was fit to stand trial. At least two examiners, the British doctor and the Soviet one, noted their belief that Hess's amnesia might be fake. Efforts were made to trigger his memory, including bringing in his former secretaries and showing old newsreels, but he persisted in showing no response to these stimuli. When Hess was allowed to make a statement to the tribunal on 30 November, he admitted that he had faked memory loss as a tactic. He spoke to the tribunal again on 31 August 1946, the last day of closing statements.|$|E
