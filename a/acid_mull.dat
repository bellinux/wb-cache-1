40|$|On {{agar plates}} more colonies and species of fungi {{developed}} from oak leaves from calcareous mull (loose mixed litter and mineral matter) than from those from mor (usually compact litter layer abruptly distinct from underlying soil; without free calcium). Fungal plate counts, mycelial growth and concentration from soil under calcareous mull were lower and plate counts of bacteria and actinomycetes {{higher than those}} from mor; those from <b>acid</b> <b>mull</b> were usually intermediate. The characteristics of the fungal flora seemed influenced by water and calcium content through the chemical composition of the vegetation and its litter, and secondly by the physical factors of soil, the saprophagous soil fauna and the non-fungal microflora. The numbers of micro-organisms and mycelial growth in the mineral soil were influenced by temperature, moisture and added fresh litter. Maximum mycelium concentrations in oak soils were in autumn or winter, but not in pine soils. Mycelium was decomposed almost equally fast in mull and mor. The mull had 4 - 10 times as much chitin-decomposing and mycolytic micro-organisms than mor; mor had more mycophagous oribatid mites, consuming individually 3 times as much in summer than in winter. Fruiting bodies of toadstools were most frequent (partly dependent on soil moisture content) about 2. 5 months before mycelium reached maximum concentration. The toadstools were mostly humus and litter fungi in mull, and mycorrhizal fungi in <b>acid</b> <b>mull</b> and mor. Litter fungi occurred in all types...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of the inorganic nutrient relations of three populations of Deschampsia caespitosa growing on an <b>acid</b> <b>mull,</b> a calcimorphic brown earth and chalk rubble respectively. Nutrient concentrations in different fractions of the tussocks generally reflected the contrasting availabilities of exchangeable ions in the corresponding soils. However, pronounced seasonal patterns in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and, {{to a lesser}} extent, magnesium concentrations tended to be inversely related to a seasonal progression {{in the proportion of}} live shoot material per tussock. A concentration peak in winter was attributed to translocation from dying tissues to younger tissues and another in spring was attributed to ion uptake. Tolerance of oligotrophic soils in D. caespitosa is discussed in relation to its mode of growth and the adaptive value of internal nutrient cycling...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the gliotoxic effects of α-aminoadipic acid (AAA) in a rat model of AOH and its underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: In the rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH), intraocular pressure was increased to 110  mmHg for 60  minutes. Animals were divided into four groups: sham operation (Ctrl), AOH, AOH + phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and AOH + AAA. Cell apoptosis in the ganglion cell layer was detected with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5 &# 39;-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) immunostained with Thy- 1 were counted. Müller cell activation was detected using immunostaining with glutamine synthetase and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was examined using Western blot. Results: In the rat model of AOH, cell apoptosis was induced in the ganglion cell layer and the number of RGCs was decreased. Müller cell gliosis in the retinas of rats was induced, and retinal protein levels of TNF-α were increased. Intravitreal treatment of AAA versus PBS control attenuated these retinal abnormalities to show protective effects in the rat model of AOH. Conclusion: In the retinas of the rat model of AOH, AAA treatment attenuated retinal apoptosis in the ganglion cell layer and preserved the number of RGCs, likely through the attenuation of Müller cell gliosis and suppression of TNF-α induction. Our observations suggest that AAA might be a potential therapeutic target in glaucoma.

Five groups of species, each associated with a given habitat, were determined: above the ground surface a distinction is evident between light species (open sites), hygrophilic species (moist forest sites) and corticolous species (dry forest sites); edaphic species may be divided into acidophilic species (mor, moder and <b>acid</b> <b>mull</b> humus) and neutroacidocline species (earthworm mull).

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects on}} forest soil {{macrofauna}} of two treatments, viz. litter interception and twofold litter supply, were studied for five yr in the field. Results concern five saprophagous groups (Lumbricidae, Diplopoda, Isopoda, Coleoptera larvae, Diptera larvae) and five zoophagous groups (Geophilomorpha, Lithobiomorpha, Pseudoscorpionida, Coleoptera larvae, Diptera larvae). The litter interception {{had a negative}} effect on the abundance of most taxa, but was rather slow; there was no significant decrease in abundance before at least 1 yr in Lumbricidae, 2 yr in Isopoda and zoophagous Diptera larvae, 2. 5 yr in Diplopoda, saprophagous Diptera larvae, Geophilomorpha and Lithobiomorpha. The twofold litter supply had no significant effect on the abundance of most taxa; on the other hand, it initiated a process of dead leaf accumulation in relation to control, with an annual decomposition rate (k') higher on the control plot than on the plot with an increased litter supply.

40|$|The {{chemical}} properties of surface peat cover (SPC) were {{studied in the}} context of Estonian pedoecological conditions. SPC comprises the superficial layers of fens (Group 1) and transitional bogs (Group 2), together with slightly <b>acid</b> peaty <b>mull</b> / strongly <b>acid</b> peaty moder (Group 3) and very strongly acid peaty mor (Group 4) layers overlying mineral soils. Thus, it spans organic soils, namely Histosols (Groups 1 and 2); together with Histic Gleysols (Group 3) and Histic Podzols (Group 4), which are developmentally intermediate between organic and mineral soils. Moderately acid eutrophic (Group 1) and very strongly acid mesotrophic (Group 2) peats (forest litter layers excluded) were uniformly characterised up to 40 cm depth; whereas for Groups 3 and 4 we examined the full thickness of available peat layers, which ranged from 10 to 30 cm. The results show that Al, K and heavy metal contents are significantly higher and organic carbon content is lower in Histic Soils (3, 4) than in Histosols (1, 2). The amounts of Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe are significantly higher and C:N ratio, exchangeable acidity and content of free H+ lower in less acidic (1, 3) than in more acidic (2, 4) soil types. The total concentration of elements (excluding heavy metals) extracted by nitro-hydrochloric acid (aqua regia) is considerably higher in less acidic soils, at 28 – 45 g kg- 1 (1, 3) versus 10 – 12 g kg- 1 (2, 4); and mean contents of individual elements decrease in the order Ca(51 %) > Fe(20 %) > S(10 %) ≥ Al(10 %) > Mg(3 %) ≥ P(3 %) > K(2 %) > Mn(1 %) > Na(< 1 %). The most abundant heavy metals are Pb (12 – 33 mg kg- 1), Zn (7 – 41 mg kg- 1), Cu (3 – 12 mg kg- 1), Cr (2 – 23 mg kg- 1) and Ni (2 – 8 mg kg- 1); Cd and Hg contents are very low, ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 5 mg kg- 1. The dominant exchangeable basic cations are Ca 2 + (78 – 93 %) and Mg 2 + (7 – 15 %), and the peat contains much smaller amounts of K+ (1 – 6 %) and Na+ (< 2 %).

40|$|After {{extensive}} thinning of beechwood in the Chiltern Hills, Deschampsia caespitosa {{was seen}} to have become the dominant component of the vegetation on strongly contrasting soils.

These soils were characterized in terms of their moisture release curves and their seasonal fluctuations in water availability were monitored during 1971; a computer-based method for the derivation of matric potential directly from gypsum block resistance, employing a polynomial regression model and a temperature correction equation, is described. The chalk soil was found to hold the most available water, but severe water stress proved to be an infrequent contingency on all three sites. However, matric potentials of the order of - 10 bar occurred in summer with no apparent ill-effect on D. caespitosa, indicating that its frequent occurrence in waterlogged habitats is not due to a high physiological requirement for water but to its manifestly broad edaphic tolerance coupled with a lack of competitive ability...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of inorganic nitrogen in three strongly contrasting soils, which supported almost pure stands of Deschampsia caespitosa in the Chiltern Hills, was investigated during {{a study of}} the edaphic tolerance of the species. Seasonal changes in the rates of accumulation of nitrate- and ammonium-N, measured using an incubation method, were followed during 1971 - 72. The potential for nitrogen mineralization was assessed using incubations at 25 ? C while more realistic estimates of mineralization rates prevailing in the field were made with incubations at temperatures appropriate to the dates of collection. In the chalk soil (pH 7. 6 - 8. 3) and calcimorphic brown earth (pH 7. 0 - 8. 0) only nitrate-N accrued and at modest rates. The <b>acid</b> <b>mull</b> soil (pH 3. 7 - 4. 2) produced much more inorganic nitrogen; for much of the year this was substantially in the ammonium form but a pronounced spring peak in nitrification was observed during two successive years with some, although much less, nitrification evident for most of the study period. Nitrification could be detected in the calcareous soils even at temperatures as low as 2 ? C.
