40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that exogenous cues <b>accentuate</b> <b>contrast</b> appearance. The empirical finding is controversial because non-veridical perception challenges the idea that attention prioritizes processing resources to make perception better, and because philosophers have used the finding to challenge representational accounts of mental experience. The present experiments confirm that when evaluated with comparison paradigms exogenous cues increase the apparent contrast. In addition, contrast appearance was also changed by simply changing the purpose of a secondary task. When comparison and discrimination reports were combined in a single experiment there was a behavioral disassociation: contrast enhanced for comparison responses, but did not change for discrimination judgments, even when participants made both types of judgment for a single stimulus. That a single object can have multiple simultaneous appearances leads inescapably to the conclusion that our unitary mental experience is illusory...|$|R
40|$|By {{examining}} {{contexts in}} which ‘emergent’ oppositions appear, we consider the relative contribution of formal parallelism, connective type and semantic relation (considered {{as an indicator of}} relative semantic parallelism) in generating contrast. The data set is composed of cases of ancillary antonymy – the use of an established antonym pair to help support and/or <b>accentuate</b> <b>contrast</b> between a less established pair. Having devised measures for formal and semantic parallelism, we find that but is less likely to appear in contexts with high levels of formal parallelism than non-contrastive connectives like and or punctuation. With respect to semantic parallelism, we find that contrastive connectives are less likely to occur with pairs that are in traditional paradigmatic relations (‘NYM relations’: antonymy, co-hyponymy, synonymy). The paper’s main hypothesis – that nonparadigmatic relations need more contextual sustenance for their opposition – was therefore supported. Indeed, pairs in NYM relations were found to be {{more than twice as likely}} to be joined by a non-contrastive connective as by a contrastive one...|$|R

25|$|From {{the time}} of the reign of the Antonine emperors, Roman art {{increasingly}} depicted battles as chaotic, packed, single-plane scenes presenting dehumanized barbarians mercilessly subjugated by Roman military might, at a time when in fact the Roman Empire was undergoing constant invasions from external threats that led to the fall of the empire in the West. Although armed, the barbarian warriors, usually identified as Goths, are depicted as helpless to defend themselves. Various aspects of the execution of the work <b>accentuate</b> the <b>contrast</b> between the Romans and the Goths. The Roman figures are all clean-shaven and wear armour and helmets, which distinguish them clearly from the Goths, who are unarmoured and wear distinctive clothing, beards, and hairstyles. The Romans are given a nobler appearance with idealised physical features which contrast with the Goths who are almost caricatures, with enlarged noses, pronounced cheekbones, and wild expressions on their faces. The alternation of light/dark <b>accentuates</b> the <b>contrast</b> between the two groups. Shadows and deep carving are mostly found in the faces and hair of the Goths whereas the smooth surface of the marble is reserved for the Romans, who are less deeply carved.|$|R

40|$|Highly {{scattering}} plasma-sprayed {{thermal barrier}} coatings (TBCs) present {{a challenge for}} optical diagnostic methods to monitor TBC delamination because scattering attenuates light transmitted through the TBC and usually degrades contrast between attached and delaminated regions of the TBC. This paper presents a new approach where reflectance-enhanced luminescence from a luminescent sublayer incorporated {{along the bottom of}} the TBC is used to identify regions of TBC delamination. Because of the higher survival rate of luminescence reflecting off the back surface of a delaminated TBC, the strong scattering exhibited by plasma-sprayed TBCs actually <b>accentuates</b> <b>contrast</b> between attached and delaminated regions by making it more likely that multiple reflections of luminescence off the back surface occur before exiting the top surface of the TBC. A freestanding coating containing sections designed to model an attached or delaminated TBC was prepared by depositing a luminescent Eu-doped or Er-doped yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) luminescent layer below a plasma-sprayed undoped YSZ layer and utilizing a NiCr backing layer to represent an attached substrate. For specimens with a Eu-doped YSZ luminescent sublayer, luminescence intensity maps showed excellent contrast between unbacked and NiCr-backed sections even at a plasma-sprayed overlayer thickness of 300 m. Discernable contrast between unbacked and NiCr-backed sections was not observed for specimens with a Er-doped YSZ luminescent sublayer because luminescence from Er impurities in the undoped YSZ layer overwhelmed luminescence originating form the Er-doped YSZ sublayer...|$|R

30|$|For MRI, the {{contrast}} agents gadoxetate disodium (Primovist, Eovist; Bayer Healthcare, Leverkusen, Germany) and gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance; Bracco Diagnostic, Milan, Italy) can help improve liver segmentation. Both are gadolinium-based contrast agents that provide hepatobiliary phases during MRI occurring 20 [*]minutes and 2 [*]hours after contrast injection [54]. Imaging in the hepatobiliary phase reveals strong uptake {{in the normal}} liver, which may <b>accentuate</b> the <b>contrast</b> with non-hepatic tissue (e.g. vessels or focal liver lesions) and adjacent organs. The hepatobiliary uptake is roughly 50 % of the injected dose of gadoxetate disodium and 5 % of the injected dose﻿ of gadobenate dimeglumine [55]. The hepatospecificity of gadoxetate disodium increases {{the contrast}} between liver parenchyma and liver lesions or vascular structures compared to conventional contrast agents and other imaging modalities [54, 56, 57].|$|R

5000|$|The {{subject of}} the {{painting}} is a woman sitting in a green and yellow striped armchair. Her figure and the chair take {{up the majority of}} the canvas. She is nude except for sheer, gold-trimmed harem pants that covers her legs and touches the floor. The woman is heavily sexualized by her suggestive pose and how Matisse portrays the curvature of her body. Her breasts are round and idealized. However, the whole body of the sitter is not idealized because she has hair under her arms, which was considered scandalous by contemporary critics. [...] The brushwork in the painting is loose and shows the gestural movements of the artist. The painting has very little spatial depth, forcing the viewer to confront the woman in the foreground. The architectural and decorative elements further focus the viewer on the seated female. The shadows and curvature of her body is <b>accentuated</b> in <b>contrast</b> with the flat rendering of patterns in the planes behind her. The red decorative element, possibly a tapestry or a painting, hanging on the wall and the striped armchair that she is sitting in offer movement to the viewer’s eye. As the viewers gaze is taken around the painting by the geometric shapes to the pattern, and after their gaze glazes over the flat olive wall and muted orange floor the viewer will come to rest upon the reclined female. The air of comfortability that the woman exudes ensures that even as the viewer’s gaze is taken around the painting, it will always land on the female.|$|R
40|$|AbstractGastric {{intestinal}} metaplasia (IM) {{is associated}} with a risk for development of differentiated-type gastric cancers. The diagnosis of IM is currently based on the histology of biopsy specimens because IM usually appears in flat mucosa and has few morphologic changes, and identification of IM by conventional endoscopy has high interobserver variability and a poor correlation with histological findings. Autofluorescence imaging (AFI) produces real-time images from natural tissue fluorescence from endogenous fluorophores with light excitation. Narrow band imaging (NBI) uses two specific narrow banded lights (400 – 430 nm and 525 – 555 nm) to <b>accentuate</b> the <b>contrast</b> in surface structure and microvascular architecture of the superficial mucosa. With magnification, NBI enables a detailed observation of the morphological features of the epithelium corresponding to histology. Currently, AFI and NBI are incorporated with high-resolution white-light video endoscopy in one system (tri-modal imaging). To diagnose gastric IM, selection of Helicobacter pylori positive patients is important because it increases pretest probability. For an endoscopic procedure, areas with H. pylori associated mucosal atrophy or IM are identified as areas that increase visibility of mucosal vessels and lose gastric folds in the white-light image; greenish mucosa in the gastric corpus in AFI imagery; and whitish patchy areas in NBI imagery. When the magnifying NBI is applied in the areas, IM can be diagnosed as mucosa with ridged, papillary or villiform surface structure in the corpus or mucosa, with whitish papillary or villiform surface structure in the antrum, with the light blue crest sign (white-bluish lines of light on the epithelial crests).

40|$|The {{thesis is}} an {{evaluation}} of preferred tone reproduction {{as a function of}} reproduction size. When photographs are reproduced photomechanically using the halftone process the main limitation in achieving a facsimile reproduction is the density range of the printing process. Because the printing processes normally used cannot achieve the same high density range as a photograph, tonal compression must occur. The manner in which the tonal compression is achieved has an important effect upon the appearance of the reproduction. The tone reproduction curve is a graphic method used to describe the relationship between the density of the original and the density of the reproduction. A variety of tone reproduction curves can be used to describe a variety of prints whose tone reproduction has been varied. Experimental work was conducted to determine if pre ferred tone reproduction is different for reproductions of varying size. Low key, normal key, and high key original photographs were reproduced using the halftone process with five variations of tone reproduction at a small, medium and large size. A group of twenty-one viewers was used to evaluate the reproductions. The results of the tone reproduction evaluation suggest that preferred tone reproduction varies relative to size primarily with low key scenes. To a lesser extent preferred tone reproduction varies relative to size with normal key scenes. There appears to be no difference in preferred tone reproduction relative to size with high key scenes. The results seem to indicate that with low key originals, viewers prefer small size (32 ̆ 2 x 2 5 / 162 ̆ 2) repro ductions with 2 ̆ 2 open 2 ̆ 2 or lower density midtones and shadows. At the middle size (8 1 / 22 ̆ 2 x 6 5 / 82 ̆ 2), viewers prefer darker midtones and shadows, sacrificing some detail. At the largest size, viewers rated the reproduction with 2 ̆ 2 open 2 ̆ 2 shadows very poor while rating a reproduction with darker midtones and shadows as best. The reproduction with the darkest shadows, losing all detail, was rated the poorest. The only difference in preferred reproduction relative to size in normal key subjects was that at the smallest size the preferred reproduction was a curve that <b>accentuates</b> the <b>contrast</b> in the midtones. At the medium and large sizes the preferred curve was the curve that corresponds most closely to equal visual differences in brightness throughout the range of tones. This is similar to results obtained by Yule in previous studies. The preferred reproductions chosen when using a high key subject were very consistent from small to medium to large. The preferred reproductions for this subject were different than that for low and normal key scenes...|$|R
40|$|The Xinguara {{region is}} {{situated}} in the northern sector of the Rio Maria Granite-Greenstone Terrain (RMGGT), southeastern Amazonian craton. The RMGGT is composed by greenstone belts and diversified granitoid plutons. Granitoids and gneisses, formeriy included indistinctly in the Xingu Complex, have been individualized in two new stratigraphic units: The Caracol tonalitic complex (CTc), which shows enclaves of the greenstone belts and the Água Fria trondhjemite (THaf). The Iatter is intrusive in the Sapucaia greenstone belt and in the CTc, and coeval with the Xinguara granite (Gxg). Some granodioritic bodies exposed in the Xinguara region are correlated with the Rio Maria granodiorite (GDrm). They are younger than the CTc and older than the THaf and Gxg. The dominant regional structures follow a WNW-ESE trend, observed in the south portion of the CTc {{and also in the}} comparatively younger granitoid plutons. The CTc preserves a N-S banding in its NW sector, but this structure is transposed to the WNW-ESE regional trend. The GDrm shows strongly flattened mafic enclaves, which defines a foliation; The THaf displays a magmatic banding; The Gxg pluton has an elongated shape; ali these structures follow the regional trend. The Gxg displays a weak foliation, subhorizontal at the center and dipping at high angles along the borders of the intrusion. The G 1 axis of the regional stress during the intrusion of the granitoids was horizontal and trending N 40 E. The regional stress remained active during the submagmatic stage of the CTc evolution, as indicated by the presence of folds or boudins affecting its banding. It was responsible by the transposition to WNW-ESE of N-S structures. The stress field orientation was similar during the two phases of the Archean evolution of the region. This is suggested by the main submagmatic to subsolidus deformation structures in the GDrm, THaf, and Gxg. The changing trends of the CTc foliation suggest that the CTc was formed by domic plutons, intruded and sectionated by the younger granitic intrusions. Al-in amphibole geobarometer data suggest that the GDrm crystallized under a lithostatic pressure of — 3 kbar, equivalent to a — 10 km depth. The contact metamorphic effects of the Rio Maria granodiorite in the metabasaltic rocks of the Identidade greenstone belt are coherent with this data and suggest also that its emplacement was not diapiric-controlled. The variation in the intensity and orientation of the foliation in the Xinguara pluton and the deformation imprinted on its country rocks suggest its emplacement by bailooning. The emplacement of the THaf was probably controlled by diapiric processes. The CTc is a typical TTG, {{similar to those of the}} Archean trondhjemite series. Two different geochemical signatures have been identified in this granitoid on the basis of <b>accentuated</b> <b>contrasts</b> in LaN/YbN ratios. The GDrm is different of the TTG series. It follows the calc-alkaline trend and is similar to the Mg-rich granodiorites of the Sanukite Series. The THaf is geochemically similar to the CTc and by extension to the Archean TTG, but it is comparatively enriched in K 2 O. The Gxg is a high-K 2 O, strongly fractionated, calc-alkaline Archean leucogranite. Its REE pattern is indicative of a crustal origin. The dominant, high LaN/YbN ratio CTc group crystallized from a liquid probably originated from the partial melting of garnet amphibolites derived from 'normal' tholeiites. The latter should be similar in composition to the Archean metabasalts or to the metabasalts from the Identidade greenstone belt and the degree of partial fusion required would be, respectively, 25 - 30 % and 10 - 15. On the other hand, the tonalites with Iow LaN/YbN ratios crystallized from a liquid derived from a garnet-free similar source. Nd isotopic data indicate a mantle source and a juvenile character for the tonalites of the first group. A tonalite sample of the second group and an enclave in the Gxg yielded negative ONd values and > 3. 2 Ga TDM ages. These data suggest that the tonalites of this group could derive from an older source with a longer crustal residence time. The THaf may have been generated by 5 - 10 % partial melting of garnet amphibolites derived from metabasalts, chemically similar to the metabasalts from Identidade. The liquids of the Gxg were originated by variable degrees of partial melting of a source similar to the oldest TTG granitoids. The Archean geologic evolution of the Xinguara region occurs in two stages. The first starts in the interval of 3, 2 Ga, sugerindo participação de uma fonte mais antiga e com maior tempo de residência crustal. O THaf pode ter sido gerado a partir de 5 a 10 % de fusão de metabasaltos de composição química similar aos de Identidade, transformados em granada-anfibolito. Os líquidos do Gxg tiveram origem a partir de diferentes graus de fusão de fonte de composição similar aos granitóides TTG mais antigos. A evolução geológica arqueana de Xinguara ocorreu em duas fases. A primeira deu-se no período de < 2, 95 a 2, 91 Ga e revela analogias com a evolução dos crátons Pilbara (Autrália) e Dharwar (Índia). A segunda fase ocorreu a partir de 2, 88 Ga, quando há fortes evidências de mudanças no comportamento da crosta. Neste estágio se daria o espessamento e estabilização da mesma, o que a tornaria mais rígida. A partir daí os processos de convergência e subducção de placas foram mais efetivos. Neste contexto, a fusão do manto enriquecido geraria o magma parental do GDrm. A fusão de granada-anfibolito da crosta oceânica subductante geraria o magma do THaf. A ascensão dos magmas do THaf e do GDrm forneceria calor para a fusão dos granitóides TTG da base da crosta e geração dos magmas graníticos do pluton Xinguara...|$|R
40|$|Not all boninites are glassy lavas. Those of Hole 458 in the Mariana {{fore-arc}} {{region are}} submarine pillow lavas and more massive flows in which glass occurs only in quenched margins. Pillow and flow interiors have abundant Plagioclase spherulites, microlites, or even larger crystals {{but can be}} recognized as boninites by (1) occurrence of bronzite, (2) presence of augite-bronzite microphenocryst intergrowths, and (3) reversal of the usual basaltic groundmass crystallization sequence of plagioclase-augite to augite-plagioclase. The latter is <b>accentuated</b> by sharply <b>contrasting</b> augite and Plagioclase crystal morphologies near pillow margins, a consequence of rapid cooling rates. This crystallization sequence {{appears to be a}} consequence of boninites having higher SiO 2 and Mg/Mg + Fe than basalts but lower CaO/Al 2 O 3. Microprobe data are used to illustrate the effects of rapid cooling on the compositions of pyroxene and microphenocrysts in a glassy boninite sample and to estimate temperatures of crystallization of coexisting bronzite and augite. A range from 1320 °C to 1200 °C is calculated with an average of 1250 °C. This is higher by 120 °- 230 ° than the known range for western Pacific arc tholeiites and by over 300 ° than for calc-alkalic andesites. Boninites of Hole 458 lack olivine and clinoenstatite but are otherwise chemically and petrographically similar to boninites that have these minerals. In order to distinguish the two types, the Hole 458 lavas are here termed boninites and the others are termed olivine boninites. Arc tholeiite pillow lavas from Holes 458 and 459 B are briefly described and their textures compared to fractionated, moderately iron-enriched, abyssal tholeiites. Massive tholeiite flows contain striking quartz-alkali feldspar micrographic intergrowths with coarsely spherulitic textures resulting from in situ magmatic differentiation. Such intergrowths are rare in massive abyssal tholeiites cored by DSDP and probably occur here because arc tholeiites have higher normative quartz at comparable degrees of iron enrichment - a result of higher oxygen fugacities and earlier separation of titanomagnetite - than abyssal tholeiites...|$|R
40|$|In {{all major}} trading regions there are {{geographic}} concentrations of ports, and their prosperity {{is closely related}} to the economic well-being of their hinterlands and of the overseas regions to which they are linked via shipping services. The UK is well suited to studies of regional shifts in port activity. This paper outlines the trends in port traffic at selected UK ports over the last four decades or so. Traditional trade routes have largely been replaced by both near-sea and short-sea business in response to European Union (EU) expansion and fresh, rapidly growing links with low-cost Far East trading partners. Changes in port traffic are set in a regional context {{and the quality of the}} local transport infrastructure, important for distribution, is also evaluated. This paper therefore examines port performance as expressed by annual change in cargo tonnage handled in relation to port location, hinterland and foreland connectivity, and other variables. The concentration of economic activity and port capacity in the southeastern region of the UK is reflected in port traffic statistics. Important influencing factors are EU expansion, increasing use of unit loads and a move towards Far East sourcing. The main beneficiaries have been the deep-sea container ports, mostly in the southeast, a number of Ro-Ro ports, certain multi-purpose ports such as Immingham, and specialist facilities such as the liquid bulk terminals at Milford Haven. The main trends have been a concentration of business into certain favoured regions. Broadly, the expansion of the EU and the move towards Far East sourcing via ever larger ships have <b>accentuated</b> the regional <b>contrast</b> in container traffic growth between the northwest and the southeast. For other cargoes, the regional pattern is more complex and less well defined. Port traffic in the south and east has generally shown steady growth; the major exception is the dry bulk sector where volumes have, in recent years, reduced in the southern ports but risen through northern ports. Overall, port location and inland connectivity are found to be powerful determinants of port performance over the timescale examined.

40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] PU vir CHO, 1959. This study furnishes {{some results}} of an {{investigation}} to ascertain whether {{the possibility of a}} Christian logic can be maintained as a meaningful question. This problem seems to be enmeshed in a complex encompassing the problem of Christian science* as such. Whether the possibility of a Christian logic is maintained or denied, at any rate this implies a positive standpoint towards the problem of a Christian logic. Some general remarks having been made in an introductory chapter, the main aspects bearing on the background of different points of view towards logic are presented in Chapter II. The general philosophical conception adopted seems to be of importance with a view to the formation of a conception of logic in at least and especially two respects. Philosophical trends have a marked influence on the view taken of logic. As far as modern philosophy is concerned, one can point to the differences appertaining to logic, its character, and the domain accorded to logic as science, its place in the cosmic reality, etc., differences which become evident in the conceptions of, for example, Descartes, Arnauld & Nicole, Kant, Opzoomer, Heymans, Bolland, Dewey, Bergson and Heidegger. Whereas Dewey, Bergson and Heidegger move in an irrationalistic direction, the first mentioned six philosophers bear evidence of a rationalistic point of view. The idealistic conception of Kant differs from the scientialism of a Descartes and the practicalism of the writers of The Port Ro*al Logic; the difference {{can be traced to the}} fact that Kant lends. the divergent solutions furnished by scientialism and practicalism to a unity, which ascribes to the ~ human perceptive faculty two functions, a theoretical and practical; theoretical reason and practical reason are autonomous, each in its particular sphere. The more recent rationalism of an Opzoomer, Heymans and Bolland, keeps to the rationalistic main lines but takes the a priori's of autonomous reason in a dynamic-active sense by laying stress on the scientific methods. Positivism advanced the first solution in this direction, overestimating scientific theory in a scientialistic spirit, with the result that the practical existence is viewed in the light of science. The positivism of a Comte and Opzoomer finds an antipode in the neo-positivism of, for instance, Dilthey, Wundt and Heymans, laying stress on the practical aspect. And then the neoidealism of Cassirer, Bosanquet, Bolland and others bridges the opposition between the positivistic and nee-positivistic conceptions. The far-reaching influence of rationalistic conceptions encountered a serious set-back on account of the increasing importance attached to the se-called critique of science and especially the rise of irrationalistic conceptions. Irrationalism accepts reason in a rationalistic sense, but limits its validity and importance to a specific sphere. The pragQatism of James and Dewey, for instance, supports science only in so far as it furthers practical purposes: one has to obey reason in order to experiment, but the important point is exactly the fact that one is busy experimenting on account of a need bearing on practical life. A second trend, the "philosophy of life" which had an eminent exponent in Bergson, emphasizes the importance of "life" (taken in an organicpsychovitalistic sense) instead of practical utility, and therefore <b>accentuates</b> intuition in <b>contrast</b> to the symbolic operational method of intelligence (which "belong to the domain of logic). And finally existentialistically-minded philosophers champion the cause of human existence, of the individual concrete situation. It is pointed out that these differences in philosophical conception result in different points of view taken of logic. Secondly the specific type of philosophical point of view is an ontological factor of supreme importance in the realisation of a conception of logic. Kant and Hegel, for instance, both advance an idealistic conception, but differ as to the type of philosophical point of view; for Hegel attaches himself to a contradictory type whereas Kant propounds an "ennoetic" conception which regards the sensations as furnishing the material for the forms of the intellect, that is to say, the intellect has the sensations as contents of the mind. Moreover I may refer to the interaction-theory of a Descartes and the instrumentistic point of view of a Bergson or the psychomonistic type represented by a Heymans, etc. Each particular type of philosophical conception involves a specific cosmology and anthropology, and results in a particular conception of logic and the problems of this branch of science. In addition to the above mentioned ontological matters, it is necessary to point separately to the importance of epistemological factors for one's conception of logic. This point is illustrated by enumerating some basic problems of a theory of knowledge and explaining a few points in greater detail, for instance, the possibility and suppositions of knowledge; the analysis of knowledge (including the essence, character and kinds of knowledge), the formation of knowledge, the purpose of knowledge and the unity of knowledge (including limits and scope of knowledge, the partial nature and coherence of knowledge); and the validity of knowledge (including knowledge and law, knowledge and value, as well as the reliability of knowledge). In yet another respect different points of view may arise, viz. according to the opinion held as to logic as science, its character and domain, and the investigation of the logical field. There is, for instance, a trend in logic which attempts to approach the field of logic from that of mathematics, and on the other hand some logicians undertake the task of studying the basic principles of mathematics with logic as the starting-point. Moreover, also the points of view of psychologism in logic (Sigwart) and Husserl’s reaction against this trend, tend to show that the scientific determination of the field of investigation bears testimony to the fact that the logician cannot afford to neglect matters which can be traced to different attitudes in theory of science, and different points of view in regard to the field of investigation. Lastly the suggestion may be offered that one-sided stressing of one or more of the different factors of importance (mentioned above) as such, may also result in different conceptions of logic. * * * Up to this point no attention has been paid to the possibility of the Christian conviction, the Christian "life and world-view", etc., as an important factor in the formation of a conception of logic. Chapter III gives a general survey of the points of view taken on logic in a Christian atmosphere. A Christian logic is an utter impossibility; this is the first standpoint taken as to this problem. This, point of view comprises, however, various subordinate solutions of the problem. Some argue that as far as the importance and implications of Christianity are concerned, Christianity is confined to divine worship and this does not bear on logic in any way whatsoever. Others acknowledge the importance of Christianity for divine worship, and add: for daily practical life too [...] - although in no wise for science and therefore not for logic. A third solution accepts the significance of Christianity for a section of science, for instance as far as theology is concerned, and also for philosophy, and perhaps in some respects for other branches of science (e. g. sociology, ethnology, the science of history, etc.) but at any rate not as far as logic is concerned. On the other hand some scientists, inspired by the reformational concept of Calvin, maintain that Christianity, that the Christian view of cosmos and man, the Christian approach to scientific matters, etc., must be esteemed a factor of importance so far as the conception of science as such is concerned, and that moreover it is imperative that all scientific investigations be undertaken in the light of the revelation (in Holy Scripture); for this reason among others the idea of a Christian logic is not absurd. This thesis can be elucidated by mentioning some contributions to a Christian logic, for instance, A. Kuyper's opinion that science is of two kinds because humanity is of two kinds, those regarding the cosmos as normal and those who take into account the reality of the fall of man in Adam, and therefore acknowledge the fact that an act of interference on the part of God is necessary to put the cosmos again in a correct relation to Him. On account of this difference Kuyper therefore maintains the existence of a Christian and non Christian science. As the fact of sin dit not affect the formal activity of thinking, according to Kuyper, he states that the palingenesis does not cause any difference in this respect; therefore only one kind of logic exists [...] - a Christian logic. S. O. Los indicates the necessity of a Christian logic by stating that the Calvinistic principles ought to find application in every section of science, not excluding logic. A Christian logic takes into account the principles of Holy Scripture and brings them to bear upon scientific studies. H. G. Stoker's conception of the cosmos as a created coherent diversity implies i n t era 1 i a that the field of logic has an irreducible, unique character of its own, but the logical sphere is part of a comprehensive totality in which all diversity is given in a coherent complex. Because it is a radical diversity, it is unlike the psychical, lingual or ethical sphere, and therefore the logical sphere may not be reduced to any other diversity nor isolated from the diversity with which it constitutes a totality. On account of the fact that cosmic reality is a created diversity, it is not autonomous nor self-sufficient; a Christian logic therefore naturally opposes the dogma of the autonomy of thought. C. Van Til points out that whereas the facts|$|R
