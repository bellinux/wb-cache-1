And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E

25|$|I {{wanted to}} do {{something}} refreshing and different, so I mixed genres and drew inspiration from touring, traveling, watching rock bands, and attending festivals… I was like a mad scientist, putting lots of different songs together. Boyz II Men were the first ones to put Destiny's Child on tour. They showed us how to treat an opening act <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> forget that. That was 15 years ago! Wow, 15 years! I'm old.|$|E

500|$|The author {{explained}} to Los Angeles Magazine her reasoning for {{including in the}} book a graphic phrase used by Jack Nicholson after his lovemaking session with her: [...] "The reason that line made the book is because he {{told me not to}} say anything. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never,</b> ever respond to anybody—man, woman, vegetable, or mineral—who tells me to keep my mouth shut. Alter what I've been through, I don't think so, pal." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1970–71 season, the Royals {{stunned the}} {{basketball}} world by trading Robertson to the Bucks for Flynn Robinson and Charlie Paulk. No reasons were officially given, but many pundits suspected head coach Bob Cousy {{was jealous of}} all the attention Robertson was getting. Robertson himself said: [...] "I think he was wrong <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> forget it." [...] The relationship between Oscar and the Royals had soured {{to the point that}} Cincinnati had also approached the Lakers and Knicks about deals involving their star player (the Knicks players who were discussed in those scenarios are unknown, but Los Angeles stated publicly that the Royals asked about Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain, with the Lakers saying they would not consider trading either star).|$|E
500|$|Blunt {{appeared}} on {{an episode of}} Sesame Street which aired on 14 November 2007, singing about triangles {{to the tune of}} [...] "You're Beautiful". A parody of [...] "You're Beautiful" [...] titled [...] "You're Pitiful" [...] was recorded by Weird Al Yankovic. He gave personal permission for this parody to be included on a Weird Al album, but Atlantic Records, his label, stepped in to forbid the commercial release of the song. Weird Al has since made the song available as a free MP3 download on his website. In a request by Yankovic to include the song on an upcoming compilation CD, Blunt's manager replied via email, [...] "Thanks for your email, but both James <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> approve this parody to be released on any label." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2008 interview, Corey Taylor {{said that}} he only met Rubin four times during the entire {{recording}} process of Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses and that Rubin barely ever showed up to the studio: [...] "...we were being charged horrendous amounts of money. And for me, if you're going to produce something, you're fucking there. I don't care who you are." [...] He also added: [...] "He is overrated, he is overpaid, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> work with him again." [...] Conversely, Slipknot's guitarist Jim Root had said in that same interview that [...] "A lot of {{the guys in the}} band say Rick was unavailable. And yeah, he takes on a lot of projects at one time, but he also does things that are beneficial. He would listen to what we'd done, then have us retrack things that needed work. He's kind of like Big Brother up on the hill. Even though he wasn't there physically every day, he was. That's my favorite record we've done." ...|$|E

He lifted the ball right over the defence and Romario touched it in first time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2014 the {{trustees}} sold {{the house and}} 800 acres for £11.25m to an undisclosed buyer (believed to be Conservative Party donor and multi-millionaire property developer Jamie Ritblat) after overcoming a legal challenge from the Earl of Cardigan. In November 2014 the Earl {{was reported in the}} Daily Telegraph newspaper to be living with his second wife and baby daughter in an unheated lodge in the grounds of Tottenham House on a £71-a-week jobseeker’s allowance while training to be a lorry driver. He is still theoretically the hereditary Warden of Savernake Forest and has stated he was: [...] "put on this earth to take care of Savernake <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> let it go". He is due to benefit from the sale proceeds and will still own jointly with {{the trustees}} 3,700 acres, mainly woodland, in Savernake Forest.|$|E

2500|$|Peled did {{approach}} his old comrade in arms Yitzhak Rabin, then on {{his first}} term as Prime Minister of Israel (1974–77). He offered to brief Rabin on his talks with the Palestinians, and Rabin consented. On several occasions, indeed, Sartawi and other Palestinian interlocutors used this channel to pass on specific messages intended for Rabin's ears. The PM patiently heard him out, but never consented {{to send a message}} in return. [...] "That would be negotiating with the PLO, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> never do that" [...] he told Peled—ironic words in retrospect, as Rabin was later to conduct intensive talks with the PLO and sign the Oslo Agreement with Arafat. Peled always believed that Oslo was at least in part a late flowering of the seeds he and his friends had sown in the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Audio {{tapes of}} President Richard Nixon, in {{conversation}} with his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman in 1972, reveal that Nixon mused [...] "I'm wondering if that was fixed" [...] after seeing the photograph. After the release of this tape, Út commented, [...] "Even though it {{has become one of}} the most memorable images of the twentieth century, President Nixon once doubted the authenticity of my photograph when he saw it in the papers on 12 June 1972.... The picture for me and unquestionably for many others could not have been more real. The photo was as authentic as the Vietnam War itself. The horror of the Vietnam War recorded by me did not have to be fixed. That terrified little girl is still alive today and has become an eloquent testimony to the authenticity of that photo. That moment thirty years ago will be one Kim Phúc <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> forget. It has ultimately changed both our lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2009, it was {{revealed}} that the singer was parting ways with Columbia Records. Speaking of her decision to leave, Rowland said, [...] "as a solo artist, I felt the need to explore new directions, new challenges, and new freedoms outside my comfort zone and my friends and family at Columbia have been incredibly understanding about my evolution. I want to thank everyone at Columbia for the love and support they've shown <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> forget how many good times we've had over the years." [...] It was also announced in March that Guetta was releasing [...] "When Love Takes Over", his collaboration with Rowland. The song went on to be a worldwide success for the duo. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said [...] "the success comes at an intriguing time in Rowland's career", having noted that she had landed a hosting job on Bravo's The Fashion Show and was in between labels.|$|E

2500|$|After the election, aide Seymore Trammell {{recalled}} Wallace saying, [...] "Seymore, {{you know}} why I lost that governor's race? ... I was outniggered by John Patterson. And I'll tell you here <b>and</b> now, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> be outniggered again." ...|$|R
5000|$|After this defeat, Wallace {{determined}} {{that in order}} to be elected governor he would have to change his position on racial issues, and told one of his campaign officials [...] "I was out-niggered by John Patterson.

2500|$|Now I {{will never}} forget this incident... We were at al-Malikiyya, the other {{frontier}} base and word came through about 6 {{o'clock in the morning}} that one of our patrols had been blown up and Millie Law [...] had been killed. Now Gerald Whitfeld [...] had told these mukhtars that if any of this sort of thing happened he would take punitive measures against the nearest village {{to the scene of the}} mine. Well the nearest village to the scene of the mine was a place called al-Bassa and our Company C were ordered to take part in punitive measures. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> forget arriving at al-Bassa and seeing the Rolls Royce armoured cars of the 11th Hussars peppering Bassa with machine gun fire and this went on for about 20minutes and then we went in and I remembered we had lighted braziers and we set the houses on fire and we burnt the village to the ground... Monty had him [...] up and he asked him all about it and Gerald Whitfeld explained to him. He said [...] "Sir, I have warned the mukhtars in these villages that if this happened to any of my officers or men, I would take punitive measures against them and I did this and I would've lost control of the frontier if I hadn't." [...] Monty said [...] "All right but just go a wee bit easier in the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romero preached that [...] "The most {{profound}} social revolution is the serious, supernatural, interior reform of a Christian." [...] He also emphasized: [...] "The liberation of Christ and of His Church is not {{reduced to the}} dimension of a purely temporal project. It does not reduce its objectives to an anthropocentric perspective: to a material well-being or only to initiatives of a political or social, economic or cultural order. Much less can it be a liberation that supports or is supported by violence." [...] Romero expressed several times his disapproval for divisiveness in the Church. In a sermon preached on 11 November 1979 he said: [...] "The other day, one of the persons who proclaims liberation in a political sense was asked: ‘For you, {{what is the meaning}} of the Church’?" [...] He said that the activist [...] "answered with these scandalous words: ‘There are two churches, the church of the rich and the church of the poor. We believe in the church of the poor but not in the church of the rich.’" [...] Romero declared, [...] "Clearly these words are a form of demagogy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> admit a division of the Church." [...] He added, [...] "There is only one Church, the Church that Christ preached, the Church to which we should give our whole hearts. ...There is only one Church, a Church that adores the living God and knows how to give relative value to the goods of this earth." ...|$|E
