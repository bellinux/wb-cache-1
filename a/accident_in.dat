5|$|In July 2009, {{more than}} 40 {{people were killed}} in a fire <b>accident</b> <b>in</b> a firecracker unit. The police traced out {{unregistered}} units and irregularities that led to the <b>accident.</b> <b>In</b> a fire <b>accident</b> <b>in</b> August 2011, seven people were killed and five were seriously injured. A similar fire accident and blast in a private unit in September 2012 killed 40 people and injured 38 others. The common reasons cited for the accidents are inadequate training of workers and supervisors involved in different stages of production and marketing of firecracker items. Other reasons are found to be overstocking of explosives, raw material and finished goods, and employment of workers in excess of the permitted strength.|$|E

One of the root causes of <b>accidents</b> <b>in</b> RMAA works is low safety awareness of RMAA workers; however, wider organizational and industrial factors are not negligible.
