A preparation of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds</b> and a process of testing of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds</b> were in accordance with the standard CSN EN 1465.

40|$|In this work, {{ultrasonic}} {{techniques to}} nondestructively evaluate <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> degradation have been studied. The {{key to the}} present approach is the introduction of an external factor which pulls the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> in the nonlinear range, simultaneously with the application of an ultrasonic technique. With the aid of an external static tensile loading, a superimposed longitudinal wave has. been used to obtain {{the slopes of the}} stress-strain curve of an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> at a series of load levels. The critical load, at which a reduction of the slope is detected by the superimposed longitudinal wave, is an indication of the onset of nonlinear behavior of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond,</b> and therefore of bond degradation. This approach has been applied to the detection of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> degradation induced by cyclic fatigue loading. Analogously to the longitudinal wave case, a superimposed shear wave has been used to obtain the effective shear modulus of adhesive layers at different shear load levels. The onset of the nonlinear behavior of an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> under shear loading has been detected by the use of a superimposed shear wave. Experiments show that a longitudinal wave can also detect the nonlinear behavior when an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> is subjected to shear loading. An optimal combination of ultrasonic testing and mechanical loading methods for the detection of degradation related nonlinear behavior of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds</b> has been discussed. For the purpose of a practical application, an ultrasonic technique that uses a temperature increase as an alternative to static loading has also been investigated. A general strain-temperature correspondence principle that relates a mechanical strain to a temperature has been presented. Explicit strain-temperature correspondence relations for both the tension and shear cases have been derived. An important parameter which quantifies the relation between the wave velocity and temperature has been defined. This parameter, which is indicative of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> nonlinearity and which can be conveniently obtained by an ultrasonic measurement, has been used as an indication of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> degradation. Experimental results have shown that the temperature increase method is a convenient and productive alternative to static loading. A technique which uses the reflected waveform data to obtain the fundamental ultrasonic parameters (transit time, reflection coefficient and attenuation coefficient) of an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> has also been presented...|$|R
