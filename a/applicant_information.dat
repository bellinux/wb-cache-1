The majority of job and resume boards (LinkedIn.com, Monster.com, Hotjobs, CareerBuilder, Indeed.com) have partnerships with ATS software providers to provide parsing support and ease of data migration from one system to another. Newer applicant tracking systems (often referred to as next generation) are platforms as a service whereby the main piece of software has integration points that allow providers of other recruiting technology to plug in seamlessly. The ability of these next generation ATS solutions allows jobs to be posted where the candidate is and not just on job boards. This ability is being referred to as Omnichannel Talent Acquisition.|$|E

The process and content of three interviewers' questioning of 149 candidates for an entry-level correctional officer position was examined.

Furthermore, the validity of individual interviewers' applicant evaluations varied considerably. These results reinforce the existence of differences in interviewers' questioning behavior and differences in the quality of <b>applicant</b> <b>information</b> they gather. Because differences in questioning behavior correspond to differences in the predictive validity of applicant ratings, both these variables should be monitored at the individual interviewer level...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines {{whether it is}} necessary to manually enter credit history inquiry information instead of using similar information in D 1 S data bases when processing credit report requests pertaining to DoD security clearance applicants. Although the precise applicant addresses are not currently contained in these data bases, the identities of the DIS field offices requested to gather information at those locations is available. The research used actual security clearance <b>applicant</b> <b>information</b> which was submitted to a national credit vendor in two formats. The first format used the applicant's full address information while the second substituted the full address with a general delivery address and the regional DIS office Zir code that would provide investigative coverage for the applicant's address. The results of the study showed that the credit reports obtained from TRW with the general delivery address and the regional DIS office ZIP code were of the same quality as those obtained in the current procedure. Therefore, it appears that manually entering the inquiry information may not serve a useful purpose. [URL] United States Arm...|$|E
40|$|A principled {{technique}} for monitoring {{the performance of}} a consumer credit scorecard through time is derived from Kalman filtering. Standard approaches sporadically compare certain characteristics of the new applicants with those predicted from the scorecard. The new approach systematically updates the scorecard combining new <b>applicant</b> <b>information</b> with the previous best estimate. The dynamically updated scorecard is tracked through time and compared to limits calculated by sequential simulation from the baseline scorecard. The observation equation of the Kalman filter is tailored to take the results of fitting local scorecards by logistic regression to batches of new clients that arrive in the current time interval. The states in the Kalman filter represent the true or underlying score for each attribute in the card: the parameters of the logistic regression. Their progress in time is modelled by a random walk and the filter provides the best estimate of the scores using past and present information. We illustrate the technique using a commercial mortgage portfolio and the results indicate significant emerging deficiencies in the baseline scorecard...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{studies the}} {{application}} of two group discriminant analysis {{in the field of}} credit scoring. The view here given provides a completely different approach to how this problem is usually targeted. Credit scoring is widely used among financial institutions and is performed in a number of ways, depending {{on a wide range of}} factors, which include available information, support data bases, and informatic resources. Since each financial institution has its own methods of measuring risk, the ways in which an applicant is evaluated for the concession of credit for a particular product are at least as many as credit concessioners. However, there exist certain standard procedures for different products. For example, in the credit card business, when databases containing <b>applicant</b> <b>information</b> are available, usually credit score cards are constructed. These score cards provide an aid to qualify the applicant and decide if he or she represents a high risk for the institution or, on the contrary, a good investment. Score cards are generally used in conjunction with other criteria, such as the institution's own policies. In building score cards, generally parametric regression based procedures are used, where the assumption of an underlying model generating the data has to be made. Another aspect is that, in general, score cards are built taking into consideration only the probability that a particular applicant will not default. In this thesis, the objective will be to present a method of calculating a risk score that, does not depend on the actual process generating the data and that takes into account the costs and profits related to accepting a particular applicant. The ultimate objective of the financial institution should be to maximise profit and this view is a fundamental part of the procedure presented here.

40|$|Cyber-vetting is a {{relatively}} new selection strategy employing technologies like social network sites to evaluate prospective workers. Increasing use of networked information communication technologies (ICTs) allows employers to extract <b>applicant</b> <b>information</b> to inform personnel decisions. Specifically, this research explores: (a) what sources and informational criteria employers use, (b) how access to this information shapes impressions, career capital evaluations, and human capital decisions, and (c) what or how participants perceive cyber-vetting. Drawing on interdisciplinary literature, five lenses—sensemaking, techno-materiality, legal, impression formation, and careers—frame this research. ^ Results of interviewing and surveying human resource professionals, hiring managers, recruiters, and job applicants suggest employers use ad-hoc seemingly idiosyncratic strategies, incorporating new information sources to evaluate applicants. These processes often occur outside current standards for personnel selection and employment protection. Decisions often rely on stereotypical and iconic information, are affected by information noise and the absence of information, and typically fail to account for alternative perspectives. In addition, different, shifting, and contentious meanings of cyber-vetting shaped by identity, privacy, and perceived generational assumptions create boundary turbulence impacting career capital interpretations and impressions. Furthermore, the incorporation of a new technological criterion, and the increased visibility, changing definitions, and uses of visual, textual and relational criteria alter career capital construction and evaluation. ^ Cyber-vetting informs personnel decisions and therefore affects individual careers, organizational effectiveness, social norms, and their associated material and nonmaterial outcomes (Ciulla, 2000; Deetz, 1993; Jablin, 2001). Addressing micro through macro practices, this research connects to work on privacy, work/non-work boundaries, corporate image, personal branding, and uses of technology-provided information. Theoretically, this project contributes to career theory, particularly communicative constructions of career capital within a global information society. It extends literature on information acquisition and use, specifically the effects of new ICTs in personnel selection and the transformative potential of socio-technical systems. Furthermore, this research identifies new forms of work. Pragmatically, it suggests the need to develop new standards for personnel selection, including an etiquette and ethics of cyber-vetting, a new media literacy, and associated communicative and socio-technical competencies. Moreover, this research informs broader social strategies to address implications of changing hiring practices. ...|$|E
