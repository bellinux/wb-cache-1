40|$|Namias has {{suggested}} cross-sections of potential temperature, {{which can be}} drawn very quickly. Since unsaturated air maintains a constant potential temperature during vertical motions, places in the cross-section where the potential temperature lines dip downward would probably represent subsidence (or a transition from a colder to a warmer air mass), and those where the potential temperature lines slope upw-ard would represent zones of rising air (or a transition from a warm to a colder air mass). To return {{to the question of}} time, it has been the experience in TWA 4 that to construct the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>chart</b> and the Rossby diagram requires about 10 minutes with the data received in the present Weather Bureau code.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that the minimum surface pressure for hurricane Daisy, observed at 1945 GMT, August 27, 1958, should be 948 mb. and not 935 mb. as reported in [l]. The reason for this error is as follows. The flight altitude pressure on board the aircraft from which the dropsonde determination of the surface pressure was made was given as 485 mb. The pressure altimeter altitude was given as 18, 400 ft. This is not possible. In the ICAO Standard Atmosphere, a pressure of 485 mb. corresponds to a pressure altimeter reading of 19, 020 it. This value as the corrected pressure altimeter altitude, the reported radar altitude of 18, 800 ft., and the temperature and moisture values transmitted by the dropsonde were used to rework the sounding on an <b>adiabatic</b> <b>chart.</b> Th...|$|E
40|$|Though {{the method}} of <b>adiabatic</b> <b>charts</b> {{has been applied to}} thermodynamical {{problems}} in meteorology for a long time, especially in aerology their use has been flourished remarkably during last twenty years, and in this period quick treatments of observational data of aerology and quick calculations of their heights were required, because many aerological observatories were established and at each place aerological observations were carried out several times a day. So far in meteorological circles a well known method by barometric formula has been used as procedures of height calculations for these data. (cf. 1 (i)). About twenty years ago, however, {{in order to reduce the}} complication inherent in these procedures, Stuve proposed a method to utilize <b>adiabatic</b> <b>charts</b> for this purpose, whose adoption has since prevailed quickly in the aerological circles. Moreover a few special <b>adiabatic</b> <b>charts</b> have appeared, suitable to the above requirement about the quick height calculation. At the same time some theories about height calculations on <b>adiabatic</b> <b>charts</b> and the mutual relations among these charts appeared also as below. We shall classify the recent development of these theories into the following four classes. (i) Stuve's theory to reduce the height problem of actual atmosphere on Emagram (T-logp) to that of isothermal atmosphere or dry adiabatic one. (ii) Theories of height calculation on Tephigram by Shaw, Brunt and Arakawa. (iii) Refsdal's theory of Aerogram. (iv) Yamaoka's theory for the transformation of <b>adiabatic</b> <b>charts</b> and his proposition of Taikisendzu (Atmospheric Chart). As shown in the above classification new <b>adiabatic</b> <b>charts</b> such as Aerogram and Taikisendzu have appeared recently, convenient to the height calculation on these diagrams. According to the author's opinion, contrary to the usual considerations about Tephigram, it belongs to the same family of <b>adiabatic</b> <b>charts</b> as Aerogram etc. as regards to the convenience of height calculation. Though the general theories for height calculation are described in the above classification (iii) and (iv), Yamaoka's (iv) is, however, considered to be superior to Refsdal's theory (iii). But there remains some questions to be discussed-their assumptions and mutual relations among these diagrams. In this paper we shall consider mainly these problems, and make good Yamaoka's theory, but in our paper the whole problem is treated quite differently from Yamaoka's. In 1 preliminary notes on fundamental equations and the theory for height calculation so far used are described as fundamentals for the further development of our theory. In 2 conditions to be satisfied for our aim are discussed, as the above coordinates lead to the partial differential equation of Monge-Ampere's type, its general solution being given in 3. In 4 the outline of Yamaoka's theory is described and its results are compared with ours. In 5 mutual relation among Aerogram, Taikisendzu and Tephigram is derived from our general formula and rough sketch of each case is also delivered...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedRadiosonde information is extensively {{used in the}} analysis and forecast of meteorological phenomena and the accuracy of both analyses and forecasts is dependent primarily upon {{the accuracy of the}} meteorological parameters determined from radiosonde flights. To evaluate the accuracy obtainable, 50 radiosonde flights were launched from the U. S. Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. Thirty-five flights carried aloft the AN/AMT- 4 B model transmitter alongside the prototype AN/AMT- 11 DX transmitter and 15 flights carried the AN/AMT- 11 C model along with the AN/AMT- 4 B. All data obtained were reduced by the Geophysics Division, Pacific Missile Range, Point Mugu, California, on a CDC- 3100 computer and graphically by the experimenter on the WBAN- 31 series <b>adiabatic</b> <b>charts.</b> Values of temperature, relative humidity, and pressure as determined by each instrument were compared at each 3 -minute interval of each flight and values of temperature, pressure altitude, relative humidity and dewpoint were compared at standard pressure levels. The results obtained afforded a realistic evaluation of the various sensing elements under field conditions and indicate an urgent requirement {{for the development of a}} more accurate water vapor sensing device and replacement of the radiosonde baroswitching circuit by a hypsometer for precise determination of pressure values.
