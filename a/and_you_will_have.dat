As soon as the draft is over, if you are good enough, you will be invited by five or six teams, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> a chance to choose who you will play summer league ball with.

Chooksa homar participated in the events and {{reported}} that Irataba told the warriors, [...] "I hear you fought, though I told you not to. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> war again: I know it. You used to fight the Maricopa. I want to go [...] to see the Maricopa and tell them: 'The Mohave will not come any more to attack you'." [...] Irataba, weary of the constant fighting and worried that further conflicts with neighboring tribes would draw more attention from the US soldiers, organized a peace expedition to the Maricopa, settling the ancient disputes between the two peoples.|$|E

500|$|The {{new republican}} {{government}} was headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman. The Prime Minister was Mohsin al-Aini. Noman, however, remained in Beirut. He was doubtful {{of his colleagues}} reluctance {{to negotiate with the}} Hamidaddin family, preferring to expel it instead. On November 23, he resigned, and his place was taken by Hassan Amri. Prince Mohamed bin Hussein told the country's chiefs [...] "We have money, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> your share if you join us. If not, we will go on without you". The chiefs agreed to mobilize their tribes. 6,000 royalist regulars and 50,000 armed tribesmen known as [...] "the Fighting Rifles" [...] surrounded San'a, captured its main airport and severed the highway to the port of Hodeida, a main route for Russian supplies. In a battle twelve miles east of the capital, 3,200 soldiers of both sides were killed, and an entire republican regiment reportedly deserted to the royalists. Bin Hussein gave them an ultimatum: [...] "Surrender the city or be annihilated". Iryani went to Cairo for what the Egyptian official press agency called [...] "a medical checkup". Foreign Minister Hassan Makki also left Yemen, leaving the government in charge of Amri. Amri declared a 6 p.m. curfew and ordered civilians to form militia units [...] "to defend the republic". In Liberation Square, six suspected royalist infiltrators were publicly executed by a firing squad, and their bodies were later strung up on poles.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} side, Anthony Kennedy felt that Prima Paint and {{subsequent}} decisions had [...] "certainly displaced {{the states and}} state law from this area [...] a very substantial extent". It {{was up to the}} Court to resolve confusion similar to that created in the instant case, he added. Antonin Scalia worried that ruling in Cardegna's favor would open the floodgates of litigation. [...] "All {{you have to do is}} open the door <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> litigation in court," [...] Ginsburg agreed, [...] "and then the court will decide what the arbitrator would otherwise decide." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{tendency}} to make vows to God was strong in ancient Israel; the Torah {{found it necessary}} to caution against the promiscuous making of vows: [...] "When you make a vow [...] to the LORD your God, do not put off fulfilling it, for the LORD your God will require it of you, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> incurred guilt; whereas you incur no guilt if you refrain from vowing. You must fulfill what has crossed your lips and perform what you have voluntarily vowed to the LORD your God, having made the promise with your own mouth."

2500|$|Anthony {{was born}} in Coma in Lower Egypt in 251 to wealthy {{landowner}} parents. When he was about 18 years old, his parents died and left him with the care of his unmarried sister. Shortly thereafter, he decided to follow the Evangelical counsel of Jesus which reads, [...] "If {{you want to be}} perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> treasures in heaven." [...] Anthony gave away some of his family's lands to his neighbors, sold the remaining property, and donated the funds thus raised to the poor. He then left to live an ascetic life, placing his sister with a group of Christian virgins, a sort of proto-convent.|$|E
2500|$|In {{connection}} with the rebus mentioned, a tale is told of one Allan of Stewarton who was rowing a Scottish chief off the Ayrshire coast.

Reid {{added in}} 2013, [...] "Imagine, if you will, {{a world in}} which the Beatles were known only for their early hits whilst The White Album or Abbey Road were of interest, or even known, only to the group’s biggest fans, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> some grasp of how the Beach Boys’ {{distorted}} public image has helped to bury their most important artistic works."

2500|$|It was {{however the}} American diplomat and travel writer Elihu Burritt {{who brought the}} term [...] "the Black Country" [...] into {{widespread}} common usage with the third, longest and most important of the travel books he wrote about Britain for American readers, his 1868 work Walks in The Black Country and its Green Borderland. Burritt had been appointed United States consul in Birmingham by Abraham Lincoln in 1864, a role that required him to report regularly on [...] "facts bearing upon the productive capacities, industrial character and natural resources of communities embraced in their Consulate Districts" [...] {{and as a result}} travelled widely from his home in Harborne, largely on foot, to explore the local area. Burritt's association with Birmingham dated back 20 years and he was highly sympathetic to the industrial and political culture of the town as well as being a friend many of its leading citizens, so his portrait of the surrounding area was largely positive. He was the author of the famous early description of the Black Country as [...] "black by day and red by night", adding appreciatively that it [...] "cannot be matched, for vast and varied production, by any other space of equal radius {{on the surface of the}} globe". Burritt used the term to refer to a wider area than its common modern usage, however, devoting the first third of the book to Birmingham, which he described as [...] "the capital, manufacturing centre, and growth of the Black Country", and writing [...] "plant, in imagination, one foot of your compass at the Town Hall in Birmingham, and with the other sweep a circle of twenty miles [...] radius, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have,</b> 'the Black Country". However he also described a 'Black Country proper' including Wolverhampton, Dudley, and several smaller towns.|$|E
