5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as,</b> or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E

5|$|Associate Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion, {{with whom}} Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg joined. Breyer {{disagreed}} with the majority's holding that fair-minded jurists could disagree on whether Alvarado was in custody, holding that the facts compelled the single conclusion that Alvarado was in custody. Breyer held that the actions the police did not do, such as arrest Alvarado or threaten him, were not <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> what the police did do. Specifically, the police had Alvarado's parents bring him to the police station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.|$|E

Britain in mid-2nd century contained the largest number of auxiliary regiments in any single province: about 60 out of about 400 (15%).

Rashtrakuta inscriptions use both Kannada and Sanskrit (historians Sheldon Pollock and Jan Houben claim they are mostly in Kannada), and the rulers encouraged literature in both languages. The earliest existing Kannada literary writings are credited to their court poets and royalty. Though these Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas, they were conversant in a northern Deccan language as well.|$|E

5|$|The 10-minute {{murder scene}} which forms the film's climax is scored with almost {{the whole of}} the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. This is an {{atypical}} scoring for a film, since Verdi's piece is not an aria, but a dramatic dialogue in which the words are <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> the music. Thus the astute spectator will be presented with two dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.|$|E

5|$|Although William's {{supporters}} now {{dominated the}} government and parliament, there remained significant pockets of Scottish support for James, a movement which became known as Jacobitism, from the Latin (Jacobus) for James.

It's hard to be definitive on the extent or make up since clan loyalties or feuds were often <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> religion or attachment to the Stuarts; this included generalised hostility between Lowlanders and Highlanders, specific feuds (Campbells and McDonald's) or differences within branches of the same clan; Gordons and Fletchers fought on both sides in 1715 and 1745. In addition, the Stuart monarchy only ended {{with the death of}} Queen Anne in 1714, so until then, supporting the Stuarts was not necessarily the same as being a Jacobite.|$|E
