60|$|I {{have been}} not {{writing to you}} at a tremendous, an infamous rate, {{for a long time}} past; but I should indeed be sunk in baseness if I were to keep this pace after what has just {{happened}}. For what has just happened is that I have been reading the Hazard of New Fortunes (I confess I should have liked to change the name for you,) and that it has filled me with communicable rapture. I remember that the last time I came to Italy (or almost,) I brought your Lemuel Barker, which had just come out, to read in the train, and let it divert an intense professional eye from the most clamourous beauties of the way--writing to you afternoons from this very place, I think, all the good and all the wonder I thought of it. So I have a decent precedent for insisting to you, now, under circumstances exactly similar (save that the present book is a much bigger feat,) that, to my charmed and gratified sense, the Hazard is simply prodigious.... I should think it would make you as happy as poor happiness will let us be, to turn off from one year to the other, and from a reservoir in daily domestic use, such a free, full, rich flood. In fact your reservoir deluges me, altogether, with surprise as well as other sorts of effusion; by which I mean that though you do much to empty it you keep it remarkably full. I seem to myself, in comparison, to fill mine with a teaspoon and obtain but a trickle. However, I don't mean to compare myself with you or to compare you, in the particular case, with anything but life. When I do that--with the life you see and represent--your faculty for representing it seems to me extraordinary and to shave the truth--the general truth you aim at--several degrees closer than anyone else begins to do. You are less big than Zola, but you are ever so much less clumsy and more really various, and moreover you and he don't see the same things--you have a wholly different consciousness--you see a totally different side of a different race. Man isn't at all one after all--it takes so much of him to be American, to be French, &c. I won't even compare you with something I have a sort of dim stupid sense you might be and are not--for I don't in the least know that you might be it, after all, or whether, if you were, you wouldn't cease to be that something you are which makes me write to you thus. We don't know what people might give us that they don't--the only thing is to take them on what they do and to allow them absolutely and utterly their conditions. This alone, for the tastes, secures freedom of enjoyment. I apply the rule to you, and it represents a perfect triumph of appreciation; because it makes me accept, largely, all your material from you--an <b>absolute</b> <b>gain</b> when I consider that I should never take it from myself. I note certain things which make me wonder at your form and your fortune (e.g.--as I have told you before--the fatal colour in which they let you, because you live at home--is it?--paint American life; and the fact that there's a whole quarter of the heaven upon which, in the matter of composition, you seem consciously--is it consciously?--to have turned your back;) but these things have no relevancy whatever as grounds of dislike--simply because you communicate so completely what you undertake to communicate. The novelist is a particular window, absolutely--and of worth in so far as he is one; and it's because you open so well and are hung so close over the street that I could hang out of it all day long. Your very value is that you choose your own street--heaven forbid I should have to choose it for you. If I should say I mortally dislike the people who pass in it, I should seem to be taking on myself that intolerable responsibility of selection which it is exactly such a luxury to be relieved of. Indeed I'm convinced that no readers above the rank of an idiot--this number is moderate, I admit--really fail to take any view that is really shown them--any gift (of subject) that's really given. The usual imbecility of the novel is that the showing and giving simply don't come off--the reader never touches the subject and the subject never touches the reader; the window is no window at all--but only childish finta, like the ornaments of our beloved Italy. This is why, as a triumph of communication, I hold the Hazard so rare and strong. You communicate in touches so close, so fine, so true, so droll, so frequent. I am writing too much (you will think me demented with chatter;) so that I can't go into specifications of success....|$|E

The international actor's interests not only include power but also encompass the economic and cultural effects of an action as well. The theory is also interrelated with a non-zero-sum game which proposes that through use of comparative advantage, all states who engage in peaceful relations and trade can expand wealth.|$|E
50|$|A Presidential Traverse {{does not}} merely require the <b>absolute</b> <b>gain</b> of some 4,500' from {{starting}} {{point to the}} 6,288' summit of Mt. Washington; it involves repeated gain and loss of elevation between individual summits along the way. The fact that the range stretches less than twenty miles {{from one end to}} the other and most of its main trails are easily accessible from major through roads errantly suggests that the terrain embraced by the Presidentials lacks remoteness. In truth, the range is a wind ravaged wilderness. A basic Presidential Traverse encompasses almost 9,000' of combined vertical, doubled when difficult downclimbing is included. Adding the principal sub-peaks stretches this to almost 20,000' of up- and downclimb in a single traverse.|$|E
5000|$|The {{models that}} have the strongest support from living systems are demographic. In Lamont Cole's classic 1954 paper, he came to an {{interesting}} conclusion: [...] For an annual species, the <b>absolute</b> <b>gain</b> in intrinsic population growth which could be achieved by changing to the perennial reproductive habit would be exactly equivalent to adding one individual to the average litter size. For example, imagine two species—an iteroparous species that has annual litters averaging three offspring each, and a semelparous species that has one litter of four, and then dies. These two species have the same rate of population growth, which suggests that even a tiny fecundity advantage of one additional offspring would favor the evolution of semelparity. This is known as Cole's Paradox.|$|E
40|$|Realists {{assume that}} {{individuals}} {{are obsessed with}} relative gains and that cooperation is {{the exception rather than}} the norm in international relations. In contrast, liberal institutionalists assume that, in many situations, individuals are motivated by <b>absolute</b> <b>gains.</b> These critical assumptions are examined. Results show that the salience of relative gains varies with the beliefs of the individual, the nature of the opponent, and the context of the situation, and that individuals often employ alternative pure strategies (e. g., equity) or mixed strategies (e. g., relative gains in the domain of <b>gains</b> and <b>absolute</b> <b>gains</b> in the domain of losses). Decision strategies (e. g., relative <b>gains,</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>gains,</b> joint gains, equality, and altruism) are linked to the growing constructivist literature in international relations. How do everyday citizens make sense of international events suchas the rise of China? Do they view the change with apprehension or do they see it as an opportunity to be taken advantage of? Although major theories of international relations such as realism and liberalism suggest appropriate responses, these theories implicitly or explicitly focus on decisions by the political elite. Do everyday citizens respond in a similar manner? What beliefs do they hold, and how do these beliefs influence their willingness to cooperate in the rapidly changing international environment...|$|R

40|$|Past studies {{suggested}} that sex ratio influences individuals’ economic behaviors; however, the underlying mechanism of this effect remains unclear. In the current work, we examined how sex ratio influenced women’s preference for relative gain over greater <b>absolute</b> <b>gain</b> {{in the context}} of games involving resource allocation between oneself and another woman; the role of intrasexual competition in this process was also explored. By experimentally manipulating women’s perceptions of local sex ratio, the present study found that women primed with a female-biased sex ratio (i. e., an excess of women) showed higher levels of intrasexual competition. Exposure to the cue of a scarcity of men also led women to care more about their relative gain compared with <b>absolute</b> <b>gain.</b> The effect of sex ratio on shifts of women’s preference between relative gain and <b>absolute</b> <b>gain</b> was mediated by the strength of women’s competitive attitude toward same-sex others. These findings suggest that, by altering the intensity of female–female competition, sex ratio may have a pronounced effect on women’ economic-related decisions...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{a unique}} survey of Roma and non-Roma in South Eastern Europe to {{evaluate}} competing {{explanations for the}} poor performance of Roma in the labour market. The analysis seeks to identify the determinants of educational achievement, employment and wages for Roma and non-Roma. LIML methods are employed to control for endogenous schooling and two sources of sample selection bias in the estimates. Nonlinear and linear decomposition techniques are applied {{in order to identify}} the extent of discrimination. The key results are that: the employment returns to education are lower for Roma than for non-Roma whilst the wage returns are broadly similar for the two groups; the similar wage gains translate into a smaller <b>absolute</b> wage <b>gain</b> for Roma than for non-Roma given their lower average wages; the marginal <b>absolute</b> <b>gains</b> from education for Roma are only a little over one-third of the marginal <b>absolute</b> <b>gains</b> to education for majority populations; and, there is evidence to support the idea that a substantial part of the differential in labour market outcomes is due to discrimination. Explanations of why Roma fare so badly tend to fall into one of two camps: 'low education' vs. 'discrimination'. The analysis suggests that both of these explanations have some basis in fact. Moreover, a direct implication of the lower absolute returns to education accruing to Roma is that their lower educational participation is, at least partially, due to rational economic calculus. Consequently, policy needs to address both low educational participation and labour market discrimination contemporaneously. Roma, discrimination, transition, returns to education...|$|R
