40|$|The {{ability to}} realize truly {{three-dimensional}} electronic circuits is complicated {{if not impossible}} using traditional fabrication techniques. Such techniques are limited {{to the use of}} two dimensional printed circuit boards (PCBs), and require various dissonant processes which exhaust time, volume and cost. Due to the nature of Additive Manufacturing (AM) such problems are diminished and in some ways completely overcome. Additive Manufacturing allows for a higher range of design freedom along conformal surfaces, as well as unit level customization; it is the threshold for embedded electronics, allowing for three-dimensional circuitry in ways traditional fabrication is unfeasible. In such ways, <b>additive</b> <b>technologies</b> provide for a diverse range of optimization toward space applications, such as small satellites. Specific to this research is the CubeSat project, which is the use of small satellites to provide for low cost fabrication, as well as shared launches. The purpose of UTEP 2 ̆ 7 s collaboration with the CubeSat project is to prove not only the successful integration of <b>additive</b> <b>technologies</b> for low cost fabrication of small satellites but participate in the launch and prove the performance of such fabricated devices in space research. The <b>Additive</b> <b>technologies</b> described within this thesis are both Stereolithography and Fused Deposition Modeling.

40|$|<b>Additive</b> <b>technologies</b> (AT) are {{effective}} when processing relatively small batches of products, when {{high costs of}} materials is compensated by lowering fixed costs which {{are related to the}} use of traditional technologies. Aerospace equipment production is characterized, as a rule, within single and serial (small and medium series) types of production, which is why <b>additive</b> <b>technologies</b> will be in high demand in this field of engineering production. There is a necessary condition, regarding the widespread implementation and spreading of new technologies. It is its technical and economic efficiency. This article provides specific information on the comparative characteristics of classic and <b>additive</b> <b>technologies</b> of the common purpose and some pros and cons of these technologies.
