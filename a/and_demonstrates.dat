5|$|Bulgarian cuisine {{is similar}} to those of other Balkan {{countries}} <b>and</b> <b>demonstrates</b> a strong Turkish and Greek influence. Yogurt, lukanka, banitsa, shopska salad, lyutenitsa and kozunak are among the best-known local foods. Oriental dishes such as moussaka, gyuvech, and baklava are also present. Meat consumption is lower than the European average, given a notable preference for a large variety of salads.|$|E

5|$|Also {{attributable}} to Gasparo Cairano, and dated at this stage, is the singular St John the Baptist {{placed in the}} tympanum of the capitol of the eponymous Abbey in Parma. The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by critics to Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the catalog {{of the works of}} Cairano due to obvious correlation with the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant <b>and</b> <b>demonstrates</b> that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E
5|$|Fischer and {{co-workers}} also studied {{the chemistry of}} iridocene, the third transition series analogue of rhodocene and cobaltocene, finding the chemistry of rhodocene and iridocene are generally similar. The synthesis of numerous iridocenium salts including the tribromide and hexafluorophosphate have been described. Just as with rhodocene, iridocene dimerises at room temperature but a monomer form can be detected at low temperatures and in gas phase and IR, NMR, and ESR measurements indicate a chemical equilibrium is present and confirm the sandwich structure of the iridocene monomer. The complex , the analogue of rhodocene derivative reported by Fischer, has also been studied <b>and</b> <b>demonstrates</b> properties consistent with {{a greater degree of}} π-backbonding in iridium(I) systems than is found in the analogous cobalt(I) or rhodium(I) cases.|$|E

Chuck then brings Ellie to Castle <b>and</b> <b>demonstrates</b> martial arts skills from the Intersect. When Chuck claims to be Agent X, the first human Intersect, Ellie informs him that, according to the laptop, someone had originally uploaded the Intersect to their brain before Chuck's birth. After Chuck repairs the computer, they find a redacted file on British scientist Hartley Winterbottom.|$|E
5|$|When Wright {{designed}} the Heller House in 1896, it marked his {{move away from}} styles that were popular into an era of geometric and highly modern designs. Wright's design exhibits the influence of Wright's mentor, Louis Sullivan, <b>and</b> <b>demonstrates</b> Wright's move towards Prairie School homes which would epitomize much of his early work. Sullivan's influence {{can also be seen}} in the floral pattern of the Richard Bock plaster frieze on the home's third floor, although during the 1970s, restoration work—which utilized sandblasting—destroyed much of the detail on the frieze.|$|E
5|$|Hanna M. Roisman compares Kint to Odysseus, {{capable of}} {{adapting}} both his personality and his tales {{to his current}} audience. Throughout his tale, Kint adapts his confession to Kujan's revealed biases. Roisman draws direct parallels to Odysseus' tales to the Phaeacians: like Odysseus, Kint allows his audience to define him and his narrative. Appealing to Kujan's arrogance, Kint allows himself to be outwitted, humiliated, and broken by his interrogator; Kint further invents a mythical villain that he credulously believes in and gives Kujan the privileged perspective of the skeptic. Kint thus creates a neo-noir thriller inside of a neo-noir thriller <b>and</b> <b>demonstrates</b> the artificiality of storytelling. Benjamin Widiss identifies post-structural elements to the film, such as {{the lack of a}} clear protagonist throughout much of the film. This extends to ambiguity over Kint's role as author or reader, and whether he is Kint pretending to be Söze or the reverse.|$|E
