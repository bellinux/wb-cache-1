For example, there are about 600 million tweets produced every day. It is not necessary to look <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> to determine the topics that are discussed during the day, nor is it necessary to look at all the tweets to determine the sentiment on each of the topics. A theoretical formulation for sampling Twitter data has been developed.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asking whether}} God's works are perfect, I {{ought to look}} <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> together, not at one isolation. [...] For {{something}} that seems imperfect when viewed alone might seem completely perfect when regarded as having {{a place in the}} world. [...] Of course, since calling everything into doubt, I haven't established that anything exists besides me and God. But, when I consider God's immense power, I can't deny that He has made — or, in any case, that He could have made — many other things, and I must therefore view myself as having a place in a universe.

Outwardly things went pretty well with the king's affairs, and, as he was fond of pomp and display, he gradually acquired habits of very profuse and lavish expenditure.

60|$|Yet, Monseigneur had slowly {{found that}} vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs, {{both private and}} public; and he had, as to both classes of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to {{finances}} public, because Monseigneur could not make anything <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> and must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet time {{to ward off the}} impending veil, the cheapest garment she could wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General, poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt.|$|E

Mrs. Taunton whispered to a neighbour that it was ‘quite sickening!’ and the Misses Taunton looked as if they knew how to play, but disdained to do it.|$|E
6000|$|But {{let them}} be of what use they will in verbal propositions, they cannot {{discover}} or prove to us the least knowledge {{of the nature of}} substances, as they are found and exist without us, any further than grounded on experience.

WHAT IS, IS, and IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SAME THING TO BE AND NOT TO BE, are made use of in the probation of propositions wherein are words standing for complex ideas, v.g. man, horse, gold, virtue; there they are of infinite danger, and most commonly make men receive and retain falsehood for manifest truth, and uncertainty for demonstration: upon which follow error, obstinacy, and all the mischiefs that can happen from wrong reasoning. The reason whereof is not, that these principles are less true [or of less force] in proving propositions made of terms standing for complex ideas, than where the propositions are about simple ideas. [But because men mistake generally,--thinking that where the same terms are preserved, the propositions are about the same things, though the ideas they stand for are in truth different, therefore these maxims are made use of to support those which in sound and appearance are contradictory propositions; and is clear in the demonstrations above mentioned about a vacuum.
