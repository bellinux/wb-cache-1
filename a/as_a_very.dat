5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE.

5|$|In 1922, the American {{explorer}} Roy Chapman Andrews led a {{well documented}} expedition to China and Mongolia {{sponsored by the}} American Museum of Natural History.

Warner described Hirst <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> consistent batsman throughout the tour, and noted that while he was a less effective bowler in Australian conditions than at home, he was often unlucky.|$|E

5|$|The Ilyushin Il-6 was a Soviet {{long-range}} bomber {{developed from}} the Ilyushin Il-4 during 1942. Originally intended as a high-speed replacement for the Il-4, it was recast <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> long-range bomber with fuel-conserving diesel engines before production of the single prototype began in December 1942. Flight testing showed controllability issues when landing at high weights and the engines proved {{to be hard to}} start at low temperatures and were slow to respond to throttle movements. Further development was canceled in 1944.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|After peak intensity, Chapala {{skirted the}} Yemeni island of Socotra on 1November. Drier air and {{increased}} wind shear weakened the cyclone, although it maintained {{much of its}} intensity upon entering the Gulf of Aden on 2November, becoming the strongest known cyclone in that body of water. After bypassing northern Somalia, Chapala weakened further {{and turned to the}} west-northwest. Early on 3November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> severe cyclonic storm, making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. The storm dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} both sides claimed victory and modern views {{as to who}} won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's Republic of Poland portrayed the battle as difficult, but victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming the near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence and desire to capture Dresden. The battle's outcome is now generally seen in Poland <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> costly victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E

5|$|After {{the storm}} {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about six}} hours, the IMD downgraded Gonu to very severe cyclonic storm status late on June 4. Its eye became cloud-filled and ragged, and the cyclone gradually weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached the Arabian Peninsula. Due to land interaction with Oman, the inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened, and {{over a period of}} 24hours the intensity decreased by 95km/h (60mph). According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the easternmost tip of Oman still <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> severe cyclonic storm early on June 6. Although the winds continued to gradually decrease, overall organization increased slightly in the hours prior to landfall; Gonu maintained a well-defined low-level structure with a weak eye.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th {{and early}} 13th centuries the advowson (the right to appoint the vicar) {{of the church}} was held jointly by two local landowning families, the deBolbec (or deBolebec) and Sifrewast families; <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large parish (generally {{considered}} {{to have been the}} largest parish in Buckinghamshire) twin administrations suited the needs of the parish. Following the civil wars of the reign of King Stephen(1135–1154) England underwent a major upsurge in religious activity and saw a significant growth of monasteries. At some point prior to 1221 the deBolbec family had included their half of the advowson in a grant to the Cistercians of Woburn Abbey, and the Sifrewasts had granted their half to the Augustinian Abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis in Leicester. From then on, Woburn and Leicester were to share the patronage, each appointing their own vicars to the parish, known as Chesham Woburn and Chesham Leicester.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter can be thought of <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo's {{early life}} {{has been the subject}} of {{historical}} conjecture. Vasari, the 16th-century biographer of Renaissance painters, tells a story of Leonardo <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> young man: A local peasant made himself a round shield and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that Ser Piero sold it to a Florentine art dealer, who sold it to the Duke of Milan. Meanwhile, having made a profit, Ser Piero bought a shield decorated with a heart pierced by an arrow, which he gave to the peasant.|$|E
5|$|Life {{with her}} {{grandmother}} was strict and, as Mambo felt depressed without her father, she became withdrawn, sticking to a daily routine of prayers and studying.

She later became more outgoing and was known among {{her family and friends}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> feminine child, enjoying dresses and make-up. While in elementary school she began singing along with songs by her favourite singers Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston in her bedroom. Her mother, believing that Mambo had the ability to be a professional singer, convinced Mambo to try and sing in public while the latter was still in junior high school.|$|E
5|$|Mangalore's {{historical}} {{importance is}} {{highlighted by the}} many references to the city by foreign travellers. During the first century CE, Pliny the Elder, a Roman historian, made references to a place called Nitrias, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> undesirable place for disembarkation, {{on account of the}} pirates which frequent its vicinity, while Greek historian Ptolemy in the second century CE referred to a place called Nitra. Ptolemy's and Pliny the Elder's references were probably made to the Netravati River, which flows through Mangalore. Cosmas Indicopleustes, a Greek monk, in his 6th century work Christian Topography mentions Malabar as the chief seat of the pepper trade, and Mangarouth (port of Mangalore) as one of the five pepper marts which exported pepper.|$|E
