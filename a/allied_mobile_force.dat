During this tour, 18-year-old Pte David Wray {{was shot and}} killed by a sniper whilst on a foot patrol in the Creggan housing estate. From 1978 to 1983, the regiment served as part of the <b>Allied</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Force.</b>|$|E
50|$|In case of war men Air Command's Air Transport Group {{would have}} flown about 1,400 men from 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group to Germany to bring 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group up to wartime strength, while 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group {{would have been}} shipped over the Atlantic as {{reinforcements}} for 1 Canadian Division (Forward). Special Service Force would have contributed a battalion group centered around 1st Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment to NATO's <b>Allied</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Force</b> (Land) (AMF(L)). The Airborne Regiment was destined for defence operations in Canada.|$|E

25|$|While Manstein was formulating new {{plans in}} Koblenz, Generalleutnant Heinz Guderian, {{commander}} of the XIX Army Corps, was lodged in a nearby hotel. Manstein was initially considering a move north from Sedan, directly {{in the rear of}} the main <b>Allied</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>forces</b> in Belgium. When Guderian was invited to contribute to the plan during informal discussions, he proposed a radical and novel idea. Most of the Panzerwaffe should be concentrated at Sedan. This concentration of armour should advance to the west to the English Channel, without waiting for the main body of infantry divisions. This might lead to a strategic collapse of the enemy, avoiding the relatively high number of casualties normally caused by a Kesselschlacht (cauldron battle).|$|R
50|$|SETAF's {{mission and}} {{geographical}} {{area of responsibility}} increased in 1972 when the command enlarged its signal support unit and {{took control of the}} 558th U.S. Army Artillery Group (USAAG) in Greece and the 528th USAAG in Turkey. These units had been in support of NATO since the early 1960s, along with the 559th USAAG, which had been a USASETAF unit in Italy since 1964. The 509th Infantry Regiment (Airborne Battalion Combat Team - ABCT) was previously placed under the command of SETAF in 1973 and later inactivated in the mid-1980s; it was replaced by the 4th Battalion, 325th Infantry Regiment, part of the 82nd Airborne Division. The 4/325th ABCT was composed of three line companies (including a COHORT company) Alpha, a headquarters company, a combat-support company, and a 105mm artillery battery. A member of NATO's <b>Allied</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Forces</b> (Land), the 4/325th ABCT was the right flank element of the European front during the late Cold War and was deployable by parachute to anywhere in the region.|$|R
50|$|Until 1988 the Canadian Air-Sea Transportable Brigade Group {{formed around}} the 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group {{was destined to}} {{reinforce}} Northern Norway and had its heavy equipment pre-positioned in Norway. In 1987 Canada decided use the 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group to reinforce the 1st Canadian Division in Germany instead. Depending on operational needs NATO's <b>Allied</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Force</b> (Land) might have been deployed to Northern Norway. The US Army's 10th Mountain Division was expected to ship out to Norway within 10 days after a Soviet attack in case the situation required additional allied reinforcements.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Allied</b> Command Europe <b>Mobile</b> <b>Force</b> {{was a small}} NATO quick {{reaction}} force, headquartered at Heidelberg, Germany, active from 1960 to 2002. It formed part of Allied Command Europe (ACE), headquartered at SHAPE at Casteau, Belgium. The land {{component of}} the force, consisting of a brigade-sized formation of about 5,000 personnel, was composed of units from 14 NATO states.|$|R
5|$|While the Germans {{were unable}} to mount a counterattack against the Allied beachheads on 15August, by the morning of 16August vonSchwerin had finally {{assembled}} a force {{about the size of}} four infantry battalions. With this force he launched a two-pronged assault towards LeMuy and the Allied bridgehead, as well as toward Draguignan to relieve the LXIICorps headquarters there. By that time, the Allies had already landed a significant number of troops, vehicles, and tanks. The <b>Allied</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>forces</b> of the 45thDivision went out against the German forces themselves. The division surrounded the town of LesArcs, recently reoccupied by vonSchwerin's troops, and attempted to isolate the German forces there. After heavy fighting throughout the day, vonSchwerin ordered his troops to retreat under cover of night. At the same time, heavy fighting occurred at Saint-Raphaël. Mobile units of the 148th Infantry Division finally had arrived there and encountered the US 3rd Division, which was trying to take Saint-Raphaël. This attack, however, was fruitless. By 17August the German counter-attacks had been largely defeated, Saint-Raphaël was secured together with a large bridgehead along the coastline, and <b>mobile</b> <b>forces</b> had linked up with the airborne troops in LeMuy. French troops had been pouring ashore since 16August, passing {{to the left of the}} American troops with the objective of Toulon and Marseille.|$|R

5|$|On 10 May 1940, the Wehrmacht invaded Luxembourg, Netherlands and Belgium. In the Netherlands the Germans made steady progress. By 12 May, {{units of}} the German Army Group B were closing on Rotterdam and Amsterdam, while in central Belgium the Germans were close to {{reaching}} the Dyle river east of Brussels. In response to the invasions, the Allied First Army Group, {{under the command of}} Gaston Billotte, containing the French Seventh Army, French Ninth Army, French First Army and the British Expeditionary Force, advanced to the Dyle river in order to form a solid front line as part of the Dyle Plan, a defensive strategy to halt the German advances in Belgium. However, the offensive by Army Group B was a diversion. The main thrust of Fall Gelb was to be conducted by Army Group A through the Ardennes in Luxembourg and southern Belgium. Once these lightly defended areas were negotiated, Army Group A's XIX. Panzerkorps (19th Tank Corps), under the command of Heinz Guderian, was to strike into France at Sedan, located on the Meuse river. Its capture would enable a German advance into the undefended depths of France and to the English Channel, into the rear of the <b>Allied</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>forces</b> advancing into Belgium. The result would be a strategic-level encirclement.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{a series of}} studies {{concluded}} that interallied coordination would be improved by stationing three international NATO headquarters on the same installation with HQ USAREUR/7A. This resulted in the headquarters of the Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force (4ATAF) moving into building 8 of Campbell Barracks in September 1980. The CENTAG headquarters returned to Campbell Barracks in December 1980, occupying offices in buildings 3,5, and 7 (with an office for the CENTAG Chief of Staff in building 1). Finally, the headquarters of the <b>Allied</b> Command Europe <b>Mobile</b> <b>Force</b> (Land) moved to Campbell Barracks in December 1980, occupying part of building 7.|$|R

5000|$|In {{preparation}} for this change, [...] "41 Designate Squadron" [...] was formed at RAF Coltishall, in Norfolk, on 1 July 1976 and commenced training as a reconnaissance unit with SEPECAT Jaguar GR.1 aircraft. The two squadrons operated {{independently of one another}} until 31 March 1977 when 41 Squadron was disbanded at Coningsby. This allowed 41 Designate Squadron to drop 'Designate' from their name, take possession of the Standard, adopt the Squadron badge, and become the new combat-ready 41 Squadron at RAF Coltishall a day later.41 Squadron’s role changed to low-level reconnaissance and, in early 1978, it became part of SACEUR’s Strategic Reserve. In 1980, the unit was assigned to the <b>Allied</b> Command Europe <b>Mobile</b> <b>Force</b> and was subsequently involved in exercises at Bardufoss in Norway and in the Mediterranean.|$|R

During the action of moving service families and holidaymakers to safety from Limassol, Piper Malcolm Halliday played at the roadside becoming known as [...] "The piper of Cyprus". This had put the Regiment on a war footing and they were involved in riots attacking RAF Akrotiri and protection of the Sovereign Area Base of Episkopi. They were relieved in early 1975 returning unexpectedly to Kirknewton near Edinburgh and did a further four-month tour of Northern Ireland where three soldiers were lost in a roadside bomb attack. They moved to Münster in mid-1976 as the Nuclear Convoy Battalion charged with the protection of 8 Regiment RCT. [...] In this role the Battalion was equipped with Landrovers, a change from the normal equipment used by previous and subsequent NCB units which were armoured infantry battalion.
