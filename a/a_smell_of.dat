5|$|Also {{found on}} {{calcareous}} (chalky) soils, Rubroboletus satanas is larger {{and has a}} pale cap, and its upper stem lacks the reticulations characteristic of S.luridus. Its flesh does not turn blue so markedly on bruising or cutting. It has a more globular overall shape, and young mushrooms carry <b>a</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> decay. The edible Neoboletus luridiformis can be distinguished from S.luridus by its dark brown cap; it also grows on sandy soils associated with conifers. In North America, it can {{be confused with the}} poisonous Rubroboletus pulcherrimus, which has a fatter stalk and deeper red pores. Initially collected in Michigan under oak, Boletus vinaceobasis resembles S.luridus but has shorter spores and its cystidia are dark brown in Melzer's reagent. Boletus species that share a similar appearance with S.luridus but lack reticulation in their stems include B.subvelutipes (found in North America and Asia) and B.hypocarycinus (United States).|$|E
5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed <b>a</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E

25|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} {{released}} from the lake is at a very low temperature believed to cause frostbite, {{which is consistent with}} blisters found on the skin of survivors of the incident at Lake Monoun. The survivors also reported <b>a</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> rotten eggs and feeling warm before passing out; this is {{explained by the fact that}} at high concentrations, carbon dioxide acts as a sensory hallucinogenic. Studies with jet pilots regarding carbon dioxide report similar effects as reported by survivors, i.e. smell of rotten eggs, gunpowder and feeling of warmth.|$|E

Shajar al-Durr and the servants were arrested and Aybak's Mamluks (the Mu'iziyya Mamluks) wanted to kill her, but the Salihyya Mamluks protected {{her and she was}} taken to the Red Tower where she stayed. The son of Aybak, the 15-year-old al-Mansur Ali, was installed by the Mu'ziyyah Mamluks as the new Sultan. Shajar al-Durr was stripped and beaten to death with clogs by the bondmaids of al-Mansur Ali and his mother. [...] Her naked body was found lying outside the Citadel. According to the historian Ibn Iyas, Shajar al- Durr was dragged from her feet and thrown from the top naked, with a cloth around her waist. She stayed in the moat for three days, unburied, until one night a mob came and took off the cloth around her waist because it was silk with pearls and had <b>a</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> musk.

2500|$|In 1995, Drummond bought <b>A</b> <b>Smell</b> <b>of</b> Sulphur in the Wind by Richard Long, for $20,000. In Drummond’s own words, he ‘fell in {{love with}} Richard Long’s work because’ [...] "it was art by walking and doing things on his walks." [...] Five years later, Drummond {{felt that he was}} no longer [...] "getting his money's worth" [...] from the photograph. [...] He decided to try to sell it by placing a series of {{placards}} around the country. When this failed to result in its sale, in 2001 he cut the photograph and mounting card into 20,000 pieces to sell for $1 each. His plan, upon retrieving the $20,000 in cash, is to walk with it to the remote place in Iceland where Richard Long had made the photograph and bury it in a box beneath the stone circle. He will then take his own photograph of the site, bring it home, frame it, hang it in the same place in his bedroom where the Richard Long hung, and call the new work The Smell of Money Underground. Drummond's books How to be an Artist and a later soft-bound edition titled $20,000 recounts this story.|$|E
2500|$|Berry {{recalls the}} artistic {{inspiration}} he obtained from... "the streets of my early childhood, the moorland landscape, pit villages, public houses, chip shops, night town and later avenue life." [...] Lamenting change, he bemoans that, [...] "the old wooden mangle rollers {{were replaced by}} rubber wringers, the iron range grate by little fancy tiled affairs, the elegant, slim paper packets of five Woodbines disappeared..." [...] He felt {{he had been born}} into a tightly cohesive society, but [...] "the values that had held the working class together began to slowly be eroded." [...] He loved a world that was filled with, [...] "a line of shunted coal waggons...wreaths of steam and <b>a</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> gas...youths playing cards {{at the back of the}} old knackers yard...old men cough in the betting shops and huge fat women queue in the Co-op...the chain row and pit-head gear." [...] This was a [...] "place of empty chapels and aborted kilns", [...] "the window cleaner with wild eyes and a mania for gambling", or indeed [...] "an effeminate man who wears a ginger wig...muttering to himself all day, he pushes an old pram with a bird cage in it." [...] Touchingly, he noticed the habits of the people: [...] "at weekends when you are flush and filled with drink or the prospect of drink", and when one might feel [...] "as dry as a lime-burner's clog." [...] He loved [...] "the sunken bricks of his garden path." [...] and even a visit to the gents could become an inspiring revelation: [...] "as I stand piddling in the crazed urinal stall I can see the red and green tail lights of some night plane moving across this area of infinite velvet over the darkened hoop of the world." ...|$|E
