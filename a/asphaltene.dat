Thus, {{this work was}} aimed to experimentally study the adsorption/occlusion processes inside the <b>asphaltenes,</b> using the deuterated paraffin n-C 20 D 42 as the target compound under the conditions of high temperature/high pressure, with some chloride salts as additives to probe the mechanism of the adsorption/occlusion inside <b>asphaltenes.</b> The {{results show that the}} adsorption/occlusion phenomena take place inside <b>asphaltenes</b> during their thermal evolution. Occlusion inside <b>asphaltenes</b> could occur via two paths, namely, the physical process maybe through the polar interactions among the molecules and the chemical process through condensation or polymerization of the molecules, and then some substantial microporous units could develop to adsorb/occlude other fractions.

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>asphaltenes</b> in heavy oil {{is related to}} its high viscosity which is a major constraint in heavy oil processing and transportation. Moreover, {{problems associated with the}} deposition of <b>asphaltenes</b> at different stages of the heavy oil refining steps increase the cost of heavy oil processing. In this research project, we have achieved viscosity reduction of heavy oil by treating it through the novel JetShear destructuring process. Subsequently we have studied the adsorption of the <b>asphaltenes</b> over specific solid adsorbents. Characterization of the raw and treated heavy oil has been conducted. We have experimentally shown that the JetShear destructuring process reduces diluent requirements (up to 50 %), decreases the initial viscosity of heavy oil and lowers the oil density (increasing its API degree) thus providing a solution for pipeline transportation. The <b>asphaltenes</b> content of the treated product oil was also found to decrease slightly during the JetShear destructuring as per SARA fractions determination. This implies incipient cracking of the heavy oil induced by the JetShear treatment. Adsorption of <b>asphaltenes</b> over practical adsorbents was conducted to determine whether <b>asphaltenes</b> could be selectively removed from the oil aiming at establishing the basis of a process. that could lead to breakthrough technology in heavy oil processing. Investigations of adsorption of <b>asphaltenes</b> were centered onto two objectives: firstly, <b>asphaltenes</b> characterization based on molecular size and separation of <b>asphaltenes</b> into acidic and basic fractions; secondly, <b>asphaltenes</b> interaction with adsorbents was studied. Experiments using virgin and destructured heavy oil showed that <b>asphaltenes</b> were preferentially removed following a multilayer adsorption model in the pores with significant and practical yields (0. 25 ~ 0. 36 g asphaltenes/g adsorbent) in the 150 [degree centigrade] range. Maximum uptake required 200 min of contact time at heavy oil/adsorbents ratios in the 5 : 1 range. The adsorption reduced the <b>asphaltenes</b> remaining in the treated heavy oil by allowing the <b>asphaltenes</b> to lodge in the pores as well as getting adsorbed on the surfaces of the adsorbent particularly the lower molecular weight <b>asphaltenes.</b> The combined treatment (i. e. destructuring and adsorption) also changed the functional group of the <b>asphaltenes,</b> and induced loss of heteroatoms lowering sulfur content in the final oil...|$|R

Indeed, the maxima of MMD of n-alkanes in oil <b>asphaltenes</b> 3, 4, and 5 was at 54 – 56, 40 – 44, and 54 – 56 (Fig.  1), whereas the maxima of MMD of n-alkanes in corresponding wax deposit <b>asphaltenes</b> showed n-alkanes with {{a smaller number of}} carbon atoms with maxima at 41 – 43, 40 – 42, and 49 – 51, respectively (Fig.  5).

30|$|The {{research}} found that <b>asphaltenes</b> contain paraffin hydrocarbons {{with a wide}} MMD from 12 to 60. On {{the example of the}} oils of different ages from the Samara region, Russia, it is shown that the composition of paraffin hydrocarbons in <b>asphaltenes</b> depends on the age of the oil reservoir from which oil is produced. The higher the age of oil reservoir, the smaller the share of low molecular weight n-alkanes in <b>asphaltenes.</b> That {{may be due to the}} decrease in the share of low molecular weight n-alkanes in oil and the fact that with increasing depth of occurrence of the oil reservoir, the <b>asphaltenes</b> become denser and their ability to occlude low molecular weight hydrocarbons reduces. The increase in the share of high molecular weight n-alkanes in <b>asphaltenes</b> with an increase in the age of oil reservoir is explained by the increase in their share in the oil, from which <b>asphaltenes</b> are precipitated.|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} a {{dispersant}} to maintain <b>asphaltenes</b> in a peptized state and to prevent flocculation of <b>asphaltenes</b> was investigated by considering its stability under different conditions.

50|$|Saturate, Aromatic, Resin and <b>Asphaltene</b> (SARA) is an {{analysis}} method that divides crude oil components {{according to their}} polarizability and polarity.

Aromatics, which contain one or more aromatic rings, are slightly more polarizable. The remaining two fractions, resins and asphaltenes, have polar substituents.

30|$|The {{quantitative}} assessment of n-alkanes, <b>asphaltenes</b> and resins in five different crude oil samples: Escravos, Bonny Export, Penningston, Bodo (Nigerian crudes) and Bassrah (from Iraq) was successfully carried out using a new approach coded NAASAR, (n-alkanes, <b>asphaltenes,</b> aromatics and resins) comprising urea adduction followed by gas chromatographic analyses (for n-alkanes), n-heptane precipitation (for <b>asphaltenes)</b> and column chromatography (for resins). The results established the occurrence of n-alkanes ranging from n-C 8 H 18 to n-C 40 H 82 with total weight percentage n-alkane yields in the order: Bodo 47.41  > Bonny Export 32.47  > Penningston 30.75  > Bassrah 11.22  > Escravos 5.58. N-heptane precipitation showed that Bodo crude oil has the highest weight percent concentration of <b>asphaltenes</b> (7.31  %) and Bonny Export, the least (1.34  %). Bodo crude oil also has {{a higher percentage of}} resins (9.66) than Bassrah(3.77). 0 API gravity, wt % of n-alkanes, <b>asphaltenes,</b> resins and the ratio of <b>asphaltenes</b> to resins were compared in two of the crudes: Bodo and Bassrah. The <b>asphaltenes</b> to resins ratio {{is one of the key}} parameters that control the stability of asphaltenemisceles in crude oils. This work demonstrated that Bassrah crude has a higher <b>asphaltenes</b> to resins ratio than Bodo crude. NAASAR method employed in this work is cost effective because it does not require sophisticated equipment as in SARA group type of analysis (saturates, aromatics, resins and <b>asphaltenes)</b> according to Fan and Buckley (2002). It requires small samples of crudes and solvents and also it is a reliable means of crude oil analysis when compared with other existing methods which require the use of fairly large samples and solvents.|$|R
