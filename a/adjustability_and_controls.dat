40|$|Key Foundation of Nanjing Army [09 Z 020, 10 Z 022]Most {{anterior}} spinal {{instrumentation systems}} are designed {{as either a}} plate or dual-rod system and have corresponding limitations. Dual-rod designs may offer greater adjustability; however, this system also maintains a high profile and lacks a locking design. Plate systems {{are designed to be}} stiffer, but the fixed configuration is not adaptable to the variety of vertebral body shapes. The authors designed a new combined rod-plate system (D-rod) to overcome these limitations and compared its biomechanical performance with the conventional dual-rod and plate system. Eighteen pig spinal specimens were divided into 3 groups (6 per group). An L 1 corpectomy was performed and fixed with the D-rod (group A; n= 6), Z-plate (Sofamor Danek, Memphis, Tennessee) (group B; n= 6), or Ventrofix (Synthes, Paoli, Pennsylvania) (group C; n= 6) system. T 13 -L 2 range of motion was measured with a 6 degrees of freedom (ie, flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation) spine simulator under pure moments of 6. 0 Nm. The D-rod and Ventrofix specimens were significantly stiffer than the Z-plate specimens (P <. 05) based on results obtained from lateral bending and flexion-extension tests. The D-rod and Z-plate specimens were significantly stiffer than the Ventrofix specimens (P <. 05) in axial rotation. The D-rod combines the advantages of the plate and dual-rod systems, where the anterior rod exhibits the design of a low-profile locking plate, enhanced stability, and decreased interference of the surrounding vasculature. The posterior rods function in compression and distraction, and the dual-rod system offers greater <b>adjustability</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> over screw placement. The results indicate that it may provide adequate stability for anterior thoracolumbar reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|The LCLS generates linearly polarized, intense, high {{brightness}} x-ray pulses from planar fixed-gap undulators. While the fixed-gap design supports {{a very successful}} <b>and</b> tightly <b>controlled</b> alignment concept, it provides only limited taper capability (up to 1 % through canted pole <b>and</b> horizontal position <b>adjustability)</b> <b>and</b> lacks polarization <b>control.</b> The latter is of great importance for soft x-ray experiments. A new compact out-of-vacuum undulator design (Delta), based on a 30 -cm-long in-vacuum prototype at Cornell University, is being developed and tested to add those missing properties to the LCLS undulator line. Tuning Delta undulators within tight, FEL type tolerances is a challenge {{due to the fact}} that the magnetic axis and the magnet blocks are not easily accessible for measurements and tuning in the fully assembled state. An R&D project is underway to install a 3. 2 -m long out-of-vacuum device in place of the last LCLS undulator, to provide controllable levels of polarized radiation and to develop measurement and tuning techniques to achieve x-ray FEL type tolerances. Presently, the installation of the device is scheduled fo...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a neck pain risk score for office workers (NROW) to {{identify}} office workers at risk for developing nonspecific neck pain with disability. MethodsA 1 -year prospective cohort study of 559 healthy office workers was conducted. At baseline, risk factors were assessed using questionnaires and standardized physical examination. The incidence of neck pain was collected every month thereafter. Disability level was evaluated using the neck disability index. Logistic regression was used to select significant factors to build a risk score. The coefficients from the logistic regression model were transformed into the components of a risk score. ResultsAmong 535 (96 %) participants who were followed up for 1 year, 23 % reported incident neck pain with disability (≥ 5). After adjusting for confounders, the onset of neck pain with disability was significantly associated with history of neck pain, chair <b>adjustability,</b> <b>and</b> perceived muscular tension. Thus, the NROW comprises 3 questions about history of neck pain, chair <b>adjustability,</b> <b>and</b> perceived muscular tension. The NROW had scores ranging from 0 to 4. A cut-off score of at least 2 had a sensitivity of 82 % and specificity of 48 %. The positive and negative predictive values were 29 % and 91 %, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0. 75. ConclusionThe risk score for nonspecific neck pain with disability in office workers was developed, and it contained 3 items with scores ranging from 0 to 4. This study shows that the score appears to have reasonable sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values for the cut-off point of at least 2...|$|R
