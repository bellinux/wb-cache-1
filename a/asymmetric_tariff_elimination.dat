40|$|Current {{tariffs on}} wood {{products}} {{act as a}} barrier to trade. They restrict market access to more efficient producers. When a multilateral <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> policy is simulated with a global trade model the results project greater trade activity in softwood lumber and plywood, and a greater market share for the US, Canada and European producers. Smaller but similar effects are found in the hardwood sector. The scenario analysis also suggests the possibility that, in the short term, <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> may not lead to increase global consumption. A <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> policy may result in a strong demand effect in the North American market, and, as a result, may lead to higher prices. Supply tightness may come from either stronger than expected demand growth and restrictions on supply availability in North America. Demand rigidity in Asian economies for lumber and plywood lead to positive, but small consumption gains with tariff liberalization. Initial changes in softwood lumber trade flows reach 20 % from baseline dropping to 13 % by 2010. The result suggests that tariffs in softwood lumber have restricted markets mostly for North American and European producers. Because the North American, particularly the US market, and Europe are also the major consumers of softwood lumber, a <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> scenario results in greater international demand for their products raising domestic prices and lowering domestic consumption. This reduction in North American and European domestic consumption outweighs consumption gains in Japan, Australia and Mexico, regions where <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> occurs. The current economic outlook for Asia is likely having a strong influence on the above result. Baseline results suggest a strong demand in the US while Asian consumption has fallen. The current global market condition has raised product prices in the US and lowered prices in Asia, an effect expected from lowering tariffs, but due to different forces. With an expanding US domestic markets and little consumption growth in Asian, the <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> policy places further upward price pressure on US consumers as US and other producers shift some production from domestic to international markets. A further strengthening of foreign demand through a <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> scenario reinforces upward price pressures affecting consumers in the US. Hence, the simulation suggests a global consumption decline in the short term with a price rise in the North American and European markets. This result suggests low cost producers are constrained from meeting expanded demand from tariff liberalization in the short run. A dominant North American market characterizes the global softwood plywood sector. The simulation results suggest that <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> in the softwood plywood sector increases trade activity as well as global consumption and production. The US, a major consumer and producer of softwood plywood, acts as an exporter reducing its consumption and increasing output. As such the US dominates the response from a <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> scenario in the model. Since many of the producing sectors outside the US have exogenous behavior for this sector, production changes in the model are limited. The limited production capacity outside North America for softwood plywood is likely to lessen the importance from these exogenous production constraints. Tariff effects on plywood trade are substantial percentage-wise; they reach 8 % immediately and attain 14 % by 2010. Softwood plywood is viewed as a mature product in decline being replaced by alternative engineered materials. Production capacity expansion in these engineered materials outside the U. S. are more likely to lessen the expanded production and consumption associated with the simulated <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> policy in softwood plywood. Currently, fiberboard and reconstituted products are projected exogenously in CGTM. <b>Tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> in the softwood lumber and plywood sectors has a direct impact on the sawlog and pulpwood sectors. There is little evidence of any substantial effect from a <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> policy in the softwood sawlog sector and no recorded changes in the pulpwood sector due to <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination.</b> This is because tariffs currently exist in countries with limited market behavior, such as China, or with small trade flows such as Mexico. Hence, changes observed in the log sector are driven primarily by the softwood lumber <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination.</b> Softwood log trade is lower under the <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> policy. Changes in trade activity in the softwood log sector reach 8 % from baseline due to lumber and plywood <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination.</b> Hardwood sector results are smaller than the softwood sector impacts. Assumptions regarding China’s consumptive behavior have a strong influence on the results. Sensitivity analysis with higher Chinese consumption projects greater imports originating from nearby Asian countries. Otherwise, much of the increase in production would come from the US. The above results suggests the major part of increased softwood harvests would involve Canadian forests which are mostly natural followed by secondary forests in the US and Europe. Depending on Chinese consumption changes, the major increase in hardwood harvests would originate from Southeast Asian producers under high Chinese consumption growth. Otherwise, the increase in hardwood consumption would flow from US forests...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the economic effects of <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> {{policies in the}} Philippines {{with the aid of}} PHILGEM: a detailed single-country computable general equilibrium model of the Philippine economy. We focus on income distribution, comparing rich to poor and men to women. To this end, PHILGEM includes a social accounting matrix (SAM), which distinguishes 38, 400 households. The key to rich detail in household results is a very detailed pattern of connection between core CGE outcomes (earnings by sector) and individual household incomes. We divide individual labour income between 7 labour types and 2 genders in 105 sectors. Each household may include several wage earners with different characteristics. We find that <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> benefits the Philippine economy: conventional triangle welfare gains outweigh terms of trade losses. Men benefit but women benefit slightly more; because some expanding export-oriented sectors employ more women. Although unilateral <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> reduces the poverty headcount, Gini income inequality increases slightly. If other countries also liberalize, then both poverty headcount and income inequality decline. Our 38, 400 households are drawn from a nationally-representative household survey of Philippines. We compare several different methods of using so much household detail. We find it computationally feasible to represent all 38, 400 households directly in the model; or, more conventionally, to use a more aggregated CGE model to drive a microsimulation model. A key question that affects results is whether to adjust national accounts and household survey data to be consistent. We also use a dynamic version of PHILGEM to trace out the adjustment between short- and long-run equilibriums. The results from dynamic simulation broadly reproduce conclusions drawn from our comparative-static simulations. ...|$|R

After {{a decade}} of high growth, all segments of the Russian economy are experiencing a slowdown caused by the global financial crisis. To boost growth and living standards, {{and to ensure that}} Russia emerges from this global crisis, the need for a correct and comprehensive economic policy response is of high importance these days. This dissertation addresses two important economic issues in Russia: tax evasion and tariff reform. Though these topics have been studied intensively over the last century, there have been only a few attempts made in the economics field that give a direct estimate of tax evasion and <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> for the Russian economy. The primary reason for preventing a direct estimate is a lack of reliable and representative data. This dissertation uses the most recent industry data from Russia not previous used and provides a theoretical and quantitative analysis of tax compliance and tariff reform in Russia. The first chapter of this dissertation starts with an assessment of the role of taxation as a macroeconomic tool. It then reviews the problematic issues facing the tax system of developing countries such as tax evasion and tariff liberalization. The second chapter explores tax compliance behavior of companies in Russia. I develop a static industry model of tax evasion with heterogeneous producers to investigate the key determinants that give rise to tax evasion in Russia. Assuming that the probability of detection depends on the level of production, the model explains why small firms evade taxes. My quantitative experiments allow me to estimate how much the model economy gains if the tax burden, penalties, and probability of detection were changed. The third chapter discusses potential effects of trade liberalization on the Russian economy. I construct a static applied general equilibrium model and perform a series of numerical experiments, such as a partial and complete <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> scenario.

40|$|Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi {{ushered in}} a new era in Japan’s {{international}} trade policy in January 2002 when he and his Singaporean counterpart, Goh Chok Tong, signed the Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement (JSEPA), the first bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed between Asian countries. This trade strategy also reflected Japan’s interest in launching its so-called ‘multi-layered trade policy’ which meant the pursuit of bilateral and regional trading arrangements, including FTAs, in an attempt to complement multilateralism based on the GATT/WTO to reinvigorate efforts to achieve global trade liberalisation. This paper aims to examine how and why Japan and Singapore decided to pursue FTAs, what interests both perceived in their pursuit of FTAs, what elements contributed to both countries being linked in this trade policy arrangement, and what implications the JSEPA has had for the FTA movement in East Asia. It argues that the JSEPA was made possible mainly through Singapore’s initial offer to exclude agricultural products from <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination.</b> But Japan faced problems in seeking FTAs with other ASEAN countries which were less developed than Singapore and had a higher proportion of agricultural exports, as the exclusion of specific agricultural products, such as rice and sugar, would contradict Japan’s claim that its FTAs would bolster the WTO-based multilateral system. The proliferation of FTAs in East Asia may generate a ‘spaghetti-bowl’ effect with varying rules of origin that may divert and distort trade, but the ‘new age’ aspects of the Japan- Singapore agreement will also have some positive economic effects. Although the preferential trade elements of the agreement are detrimental, the smaller portion of <b>tariff</b> <b>elimination</b> results in a smaller trade diversion effect on trading partners. Therefore, the Japan-Singapore agreement carries symbolic meaning in terms of trade policy debates as well as signifying a paradigm shift in Japan’s international trade policy. ...|$|R

Hence, the volume of intra-trade is generally increased with the enactment of free trade agreements. From the perspective of exporting countries, the increase in intra-trade flow will improve the economies of scale in production.
