40|$|In {{wireless}} sensor networks, density {{control is}} an important technique for prolonging a network’s lifetime. To reduce the overall energy consumption, it is desirable to minimize the overlapping sensing area of the sensor nodes. In this paper, we study the problem of energy-efficient area coverage by the regular placement of sensors with adjustable sensing and communication ranges. We suggest a more accurate method to estimate efficiency than those currently used for coverage by sensors with <b>adjustable</b> <b>ranges,</b> and propose new density control models that considerably improve coverage using sensors with two sensing ranges.

40|$|Abstract — The {{coverage}} {{problem is}} a fundamental issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Recent coverage patterns only utilize the <b>adjustable</b> <b>ranges</b> of sensors to minimize the sensing energy consumption. However, a big amount of energy consumption for communication is not strictly taken into account, especially for high rate data transmission applications. In this paper, we introduce an energyefficient pattern {{that is used to}} minimize the communication energy consumption for high rate data transmission WSNs, while simultaneously, guarantee a high degree of sensing coverage. Theoretical calculations and extensive simulation are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the new pattern compared to existing ones in terms of various performance metrics. Our proposed pattern can minimize the total energy consumption at most 17. 4 % compared to the existing patterns, which were known as the best patterns...|$|R

The operating range was adjusted by varying the radio signal strength so that traffic lights could be activated only nearby (if desired), or at greater distances. The downside to these preemption systems (which also performed collision avoidance) was that they would display the direction of impending collisions, but {{not be able to}} effectively (or accurately) calculate the distance to collision by any method other than RF signal strength, which was only a rough estimate at best.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} is a rear sight that adjusts in both directions, though {{military}} rifles {{often have a}} tangent sight in the rear, which a slider on the rear sight has pre-calibrated elevation adjustments for different ranges. With tangent sights, the rear sight {{is often used to}} adjust the elevation, and the front the windage. The M16A2 later M16 series rifles have a dial <b>adjustable</b> <b>range</b> calibrated rear sight, and use an elevation adjustable front sight to [...] "zero" [...] the rifle at a given range. The rear sight is used for windage adjustment and to change the zero range.|$|E
50|$|Developed and {{patented}} by James M. Leatherwood, the <b>Adjustable</b> <b>Ranging</b> Telescope (ART) system combines a rangefinding scale inside the telescopic sight (scope) with an adjustable cam {{built into the}} scope's mount that raises or lowers {{the rear of the}} sight to compensate for the trajectory of the bullet. The cam is preset for a specific cartridge; i.e. the 7.62 mm NATO round. In use, the shooter first adjusts the magnification of the scope such that the ranging brackets subtend the target. Since the range cam is locked to the magnification ring, the range is automatically set and the drop of the shot is accounted for. This then allows the shooter to place the scope's aiming point directly on the target without having to hold over or under to compensate for the bullet's rise and fall.|$|R

This paper proposes a new structural-parameter-based JHD active adjustment approach for our previous jumping robot. First, the JHD adjustments, modifying the lengths of different legs of the robot, are modelled and simulated. Then, three mechanisms for leg-length adjustment are proposed and compared, and the screw-and-nut mechanism is selected.

40|$|Recently, {{the use of}} {{a virtual}} {{backbone}} (connected dominating set) in various applications in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) has become popular. These applications include topology management, point and area coverage, and routing protocol design. In a mobile environment such as a MANET, one challenging issue in constructing a virtual backbone is to accomplish a distributed and localized solution that aims at balancing several contradicting objectives: small approximation ratio, fast convergence, and low computation cost. Many existing distributed and localized algorithms select a virtual backbone without resorting to global or geographical information. However, these algorithms incur a high computation cost in a dense network. In this paper, we propose a distributed solution based on reducing the density of the network using two mechanisms: clustering and <b>adjustable</b> transmission <b>range.</b> By using <b>adjustable</b> transmission <b>range,</b> we also achieve another objective, energy-efficient design, as a by-product. As an application, we show an efficient broadcasting where nodes (and only nodes) in a virtual backbone are used to forward the broadcast message. The virtual backbone is constructed using Wu and Li’s marking process [1] and the proposed density reduction process. The application of the density reduction process to other localized algorithms is also discussed. The efficiency of our approach is confirmed through both analytic and simulation study...|$|R
