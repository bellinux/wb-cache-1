2500|$|After a {{successful}} [...] hop, Bruno Steffen planned {{to fly the}} Forssman on its <b>acceptance</b> <b>flight</b> with four passengers aboard, as he had for his own R.I design. However, everyone whom he invited declined, including {{the members of the}} Idflieg acceptance committee, and so he made the flight alone. [...] Carrying the required 1,000-kilogram payload, Steffen reached 2,000metres in 28 minutes, and then climbed another [...] before returning to the ground. While descending, one engine failed, followed shortly by the other three. Nevertheless, Steffen made a safe landing and the acceptance criteria were verified.|$|E
2500|$|Bong {{then became}} a test pilot {{assigned}} to Lockheed's Burbank, California, plant, where he flew P-80 Shooting Star jet fighters at the Lockheed Air Terminal. [...] On August 6, 1945, the plane's primary fuel pump malfunctioned during takeoff on the <b>acceptance</b> <b>flight</b> of P-80A 44-85048. Bong either forgot to switch to the auxiliary fuel pump, or for some reason was unable to do so. Bong cleared away from the aircraft, but was too low for his parachute to deploy. The plane crashed into a narrow field at Oxnard St & Satsuma Ave, North Hollywood. His death was front-page news across the country, sharing space with the first news of the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E
2500|$|During its <b>acceptance</b> <b>flight,</b> {{the newly}} {{refurbished}} R.II carried a 2,310-kg (5,100-lb) useful load to {{an altitude of}} [...] and stayed aloft for four hours. Having satisfied requirements, R.II was delivered to Riesenflugzeugersatzabteilung (Rea — [...] "giant aircraft support unit"), the support unit for R-type aircraft, on 29 June 1917. Although the R.II's performance was a significant improvement over other R-type aircraft produced by Siemens-Schuckert, its increased span and weight limited its speed, and it could not keep pace with similar aircraft manufactured by Staaken then entering service. The R.II was therefore relegated to training duties with the Riesenflugzeug Schulabteilung ("giant aircraft training unit") at Döberitz. In June 1918, it was transferred back to Rea at Cologne, where it crashed later that year.|$|E
2500|$|The H.P.20 {{was first}} flown, with slots closed on 24 February 1921 at Cricklewood. [...] About {{a month later}} it was flying with {{controllable}} slots. [...] In one test it landed at 43 mphh (69km/h) at a wing loading of 11lb/ft2 (54kg/m2), {{about the same as}} a Cessna 152. [...] This corresponds to a lift coefficient of 1.17. [...] Aerodynamic loads made the slats hard to operate reliably. [...] After manufacturer's tests, the Air Ministry agreed to take on the aircraft, but the Ministry's pilot made a heavy landing at Cricklewood during <b>acceptance</b> <b>flights</b> and the H.P.20 remained there for repairs until final delivery in February 1922.|$|R
25|$|Designers Bruno and Franz Steffen piloted the {{aircraft}} themselves {{on its first}} test flight on 24 May 1915. They ended this flight prematurely because of overheating in the gearboxes, and subsequent tests revealed other defects such as excessive vibration in the drive system. With these problems addressed, the R.I was ready for its Idflieg <b>acceptance</b> <b>flights</b> in June 1915. Bruno Steffen ferried the three-person inspection team, plus a number of passengers, from Neumünster to Döberitz. He had even placed two armchairs {{and a bottle of}} champagne in the cabin for the occasion. The R.I reached Döberitz safely and made around twenty-four test flights before it was accepted by the military on 26 July 1915.|$|R
25|$|The R-Unit was inactivated on 30 May 1989. Upon inactivation, {{the unit}} was {{reformed}} as Detachment 1, 57th Fighter Weapons Wing (FWW). In 1990 the last F-117A (843) was delivered from Lockheed. After completion of <b>acceptance</b> <b>flights</b> at Area 51 of this last new F-117A aircraft, the flight test squadron continued flight test duties of refurbished aircraft after modifications by Lockheed. In February/March 1992 the test unit moved from Area 51 to the USAF Palmdale Plant 42 and was {{integrated with the}} Air Force Systems Command 6510th Test Squadron. Some testing, especially RCS verification and other classified activity was still conducted at Area 51 throughout the operational lifetime of the F-117. The recently inactivated (2008) 410th Flight Test Squadron traces its roots, if not its formal lineage to the 4450th TG R-unit.|$|R
2500|$|Siemens-Shuckert {{engineers}} {{believed that}} with still larger radiators, the Maybach engines {{could be made}} to work on this aircraft. However, the firm lacked the personnel and the experience to undertake engine development. Therefore, while Siemens-Schuckert asked the Idflieg to allow them to substitute Benz Bz.IV engines on the [...] R.II and R.III the firm suggested that the Idflieg accept the R.IV in its current state, including its Maybach engines, so that they could oversee a development programme for the engine themselves. The Idflieg agreed to this suggestion and lowered its specifications for the R.IV accordingly. The R.IV passed the new requirements on an <b>acceptance</b> <b>flight</b> on 27 August 1916, and was accepted into service with the Riesenflugzeugersatzabteilung (Rea — [...] "giant aircraft support unit") the same day.|$|E
2500|$|Despite all setbacks, Siemens-Schuckert {{still wanted}} to sell the aircraft, and {{commenced}} another rebuild. The nose was redesigned again, into a rounded, blunt configuration with a gun position atop. The pilot's position was relocated either behind the nose windows or to an open cockpit {{on top of the}} fuselage. By now, the aircraft had acquired the nickname Ladenhüter (literally, [...] "shelf warmer" [...] or, idiomatically, [...] "white elephant") and pilots refused to fly it. Siemens-Schuckert director Walter Reichel negotiated a price discount for the Idflieg if they would accept the aircraft to a lower specification. The Idflieg accepted, and reduced the acceptance criteria to the aircraft reaching [...] in 30 minutes while carrying a useful load of [...] and enough fuel for an endurance of 4 hours. Reichel now offered Bruno and Franz Steffen ten percent of the sale price if they could perform an <b>acceptance</b> <b>flight</b> to meet the Idfliegs requirements. The Steffen brothers examined the Forssman and Bruno agreed to make the flight, against the recommendations of friends and associates. Franz's calculations based on the construction drawings showed the aircraft safe to fly, although the fuselage to be structurally weak immediately aft of the wings.|$|E

50|$|Future {{training}} to be undertaken at the Shindand Air Wing at Shindand Air Base in western Afghanistan. The base which has been refurbished and expanded by ISAF which tripled its size. A new 1.3 mile training runway was to begin construction in 2012 but has been canceled. The seven candidates are all graduates of the National Military Academy of Afghanistan of Initial Officer Training held in the United Kingdom and have also undertaken English language training in the Kabul English Language Training Center. Students will be trained in both fixed-wing aircraft, namely the Cessna 182T and 208B and in rotary wing aircraft, the MD 530F. About 6 MD 530F helicopters were delivered to Shindand in late 2011. The initial 6 helicopters have completed <b>acceptance</b> <b>flights</b> and can now be used to begin training Afghan Pilots, although one was destroyed in 2013 by an IED. The four-year contract could see as many as 54 other helicopters being supplied to the AAF.|$|R

50|$|The Model Cs quickly {{earned an}} unenviable {{reputation}} when {{six of the}} eight passing their <b>acceptance</b> <b>flights</b> crashed between July 8, 1913, and February 9, 1914, with {{all but one of}} the crashes involving fatalities. The fifth crash on November 24, 1913 killed the Army's chief instructor and a new pilot. As a result, the Wright Company factory manager, Grover Loening, concluded that the Wright C was flawed by a design defect. Orville Wright disagreed, maintaining that pilot error was to blame, specifically unfamiliarity with the more powerful engine. He theorized that pilots stalled the aircraft by applying full power that in level flight made angle of attack critical. He proposed that full power be used only to climb and invented an angle-of-incidence indicator sensitive enough to warn a pilot that his climb or dive was too steep. He also completed work on an autopilot which he patented in October 1913, and successfully demonstrated in December, but a gyroscope-operated autopilot patented by Lawrence Sperry proved more immediately practical and became standard.|$|R

5|$|The {{squadron}} was re-formed at Williamtown on 24January 1949 {{equipped with}} de Havilland Vampire jet fighters. From 1949 to early 1952 No.75 Squadron conducted training exercises, which included teaching new pilots to operate Vampires, {{as well as}} making <b>acceptance</b> <b>flights</b> of Vampires delivered to the RAAF. During this period a key role for the squadron was training pilots for combat in the Korean War with the Gloster Meteor-equipped No.77 Squadron. In March 1952 the Australian Government decided to reform No.78 Wing and deploy it to Malta where it would form part of a British force which sought to counter the Soviet Union's influence in the Middle East. No.75 and No.76 Squadrons were selected to form the wing's flying units, and they arrived at RAF Hal Far in Malta during July 1952 and were equipped with Vampires leased from the Royal Air Force (RAF). While based at Malta the wing took part in numerous training exercises in the Mediterranean region as well as Europe, including a large-scale NATO exercise in 1953 which involved 2,000 aircraft and 40,000 personnel. In addition, the wing participated in a royal review to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

On the eve of its 28th flight, Captain Vedania Mannuwal, assigned to the test program, was advised not to stress the aircraft, as the source of the vibrations experienced during the previous flight in the morning had not been discovered. Determined to [...] "better" [...] his team leader's recent performance, however, he ignored the precautions and began practicing aerobatic maneuvers near Córdoba during his afternoon flight. Consequently, in a high g-force turn, a structural failure occurred with the wing separating from the fuselage. After struggling with the Martin-Baker Mk I ejection seat, Mannuwal ejected at low altitude while the aircraft was inverted. His parachute did not fully deploy, however, and he was killed. The defect in the Pulqui II was traced to faulty workmanship related to welding the joint pin that fastened the wing to the fuselage. Welding had been a dichotomy in the manufacturing process necessitated by the paucity of modern forging and pressing equipment in Argentina.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2010 a Cessna 400 {{that was}} being test flown at the factory {{developed}} a fuel leak, the cause of which {{was determined to be}} that the aircraft had [...] "suffered a significant structural failure in the wing during a production <b>acceptance</b> <b>flight</b> test.
