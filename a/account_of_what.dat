According to his undated charge sheet, witnesses for the state were Littrell, Martin, Lane, and Lawrence Payne. Austin's <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened tallied {{with that of the}} posse, except that he said he was the one, not Laura, who had objected to the shotgun being removed from the wall.

5|$|Local weavers {{specialised}} in {{the production}} of kersey, a hardwearing and inexpensive woollen fabric that was often used for military uniforms; by the 16thcentury Halifax and the surrounding Calder Valley was the largest producer of the material in England. In the final part of the manufacturing process the cloth was hung outdoors on large structures known as tenterframes and left to dry, after having been conditioned by a fulling mill. Daniel Defoe wrote a detailed <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he had been told of the gibbet's history during his visit to Halifax in Volume 3 of his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, published in 1727.|$|E

5|$|On 11 February, one {{day after}} the {{conclusion}} of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Lord Harris thought about the riot.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the Broadway {{production}} {{has led to the}} development of an auxiliary show, Behind the Emerald Curtain, created by Sean McCourt – an original Broadway production cast member who played the Witch's Father, among other roles, in addition to understudying the Wizard and Doctor Dillamond, before taking over the latter principal role – and Anthony Galde who was a long-running swing in the Broadway company from 2004 to 2012. The tour features a ninety-minute behind-the-scenes look at the props, masks, costumes and sets used in the show, and includes a question-and-answer session with the cast members. The Broadway tour is currently led by McCourt and long-running ensemble member and Glinda understudy Lindsay K. Northen. The tour also featured in the Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago sit-down productions, and were each run by different long-serving cast members of the show. The tour provides a behind the scenes look at what goes into putting on the show every day. Participants get a first hand <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it is like to be a part of the massive production that Wicked is.|$|E

25|$|Shaffer was {{inspired}} to write Equus when he heard of a crime involving a 17-year-old who blinded six horses {{in a small town}} near Suffolk. He set out to construct a fictional <b>account</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> might have caused the incident, without knowing any of the details of the crime.
