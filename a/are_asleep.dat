5|$|Pinnipeds spend {{many months}} at a time at sea, so they must sleep in the water. Scientists have {{recorded}} them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with half of their brain awake so that they can detect and escape from predators. When they <b>are</b> <b>asleep</b> on land, both sides of their brain go into sleep mode.|$|E
5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they <b>are</b> <b>asleep.</b> Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
5|$|Whitetip reef sharks hunt {{primarily}} at night, when many fishes <b>are</b> <b>asleep</b> and easily taken. After dusk, groups of sharks methodically scour the reef, often breaking off pieces of coral in their vigorous pursuit of prey. Multiple sharks may target the same prey item, covering every exit route {{from a particular}} coral head. Each shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. Unlike blacktip reef sharks and grey reef sharks, whitetip reef sharks do not become more excited when feeding in groups and {{are unlikely to be}} stirred into a feeding frenzy. Despite their nocturnal habits, whitetip reef sharks will hunt opportunistically in daytime. Off Borneo, this species gathers around reef drop-offs to feed on food brought up by the rising current. Off Hawaii, they follow Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi) and attempt to steal their catches. A whitetip reef shark can survive for six weeks without food.|$|E

25|$|Derrick Cave {{is home to}} a {{population}} of Townsend's big-eared bats. The bats are very shy so visitors rarely see them. In fact, the bats usually remain in hibernation until July, and when active they are nocturnal so they <b>are</b> <b>asleep</b> during the day when the cave is open to the public. If a bat is sighted, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife recommends that it be left undisturbed. This is particularly important when the bats are hibernating. Waking a bat from hibernation is extremely stressful, and can cause the bat to die from the sudden expenditure of energy.|$|E
25|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is highly}} {{responsive}} to olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey. Its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency {{sounds in the}} 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish. They hunt primarily at night, when many fishes <b>are</b> <b>asleep</b> and easily taken. After dusk, a group of sharks may target the same prey item, covering every exit route from a particular coral head. Each shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. They feed mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes, and goatfishes, as well as octopus, spiny lobsters, and crabs. Important predators of the whitetip reef shark include tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks.|$|E

[...] From birth to death all we ever do is think: we have one thought, we have another thought, another thought, another thought. Even when you <b>are</b> <b>asleep</b> you are having dreams, so there is never a time from birth to death when the mind isn't always active with thoughts.

500|$|The {{assertion}} that the dream was that of Mr. Porter, whose dream personality personified itself as HCE, came from the critical idea that the dreamer partially wakes during chapter III.4, in which {{he and his family}} are referred to by the name Porter. Anthony Burgess representatively summarized this conception of the [...] "dream" [...] thus: [...] "Mr. Porter and his family <b>are</b> <b>asleep</b> for the greater part of the book [...] Mr. Porter dreams hard, and we are permitted to share his dream [...] Sleeping, he becomes a remarkable mixture of guilty man, beast, and crawling thing, and he even takes on a new and dreamily appropriate name – Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Mother is {{most commonly}} psychoanalyzed as be complementary to the feminist theory. The most commonly referenced {{pertaining to the}} subject is the Barbara Creed book, The Monstrous-Feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis, which perceives Mother as being complementary to the archaic mother theme of the 1979 film. Creed cites the crew members being awoken by a figure dubbed [...] "Mother" [...] in a womb-like room, without a father figure, and with the comprehensive directive to provide life support, as being the poignant indicator to support her conclusion. Likewise, in Beyond the Stars: Locales in American popular film by Paul Loukides and Linda K. Fuller, Mother is presented as the central focus for {{the context of a}} mother ship. As the authors describe, Mother maintains an intimate connection with the crew, providing a watchful eye when they <b>are</b> <b>asleep,</b> as well as a small, womb-like computer module for direct communication about sensitive matters. Mother is voiced by Helen Horton in Alien and Lorelei King in Alien: Covenant.|$|E
500|$|The Word for World is Forest {{shares the}} theme of dreaming with the later Le Guin novel The Lathe of Heaven. Suzanne Reid stated that the novel {{examines}} the source and effect of dreams. The Athsheans teach themselves to consciously and actively control their dreams. This allows them to access their subconscious {{in a way that}} the Terrans are not able. The Athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern with a period of 120 minutes, which makes it impossible for them to adapt to the Terran eight-hour work day. Their dreaming is not restricted to times when they <b>are</b> <b>asleep,</b> with adept dreamers being able to dream while wide awake as well. [...] The visions they see while dreaming direct and shape their waking behavior, which Selver describes as [...] "balanc your sanity... on the double support, the fine balance, of reason and dream; once you have learned that, you cannot unlearn it any more than you can unlearn to think." ...|$|E

2500|$|Visitors {{can choose}} to either see and observe the Philippine tarsier in the net {{enclosure}} or in their nature habitat through the tarsier trail. As mentioned earlier, the net enclosure has a seven-foot fence where 100 Philippine tarsiers are kept for feeding, breeding and display. [...] Here, visitors can get {{up close and personal}} with the species, or take pictures, but are urged to do so quietly and not to handle them so as not to put stress on the animals who <b>are</b> <b>asleep</b> during daytime.|$|E

2500|$|Lack {{of consent}} {{is key to}} the {{definition}} of rape. [...] Consent is affirmative [...] "informed approval, indicating a freely given agreement" [...] to sexual activity. It is not necessarily expressed verbally, and may instead be overtly implied from actions, but the absence of objection does not constitute consent. Lack of consent may result from either forcible compulsion by the perpetrator or an inability to consent {{on the part of the}} victim (such as persons who <b>are</b> <b>asleep,</b> intoxicated or otherwise mentally compromised). [...] Sexual intercourse with a person below the age of consent, i.e., the age at which legal competence is established, is referred to as statutory rape.|$|E

2500|$|In Persian {{countries}} a sweet paste made {{entirely from}} germinated wheat is called Samanū (...) in Iran, Samanak (...) , (...) (...) or Sümölök (...) , which {{is prepared for}} Nowruz (Persian new year celebration) {{in a large pot}} (like a kazan). A plate or bowl of Samanu is a traditional component of the Haft sin table symbolising affluence. Traditionally, women take a special party for it during the night, and cook it from late in the evening till the daylight, singing related songs. In Tajikistan and Afghanistan they sing: Samanak dar Jūsh u mā Kafcha zanēm - Dīgarān dar Khwāb u mā Dafcha zanēm. (meaning: [...] "Samanak is boiling and we are stirring it, others <b>are</b> <b>asleep</b> and we are playing daf"). In modern times, making samanu can be a family gathering. It originally comes from the Great Persian Empire.|$|E

All four <b>are</b> <b>asleep.</b> The arch contains an altar and statues of Saint Peter, Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch. Sebastion and Roch were regarded as saints who specialised in warding off disease so their veneration was important. The people feared another epidemic and wanted it avoided. Peter holds his key, Sebastian is depicted with arrows whilst St Roch prays on his knees. On the buttress to the right is Saint Luke and his attribute the ox.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea of a}} 'dreambody' was {{generalised}} to {{the concept}} of a 'dreaming process': a potentially meaningful pattern within symptoms, dreams and other irrational or disturbing aspects of our experience. [...] Totton explains that for process oriented psychology, 'dreaming' refers to any 'extra-conscious signals through which our process communicates itself'. The signals of a 'dreaming process' go beyond nighttime dreams and body symptoms to include 'daydreams, imagery and flickers of awareness that come and go'. [...] For Process Work, 'dreaming' can be defined as 'the unconscious activity of the person, both when they <b>are</b> <b>asleep</b> and when they are awake'. Shafton comments that Mindell, along with Walter Bonime, Fritz Perls, Strephon Williams, Jeremy Taylor and Eugene Gendlin, makes the assumption that 'dreamlike symbolic processes occur in waking' and accordingly applies dreamwork techniques to aspects of conscious experience.|$|E
