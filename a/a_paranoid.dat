25|$|The equestrian director, August, is {{a brutal}} man who mistreats {{the animals in}} his care (such as the new elephant, Rosie) and the people around him, but he can also be charming and generous.

25|$|He {{was convicted}} of several murders, and {{received}} six life sentences, {{as well as the}} death sentence.

His claims of racial motivation were offset by a defense expert witness who testified in 1997 that Franklin was <b>a</b> <b>paranoid</b> schizophrenic who was not fit to stand trial.|$|E

A pivotal argument for Mollath's insanity, besides the general impression he made, was that he insisted his wife was involved in a complex system of tax evasion; the court came to call it <b>a</b> <b>paranoid</b> belief system Mollath had developed, which led him to accuse many people of being part of a conspiracy and act irrationally and aggressively, namely puncturing car tires of people in a way that could lead to accidents.|$|E
