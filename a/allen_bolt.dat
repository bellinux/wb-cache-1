5000|$|... "Laprade" [...] seatposts (newer) use {{a single}} {{vertical}} bolt (typically an <b>Allen</b> <b>bolt)</b> which when tightened pushes two rail-grabbing pieces together. The lower {{surface of the}} lower rail-grabbing piece is convex and grooved, matching a concave groved {{on the top of}} the seat post. The curve allows the up/down angle of the saddle to be adjusted when the bolt is loosened, and loosening also allows the rails to slide forward and back. Depending on the saddle angle, the vertical bolt is not perpendicular to the angle of the rails, but the grooves prevent the interface from slipping and adopting a completely horizontal angle. This angular adjustment mechanism is known as pivotal and is common on BMX bikes. Because the grooves are finer than the grooved discs in the sold-separately saddle clamp, sometimes Laprade-style posts are also marketed as [...] "microadjustable" [...] even though the adjustment is not continuous as with the Campagnolo style.|$|E
5000|$|To attach {{it to the}} bicycle's main frame, the {{seatpost}} {{is inserted}} into the seat tube, which must be of a very slightly larger diameter (or a cylindrical shim can be used). The seatpost is {{held in place by}} squeezing the top of the seat tube with a tightening ring (temporarily reducing its diameter; a vertical slit cut into the tube allows this to happen without crumpling) until the tube firmly hugs the post where it leaves the frame. A hole for a pinch bolt (also known as a [...] "binder bolt") may be built into the frame for this purpose, or a [...] "seat post clamp" [...] may be purchased separately (but must be sized to closely fit the diameter of the seat tube). Whether integrated or separate, the seat post bolt can have a simple nut, can be an <b>Allen</b> <b>bolt,</b> or can include a quick-release mechanism, with a handle that releases the clamp without tools. [...] A quick-release allows easy height adjustment of the seat, though increases the risk of seat theft unless it is also used to detach the seat when parking.|$|E
50|$|Adjustable Wheel Base on 12 mm Thru-Axle. This axle setup {{features}} on the DHExtreme-8, Europa DS (12 mm version), Europa FS, and Triton DH. The Wheelbase can be adjusted horizontally by 1 inch to effect {{the handling of the}} bike. The axle is tightened with a 9 m allen key and memory locked with two smaller horizontal <b>allen</b> <b>bolts,</b> creating a very stiff wheelbase. The disk-brake mount and derrailleur hanger make up either side of the moving section, and can therefore be replaced if damaged.|$|R
2500|$|He also {{invented the}} {{inverted}} BMX racing bicycle stem (also {{known as a}} [...] "gooseneck"). Unlike the standard [...] "quill gooseneck" [...] stem, BMX bicycles {{in need of a}} stem with a much tighter clamping force on the bars to eliminate movement forward or back. That could be caused by the more violent physical abuse racers put upon it like pulling with maximum force during racing and jumping their bicycles, these stems were four-point block clamps secured with <b>Allen</b> <b>bolts,</b> unlike the single point quill gooseneck that had a single [...] "pinchbolt" [...] configuration to clamp the bars. Most other stems of this type, like the standard gooseneck, raised the bottom level of the handlebars up, the inverted stem dropped them down. Breithaupt was heading to an NBA National in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1979 to race cruiser class a new division in BMX that at the time was made up of BMX bicycles (during this time most were converted Beach Cruisers with 26" [...] diameter wheels, built for the larger rider as opposed the standard 20" [...] vehicle). As he was fitting his handle bars onto the stem of the bicycle he noticed that it was to high for his liking and presumably it couldn't be lowered far enough down to get the feel and leverage he desired. he then removed the clamp the part that actually held fast to the handlebars, from the stem, that was inserted into the head tube and into the fork's neck. He flipped it over and reattached it. He was able then to drop the bottom of the bars another few millimeters to his liking. He later won his Cruiser class at this national using that configuration. He would then persuade [...] "Tuff Neck", a leading manufacturer of BMX bicycle parts at the time, to mass-produce the new component.|$|R
2500|$|The 1981 {{model year}} {{represented}} a radical upgrade for VAM's top performance line. An all-new [...] "rally" [...] emblem design in all-lower case letters and computer-like typography appeared on both front fenders. The Rally AMX obtained a new [...] "waved" [...] stripe design {{located on the}} front edge of the hood and fenders with an integrated [...] "AMX" [...] leyend on the right front corner. It was very discreet compared to the last year's decals while the [...] "AMX over Rally" [...] and [...] "4.6 Litros" [...] stickers were removed. The Rally GT got also discreet [...] "GT" [...] stickers for the front of the hood bulge and [...] "GT 4.6/X" [...] stickers for the right corner of the rear spoiler. The previous year's [...] "American GT" [...] side decals and [...] "GT" [...] central rear spoiler emblem were deleted. Both versions shared all-new impressive Recardo-type reclining bucket seats with adjustable headrests, all new door panels in vinyl with cloth and carpet inserts but that no longer had map pouches, AMC's barred grille design used in the Eagle models made in aluminum instead of plastic, international symbols on the instrument cluster warning lights, the high beams switch integrated to the steering column, a new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel design with six fake <b>Allen</b> <b>bolts</b> on the horn button forming a hexagon, AM/FM stereo radio with four speakers as standard equipment and higher quality dashboard woodgrain panels. Mechanically, the coolant recovery tank and fan shroud became present. The optional equipment list was vastly improved; the set of power doorlocks and windows that debuted the year before in the American (Concord) line became available in the Rally. The GT got the electric antenna while the AMX included the rear spoiler with electric trunk release, both as standard equipment. The full optional equipment list for the Rally AMX was air conditioning, automatic transmission, intermittent wipers, reading dome light, rear defroster, sports steel wheels, electric antenna, power door locks and power windows; the list of the Rally GT was restricted to the electric locks and windows only {{while the rest of the}} accessories were standard except for the unavailable automatic transmission and air conditioning.|$|R
