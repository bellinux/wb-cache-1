5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be {{cross-faded}} at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>series</b> of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{the protests}} became an armed {{rebellion}}. The first {{shots were fired}} at the Oliver Miller Homestead in present-day South Park Township, Pennsylvania, about ten miles south of Pittsburgh. As word of the rebellion spread across the frontier, <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>series</b> of loosely organized resistance measures were taken, including robbing the mail, stopping court proceedings, {{and the threat of}} an assault on Pittsburgh. One group disguised as women assaulted a tax collector, cropped his hair, coated him with tar and feathers, and stole his horse. Another group bombarded the estate of the tax collector John Neville, a friend of George Washington.|$|E

5|$|Further {{experiments}} in 1969 at Dubna and in 1970 at Berkeley demonstrated an actinide chemistry {{for the new}} element, so that by 1970 it was known that element 103 is the last actinide. In 1970, the Dubna group reported the synthesis of 255103 with half-life 20s and alpha decay energy 8.38MeV. However, {{it was not until}} 1971, when the nuclear physics team at the University of California at Berkeley successfully performed <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>series</b> of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260, that all previous results from Berkeley and Dubna were confirmed, apart from the Berkeley's group initial erroneous assignment of their first produced isotope to 257103 instead of the probably correct 258103. All final doubts were finally dispelled in 1976 and 1977 when the energies of X-rays emitted from 258103 were measured.|$|E

25|$|Founded around 1910 by Antonio María Romeu (18761955), {{this was}} for thirty years the most {{important}} charanga in Cuba.

The orchestra recorded hundreds of numbers over many years, beginning in 1915, and issued <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>series</b> of albums after 1950. It is not clear that Romeu was, as sometimes claimed, the originator of the charanga, but it is clear that his band was for many years the leading danzonera.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{a region}} where whites are a minority, until 1960 West Indies were always captained by white cricketers, though this was more social than racial discrimination. Throughout the 1950s, social theorist CLR James, the {{increasingly}} political former cricketer Learie Constantine and others called for a black captain. Constantine himself had stood in for Jackie Grant in the field against England on the 1937–38 tour, and George Headley captained the West Indies in the First Test against England in 1947–48 when the appointed, white captain, John Goddard was injured. However, no black was appointed as captain for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>series</b> until Frank Worrell was chosen to lead West Indies in their tour of Australia in 1960–61.

25|$|Since the Newtonian {{reflector}} is {{the most}} common telescope built by amateur telescope makers, large sections of the literature on the subject are devoted to fabrication of the primary mirror. The mirror has to be carefully ground, polished and figured to an extremely accurate shape, usually a paraboloid. Telescopes with high focal ratios may use spherical mirrors since the difference in the two shapes is insignificant at those ratios. The tools used to achieve this shape are surprisingly simple, consisting of a similarly sized glass tool, a series of finer abrasives, and a polishing pitch lap made from a type of tree sap. Through <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>series</b> of random strokes the mirror naturally tends to become spherical in shape. At that point, a variation in polishing strokes is typically used to create and perfect the desired paraboloidal shape.|$|E
25|$|After {{the victory}} over Japan, the 5th Army {{remained}} in the Far East, and was the most powerful army in the Far East Military District throughout the entire postwar period. After the disbandment of the 9th Mechanised Army and the 25th Army in 1957, 5th Army's composition was supplemented by <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>series</b> of divisions, including the divisions that became, after many redesignations, 277th Motor Rifle Division and 123rd Guards MRD. The 4th Missile Brigade joined the army in 1963. In 1968 the 29th Motor Rifle Division arrived from Shikhany (Saratov Oblast) at Kamen-Rybolov, Primorskiy Kray. In the 1970s and 1980s, the 81st Guards MRD and the 199th MRDs {{became part of the}} 5th Army. There were also several fortified regions attached. In 1976 the 119th Motor Rifle Division (mobilisation) was formed at Lyalichi, Primorskiy Kray, which became the 77th Tank Division (mobilisation) in January 1982.

50|$|The Phoenix Living Poets was {{a series}} of slim books of poetry {{published}} from 1960 until 1983 by Chatto and Windus Ltd.

500|$|In the 1970s {{there was}} an ongoing debate about whether multi-celled animals {{appeared}} suddenly during the Early Cambrian, in an event called the Cambrian explosion, or had arisen earlier but without leaving fossils.

Later the discovery of <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>series</b> of similar lobopod animals, some with closer resemblances to arthropods, {{and the development of}} the idea of stem groups suggested that the Early Cambrian was a time of relatively fast evolution but one that could be understood without assuming any unique evolutionary processes.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to scientific advances, the designers speculated {{on the future}} development of human society.

Reynolds said the designers don't promote a single [...] "right" [...] answer, instead giving each value choice positive and negative consequences.
