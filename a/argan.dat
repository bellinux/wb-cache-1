5|$|On 3 August, General Guglielmo Nasi led 35,000 Italian troops, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of them native fighters, across the border into British Somaliland. The invaders were organized into three columns: one on the left advancing north to the coast before swinging east to Berbera, one on the right making the opposite motion on the Burao road, and a main central column, led by Carlo de Simone, containing the bulk of his forces. The central column would force the British positions at Tug <b>Argan</b> and make straight for Berbera, effectively ending the campaign in one fell swoop. Nasi advanced quickly upon Hargeisa, forcing harrying British camel soldiers to withdraw by 5 August. After a few days of rest and rearmament, the march was resumed on 8 August. After two days of probing, de Simone reached the Tug <b>Argan</b> gap and prepared for the major assault, scheduled for 11 August. In the meantime, General A. R. Godwin-Austen arrived to take command of the enlarged British army.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Tug <b>Argan</b> was a land {{battle between}} {{forces of the}} British Empire and Italy which took place on 11–15 August 1940 in what was British Somaliland (later {{independent}} and renamed Somalia). The battle {{was part of the}} Italian conquest of British Somaliland, in which Italy successfully attempted to conquer the latter British colony, and thus is included in the larger East African Campaign of the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|With the Italian {{victory at}} Tug <b>Argan,</b> the {{position}} of British forces in Somaliland was compromised, and colonial authorities were forced to initiate a naval evacuation of the garrison form Berbera. As a result, Italy was able to quickly secure British Somaliland, which proved a propaganda coup for Italy {{despite the lack of}} strategic value to the territory.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August, Godwin-Austen {{realized}} the peril of his situation, with XV Brigade nearly {{able to cut}} him off from behind, his troops exhausted, and his artillery completely deficient and running low on ammunition, and informed General Henry Maitland Wilson, who was in command at Cairo while Wavell was absent in England, that retreat from Tug <b>Argan</b> and evacuation from British Somaliland was now a necessity. If his forces could be evacuated, perhaps 70 percent of them might be removed. Otherwise, he {{would be forced to}} fight to the death, with his entire command destroyed. Wilson agreed to Godwin-Austen's request the next day, and preparations were made to flee after dark on 15 August. During that day, Observation Hill was attacked for the final time by De Simone's forces. De Simone had decided to doggedly press his attack in the gap, in lieu of completing the flanking maneuver, and finally this proved successful. By 7:00pm XIII Brigade had seized Observation Hill, and the British retreated from it in disarray. After sundown, the defenders of the remaining hills were withdrawn, along with the Punjab troops, who departed just as II Brigade was able to make inroads through their abandoned positions. British resistance had collapsed, and as Godwin-Austen and his forces fled towards Berbera, the Italians were in control of Tug <b>Argan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and {{the fury}} of Churchill, the loss of Tug <b>Argan</b> and {{consequently}} Somaliland was not of the greatest strategic importance. Certainly it was a blow to British prestige and pride, but Somaliland was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity to station an expensive garrison there. But the impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, as well as removed any chance of a sizable strategic victory.|$|E
5|$|Italian forces entered British Somaliland from Abyssinia on 4 August 1940, {{overcame the}} {{garrison}} at Hargeisa, and advanced north-east towards the capital Berbera. The British force, including {{a platoon of}} 43 Rhodesians in the 2nd Battalion of the Black Watch, took up positions on six hills overlooking the only road towards Berbera and engaged the Italians at the Battle of Tug <b>Argan.</b> Amid heavy fighting, the Italians gradually made gains and by 14 August had almost pocketed the Commonwealth forces. The British retreated to Berbera between 15 and 17 August, the Rhodesians making up the left flank of the rearguard, and by 18 August had evacuated by sea. The Italians took the city and completed their conquest of British Somaliland a day later.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{determined}} the Tug <b>Argan</b> gap {{the best possible}} place to make a stand out of the three roadways, and also the most likely invasion route, and thus positioned {{the bulk of the}} army around it. On the British right, to the north of Tug <b>Argan,</b> were three companies of the 3/15 Punjab Regiment, set upon a group of west-facing strongpoints overlooking the rough wilderness that lay beside the road. South of them lay the gap itself, manned by a contingent of Rhodesian troops. They sat upon a line of small hills, named from north to south Black, Knobbly, Mill, Observation, and Castle Hills. These hills, positioned in a row with 2,000–2,500 yard gaps in between, housed machine-gun nests surrounded with light rings of barbed wire and served as the Rhodesians' defensive strongholds and the main defense for the British of the pass. On the British left were another group of Indian troops, located upon the aptly named 'Punjab Ridge' facing directly to the south. Unfortunately for the British, the front was too wide for the troops available, and the gaps between hills too large, leaving the defenses prone to infiltration. Also, due to the hills being in a single line, the position lacked depth. Meanwhile, De Simone, arriving {{at the site of the}} impending battle on 10 August, set his forces directly opposite the British positions. On the left, II Brigade prepared to advance through the wilderness towards the Punjab troops in the north. In the Italian center, XIV Brigade faced the Rhodesian hilltop positions within the pass, and XV Brigade looked north towards Punjab Ridge on the Italian right. Behind them were XIII Brigade and the armored vehicles.|$|E
5|$|After the British had {{departed}} Tug <b>Argan,</b> the Italians swiftly began {{to bring a}} close to their operations in Somaliland. Units of the Black Watch, 2nd Battalion King's African Rifles, and the 1/2 Punjab Regiment formed a small rearguard at Barakasan, which fought gamely into the night of 17 August to buy the main force time to evacuate. The Royal Navy {{had already begun to}} evacuate military personnel from Berbera on 16 August, operations that were not interfered with, possibly due to uncertainty about whether a peace treaty might be signed in the near future. By 19 August, all military forces, including the rearguard, the remainder of which had embarked late the previous day, had been evacuated by sea. An estimated 5,300–5,700 troops in total were evacuated to Aden. Italian forces, who had been held up by naval bombardment by HMS Ceres on 17 August, arrived in an empty Berbera on the 19th, effectively completing their conquest of British Somaliland. In total, Britain had suffered extremely light casualties, with 38 dead, 102 wounded, and 120 missing; however 10 artillery pieces had to be left behind and were captured by the Italians. In comparison, Italy paid dearly for the province, suffering 465 deaths and 1530 wounded.|$|E

25|$|On 5 August, {{the port}} of Zeila was {{occupied}} by the Italian western column (Lieutenant-General Bertoldi). Any possibility of help from French Somaliland for the British was eliminated. Small forces then proceeded south-east along the coast and occupied the village of Bulhar. The Italian central column, commanded by De Simone, faced more difficulties because of the mountainous terrain through which it advanced. The column was held up at Hargeisa by the Camel Corps, assisted by a company of the Northern Rhodesia Regiment but De Simone brought up some light tanks and by 5 August the opposing troops had fallen back. De Simone took two days to reorganise at Hargeisa and then resumed his advance through the Karrim Pass toward the Tug <b>Argan,</b> a river bed in the Assa Hills. The eastern column (Brigadier General Bertello) comprising mainly irregular troops, reached Odweina on 6 August and then headed north west toward Adadle, a village on the Tug <b>Argan.</b> Chater used the SCC, supplemented by small patrols of the Illalos (a small force of local levies normally employed on police duties) to conduct a delaying action as the other British and Commonwealth forces pulled back towards Tug <b>Argan.</b>|$|E
25|$|By 10 August, De Simone {{had closed}} {{up on the}} British {{positions}} behind the Tug <b>Argan</b> and made his preparations to attack. From 7–8 August, the British had received reinforcements of the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch. General Archibald Wavell, Commander-in-Chief Middle East Command in Cairo, had also ordered a further battalion of infantry and more artillery to Berbera but these reinforcements did not arrive in time. He also considered it appropriate to appoint a major-general to command this expanding force and on 11 August, a new commander, Godwin-Austen, reached Berbera.|$|E

By 19 August, the British and Indian battalions were evacuated to Aden.

25|$|The {{central column}} would {{establish}} a base at Hargeisa and then carry the main weight of the attack through the Mirgo Pass towards Berbera. The eastern column would move to Odweina to cover the central column's flank {{and be prepared to}} link up with it if necessary. The Italians advanced in three columns, with the western column advancing towards Zeila near the border with French Somaliland, the central column towards Hargeisa and Adadlek, the eastern column towards Odweina and Burao in the south. Lieutenant-General Carlo De Simone commanded the main central column. The SCC skirmished with the Italians as the other British and Commonwealth forces slowly retired. On 5 August, the towns of Zeila and Hargeisa were captured, the occupation of Zeila cutting off British from French Somaliland. Odweina fell the following day and the Italian central and eastern columns combined, to launch attacks against the main British positions at Tug <b>Argan.</b> On 11 August, Major-General Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen, reached Berbera to take over command.|$|E
500|$|Italian {{invasion}} {{forces were}} advancing northwards on a north-south road towards the colonial capital of Berbera through the Tug <b>Argan</b> (named after the dry riverbed, or [...] "tug," [...] running across it) {{gap in the}} Assa range of hills, when they encountered British units lying in fortified positions {{on a number of}} widely distributed hills across the gap. Italian forces, after an intense four day encounter, overcame the relatively weak British positions and were able to force the gap, with the British being forced to retreat to Berbera.|$|E

But the real Aristotle did provide biological mechanisms, {{in the form of the}} five processes of metabolism, temperature regulation, information processing, embryonic development, and inheritance that he developed. Further, he provided mechanical analogies for these theories, mentioning bellows, toy carts, the movement of water through porous pots, and even automatic puppets.|$|E
500|$|Berbera, {{the capital}} of British Somaliland and its only major city and port, was the obvious {{destination}} of any invasion. As plans took shape for the blocking of Italian passage to the city, {{it became apparent that}} the border with Ethiopia was too long and open to be defended effectively. However, the rugged Somali countryside was impassable by vehicles, meaning that the British could stage a defense on the choke points of the two roads to Berbera, from Hargeisa and Burao. The Hargeisa road, the most direct route and the main route through the country, headed through a gap in the hills at a place called Tug <b>Argan</b> for the [...] "tug," [...] or dry riverbed, that ran before the line of hills. Unfortunately for the British, the gap was flat and open, meaning that a small force could not hold out for long. Despite these difficulties, three battalions of the five and a light artillery battery were stationed in the pass, with one battalion in reserve.|$|E

By 14 August, the Italians were {{almost in a}} position to cut the road, which was the only British line of supply and retreat. On 14 August, Godwin-Austen informed Middle East Command of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug <b>Argan</b> would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force and that a withdrawal would result in 70 percent of the force being saved. On 15 August, he received orders to withdraw from British Somaliland. Late on 15 August, the Italians took Observation Hill and after dark, the defenders of Tug <b>Argan</b> commenced their withdrawal. The Black Watch, two companies of the 2nd KAR and elements of 1/2nd Punjab Regiment formed a rearguard at Barkasan on the Berbera road, about [...] behind Tug <b>Argan.</b>|$|E
2500|$|While in London {{for discussions}} with Churchill, Wavell signalled to Cairo that the {{evacuation}} of British Somaliland had not been the cause of recriminations but after more details of the Battle of Tug <b>Argan</b> arrived in London, Churchill questioned why the British had retreated and if the Italian superiority was really overwhelming {{if they had not}} exploited their advantage. Churchill complained that the defence of the Tug <b>Argan</b> Gap had been [...] "precipitately discontinued" [...] and that Godwin-Austen had exaggerated the number of British casualties. Churchill blamed the local commanders for failing adequately to conduct a fighting retreat. Wavell replied that high casualties were not a sign of good leadership and Churchill never forgave the slight and began to plan his dismissal. Aosta later wrote that the invasion plan depended on speed but supply difficulties and unexpectedly poor weather and rains blocked some roads slowed the advance. During the delay caused by the British defence of Tug <b>Argan,</b> Aosta tried to send a force of 300 volunteers by aircraft to capture Berbera by coup de main but the scheme was cancelled, because the British still occupied the only landing ground. The Italians had failed to exploit the opportunity and given the haphazard nature of the evacuation and the lack of defences, the withdrawal might have prevented.|$|E

2500|$|In 1940, British Somaliland was garrisoned by 631 {{members of}} the Somaliland Camel Corps (SCC) and a small party of police at Berbera armed only with small-arms and {{anti-tank}} rifles with 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but by mid-July, reinforcements of two infantry battalions had arrived. The British hoped that the effort of invading British Somaliland would act as a deterrent and that the French in Djibouti {{would be a more}} tempting target. The defeat in France in 1940 and the French armistices with Germany and Italy left the British in Somaliland isolated. On 3 August 1940, the Italians invaded with two colonial brigades, four cavalry squadrons, [...] tanks and L3/35 tankettes, several armoured cars, [...] batteries, pack artillery and air support. The SCC skirmished with the advancing Italians as the main British force slowly retired. On 11 August, Major-General Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen took command as reinforcements increased the British garrison to five battalions with about 4,500 British and Commonwealth troops, 75 percent being African infantry and Somali irregulars. The main British defensive position was at the Tug <b>Argan</b> Gap, which commanded the road to Berbera and on 11 August, the Battle of Tug <b>Argan</b> began. By 14 August, the British were close to being cut off and with only one battalion left in reserve and next day, Godwin-Austen received permission to withdraw from the colony. By on 18 August, most of the British and local troops had been evacuated to Aden and the Italians entered Berbera on the evening of 19 August.

2500|$|While the British {{made their}} retreat to Berbera, the Royal Navy had {{constructed}} an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials.
