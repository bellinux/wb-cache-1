5|$|USS Guam and USS Trenton began transit {{from the}} coast of Oman towards Mogadishu at 22:30 (23:30 Oman time) on 2 January. The {{commander}} of <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Group</b> Two had initially proposed a seven-ship Amphibious Task Group, composed of vessels anchored at Masirah Island (off Oman) and Dubai and including four amphibious ships so that {{the full range of}} amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation. However, intervention in Kuwait seemed imminent and the commander of naval forces at Central Command did not want to divert that many ships from the Persian Gulf, thus the decision to send two of the closest ships. Although the two vessels were selected by mid-afternoon on 2 January, the transfer of some personnel from Dubai to Masirah caused a delay of eight to ten hours. Guam and Trenton carried forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, including a detachment of CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters—the largest helicopters operated by the US military—and two squadrons of CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters.|$|E

500|$|Barbey paid a {{visit to}} Washington, D.C. in June 1944 to discuss his needs but his trip was mistimed, for the Joint Chiefs of Staff had left for Europe to observe the Invasion of Normandy and Barbey had to wait for Admiral King to return. In their discussions, King {{emphasised}} that it was his intention that MacArthur's advance would proceed no further than Mindanao. This was scuttled in September 1944 by his own admirals, who recommended a descent on Leyte. By July enough amphibious ships had arrived in SWPA to allow Barbey to divide the VII Amphibious Force. Fechteler assumed command of <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Group</b> 8, while <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Group</b> 9 was formed under Rear Admiral Arthur D. Struble. In 1945, a third group, <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Group</b> 6, was formed under Rear Admiral Forrest B. Royal. For the invasion of Leyte, MacArthur and his naval commander, Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid expected that Barbey would continue in command of the amphibious forces, but Nimitz preferred the commander of the III Amphibious Force, Vice Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson, who was senior and in Nimitz's opinion, more experienced. In the end, a compromise was reached, with both amphibious forces participating, and Kinkaid in overall command.

Group A {{consisted}} of Mobile Group 14, which contained 3rd <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Group,</b> 2nd Marine Commando, 2nd Battalion 1st Colonial Parachute Regiment, and 3rd Vietnamese Parachute Battalion. Operation Camargue {{was to be}} one of the final proving grounds for the use of French armour during the war. It was to land on the beach in line with the center of Route One. Meanwhile, Group B was to advance over land from the west of the north-east facing beach. This group consisted of Mobile Group Central Vietnam's 6th Moroccan Spahis, 2nd <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Group,</b> a tank platoon from 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment, and two infantry companies from the Quang-Tri military base. Group C was to advance from the south-west into the back of Van Trinh through the swamps, and consisted of the 9th Moroccan Tabor, 27th Vietnamese Infantry Battalion, 2nd Battalion of the 4th Moroccan Rifle Regiment, 1 Commando, a tank platoon of the Moroccan Colonials, an armoured patrol boat platoon, and an LCM platoon. Group D consisted of 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Algerian Rifles, the 7th <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Group,</b> and a commando group, and was to land at the south-east end of the beach, below Group A. These forces in total formed [...] "two amphibious forces, three land-borne groupments and one airborne force" [...] all of which was commanded by General Leblanc.

500|$|MacArthur's early ambitions for an amphibious {{operation}} against North Korea {{had to be}} shelved due to the deteriorating situation in the south, which compelled him to commit the formation earmarked for the assault, the 1st Cavalry Division, to the defence of the Pusan Perimeter, to which the Eighth Army retreated in August. MacArthur then resumed his planning for an {{amphibious operation}}, which he tentatively scheduled for 15 September 1950. Navy and Marine Corps officers like Rear Admiral James H. Doyle, the commander of <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Group</b> One, and Major General Oliver P. Smith, {{the commander of the}} 1st Marine Division, were appalled by the proposed landing beaches at Inchon, which featured huge tides, broad mudflats, narrow and treacherous channels, and high seawalls. Omar Bradley called it [...] "the worst possible place ever selected for an amphibious landing." [...] While the Inchon-Seoul area was a key communications center, the risks of the landing were daunting.
