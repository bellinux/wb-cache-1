5|$|East Anglia {{was settled}} by the Anglo-Saxons {{as early as}} around 450, earlier than many other regions. It emerged from the {{settlement}} and political consolidation of <b>Angles</b> in the approximate area of the former territory of the Iceni and the Roman civitas with its centre at Venta Icenorum, close to Caistor St Edmund. According to Bede, the East <b>Angles</b> (as well as the Middle <b>Angles,</b> the Mercians and the Northumbrians) were descended from natives of Angeln (now in modern Germany). The first reference to the East <b>Angles</b> is from around 704–713, in the Whitby Life of St Gregory.|$|E

5|$|An {{equivalent}} way of {{stating the}} same condition is that, if the <b>angles</b> are partitioned into two alternating subsets, then {{the sum of}} the <b>angles</b> in either of the two subsets is exactly 180 degrees. However, this equivalent form applies only to a crease pattern on a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form of the condition remains valid for crease patterns on conical sheets of paper with nonzero defect at the vertex.|$|E
50|$|The next {{match was}} between Kurt <b>Angle</b> and Chris Benoit for the WWE Championship. Team <b>Angle</b> (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) were ejected from ringside after interfering.

Benoit applied the Sharpshooter on <b>Angle</b> but <b>Angle</b> touched the ropes. <b>Angle</b> attempted an <b>Angle</b> Slam but Benoit countered the {{move into the}} Crippler Crossface on <b>Angle</b> but <b>Angle</b> touched the ropes. Benoit applied the Ankle Lock on <b>Angle</b> until <b>Angle</b> countered the hold into an Ankle Lock on Benoit. Benoit countered the hold into the Crippler Crossface but <b>Angle</b> countered the move into an <b>Angle</b> Slam for a near-fall. Benoit executed a Diving Headbutt for a near-fall. <b>Angle</b> performed a Super <b>Angle</b> Slam for a near-fall. Benoit applied a Crippler Crossface on <b>Angle</b> but <b>Angle</b> countered it into an Ankle Lock, forcing Benoit {{to submit to the}} hold to retain the title.|$|R

5|$|Anderson {{has stated}} that the film's camera <b>angles</b> and several shots allude to the video game's camera <b>angles,</b> such as the fight between Alice and the {{security}} guard. These include a scene near the beginning {{where there is a}} close up of Alice's eye. This is a direct reference to the title screen of the first game. In another scene, Alice awakes and hears a creepy sound, which is a reference to the plot of the first game.|$|E

5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact <b>angles.</b> The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact <b>angles</b> are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact <b>angles</b> are known as metastable states.|$|E
50|$|In {{the seventh}} match, Stone Cold Steve Austin defended the WWF Championship against Kurt <b>Angle.</b> Austin {{performed}} a Stone Cold Stunner on <b>Angle</b> for a near-fall.

2500|$|In {{the main}} event, Kurt <b>Angle</b> faced The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Championship.

50|$|The sixth match pitted Kurt <b>Angle</b> against Hollywood Hulk Hogan. <b>Angle</b> {{dominated}} most of {{the match}} by using his amateur wrestling style. Hogan used his power moves on <b>Angle,</b> but <b>Angle</b> {{with a series of}} suplexes. <b>Angle</b> delivered an <b>Angle</b> Slam for a near-fall.

5|$|Sports journalism expert Kimberly Bissell {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} camera <b>angles</b> used during the 2004 Summer Olympic Games beach volleyball games. Bissell found that 20% of the camera <b>angles</b> were focused on the women's chests, and 17% on their buttocks. Bissell theorized that the appearance of the players draws fans attention more than their actual athleticism.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{was first}} observed by English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton, and its principle – wave interference – explained by Thomas Young a century later. Young described iridescence {{as the result}} of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of thin films, combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then determines that at certain <b>angles,</b> the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other <b>angles,</b> the light interferes destructively. Different colours therefore appear at different <b>angles.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{battle at}} Catraeth {{has been seen}} as an attempt to resist the advance of the <b>Angles,</b> who had {{probably}} by then occupied the former Votadini lands of Bryneich in modern north-eastern England and made it their kingdom of Bernicia. At some time after the battle, the <b>Angles</b> absorbed the Gododdin kingdom, possibly after the fall of their capital Din Eidyn in 638, and incorporated it into the kingdom of Northumbria.|$|E
2500|$|A {{reference}} <b>angle</b> is {{the acute}} version of any <b>angle</b> determined by repeatedly subtracting or adding straight <b>angle</b> ( [...] turn, 180°, or [...] radians), {{to the results}} as necessary, until the magnitude of result is an acute <b>angle,</b> a value between 0 and [...] turn, 90°, or [...] radians. For example, an <b>angle</b> of 30 degrees has a reference <b>angle</b> of 30 degrees, and an <b>angle</b> of 150 degrees also has a reference <b>angle</b> of 30 degrees (180 – 150). An <b>angle</b> of 750 degrees has a reference <b>angle</b> of 30 degrees (750 – 720).|$|R

2500|$|In {{the main}} event, Brock Lesnar faced Kurt <b>Angle</b> for the WWE Championship, where if Kurt <b>Angle</b> was disqualified or counted out, {{he would lose}} the title. The match began with Lesnar and <b>Angle</b> wrestling back and forth, until <b>Angle</b> countered a {{shoulder}} block into a German suplex. Lesnar would then attempt an F-5 on <b>Angle</b> but <b>Angle</b> countered it into an Ankle Lock, that Lesnar was able to escape out of. As Lesnar escaped, <b>Angle</b> would hit an <b>Angle</b> Slam for a near fall. He later attempted another <b>Angle</b> Slam, however, Lesnar countered into an F-5. Instead of covering <b>Angle,</b> Lesnar {{climbed to the top}} rope and botched a Shooting Star Press on <b>Angle,</b> which <b>Angle</b> covered for by pinning Lesnar for a near-fall. After Lesnar kicked out, <b>Angle</b> picked up Lesnar only to be hit with a third [...] F-5, Lesnar then successfully pinned <b>Angle,</b> winning the match and the WWE Title. After the match, <b>Angle</b> and Lesnar shook hands and embraced closing the show.|$|R

5|$|After {{the end of}} Roman rule in Britain, {{the region}} now known as East Anglia was settled by a North Germanic group known as the <b>Angles,</b> {{although}} {{there is evidence of}} early settlement of the region by a minority of other peoples, for instance the Swabians, who settled in the area around the modern town of Swaffham. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the territories of southern Britain conquered by the <b>Angles,</b> Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. The ruling dynasty of East Anglia was the Wuffingas, named from Wuffa, an early king. The first king known to have ruled is Rædwald, whose reign spanned {{a quarter of a century}} from about 599.|$|E

50|$|In {{spur gears}} and {{straight}} bevel gears, tooth profiles are considered {{only in a}} transverse plane, and the general terms profile <b>angle</b> and pressure <b>angle</b> are customarily used rather than transverse profile <b>angle</b> and transverse pressure <b>angle.</b> In helical teeth, the profiles may be considered in different planes, and in specifications {{it is essential to}} use terms that indicate the direction of the plane in which the profile <b>angle</b> or the pressure <b>angle</b> lies, such as transverse profile <b>angle,</b> normal pressure <b>angle,</b> axial profile <b>angle.</b>|$|R
