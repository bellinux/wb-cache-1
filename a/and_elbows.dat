Football was a sport that had degenerated into dangerous tactics such as: the flying wedge, punching, kicking, piling-on, <b>and</b> <b>elbows</b> to the face. Almost any violent behavior was allowed. Fatalities and injuries mounted during the 1905 season.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{competed in}} his {{preliminary}} round matchup against Aaron Wilkinson {{in the third}} episode. After some early striking exchanges in the first round, Wilkinson {{was able to take}} Johnson down and utilise ground-and-pound punches <b>and</b> <b>elbows.</b> In the second round, Johnson landed an early superman punch, as well as a takedown. After takedowns were achieved by both men, Johnson stuffed a final attempt and took the second round on the judges scorecards. In the sudden victory round, Johnson attacked quickly, which allowed him to end the fight via a rear naked choke.|$|E
5|$|Trauma, {{rather than}} {{avascular}} necrosis, {{is thought to}} cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma {{is thought to be}} the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles <b>and</b> <b>elbows).</b>|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Forty-eight {{young adult}} males were ranked {{on the basis}} of mean {{hand-grip}} strength scores and the middle one-third, the medium strength range, were chosen as subjects. These sixteen subjects were given 30 serial trials in each of four tests; knee flexion, knee extension, <b>elbow</b> flexion, <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> extension. Each trial consisted of a contraction period of three seconds followed by an intertrial rest interval of 10 seconds. Factorial analysis of variance of reciprocal strength decrement index scores suggested that: a) a significant difference existed between responses of 1) knee <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> extensor muscle groups, 2) knee extensors <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> flexors 3) flexors and extensors of the knee and 4) flexors and extensors of the elbow; b) no significant difference existed between responses of 1) knee <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> flexors, <b>and</b> 2) knee flexors <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> extensors, <b>and</b> c) when considered by trial intervals, no significant difference existed between responses of 1) knee flexors and extensors, <b>and</b> 2) <b>elbow</b> flexors <b>and</b> extensors...|$|R

5|$|A {{vignette}} in the two-part series Divided We Stand {{explored the}} after-effects of Anole's numerous traumatic experiences at the Xavier Institute during {{his return to}} his hometown. Northstar, now rehabilitated, is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole, who goes into hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to posttraumatic stress disorder from his experiences at the Xavier Institute. Northstar discovers Anole at his tree house, unhappy to see his former mentor. At first, Northstar makes jokes, thinking Anole is having a problem with fitting in as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Anole explains that his town accepts him for {{who he is and}} that his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for providing the students under their care with a poor education, stealing their innocence by constantly exposing them to danger, and then throwing them away by disbanding. Planning to run away, Anole leaves a note for his parents at the tree house <b>and</b> <b>elbows</b> Northstar in the face—similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past—and tells him to tell all of the former New X-Men not to come looking for him.|$|E

40|$|Obstetrical {{brachial plexus}} palsy {{invariably}} involves the upper roots. The {{natural history of}} the injury shows that if the condition is left untreated, spontaneous reinnervation that occurs in a variable degree in these patients leaves characteristic deformities of the shoulder <b>and</b> <b>elbow.</b> Common sequelae are the internal rotation and adduction deformity of the shoulder, <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> flexion contractures. Early microsurgical reconstruction of the affected plexus leads to more rewarding overall function of the shoulder <b>and</b> <b>elbow,</b> but residual deformities might appear again, {{similar to the ones}} noticed in untreated cases, that are even less serious.

25|$|Dinosaurs' limbs were erect {{and held}} under their bodies, rather than {{sprawling}} {{out to the}} sides like those of lizards and newts.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to: (i) determine the acceleration response of the forearm at the wrist and elbow; (ii) determine the efficacy of wrist guards by measuring the impact outcome at the wrist <b>and</b> <b>elbow,</b> and; (iii) determine the effects of muscle activation <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> angles on the wrist <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> acceleration characteristics. A seated human pendulum was designed to simulate a forward fall and produce an impact to the hands of 28 subjects. Two surface accelerometers measured the wrist <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> acceleration characteristics in response to four muscle activation levels two <b>elbow</b> angles <b>and</b> a wrist guard. The results suggest that wrist guards are capable of absorbing or redirecting the initial impact force. Furthermore, the increase in muscle activation level <b>and</b> the natural <b>elbow</b> angle, disabled the segments ability to attenuate the shock wave initiated at the hand as measured by the acceleration response at the elbow...|$|R

25|$|For {{the lateral}} (horizontal) canal, a {{separate}} maneuver {{has been used}} for productive results. It is unusual for the lateral canal to respond to the canalith repositioning procedure used for the posterior canal BPPV. Treatment is therefore geared towards moving the canalith from the lateral canal into the vestibule. The roll maneuver or its variations are used, and involve rolling the patient 360 degrees in a series of steps to reposition the particles. This maneuver is generally performed by a trained clinician who begins seated {{at the head of the}} examination table with the patient supine There are four stages, each a minute apart, and at the third position the horizontal canal is oriented in a vertical position with the patient's neck flexed and on forearm <b>and</b> <b>elbows.</b> When all four stages are completed, the head roll test is repeated, and if negative, treatment ceases.|$|E
