5|$|One of {{the first}} modern {{histories}} of the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> {{in contrast to a}} history of an individual Arab country was composed by Darwaza in the late 1920s under the title Lessons of Arab History: From Antiquity to Present Times. In the book, Darwaza begins by describing the origins of the Semitic peoples, the rise of Islam, the end of Arab rule in the Middle East by Turkic groups, and the foreign rule over the Arabs by Western powers. The book was intended {{to be used as a}} textbook in primary and secondary schools throughout the British Mandates of Palestine and later Iraq, hence its simplified and direct language. Nonetheless, it played a pioneering role in the development of pan-Arabism.|$|E
5|$|After resigning {{from the}} AHC, Darwaza {{spent the rest}} of his life in the modern state of Syria where he left {{politics}} to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930s and 1940s, he did not have any of his works published until the 1960s. As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and Egypt forming the short-lived United Arab Republic. After Egypt adopted its 1956 constitution declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation,</b> Darwaza concluded that Egypt and Syria were in a position to unite. When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the American, Soviet, and Indian models, but did not recommend any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between Egypt and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius' {{understanding}} of the Arab peoples is informed by his reading of the Bible and {{his knowledge of the}} history of imperial Rome. He {{does not appear to have}} personally known any Arabs. In his Chronicon, all the Arabs that appear—save for one reference to Ishmael—figure in the political history of the first three centuries of the Christian era. To Eusebius, the Saracens of the 4th century are direct-line descendants of the biblical Ishmaelites, descendants of the handmaid, Hagar, and the patriarch, Abraham. They are thus outcasts, beyond God's Covenant with the favored son of Abraham, Isaac. The twin images of the Ishmaelite and the Saracen—outcasts and latrones, raiders of the frontiers—reinforce each other and give Eusebius' portrait of the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> an unhappy color. He may have been reluctant to associate the first Christian emperor with a people of such unfortunate ancestry.|$|E

25|$|Since {{colonialism}} is, in all {{its forms}} and manifestations, incompatible with the dignity and paramount aims of the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation,</b> the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> rejects it and will resist it with all the means at its disposal.|$|E
25|$|Al-Arsuzi's central {{thought was}} the {{unification}} of the <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation.</b> He believed that the <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation</b> could trace its roots to the pre-Islamic and early Islamic period of Arab history. The historical link to an <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation</b> {{was more important to}} al-Arsuzi than it was to other Arab nationalists and Ba'athists. The only way to create a new <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation</b> in the Modern Age was to reestablish a link between the Arab people of the past and those of the present through language—the only true remnant of the old Arab identity. In short, language was the key to regain what had been lost (the <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation)</b> and reinvigorate the Arab identity. Al-Arsuzi believed that the Arabs lost their common identity when they allowed non–Arabs to participate in government. The result was that several laws had non-Arab characteristics—these laws, and other changes brought by non-Arabs, weakened Arab identity.|$|E

25|$|The US had the air assets {{necessary}} {{to enforce a}} no-fly zone, but was cautious about supporting such an action prior to obtaining a legal basis for violating Libya's sovereignty.

25|$|Throughout the Mandatory period, some Arab {{residents}} of Palestine preferred a future {{as part of}} a broader <b>Arab</b> <b>nation,</b> usually concretized either as a nation of Greater Syria (to include what are now Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza,) or a unified Arab state including what are now Jordan, Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.|$|E

25|$|Assad de-radicalised the Ba'ath {{government}} when he {{took power}} by giving more space to private property and by strengthening the country's foreign relations with countries which his predecessor had deemed reactionary. He sided with the Soviet Union during the Cold War in turn for support against Israel, and, while he had forsaken the pan-Arab concept of unifying the Arab world into one <b>Arab</b> <b>nation,</b> he sought to make Syria the defender of Arab interests against Israel.|$|E
25|$|Al-Arsuzi's {{work and}} thought is almost unknown and barely {{mentioned}} in Western scholarship on Arab nationalism. When {{he is actually}} mentioned in a text, it is predominantly on his irredentist views of the unified <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation.</b> Although his collected works have been published since the mid-1970s, al-Arsuzi's work on the Arabic language, which is central to al-Arsuzi's nationalist thought, are rarely mentioned at all. The study of al-Arsuzi's ideas in Arabic scholarship also lacking. Academic Yasir Suleiman gives the principal reason for this as the similarity of al-Arsuzi's works to those of Sati' al-Husri, a contemporary. Suleiman goes on to explain Al-Arsuzi's eclipsed legacy as {{the combination of a}} number of factors: firstly, in contrast to al-Husri's idea of language, al-Arsuzi's theory is self-defeating because it excluded other theories instead of including them. Secondly, his work was written with an elitist slant, rather than the populist one which al-Husri managed to convey. Thirdly, and in contrast to al-Husri's work, al-Arsuzi's work seemed old-fashioned, due to his use of old words and historical texts; moreover, while al-Arsuzi wrote about the symbolic need of an <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation,</b> al-Hustri wrote about the practical role of an Arab Nation—al-Arsuzi was obscure where al-Husri was transparent.|$|E
25|$|Al-Arsuzi's {{theories}} about society, language and nationalism, which are collectively part of Ba'athist thought, hold that the <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation</b> will be unified when the Arab people reestablish the Arab identity {{they have lost}} over the past 1000 years. The key to Arab unification, according to al-Arsuzi, is through language. In contrast to the Latin language, al-Arsuzi argued, Arabic was far less arbitrary and far more intuitive. Despite his contributions to Ba'athist thought, al-Arsuzi is barely mentioned in Western or Arab scholarship. This omission {{may be linked to}} the fact that Sati' al-Husri, a contemporary Arab nationalist, had many of the same ideas as al-Arsuzi but was better able to articulate them.|$|E

25|$|The Mufti, Hajj Amin al-Husseini and his {{supporters}} directed a Jihad against any person who did not obey the Mufti. Their national struggle was a religious holy war, and the incarnation of both the Palestinian <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> and Islam was Hajj Amin al-Husseini. Anyone who rejected his leadership was a heretic and his life was forfeit. After the Peel report publication, the murders of Arabs leaders who opposed the Mufti were accelerated. Pressed by the assassination campaign pursued by the rebels {{at the behest of}} the Husseini leadership, the opposition had a security cooperation with the Jews. The flight of wealthy Arabs, which occurred during the revolt, was also replicated in 1947–49.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, the Prime Minister Habib Bourguiba (Habib Abu Ruqaiba) {{abolished}} the monarchy and firmly established his Neo Destour (New Constitution) party. The regime sought {{to run a}} strictly structured regime with efficient and equitable state operations, but not democratic-style politics. Also terminated was the bey, a quasi-monarchist institution dating back to Ottoman rule. Then Bourguiba commenced to dominate {{the country for the}} next 31 years, governing with thoughtful programs yielding stability and economic progress, repressing Islamic fundamentalism, and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other <b>Arab</b> <b>nation.</b> The vision at Bourguiba offered was of a Tunisian republic. The political culture would be secular, populist, and imbued with a kind of French rationalist vision of the state at was buoyant, touched with élan, Napoleonic in spirit.

25|$|In theory, the National Command of {{the party}} is the {{embryonic}} government for the entire <b>Arab</b> <b>nation.</b> The body comprises 21 members, half of whom are Syrian. In practice, the Syrian Regional Command is the more powerful institution inside the party. The Syrian Regional Command is the real political leadership in Syria; {{the power of the}} National Command has become more symbolic than real. A seat in National Command has become a sinecure, an honorary post given to Syrian politicians as they retire from active political life. Hafez al-Assad rarely had time to attend National Command meetings. Instead, he appointed Vice President for Party Affairs Zuhayr Mashariqa or Abd al-Halim Khaddam to represent him at National Command meetings. In theory, the National Command could conduct proselytism and form new Regional Commands across the Arab world and support weaker Regional Commands, but Syrian policymakers have curtailed that capacity.|$|E

Habib Bourguiba has been compared to Ataturk (Mustafa Kemal) of Turkey, as a unique national modernizing leader.

500|$|The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party slogan [...] "Unity, liberty, socialism" [...] {{is the key}} {{tenet of}} Aflaq's and Ba'athist thought. Unity meant the {{unification}} of the Arab people into one nation, the <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation.</b> The creation of an <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation</b> would have direct implications on Arab development. The establishment of this new state would lead to an Arab Ba'ath (literally meaning [...] "Renaissance"). The Arab nations of his time could only progressively [...] "decline" [...] if not unified; these nations had various ailments – [...] "feudalism, sectarianism, regionalism, intellectual reactionism". The only way to [...] "cure" [...] the Arab nations was, according to Aflaq, through a revolutionary movement.

500|$|Rashid Khalidi states about Darwaza, [...] "Moved {{as he was}} by {{the civilization}} of Arabs, he evoked a distant Arab past. For obvious reasons Islam was central to that past.

In other words, culture, language, and history not religious solidarity were posited as the glue that was to hold the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> together." [...] According to Khalidi, Darwaza contributed to Arab nationalism in the practical and intellectual domains greatly.|$|E
