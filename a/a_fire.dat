50|$|Strikers are {{basically}} spring-loaded firing pins, generally of a one- or two-piece construction. In the one-piece striker, the striker {{is turned on}} a lathe out of a round bar of metal, much larger in diameter than <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> pin, to provide the mass required to detonate the primer. Two-piece strikers generally consist of <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> pin attached to a heavier rear section—in essence a hammer attached {{to the base of}} <b>a</b> <b>firing</b> pin. Two-piece strikers are commonly found on bolt-action rifles, while single-piece strikers are found on pistols, such as the Glock.|$|R

5|$|According to the {{official}} investigation conducted by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), the crash {{was caused by a}} metallic strip that fell from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off minutes earlier. This fragment punctured a tyre on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to <b>a</b> <b>fire.</b> The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed.

5|$|Catch <b>a</b> <b>Fire</b> is a 1973 album by Bob Marley and the Wailers. It {{was their}} first album {{released}} by Island Records. After touring and recording in the United Kingdom with Johnny Nash, Nash's departure to the United States left the band without enough money to return home; they approached producer Chris Blackwell, who agreed to advance the Wailers money for an album and paid their fares back to Jamaica, where they recorded Catch <b>a</b> <b>Fire.</b> The album features nine songs, two of which were written and composed by Peter Tosh and the remaining seven of which were written and composed by Bob Marley. After Marley's return to London to present the tapes to Blackwell, the producer reworked the tracks with contributions by Muscle Shoals session musician Wayne Perkins, who played guitar on two overdubbed tracks.|$|E
