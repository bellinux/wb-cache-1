Since <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> <b>seaweeds</b> grow much faster than corals they can occupy spaces where corals could have settled. They can outgrow and thus outcompete corals on bare surfaces. In the absence of plant-eating fish, seaweeds deprive corals of sunlight. They can also physically damage corals with scrapes.|$|E

30|$|The marine {{environment}} {{is believed to}} be an incomparable reservoir of bioactive natural products, many of which exhibited structural features that have not been found in terrestrial plants [5]. In {{marine environment}} algae are of two types, microalgae and macroalgae [6].

The Chinese used <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> <b>seaweeds</b> for medicinal purposes as early as 300 [*]BC [8]. The presence of reactive antioxidants (ascorbate and glutathione) along with carotenoides (α- and β-carotene, fucoxanthin, astaxanthin), mycosporine-like amino acids (mycosporine-glycine) and catechins (e.g., catechin, epigallocatechin), gallate, phlorotannins (e.g., phloroglucinol), eckol and tocopherols was reported in seaweeds [9].|$|E
40|$|The use {{of algae}} to capture carbon dioxide {{as a method}} for {{greenhouse}} gas mitigation is discussed. A {{small fraction of the}} sunlight energy that bathes Earth is captured by photosynthesis and drives most living systems. Life on Earth is carbon-based and the energy is used to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into biological material (biomass), indeed fossil fuels that we consume today are a legacy of mostly algal photosynthesis. Algae {{can be thought of as}} marine and freshwater plants that have higher photosynthetic efficiencies than terrestrial plants and are more efficient capturing carbon (Box 1). They have other favourable characteristics for this purpose. In the context of New Zealand energy strategy and policy I discuss progress in growing <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> <b>seaweeds</b> with emphasis on their application for exhaust flue carbon recycling for possible generation of useful biomass.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to test the use and applicability of the Unibest CL+ and TC models for the White Lagoon case. The White Lagoon is a small bay near Balchik, Bulgaria, that is characterised by two T-groynes and a rocky bottom nearshore. A local hotel would like the present beach to be enlarged to accommodate for more guests. In addition, due to bad circulation <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> <b>seaweeds</b> flourish in the tourist season. Different data are available, including results from a bathymetric survey, wind data, offshore wave data, sediment sieve curves and some preliminary research. Relevant physical processes are identified, such as wave transformation due to decreasing water depth and wave-induced currents and sediment transport. It is expected that different wave conditions cause widely varying processes. Due to limited breaker depth under normal wave conditions, there will be no longshore sediment transport offshore from the groynes, whereas under storm conditions, longshore transport is expected offshore from the groynes and cross-shore transport from the zone between the groynes to the offshore zone. Unibest CL+ is a single line coastline model that assumes an invariant bottom profile. Unibest CL+ is therefore incapable of modelling cross-shore dynamics, for which Unibest TC is used. For a number of reasons, it is not possible to model the entire area in Unibest CL+ and as a result the model area is limited to the area between the groynes, where diffracted waves are used as wave input. Unibest TC is used to model cross-shore dynamics for a profile between the groynes. Many problems have been encountered when applying the models. The most important problem is the lack of good calibration data. Furthermore it is expected that both models, which have been designed for sandy coasts, are very limited in their applicability to the rocky coast with little available sand at White Lagoon. It is recommended for the follow-up of this study that better calibration data is collected by measuring wave properties throughout the surf zone, with according bottom changes. In addition, more accurate wave scenarios are needed, especially for the CL+ model, either from measurements or a number of SWAN runs. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} in functional food, both freshwater and marine algal products with their possible promotional health effects, increases also in regions where algae are considered as rather exotic food. Increased attention about algae as an abundant source of many nutrients and dietary fiber from the nutrition point of view, {{as well as}} from the scientific approaches to explore new nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals, is based on the presence of many bioactive compounds including polysaccharides extracted from algal matter. Diverse chemical composition of dietary fiber polysaccharides is responsible for their different physicochemical properties, such as their ability to be fermented by the human colonic microbiota resulted in health benefit effects. Fundamental seaweed polysaccharides are presented by alginates, agars, carrageenans, ulvanes, and fucoidans, which are widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industry and also in other branches of industry. Moreover, freshwater <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> <b>seaweed</b> polysaccharides have emerged as an important source of bioactive natural compounds which are responsible for their possible physiological effects. Especially, sulfate polysaccharides exhibit immunomodulatory, antitumor, antithrombotic, anticoagulant, anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities including anti-HIV infection, herpes, and hepatitis viruses. Generally, biological activity of sulfate polysaccharides is related to their different composition and mainly to the extent of the sulfation of their molecules.

The cost of one kilogram can reach €500 (US $322 per pound), but the potatoes are normally sold for around €70 per kilo (US $45 per pound). The cost is attributed to the fact that this type of potato is almost extinct because it must be harvested by hand. The potato fields also require fertilization by seaweed in a climate shaped by the nearby sea. The presence of <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> <b>seaweed</b> in the soil is responsible for the potato's earthy and salty flavor.

30|$|Since the {{introduction}} of turbine powered aircraft approximately 70  years ago, the aviation industry {{has grown from a}} novelty to an essential need [1]. According to Schäfer [2], air transportation currently accounts for approximately 10 % of the passenger kilometres travelled by all motorised modes, and for nearly 40 % of the interregional transport of goods by value. The aviation industry consequently produces 700  m tonnes of CO 2 eq annually, which accounts for approximately 12 % of global transportation emissions. Environmentally friendly (low sulphur and aromatic content) fuels are hence desired; these consist primarily of n- and iso-paraffins, as well as cycloparaffins, as they produce less emissions [3]. Furthermore, conventional crude oil derived jet fuel is also becoming more expensive due to volatile markets [4]. The aforementioned environmental and cost factors, in combination with aspects such as energy security and the continued availability of crude oil, have placed renewed focus on the development of alternative/synthetic jet fuels by industry role players. These synthetic jet fuels are produced from biomass resources such as fermentation sugars, lignocellulosic feedstocks, triglyceride oils, <b>algae,</b> <b>and</b> <b>seaweed</b> [5].|$|R

40|$|Seaweed is a known {{potential}} carbon-dioxide (CO 2) neutral {{source of}} second generation biofuels. When seaweed grows it absorbs CO 2 {{from the atmosphere}} and this CO 2 is released back to the atmosphere during combustion. What makes <b>seaweed,</b> <b>and</b> in particular micro algae, so promising as a fuel source is their growth rates and high lipid (oil) content. Algae are among the fastest-growing plants in the world. Energy is stored inside the cell as lipids and carbohydrates, and can be converted into fuels such as biodiesel (in the presence of oils) and ethanol (in the presence of carbohydrates). Its high protein content implies that waste from the feedstock conversion process may yield a saleable waste stream as well. The level {{of interest in the}} use of algae as a source of biofuels (primarily ethanol and biodiesel but also methane and hydrogen) is rising globally. Several factors appear to account for this. Firstly, despite earlier predictions of stability in world oil prices, such non-renewable hydrocarbon source fuels continue to spiral upwards (having closed at $ 100 per barrel during Feb. 2008 for the first time) and there is a heightened awareness about the contribution of fossil fuels emissions to rapid climate changes. In this context, algae-based biofuels offer potential solutions since they are known to be a CO 2 sorbent and their harvesting may not have a negative CO 2 balance due to loss of CO 2 absorbing landmass which is the current topic of debate about first generation biofuels. The Marine Institute of Ireland has experienced a rise in interest in <b>seaweed</b> <b>and</b> <b>algae</b> as a potential feedstock for production of biofuels, reflected by requests for data concerning the properties <b>and</b> composition of <b>algae</b> <b>and</b> <b>seaweed,</b> from both the research and industrial communities over the past several months.
