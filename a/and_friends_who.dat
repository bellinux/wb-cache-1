5|$|Emigration {{of young}} people {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks of family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E
5|$|Every spring, the Institute holds a ceremony, {{known as}} When the Whistle Blows, to honor students, staff, and faculty who {{died during the}} {{previous}} year. The Georgia Tech Whistle is blown once for each person who died, and once more to salute Georgia Tech alumni <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> may also have died. A procession of the military escort, led by the Ramblin' Wreck, leads up to the ceremony, during which the Wreck is parked next to the speaker's stage.|$|E
5|$|At 2pm {{on the day}} of announcement, a {{crowd of}} about 100 journalists, supporters, <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> had {{gathered}} outside the main entrance to the Beijing housing estate where the Lius resided were denied entry. The South China Morning Post reported that policemen stationed inside their apartment {{at the time of the}} announcement prevented Liu Xia from meeting with journalists and other well-wishers. It was not immediately clear whether Liu Xiaobo was aware of the award. By that time, Liu Xia said she had been told she would be taken to Liaoning to see her husband in prison. Meetings and gatherings to celebrate in several cities were prevented or abruptly broken up by police; one such celebration dinner in Beijing, attended by 20 people, was broken up by police, and the attendees were detained.|$|E

5|$|During {{his final}} months in office, Patton drew {{criticism}} for abusing his patronage power. Critics charged {{that he had}} appointed several of his family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> were in non-merit system jobs to merit system positions, increasing their chances of being retained when a new administration took over. These charges were particularly damaging because, earlier in the year, the General Assembly had ordered Patton to cut 800 non-merit positions to help balance the budget. The Lexington Herald-Leader opined that these charges were more serious {{than those of the}} Conner affair. Patton maintained that his friends had followed proper personnel protocol in applying for and securing merit positions.|$|E

25|$|Until recently, {{there was}} no {{telephone}} system in Basankusu.

The signal stops as you leave Basankusu.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} disorders, having a support {{structure}} of family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> understand the condition can help increase {{the rate of}} recovery. During an attack, {{it is not uncommon}} for the sufferer to develop irrational, immediate fear, which can often be dispelled by a supporter who is familiar with the condition. For more serious or active treatment, there are support groups for anxiety sufferers which can help people understand and deal with the disorder.|$|E

The PCMS, established in 1986, puts on concerts by internationally renowned performers as well as local ensembles like 1807 <b>and</b> <b>Friends,</b> <b>who</b> have been prominent local performers since 1981.|$|E
25|$|A {{substantial}} {{percentage of}} the US homeless population are individuals who are chronically unemployed or have difficulty managing their lives effectively due to prolonged and severe drug and/or alcohol abuse. Substance abuse can cause homelessness from behavioral patterns associated with addiction that alienate an addicted individual's family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> could otherwise provide support during difficult economic times. Increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions {{in the housing market}} that push rent burdens higher, making housing unaffordable. Dr. Paul Koegel of RAND Corporation, a seminal researcher in first generation homelessness studies and beyond, divided the causes of homelessness into structural aspects and then individual vulnerabilities.|$|E
25|$|Yom Hazikaron, Israel's day {{of remembrance}} for fallen soldiers, is {{observed}} on the 4th {{day of the}} month of Iyar of the Hebrew calendar, {{the day before the}} celebration of Independence Day. Memorial services are held in the presence of Israel's top military personnel. A two-minute siren is heard at 11:00, which marks the opening of the official military memorial ceremonies and private remembrance gatherings at each cemetery where soldiers are buried. Many Israelis visit the graves of family members <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> were killed in action. On the evening before the remembrance day all shops, restaurants and entertainment places must close gates to the public no later than 7 P.M. (the same routine and law applies to the day of remembrance of the Holocaust which takes place a week earlier).|$|E

25|$|At school, {{as well as}} in church, Francisco's claimed paranormal power {{constantly}} {{would put}} him into trouble. Once, while in his fourth year of primary school, he claimed to have seen a man who had dictated all his school essays, but no one seemed to have given him any credits; and not even the teacher seemed to have cared about it. One of his memorial school compositions on the centenary of the independence of Brazil won an honorable mention in a state contest. In 1922 he faced skepticism from colleagues <b>and</b> <b>friends,</b> <b>who</b> accused him of plagiarism, such accusation lasted all his life. Challenged to prove his gifts, Francisco was submitted to the challenge of improvising an essay (with the help of a spirit) about sand grain, the topic was chosen at that very moment, in which, he succeeded.|$|E
25|$|While {{emigration}} {{began to}} tail off in England and Wales after the First World War, it continued apace in Scotland, with 400,000 Scots, ten per {{cent of the}} population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks of family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to retrace their paths. When the Great Depression hit in the 1930s there were no easily available jobs in the US and Canada and emigration fell to less than 50,000 a year, bringing to an end the period of mass migrations that had opened in the mid-18th century.|$|E
25|$|The defence {{then called}} various {{witnesses}} {{in an attempt}} to corroborate Einem's story. The witnesses included colleagues <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> testified to him being unwell and at home {{during the first week of}} Richard Kelvin's captivity. Also testifying for the defence was the bushwalker, who while walking his dogs through the airstrip had discovered Kelvin's body on 24 July. The purchaser of Einem's Ford Falcon detailed the condition of the car, and the relative who hosted the birthday party on 10 July stated that Einem and his mother had arrived there at 5:30pm and left at 10:30pm. Photographs of Einem at the party were also tendered to the court. Finally, the defence called Einem's mother to testify about her son's activities over the weekend upon which Richard Kelvin was kidnapped. Under cross-examination, the prosecution were able to show inconsistencies in her current testimony compared to her earlier statements to police about Einem's whereabouts on the weekend of 4–5 June, which weakened the defence case considerably as this highlighted Einem's change the previous February of his account of what happened on the night of 5 June 1983.|$|E

500|$|Through the Scientology {{practice}} of [...] "disconnection", Christman's {{husband and the}} majority of her acquaintances <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> were Scientologists {{at the time of her}} exit from the group were excommunicated from her and cut off contact. Christman recounted how after leaving the organization, the Church of Scientology attempted to damage her reputation through a policy referred to as [...] "dead agenting". According to Christman, the Scientology organization publicized inaccurate information about her online, tried to get her removed from her position of employment, and opened a lawsuit related to her protesting against the group on church property. Then Scientology-spokesperson, Mike Rinder, called her a [...] "wacko" [...] and rejected her assertions as [...] "absolute bullshit".|$|E
500|$|In 1973, FDR's son Elliott {{published}} An Untold Story: The Roosevelts of Hyde Park, {{in which}} he recalled seeing LeHand in his father's lap and alleged that she [...] "shared a familiar life in all its aspects with father". His eldest brother Jimmy disagreed, arguing that FDR's illness had made sexual function too {{difficult for him to}} have a physical affair. [...] "I suppose you could say they came to love one another", he wrote, [...] "but it was not a physical love." [...] Kathryn Smith, the author of the only biography of LeHand, could come to no conclusion, but wrote, [...] "As far as evidence goes, {{there is not a single}} written account of anyone seeing them in a compromising position, despite the hundreds of Secret Service agents, staff members, political cronies, family members <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> traipsed through FDR's bedrooms—which he used as an auxiliary office—during their twenty-one years together." [...] She quotes LeHand's great-niece, Jane Scarbrough, who said, [...] "We have no reason to believe they did , but we don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E
