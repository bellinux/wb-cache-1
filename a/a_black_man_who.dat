5|$|After {{rendering}} non-combat {{service in}} the Spanish–American War, Morrow graduated from the University of Cincinnati Law School in 1902 and opened his practice in Lexington, Kentucky. He {{made a name for}} himself almost immediately by securing the acquittal of <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had been charged with murder based on an extorted confession and perjured testimony.

In 1915, he ran for governor against his good friend, Augustus O. Stanley. Stanley won the election by 471 votes, making the 1915 contest the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history.|$|E

This danger is averted when Scout, Jem, and Dill shame the mob into dispersing by forcing them to view the situation from Atticus' and Tom's perspective.|$|E
500|$|On {{the return}} of the second parley flag, Eyre {{launched}} a full-scale assault upon the fort and its roughly 150 defenders. [...] Stephen Hempstead, a sergeant in Shapley's Company, recounted, [...] "When the answer to their demand had been returned… the enemy were soon in motion, and marched with great rapidity, in a solid column… they rushed furiously and simultaneously to the assault of the southwest bastion and the opposite sides." [...] As the British neared the ditch, they were met by a bombardment of grapeshot that killed and wounded many. [...] This briefly scattered them, but they reformed into two units. [...] Eyre led one force against the southwest bastion, where American fire repulsed the assault, seriously wounding Eyre and several of his officers. (New London historian Frances Manwaring Caulkins asserted that Eyre was mortally wounded, while Benedict Arnold reported that Eyre survived.) [...] Major William Montgomery led the second party to an abandoned redoubt just east of the fort. [...] From there, they moved across the ditch and assaulted the ramparts. [...] This unit gained the bastion against fierce resistance, but Montgomery was killed by the thrust of a 10-foot pike from Jordan Freeman, <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had previously been a slave in service to Colonel Ledyard. [...] Montgomery's men were finally able to open a gate from inside, and the British force poured into the fort.

In 1892, {{a police officer in}} Port Jervis, New York, tried to stop the lynching of <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had been wrongfully accused of assaulting a white woman. The mob responded by putting the noose around the officer's neck as a way of scaring him, and completed killing the other man.

2500|$|In Mormon {{folklore}} — a second-hand account relates that {{an early}} Mormon leader, David W.

Kimball's The Miracle of Forgiveness, a popular book within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This widespread Mormon belief is further emphasized by an account from Salt Lake City in 1963 which stated that [...] "One superstition is based on the old Mormon belief that Cain is <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> wanders the earth begging people to kill him and take his curse upon themselves (M, 24, SLC, 1963)." ...|$|E
2500|$|The New Brunswick police {{department}} has received attention for various incidents over the years. In 1991, the fatal shooting of Shaun Potts, an unarmed black resident, by Sergeant Zane Grey led to multiple local protests. [...] In 1996, Officer James Consalvo fatally shot Carolyn [...] "Sissy" [...] Adams, an unarmed prostitute who had bit him. The Adams case sparked calls for {{reform in the}} New Brunswick {{police department}}, and ultimately was settled with the family. Two officers, Sgt. Marco Chinchilla and Det. James Marshall, were convicted of running a bordello in 2001. Chinchilla was sentenced to three years and Marshall was sentenced to four. In 2011, Officer Brad Berdel fatally shot Barry Deloatch, <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had run from police (although police claim he struck officers with a stick); this sparked daily protests from residents.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conversion}} of Over-the-Rhine {{into a black}} neighborhood {{was a result of}} [...] "white flight" [...] to the suburbs. Newer housing and more space was available, new highways made commuting easier, and some jobs shifted to the suburbs. In Over-the-Rhine some buildings still didn't have running water. The suburbs were also perceived as much safer. The Cincinnati Strangler, <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> raped and murdered six white women in the mid-1960s, aggravated racist phobias. Race riots in 1967 and 1968 started in the black Avondale neighborhood and spread to nearby neighborhoods like Over-the-Rhine. Between 1960 and 1980 Over-the-Rhine lost 84percent of its white population. The black population peaked at about 7,300 in 1980, but was still relatively small compared to the 27,000 whites who had occupied the neighborhood just 20 years earlier. From 1980 to 2000 Over-the-Rhine lost both black and white residents, but lost white residents at a higher rate.|$|E

2500|$|The Civil Rights Movement began {{a new era}} as [...] the {{university}} began [...] policies against racial discrimination and segregation after legal challenges and court cases outlawed discrimination. The Bizzell Memorial Library has been designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in commemoration of the cases of G. W.

It was then state law that no school should serve both white and black students, but there were few or no separate graduate programs available for blacks. A court case effectively forced the Board of Regents to vote to admit McLaurin, but he was directed to study in a separated area within the law library and {{to be allowed to}} lunch only in a segregated area as well. The National Association for Advancement of Colored People brought the case to the U.S. Supreme court in McLaurin vs. Oklahoma State Board of Regents. In 1950, the court overturned {{the university}}'s policy for segregation at the graduate school level. The case was an important precedent for the more famous and sweeping 1954 case of Brown v. Board of Education which disallowed [...] "separate but equal" [...] policy at all school levels.|$|E
2500|$|The Department did respond, however, {{when the}} Green Bay, Wisconsin Police Department {{responded to a}} {{disturbance}} that two off-duty Minneapolis police officers were involved in.
