Upon arrival in the chosen area, the game shows and describes the scene in visual novel format, with text layered on a graphical background.

5000|$|The second {{widely held}} {{position}} that Fretheim challenges is {{the doctrine of}} divine omniscience. (chapter 4) Fretheim uses solid biblical exegesis to argue compellingly against a view (at least in the Old Testament) which classifies omniscience as one of God’s fundamental characteristics. Divine foreknowledge, he believes, is limited because of God’s relationship with creation. There is no doubt, he says, that God always knows what He will do in the future, but He does not always know what free moral agents outside of Himself will do. For Fretheim, {{the widespread use of}} words like “perhaps” and “if” in divine speech point to a lack of certainty in God’s mind about the future. God’s bargain with Abraham over Sodom is an excellent example of God’s mind being open to change depending on the unforeseen actions of human beings. The issue of foreknowledge is not presented as complex or difficult. Rather, Fretheim quickly lays out his argument and in less than fifteen pages and moves on to the addresses the issue of God’s presence in the world. (chapter 5) While acknowledging that God is everywhere at all times in a structural or general presence, Fretheim describes what he calls, the “intensification of the divine presence.” This intensity of presence can be <b>affected</b> <b>positively</b> or negatively by human beings. Fretheim argues that sin drives away God (as in Ezekiel 8:6) and actually results in the intensification of divine presence in the form of God’s wrath. Conversely, righteousness or “receptiveness” can move God to draw near.|$|E
5000|$|The pilgrimage Church of St. John of Nepomuk {{near the}} monastery in Žďár(currently Zdar Estate with New {{generation}} museum) was built {{thanks to the}} longtime, close and immensely fruitful cooperation of two extraordinary people. The impulse was given by Václav Vejmluva, an abbot of the Cistercian monastery in Žďár, who was a proven devotee of John of Nepomuk before he was beatified as well as after he was canonized. The preparation of the project {{dates back to the}} period from late April to the beginning of August 1719 and is considered a direct reaction of the abbot to the discovery of preserved tissue in the tomb of John of Nepomuk in the St. Vitus Cathedral on 15 April 1719. The design of the building was entrusted to famous architect Jan Blažej Santini-Aichel to whom abbot Vejmluva is alleged to have presented his ideas about the new sanctuary and the symbols used, which was fully compliant with the requirement of the Church: “Fathers propose, artists create“. The architect then worked {{on the basis of the}} outline. Santini dealt with the project quite individually, without any respect to the traditions concerning the shapes of religious buildings; he only accepted the contemporary viewpoint of the structure of a pilgrimage destination. The architect melted the abbot's idea of the church in which the main role was to be played by the pattern of a star, into an extraordinarily impressive form which was only appreciated by the modern time, yet not always. Friedrich Radnitzký, a member of the Central Committee, referred to the church as a [...] "visually mysterious phenomenon" [...] as late as 1886. The project was finished unusually quickly but this was nothing exceptional for Santini. Moreover, the abbot and the architect had cooperated together for many years and they were both specialists on symbology and the teaching of the Cabala which they used to a substantial extent in the project. Santini knew very well what the abbot wanted from him. Thus the resulting architecture must have been <b>affected</b> <b>positively</b> by the atmosphere of mutual understanding. The definitive shape of the building does not differ much from the first design and only a few changes were made.|$|E

40|$|Throughout the {{developed}} world, {{the share of}} agriculture in total income of the rural population is declining. This is due to push and pull factors. On one hand, terms of trade of agriculture are falling and farmers are forced to seek additional income sources. On the other hand, population expansion in rural areas, including {{an important component of}} urban-to-rural migration, creates attractive opportunities for alternative income-generating activities. The question is whether agriculture is good or bad for rural well-being. Are communities with more agriculture composed of stronger farms that enhance economic well-being, or perhaps more agriculture means lack of alternatives, in which case the outcome is the opposite? The answer has important implications for agricultural and rural policy. This paper attempts to answer this question in the context of Israeli Moshav semi-cooperative villages. These villages were established by farmers but have experienced a rising trend of exodus from farming in recent years and an inflow of non-farm population. We use village-level data derived from Censuses of Population and Censuses of Agriculture to study three complementary measures of well-being: income per-capita, housing spaciousness, and automobile ownership. We estimate a recursive system of simultaneous equations in which housing spaciousness and automobile ownership depend on income per-capita. The fraction of agriculture in total income in each village is the central explanatory variable. We also use explanatory variables representing demographic and economic characteristics of the villages, as well as geographic location and institutional affiliation. The results show that agriculture has a significantly negative effect on income per-capita. Income per-capita is also <b>affected</b> <b>positively</b> by the fraction of the population in the labor force, by the fraction of self-employed, and by the fraction of the population holding academic degrees. It is affected negatively by the distance from Tel-Aviv (the economic center of the country). Housing spaciousness and automobile ownership are <b>affected</b> <b>positively</b> by income per-capita. Holding income per-capita constant, housing spaciousness and automobile ownership are <b>affected</b> <b>positively</b> by the importance of agriculture. Housing spaciousness is also <b>affected</b> <b>positively</b> by median age in the village and the dependency ration, and negatively by household size. Automobile ownership is <b>affected</b> <b>positively</b> by household size and negatively by the dependency ratio. We conclude that rural communities that rely more heavily on agriculture are worse off in terms of income per-capita, but this adverse effect on well-being is partially offset by opposite results with respect to housing spaciousness and automobile ownership. The decline of agriculture is clearly not fully compensated by alternative sources of income. Provided that the global decline of agriculture will continue, the challenge of the authorities is to promote sufficiently attractive employment opportunities in rural areas that will smooth the occupational migration out of farming and prevent rural poverty.
