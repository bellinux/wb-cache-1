50|$|Although Lincoln sheriffs {{had tried}} {{for eight years}} to get money from the county for a jail, Brady finally got funds ($3,000) to build an {{underground}} holding area in 1877. Prior to that, the sheriff used the military jail at Fort Stanton. The new jail was twenty feet wide by thirty feet long, and ten feet deep. It was lined with rough logs and divided into two cells with a ladder and a trap door for <b>access.</b> <b>Light,</b> when available, was by candles. Conditions were so bad and escapes so common that the county anteed up for a real jail in 1880. One of the causes in the {{lack of confidence in}} Sheriff Brady was the escape in November 1877 of Jesse Evans and his gang.|$|E

50|$|In {{tapestry}} lawns mowing {{not only}} operates {{to maintain a}} low lawn-like aspect but it also repeatedly modulates the light environment and intentionally creates physical stress. The relatively taller plant species used gradually take {{more and more of}} the light as they grow, creating internal shade within the lawn and stressing the lower growing plants. When mowing is applied it removes the tall growth. This allows light to reach the light starved low growing plants and stresses the tall plants by reducing their size and photosynthetic area. The tall plants stop growing and use reserves of carbohydrates to repair the damage. Once the damage has been repaired, they begin to regrow from a reduced size plant. The low growing plants take advantage of the post-mowing window of opportunity to <b>access</b> <b>light.</b> In this way both low growing prostrate plants and the somewhat taller plants can be grown together.|$|E

The coupling ratio between the two fibers can be continuously tuned over the entire spectral band via a simple mechanical displacement method. We expect that such couplers will be of use for monitoring, splitting, and multiplexing applications in future multi-core communication and sensing systems...|$|E

In this study we introduce an experimental technique to <b>access</b> <b>light</b> scattering properties at textured TCO-silicon interfaces. Therefore we prepared a sample with a polished microcrystalline silicon layer, which is deposited onto a rough TCO layer. We used the measured results to validate calculations obtained with rigorous diffraction theory, i. e. a numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations. Furthermore we evaluated four approximate models based on the scalar scattering theory and ray tracing and compared them to the rigorous diffraction theory.

40|$|A {{geographic}} information system–based multivariate regression study {{of an urban}} U.

Carsharing {{is a relatively new}} transportation industry in which companies provide members with short-term vehicle access from distributed neighborhood locations. The number of registered carsharing members in North America has doubled every year or two to a current level of approximately 320, 000. Researchers have long supposed that public transit access is a key factor driving demand for carsharing. The results of the study, however, find an ambiguous relationship between the activity at carsharing locations and public transit <b>access.</b> <b>Light</b> rail availability is found to have a significant and positive relationship to carsharing demand. Regional rail availability is found to be weakly and negatively associated with carsharing demand, although limitations in the available data make it impossible to ascribe the observed difference t...|$|E
40|$|For their survival, plants {{need to grow}} {{in height}} to <b>access</b> <b>light</b> {{resource}} while ensuring their mechanical stability. Growth in height amplifies the mechanical constraints due to wind and gravity. Nevertheless these constraints represent morphogenetic signals that plants respond to by modifying their growth. There are two regulatory processes of growth by mechanical signals: thigmomorphogenesis and gravitropism. Thigmomorphogenesis expresses by a reduction of growth in height and an increase of growth in girth under the effect of mechanical signals. This {{is a way for}} plants to grow with controlling slenderness of their axes to avoid buckling (beating down). In some cases (storm, sudden exposure to a new mechanical environment) this process is not sufficient to prevent buckling, gravitropism then acts to restore axes orientation in case of no lethal buckling. With measuring several traits, we have demonstrated that these processes have a fundamental ecological role in the control of tree habit and the vertical structuration of ecosystems. As studies of climate changes seem to predict a higher frequency of storms it is important to study the diversity of their efficiency...|$|E
