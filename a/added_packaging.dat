40|$|Purpose – This {{study has}} three broad objectives: (1) to explore {{consumer}} views on different dimensions of consumer packaging {{when it comes}} to a common staple food; (2) to discuss the role of different packaging features in consumer choice; (3) to compare consumer views on purchasing a common staple food either as an undifferentiated anonymous commodity or as a differentiated product. Design/methodology/approach – Three semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted. A thematic analysis was made by means of a theory driven approach. Six different packaging was used as discussion material, to headlight and exemplify different aspects. Findings - The analysis revealed consumer views in eight categories of packaging features regarding a common staple food (potato) being (1) packaging material, (2) packaging size, (3) protection and preservation, (4) convenience, (5) price, (6) communication and information, (7) ethical perspectives, and (8) novelty and innovation. The role of packaging features in consumers’ choice is discussed, and comparisons are made with the alternative of an undifferentiated anonymous product. Positive and negative aspects were found in both cases. Research limitations/implications – This research contributes to present knowledge regarding packaging dimensions of fast moving consumer goods, and provides insights on consumers’ views on both packaged products and the alternative of an undifferentiated commodity. Limitations and advantages of using focus groups are discussed. Practical implications – The findings add to knowledge of consumer behaviour and food choice as regards consumer packaging and consumer views on both an undifferentiated commodity, and <b>added</b> <b>packaging</b> to diversify the product. The findings are applicable by practitioners in the industry of fast moving consumer goods. The paper suggests areas for future research. Originality/value – This study uses a common everyday staple to compare consumer views on both a differentiated product by the means of packaging, and the product as being undifferentiated and anonymous. By comparing two levels of differentiation, this study provides insights in consumer standpoints regarding packaging issues, and their views on just the actual product as commodity...|$|E
