5|$|Lynch {{has also}} {{branched}} out into television, and later, internet-based series. His {{first foray into}} the medium was Twin Peaks, {{a joint venture with}} Mark Frost. Twin Peaks became a cult success, leading to Lynch and Frost working together on a number of other projects, including On the Air, and American Chronicles. In 2002 Lynch began producing two series of shorts released through his official website—the Flash-animated DumbLand, and Rabbits. Having begun acting in his 1972 short The Amputee, Lynch went on to appear on-camera in Twin Peaks, Zelly <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> Dune. From 2007, Lynch has appeared in a recurring voice role in the animated series The Cleveland Show.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, <b>and</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time <b>and</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

25|$|VAST's {{sound is}} {{identifiable}} as ambient electro-rock with considerable industrial and acoustic influences, usually made with Crosby's traditional acoustic guitar, electronic instruments and processing, drum-driven tracks, and heavy bass. Vocally similarities range from classic rock to post-grunge. In recent years, however, VAST's sound {{has been more}} identifiable with acoustic rock in releases such as April <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> You.|$|E
25|$|In both test {{settings}} and conversations Genie still sometimes reversed I and you, my and your, <b>and</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> you, {{but during the}} summer of 1974 she began to show definite improvement in both her comprehension and production of first and second person pronouns. In August she started to demonstrate the ability to modify first subject and then object pronouns. By mid-1975, her confusion of me versus you and my versus your was much less frequent. Curtiss also noted Genie starting to use the benefactive case during this time, although she did not always include the word for.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1990s {{during which}} time she also wrote and {{produced}} films, such as The Lust In His Eye: Visions of James Wilson Morrice and Borduas <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> Artemisia there was much speculation that Clarkson would soon be given a high level appointment by the Queen-in-Council. This was finally realized in 1995 when Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and then Minister of Canadian Heritage Michel Dupuy advised Governor General Roméo LeBlanc to appoint Clarkson {{as chair of the}} board of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, and later, to the Canadian War Museum as well, all while she continued to host her show. It was during this time that the War Museum announced the decision to build the structure which now houses its collection, and which Clarkson opened as Governor General in May 2005.|$|E

500|$|The {{reference}} here to stroking [...] "that little tower" [...] {{is derived}} {{from a series of}} letters written while Rilke was completing the Elegies including a letter he wrote to Klossowska, and one to his former lover, Lou Andreas-Salomé.

500|$|Allen {{suggested}} Anhedonia, a {{term for}} the inability to experience pleasure, as a working title, and Brickman suggested alternatives including It Had to Be Jew, Rollercoaster Named Desire <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> My Goy. An advertising agency, hired by United Artists, embraced Allen's choice of an obscure word by suggesting the studio take out newspaper advertisements that looked like fake tabloid headlines such as [...] "Anhedonia Strikes Cleveland!". However, Allen experimented with several titles over five test screenings, including Anxiety and Annie and Alvy, before settling on Annie Hall.|$|E

500|$|Jarrow {{incorporated}} musical themes from The Road to Freedom, a 1986 pop {{album with}} lyrics by Hubbard and performances by John Travolta, Leif Garrett, Frank Stallone, Chick Corea, and Karen Black. [...] Jarrow also incorporated musical themes from 1980s pop, saying [...] "the liturgical music of Scientology is 1980s pop, which seems strangely appropriate {{because of the}} science fiction books. So that's what we did [...] It's a pastiche of synth-pop and pageant choir music." [...] Jarrow said he tried [...] "to capture the feel of kiddie rock" [...] such as Free to Be… You <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> Kids Incorporated.|$|E
500|$|... "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] was budgeted at US$3 million, {{slightly}} more than the US$2–2.5 million budgeted in typical Mad Men episodes. The pilot episode was mostly shot at various locations in and around New York City including the Silvercup Studios, where principal photography lasted for two days. Most of the production crew were previously part of The Sopranos. After filming concluded in New York, production moved to the Los Angeles Center Studios. Abraham collaborated with an entirely different production crew from the one in New York. According to Abraham, Los Angeles contained a continuity that {{was related to the}} show.

500|$|The Church of Scientology hired private {{investigators}} and discovered {{a criminal record}} on Lonsdale, and this was subsequently publicized by a Scientologist on fliers and on a website. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology in 2006, and they {{accused him of being}} affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, a group critical of Scientology which was restricted in where it could protest in Clearwater. In 2007, Lonsdale appeared on the BBC Panorama program Scientology <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> was interviewed by journalist John Sweeney. Later in the program, Sweeney lost his temper and shouted at a Scientology representative when he was accused of giving Lonsdale a [...] "soft interview". Lonsdale died suddenly on February 16, 2008, and a Clearwater police spokeswoman stated that the death appears to be due to suicide.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Singapore in 1979 after {{completing}} his undergraduate studies, Tang engaged in performance art, [...] {{works of art}} that are composed of actions performed by the artist at a certain place and time. The following year, he staged a work of [...] installation art called Earthworks at the National Museum Art Gallery. This comprised two works, The Product of the Sun <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> The Product of the Rain and Me, which were made up of dishes of earth, lumps of soil, and pieces of soiled and water-stained linen which he had hung in gullies at Ang Mo Kio, a construction site {{in the process of}} being turned into a public housing estate. Installation art uses sculptural materials, and sometimes other media such as sound, video and performance, to modify the way a particular space is experienced.|$|E
500|$|Several {{other artists}} {{appear on the}} soundtrack. Billy Ray Cyrus' song on the album, [...] "Back to Tennessee", is the title track of his {{eleventh}} studio album.

Disney artist Steve Rushton sings [...] "Everything I Want" [...] and [...] "Game Over". Rascal Flatts perform acoustic versions of previous efforts originally released on Feels Like Today (2004) <b>and</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> My Gang (2006).
