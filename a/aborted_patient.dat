40|$|Abortion is the {{termination}} of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion of a fetus or embryo from the uterus, resulting in or caused by its death. Missed abortion {{is the most common}} dangerous condition in pregnancy. An abortion can occur due to maternal complications, chronic disease, endocrine disorders, abortificient drugs, radiation, heavy metals and toxins. The study population consisted of 43 <b>aborted</b> <b>patients</b> and 43 normal pregnant females, referred to Imam Khomeini hospital. 10 mL blood was taken and centrifuged to isolate the patients’ serum. Then, the samples were analyzed to determine the copper and selenium levels, using atomic absorption spectrometry. All data were statistically analyzed by T-test and Mann-Whitney methods. As a result, we found a significant decrease in serum copper level in cases compared with controls. Also the results showed an insignificant decrease in serum selenium levels in the patients compared to the healthy women. According to the results, deficiency of the essential heavy metals may be a probable reason for missed abortion occurrence. These deficiencies can be related to malnutrition, decreased consumption of essential metals and supplementary compounds in pregnancy, lack of regular laboratory monitoring. Thus, consuming supplements in Iranian pregnant women can be helpful in completing a successful pregnancy...|$|R

40|$|Background and objectiveImplantation of a cardioverter {{defibrillator}} (ICD) is a frequently recommended {{treatment for}} symptomatic Brugada syndrome (BrS). However, complications {{related to the}} device have been reported. Methods and resultsWe assessed the benefit / morbidity ratio of this mode of therapy in a cohort of 34 patients implanted in 3 French experienced centers between January 1, 2002 and November 30, 2010. The mean age was 48 ± 14 years, 4 (12 %) female. Twenty nine (85 %) patients had spontaneous typical coved Type I ECG pattern, 15 (44 %) had family history of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and 24 (88 %) had positive EP study. ICD implantation was based on aborted sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in 3 (9 %), syncope in 19 (56 %) or high risk status (spontaneous type 1 ECG {{in conjunction with a}} family history of SCD and/or a positive EP study) in 12 (35 %). The median follow-up period was 74 ± 23 (9 - 127) months. One patient with prior cardiac arrest died of a non-cardiac cause, 5 (15 %) patients had appropriate device therapy; all with spontaneous type I ECG and previous syncope but none with prior cardiac arrest. Overall complication rate was 26 %. Six (27 %) symptomatic and 3 (25 %) asymptomatic patients experienced complications. Five (14 %) patients (4 with previous syncope and 1 asymptomatic) experienced inappropriate shocks and 4 (12 %) had other complications: 2 patients had lead rupture, 1 lead displacement, and 1 pneumothorax during device replacement.

Methods: Retrospective analysis {{was performed on the}} clinical data of 151 patients who underwent attempt at 158 SEPS in 17 medical centers in the United States and Canada between June 1993 and February 1996. Results: SEPS was completed on 155 limbs of 148 patients, 81 male and 67 female (mean age, 56 years; range, 27 to 87 years). Three procedures were <b>aborted.</b> Seven <b>patients</b> had bilateral procedures (data from one limb were analyzed). One hundred four limbs (70 %) had active ulcers, and 22 (15 %) had healed ulcers. A single endoscopic port without insufflation was used in 66 procedures (45 %) and laparoscopic instrumentation, with two or three ports, in 82 (55 %), with CO 2 insufflation in 78 (53 %). A tourniquet was used on 112 patients (76 %). Concomitant venous procedures were performed in 106 patients (72 %; saphenous stripping in 71, high ligation in 17, varicosity avulsion in 85). No early deaths or thromboembolism occurred. Complications included wound infections (9), superficial thrombophlebitis (5), cellulitis (4), and saphenous neuralgia (10). Seven patients with wound infection had open ulcers; nine of 10 with neuralgia had concomitant procedures. A roll-on tourniquet caused skin necrosis in one patient. The clinical score improved from 9. 4 to 2. 9 after surgery (p < 0. 0001). Mean follow-up was 5. 4 months; 31 patients had ≥ 6 months follow-up. Ulcers healed in 88 % (75 of 85); recurrence or new ulcer was reported in 3 % (4 of 120). Conclusions: The SEPS modified Linton operation appears safe, with no postoperative deaths or early thromboembolism. Wound infection after SEPS remains important. Early results indicate rapid ulcer healing. Prospective evaluation of long-term results is warranted. (J Vasc Surg 1997; 25 : 94 - 105. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This {{retrospective}} study reports of 85 {{women in the}} second trimester with one prior cesarean section undergoing medical abortion of a viable unwanted pregnancy using vaginal misoprostol. Two regimens that were selected in a nonrandomized manner were used. Materials and Methods: Eighty-five women treated with vaginal misoprostol in a 3 -year period were retrospectively analyzed. All received 400 mu g of misoprostol initially and 22 (25. 8 %) aborted. Then Group A (n= 43) received subsequent administration of 200 mu g every 6 h, whereas Group B (n= 20) received 400 mu g/ 6 h. Results: All <b>patients</b> <b>aborted.</b> The groups had no statistical difference in mean age, gravidity, parity, gestational age, and time from previous cesarean section, {{and there was no}} difference in occurrence of side effects and mean induction to abortion time interval. The lower dosage group received a median of 600 mu g of vaginal misoprostol (min 600 mu g to max 1000 mu g). There were no uterine ruptures, need for hysterotomy, or excess bleeding in any patient. Conclusions: This is the largest series reported to date of second-trimester pregnancy termination in cases with one previous cesarean section using only vaginal misoprostol. The study shows that both used regimens are safe and equally effective. All 85 women aborted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} pregabalin (PGB) in treatment of frequent nonconvulsive seizures (NCS) and nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in critically ill patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 21 patients were identified as having received pregabalin {{for the treatment of}} NCS as determined by continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. The patients were considered to be responders if their seizures were terminated within 24 h of initiation of PGB without the addition of another antiepileptic agent. RESULTS: Of the 21 patients who received PGB for treatment of NCS or NCSE, 11 (52 %) were responders. PGB was administered via a nasogastric tube or orally and was the 2 nd to 4 th agent used. The average initial dose and total daily dose of PGB was similar in the responders and non-responders (342 mg vs. 360 mg, respectively). PGB was more effective in <b>aborting</b> NCS (9 <b>patients,</b> 82 %) than NCSE (2 patients, 18 %). Of the 9 brain tumor patients, PGB resulted in seizure cessation in 67 % (6 patients). In contrast, all patients with hypoxic injury (4) did not respond to PGB. The responders were noted to have better clinical outcome (64 % vs. 9 % discharged home). Most of the patients tolerated the medication without any significant short term adverse effects, except two patients who were noted to have dizziness and sedation.

40|$|Aim. Tubal factor {{infertility}} {{accounts for}} approximately 25 - 35 % {{of cases of}} female infertility. Identifiable causes of tubal infertility are postinfectious tubal damage, postsurgical adhesion formation, and endometriosis-related adhesions. Aim {{of this study was}} to evaluate the results of a diagnostic/therapeutic minimally invasive approach in patients with suspect or ascertained mechanical infertility in terms of obtained pregnancies. Methods. The study enrolled 143 patients who underwent diagnostic or operative laparoscopy, with chromopertubation, peritoneal or endometrial culture, salpingoscopy when indicated and diagnostic or operative hysteroscopy. Nine patients with submucousintramural or multiple intramural fibroids underwent miomectomy by minilaparotomy following hysteroscopy and chromopertubation. Patients were contacted periodically by telephone to monitor the onset and outcome of pregnancy. The mean length of follow- up was 49 months (range: 11 to 118 months). Results. Of the 152 patients considered in the study, 61 became pregnant (40 %). Twenty-three pregnancies resulted in miscarriage, two in tubal pregnancy and one <b>patient</b> <b>aborted</b> after a diagnosis of Down syndrome. In total, 32 % of the patients achieved a term pregnancy. Conclusion. The diagnostic/therapeutic miniinvasive approach allows women to become pregnant naturally and it is, therefore, an option for couples with ethical and religious concerns. The percentage of pregnancies is higher than after in-vitro fertilization. When efficacious, this approach allows additional spontaneous conceptions without renewed therapy and the course of pregnancy and the type of delivery will not differ from those in a normal population...|$|R

Patients and Methods: Thirty-nine patients at two institutions were enrolled onto this institutional review board–approved study. All underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative lymphatic mapping with blue dye and a handheld gamma probe. Radical hysterectomy was <b>aborted</b> in four <b>patients</b> be-cause metastatic disease was discovered on frozen section analysis of the sentinel node. Results: Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy revealed at least one sentinel node in 33 patients (85 %), includ-ing 21 (55 %) with bilateral sentinel nodes. All 39 pa-tients had at least one sentinel node identified intraop-eratively. Eighty percent of sentinel nodes were in three pelvic locations: iliac, obturator, and parametrial (in descending order of frequency). The remaining sentinel nodes were in the common iliac and para-aortic nodal basins. A total of 132 nodes were identified clinically as sentinel nodes; 65 (49 %) were both blue and hot, 35 (27 %) were blue only, and 32 (24 %) were hot only. Eight patients (21 %) had metastatic disease. In five of these patients, sentinel nodes were the only positive lymph nodes. One patient had false-negative sentinel nodes. She had four microscopically positive parame-trial nodes that were resected in continuity with the uterus. The sensitivity of the sentinel node was 87. 5 % and the negative predictive value was 97 %.

A further 16 <b>patients</b> <b>aborted</b> the treatment during the first day and {{were not included in}} the analyses. The treatment was manual guided and also included parents. Assessments were made pre-inpatient treatment, immediately post-inpatient treatment and at 2 -month follow-up. School attendance was the primary outcome variable and secondary outcomes were composite scores of a range of adolescent- and parent-rated mental health problems. Overall, results show a considerable decline of school absenteeism and mental health problems during treatment and subsequent follow-up. Continuous school attendance was achieved by 87. 1 % of the sample at the end of inpatient treatment and by 82. 3 % at 2 -month follow-up. Comorbid symptoms of anxiety, depression, disruptive and insufficient learning behavior were significantly reduced from pre to follow-up, with effect sizes for the composite scores ranging from 0. 44 to 1. 15 ( <  0. 001).

40|$|AbstractPurpose: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to review the}} long-term results of catheter-directed thrombolysis in treatment of infrainguinal bypass graft occlusion. Methods: From January 1987 to December 1998, 67 patients with 69 acutely occluded infrainguinal arterial bypass grafts (48 vein grafts, 21 prosthetic grafts) underwent treatment with catheter-directed thrombolysis with urokinase. Long-term results were assessed with Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis, and factors predictive of success were determined with multivariate analysis. Results: Thrombolysis was <b>aborted</b> in 7 <b>patients</b> (10 %) because of major complications or technical failure and was unsuccessful in restoring graft patency (≤ 90 % lysis) in 13 patients (19 %). Successful lysis was achieved in 49 patients (71 %). A causative lesion was identified and treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or limited operative revision in 33 patients. Diffuse vein graft intimal hyperplasia or poor runoff was identified in the remaining 9 patients, who were offered no further intervention. Cumulative patency at 60 months was 65 % ± 8 % for successfully lysed vein grafts; however, only 3 of 16 successfully lysed prosthetic grafts were patent at 9 months. Although univariate analysis identified several factors associated with successful long-term vein graft function, only white race was significant at multivariate regression analysis. Conclusions: Coupled with identification and aggressive treatment of underlying causative lesions, catheter-directed thrombolysis can salvage many thrombosed vein grafts, with expectation of long-term patency similar to that with repeat bypass grafting. Poor short-term results of thrombolysis of occluded prosthetic grafts support repeat operation with a completely new bypass graft as a more appropriate option.

40|$|This {{observational}} {{study examined the}} changes during inpatient cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) of adolescents with chronic anxious-depressive school absenteeism with or without comorbid disruptive symptoms. 147 adolescents (aged 12 – 18  years) with a specific phobia or other anxiety disorder or a depressive episode or a mixed disorder of conduct and emotions and who had completely ceased to attend school or showed irregular school attendance underwent an inpatient cognitive-behavioral treatment. A further 16 <b>patients</b> <b>aborted</b> the treatment during the first day and {{were not included in}} the analyses. The treatment was manual guided and also included parents. Assessments were made pre-inpatient treatment, immediately post-inpatient treatment and at 2 -month follow-up. School attendance was the primary outcome variable and secondary outcomes were composite scores of a range of adolescent- and parent-rated mental health problems. Overall, results show a considerable decline of school absenteeism and mental health problems during treatment and subsequent follow-up. Continuous school attendance was achieved by 87. 1 % of the sample at the end of inpatient treatment and by 82. 3 % at 2 -month follow-up. Comorbid symptoms of anxiety, depression, disruptive and insufficient learning behavior were significantly reduced from pre to follow-up, with effect sizes for the composite scores ranging from 0. 44 to 1. 15 (p <  0. 001). This large {{observational study}} in adolescents with school absenteeism and a mixture of emotional and disruptive symptoms is the first to show the benefits of inpatient therapy that included cognitive-behavioral therapy and access to a special school with expertise on teaching children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{evaluates the}} ability of a third-generation cardioverter-defibrillator to abort energy {{delivery}} and the importance of electrogram storage in analyzing the aborted events. Background. In the Cadence Tiered Therapy Defibrillator, when a tachycardia satisfies detection criteria for cardioversion or defibrillation therapy, high voltage capacitors begin charging. The Cadence defibrillator continues monitoring the rhythm during charging and if the rate decreases to below the rate triggering therapy, charging is terminated. This event is registered as an aborted shock. The defibrillator also has the ability to store intracardiac electrogram recordings of the electrical events that precipitate device therapy or aborted shocks. Methods. During a mean follow-up interval of 10 ± 7 months, 55 aborted events were registered by the Cadence defibrillator in 18 of the 49 patients who received it. Thirty-two stored ventricular etectrograms of events leading to aborted shocks were available for analysis in 15 patients. Results. Intracardiac electrogram recordings demonstrated the probable electrical events leading to these aborted shocks included nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (n = 10), nonsustained rapid polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (n = 2), atrial fibrillation (n = 5), supraventricular tachycardia (n = 2) and electrical noise (n = 13). Eleven patients had a therapeutic intervention initiated {{as a consequence of the}} diagnostic information provided by analysis of intracardiac electrogram recordings. Four of the 15 patients had no changes made. During a follow-up period of 9 ± 5 months after therapy was altered, no <b>patient</b> had subsequent <b>aborted</b> shocks. Five <b>patients</b> have had seven appropriate shocks for sustained ventricular tachycardias. Conclusions. The ability of Cadence defibrillator to continue tachycardia sensing during capacitor charging and to abort shock therapy for self-terminating events prevented unnecessary shocks in 18 (37 %) of the 49 patients. Intracardiac electrogram recordings were critical for instituting appropriate therapy that may have prevented unnecessary device charging and inappropriate discharges...|$|R
40|$|A prospective, randomized, study {{involving}} 92 {{patients who}} required elective operation {{for treatment of}} duodenal ulcer was performed to compare the results of Parietal Cell Vagotomy (PCV) and selective vagotomy-antrectomy Billroth I (SV-A-BI). The protocol was broken twice. One patient was unable to undergo PCV because of pyloric stenosis and one patients underwent Billroth II anastomosis instead of Billroth I because of post-bulbar stenosis. Performance of PCV was never <b>aborted</b> because a <b>patient</b> was obese. There were no deaths. Diarrhea, dumping and other gastric complaints were less frequent after PCV than after SV-A-BI for all time periods studies up to two years. Two months after operation, the Hollander tests were negative in 59 % of patients after PCV and in 100 % after SV-ABI. Inhibition of Bao and MAO were also significantly less after PCV than after SV-A-BI. Since vagotomy of the parietal cell mass was identical in both groups of patients {{it was concluded that}} the differences in the secretory rates and the fewer negative Hollander tests in the PCV group than in the SV-A-BI group were due to retention of the antrum irrespective of its innervation. There was no explanation for the gradual increase in the BAO in the PCV group. One recurrent ulcer occurred in the PCV group in a patient who overindulged in alcohol and aspirin. After 4 days of medical management, this superficial ulcer healed as demonstrated by endoscopy. There were no recurrent ulcers after SV-A-BI. As a result of this study, it is concluded that PCV is superior to SV-A-BI because of the lower frequency of postoperative complications, diarrhea, dumping and other symptoms associated with gastric surgery. PCV may be the operation of choice for the elective treatment of duodenal ulcer; however, it remains undetermined whether the recurrent ulcer rate following PCV will be sufficiently low that the procedure can retain a position of superiority over SV-A-BI...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnlike mediastinoscopy in lung cancer, {{there exists}} no {{standard}} minimally invasive test to stage esophageal cancer. If {{it were possible}} to obtain exact preoperative staging in esophageal cancer, patients could be separated prospectively to receive neoadjuvant therapy appropriately. We studied the feasibility and efficacy of thoracoscopic and laparoscopic lymph node staging in esophageal cancer. Thoracoscopic staging was performed in 45 patients with biopsy-proven carcinoma of the esophagus. Laparoscopic staging {{was done in the}} last 19 patients. Thoracoscopic staging was <b>aborted</b> in three <b>patients</b> because of adhesions. Thoracic lymph node stage was N 0 in 39 patients and N 1 in three; celiac lymph nodes were normal in 13 and diseased in six. Esophageal resection was performed in 30 patients after thoracoscopic staging; 17 of these underwent laparoscopic staging. Thoracoscopic staging showed N 0 lymph node status in 28 patients and N 1 in two patients. Two of the 28 patients (7 %) with N 0 disease were found at resection to have paraesophageal lymph node involvement (N 1); thus the disease was understaged by thoracoscopic staging. Thoracoscopic staging was accurate in detecting the presence of diseased thoracic lymph nodes in 28 of 30 cases (93 %). Laparoscopic staging detected normal celiac nodes in 12 patients and diseased lymph nodes in five patients. After esophagectomy, the final pathology report in the 12 patients with N 0 disease was N 0 in 11 and diseased lymph nodes in one patient. Thus laparoscopic staging was accurate in detecting lymph node metastases in 16 of 17 patients (94 %). Thoracoscopic and laparoscopic staging are more accurate than existing staging methods. Six of 19 patients in whom laparoscopic staging was used had unsuspected celiac axis lymph node involvement that had been missed by standard noninvasive techniques. One of three patients with thoracic lymph nodes and three of six with celiac lymph nodes were downstaged after preoperative chemotherapy/radiotherapy. The role of thoracoscopy and laparoscopy in staging esophageal cancer should be further evaluated in a multiinstitutional trial. (J THORAC CARDIOVASC SURG 1996; 111 : 800 - 7...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundContrast-enhanced {{magnetic}} resonance angiography (CE-MRA) is a proven diagnostic {{tool for the}} evaluation of carotid stenosis; however, its utility in planning carotid artery stenting (CAS) has not been addressed. This study assessed the accuracy of three-dimensional CE-MRA as a noninvasive screening tool, compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), for evaluating carotid and arch morphology before CAS. MethodsIn a series of 96 CAS procedures during a 2 -year period, CE-MRAs and DSAs with complete visualization from the aortic arch to the intracranial circulation were obtained before CAS in 60 patients. Four additional patients, initially considered potential candidates for CAS, were also evaluated with CE-MRA and DSA. The two-by-two table method, receiver operating characteristic curve, and Bland-Altman analyses were used to characterize the ability of CE-MRA to discriminate carotid and arch anatomy, suitability for CAS, and degree of carotid stenosis. ResultsThe sensitivity and specificity of CE-MRA were, respectively, 100 % and 100 % to determine CAS suitability, 87 % and 100 % to define aortic arch type, 93 % and 100 % to determine severe carotid tortuosity, and 75 % and 98 % to detect ulcerated plaques. CE-MRA had 87 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity for the detection of carotid stenosis ≥ 80 %. The accuracy of CE MRA to determine optimal imaging angles and stent and embolic protection device sizes was > 90 %. The operative technique for CAS was altered because of the findings of preoperative CE-MRA in 22 procedures (38 %). The most frequent change in the operative plan was the use of the telescoping technique in 11 cases (18 %). CAS was <b>aborted</b> in four <b>patients</b> (5 %) due to unfavorable anatomy identified on CE-MRA, including prohibitive internal carotid artery tortuosity (n = 1), long string sign of the internal carotid artery (n = 2), and concomitant intracranial disease (n = 1). Among patients considered suitable for CAS by CE-MRA, technical success was 100 %, and the 30 -day stroke/death rate was 1. 6 %. ConclusionsContrast-enhanced {{magnetic resonance}} angiography of the arch and carotid arteries is accurate in determining suitability for CAS and may alter the operative technique. Certain anatomic contraindications for CAS may be detected without DSA. Although CE-MRA is less accurate to estimate the degree of stenosis, it can accurately predict imaging angles, and stent and embolic protection device size, which may facilitate safe and expeditious CAS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: This report {{describes}} the authors' initial {{experience with the}} Excluder thoracic endoprosthesis (W. L. Gore and Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, Ariz) and the thoracic Talent endoprosthesis (Medtronic AVE, Sunrise, Fla) and their safety and efficacy in the primary endovascular repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). In addition, comparison with a historic nonrandomized cohort of patients that had undergone open repair of descending TAAs is reported. Patients and methods: Repair of TAA (mean diameter, 68 ± 22 mm) was attempted in 19 patients with the Excluder (n = 14) and the Talent (n = 5) endoprostheses between March 1999 and January 2000. This group was compared with a historic nonrandomized cohort of 10 patients that had undergone open repair of anatomically similar descending TAA (mean diameter, 74 ± 22 mm) between January 1996 and January 1998. The mean age in the endovascular group was 70. 6 ± 5. 3 years versus 70. 1 ± 4. 5 years in the historic open group. All the procedures were performed in a standard operating room with angiographic capabilities. In the historic open group, each standard tube graft repair of descending TAA was performed by one of three staff surgeons. Results: Endograft deployment was successful in 18 patients (95 %). The procedure was <b>aborted</b> in one <b>patient</b> (Excluder) because of small iliac arteries and access difficulty. The average operative time was 155 ± 62 minutes, with a mean blood loss of 325 ± 353 mL (versus 256 ± 102 minutes and 1205 ± 1493 mL, respectively, in the open group). Eight patients needed the planned use {{of more than one}} component for enhanced sealing or additional length in the endovascular group. No type I endoleaks were identified on the intraoperative completion angiography. One perioperative mortality occurred in the endovascular group and the open group. In the endovascular group, other complications included retroperitoneal hematoma and external iliac artery dissection (n = 1), lymphocele (n = 1), and common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (n = 1). In the open group, other complications included ischemic colitis (n = 1), severe renal insufficiency (n = 2), wound infection (n = 1), and stroke (n = 1). In the endovascular group, the length of stay was 6. 2 ± 3. 3 days (range, 1 to 13 days), with only nine patients needing intensive care, whereas in the open group, the length of stay was 16. 3 ± 6. 7 days, with all patients needing intensive care. Endoleaks, graft migrations, or ruptures were not seen on the 1 -month, 6 -month, and 12 -month follow-up computed tomographic scans in the endovascular group. On the average, aneurysm size decreased from 68 ± 22 mm to 58 ± 13 mm, to 51 ± 14 mm, and to 49 ± 12 mm at 1, 6, and 12 months after endovascular repair, respectively. No spinal cord ischemia was seen in either group. Conclusion: The endoluminal repair was effective in exclusion of descending TAAs from the systemic circulation in this selected group of patients. In this short-term follow-up, compared with the nonrandomized historic cohort of open descending TAA repair, the endovascular group had significantly shorter operating times and hospital and intensive care unit stays and lower operative blood loss. Further follow-up and continued assessment of the long-term durability of these devices in elective and emergency circumstances are warranted. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 36 : 732 - 7. ...|$|R
40|$|Zielsetzung: Evaluation der lokoregionären transarteriellen Chemoperfusion (TACP) bei nicht kurativ therapierbaren und unter systemischer Chemotherapie progredienten fortgeschrittenen Stadien, Rezidivtumoren oder Metastasen maligner Tumoren des Beckens, des Pankreas und der Leber anhand des lokalen Tumoransprechens, des Überlebens und des Ansprechens tumorassoziierter Symptome (Becken und Pankreas). Material und Methodik: Bei 24 Patienten wurden TACP des Beckens durchgeführt. Die behandelten Tumorentitäten waren kolorektales Karzinom (KRK) (n = 11), Ovarial- (n = 3), Cervix-, Mamma- (BC) (je n = 2), Magen-, Nebennieren-, Anal-, Prostata-, Nierenzell- und Gartner-Gang-Karzinom (je n = 1). Bei 40 Patienten wurden TACP des Pankreas bei Pankreaskarzinom durchgeführt (n = 28 fortgeschrittene Tumorstadien, n = 12 Lokalrezidive). Bei 55 Patienten wurden TACP der Leber durchgeführt. Die behandelten Tumorentitäten waren KRK, BC (je n = 12), cholangiozelluläres Karzinom (CCC) (n = 10), Pankreas- (n = 4), Ovarial- (n = 3), Magen-, Cervix-, Papillen- (je n = 2), Prostata-, Ösophaguskarzinom, Leiomyosarkom (je n = 1) und {{cancer of}} unknown primacy (CUP) (n = 5). Mitomycin C (6 - 8, 5 mg/m²) wurde in Kombination mit Gemcitabine (1000 - 1500 mg/m²) über 1 h durch einen je nach Tumorlokalisation und -gefäßversorgung in der A. iliaca interna (Becken), dem Truncus coeliacus (Pankreas) oder der A. hepatica (Leber) platzierten Angiographiekatheter verabreicht. Mindestens 3 TACP wurden pro Patient in vierwöchigen Abständen ambulant durchgeführt. Danach wurde das Therapieansprechen evaluiert und über eine Weiterführung entschieden. Das radiologische Tumoransprechen wurde mittels MRT oder CT bestimmt und nach der RECIST-Klassifikation (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) in {{complete}} response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) und progressive disease (PD) eingeteilt. Eine deutliche Verbesserung klinischer Symptome wurde als clinical response (Rc), eine Stabilisierung als clinical stable disease (SDc) und eine Verschlechterung bestehender oder ein Auftreten neuer Symptome als clinical progression (PDc) bewertet. Die Überlebenszeiten wurden nach der Kaplan-Meier-Methode berechnet. Ergebnisse: Bei allen Patienten konnten mindestens 3 TACP durchgeführt werden. Ein vorzeitiger Therapieabbruch oder eine Verlängerung der Therapieintervalle war bei keinem Patienten notwendig. Es kam zu keinen relevanten Komplikationen. Bei Patienten, bei denen eine TACP des Beckens durchgeführt wurde, konnten tumorassoziierte Beschwerden (Schmerzen, Blutungen etc.) in 54 % (21 / 39 Einzelsymptome) gebessert werden. Radiologisch zeigten sich insg. 4 (17 %) PR, 12 (50 %) SD und 8 (33 %) PD. Für Patienten mit KRK als größte Einzelgruppe betrug das radiologische Ansprechen 2 PR, 7 SD und 2 PD bei einem medianen Überleben von 11, 5 Monaten. Tumorinduzierte Schmerzen konnten bei 20 / 32 (62, 5 %) der Patienten verringert werden, bei denen eine TACP des Pankreas durchgeführt wurde. Radiologisch fanden sich 3 (7, 5 %) CR, 9 (22, 5 %) PR, 16 (40 %) SD und 12 (30 %) PD. Das mediane Überleben lag bei 8, 1 Monaten. Patienten mit Therapieansprechen (CR + PR) lebten signifikant länger als solche mit Tumorprogress (13, 0 vs. 6, 0 Monate; p = 0, 013). Bei Patienten, bei denen eine TACP der Leber durchgeführt wurde, fanden sich insg. 1 CR, 19 PR, 19 SD und 16 PD. Davon entfielen 5 PR, 3 SD und 4 PD auf KRK, 1 CR, 4 PR und 6 SD auf BC und 2 PR, 2 SD und 6 PD auf CCC. Das mediane Überleben betrug 9, 7 Monate bei KRK, 11, 4 Monate bei BC und 6, 0 Monate bei CCC. Schlussfolgerung: Die TACP mit Mitomycin/Gemcitabine stellt ein gut verträgliches, minimalinvasives, komplikationsarmes, ambulant einsetzbares Verfahren zur palliativen Therapie von fortgeschrittenen Stadien, Rezidivtumoren und Metastasen maligner Tumoren des Beckens, des Pankreas und der Leber dar. Es konnte sogar in multipel vorbehandelten, therapieresistenten Tumoren ein Ansprechen/eine Wachstumskontrolle (= CR+PR+SD) in 17 %/ 67 % (Becken), 30 %/ 70 % (Pankreas) bzw. 36 %/ 71 % (Leber) erzielt werden. Patienten mit Pankreaskarzinom, die auf die Therapie mit der TACP ansprachen, hatten einen signifikanten Überlebensvorteil gegenüber Patienten mit Tumorprogress. In 54 % (Becken) bzw. 62, 5 % (Pankreas) konnten lokale tumorassoziierte Beschwerden gebessert werden. Aus diesen Gründen sollte die intraarterielle Chemotherapie als Option in der palliativen onkologischen Betreuung des Patienten in Erwägung gezogen werden. Purpose: The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate local transarterial chemoperfusion (TACP) as a palliative treatment option for incurable advanced tumor stages, locally recurrent tumors, and metastases of various malign neoplasia in the pelvis, pancreas, and liver, which did not respond to prior systemic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Radiological tumor response, survival, and clinical response (in pelvis and pancreas only) were retrospectively analyzed. Materials and methods: TACP of the pelvis was performed in 24 patients. Treated tumor entities were colorectal (CRC) (n = 11), ovarian (n = 3), cervical (n = 2), breast (BC) (n = 2), gastric, adrenal, anal, prostate, Gartner´s duct, and renal cell carcinoma (each n = 1). TACP of the pancreas was performed in 40 patients with pancreatic carcinoma (28 with advanced tumor stages, 12 with locally recurrent tumors). TACP of the liver was performed in 55 patients. Treated tumor entities were CRC, BC (each n = 12), cholangiocarcinoma (CCC) (n = 10), pancreatic (n = 4), ovarian (n = 3), gastric, cervical, papillary (each n = 2), prostate, esophageal carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma (each n = 1), and cancer of unknown primacy (CUP) (n = 5). Combined gemcitabine (1000 - 1500 mg/m²) and mitomycin C (6 - 8, 5 mg/m²) was administered intra-arterially within one hour through a fluoroscopy catheter placed in the internal iliac artery (pelvis), the celiac trunc (pancreas), or the hepatic artery (liver), depending on tumor localization and vascularization. At least 3 TACPs were performed on an outpatient basis in four-week-intervals. Tumor size was measured by CT or MRI scans. Radiological response was classified according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) in complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD). Clinical response to treatment was classified as clinical response (Rc), if symptoms improved explicitly, as clinical stable disease (SDc), if there was a stabilization of complaints, and clinical progression (PDc), in case of worsening of existing symptoms, or appearance of new symptoms. Survival times were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. After the third session therapy response was evaluated. In case of clinical and radiological progression, therapy was stopped and the case was discussed for further treatment options. If radiological response and clinical progression was found, therapy was continued. If clinical response with radiological progression was found, therapy was continued. Therapy could be <b>aborted</b> by the <b>patient</b> at any time. Results: A minimum of 3 TACPs could be conducted in all patients. No prolongation of the therapy intervals and no early discontinuation of the therapy were required. No major side effects or complications occurred. For TACP of the pelvis, an improvement of tumor-induced symptoms (e. g. pain, bleeding, etc.) was found in 54 % (21 / 39 single symptoms). Radiologically, in total 4 (17 %) patients showed PR, 12 (50 %) SD, and 8 (34 %) PD. For CRC patients – the biggest subgroup – radiological response was 2 PR, 7 SD, and 2 PD, with a median survival of 11. 5 months. For TACP of the pancreas, tumor-induced pain could be relieved in 62. 5 % (20 / 32) of the patients. The radiological results were 3 (7. 5 %) CR, 9 (22. 5 %) PR, 16 (40 %) SD, and 12 (30 %) PD. Median survival since first TACP was 8. 1 months. Responders (CR+PR) showed a significant survival advantage over patients with tumor progression (13. 0 vs. 6. 0 months; p = 0. 013). For TACP of the liver, the radiological results were 1 CR, 19 PR, 19 SD, and 16 PD, in total. Of that, 5 PR, 3 SD, and 4 PD accounted for CRC, 1 CR, 4 PR, and 6 SD for BC, and 2 PR, 2 SD, and 6 PD for CCC patients. Median survival since first TACP was 9. 7 months for CRC, 11. 4 months for BC, and 6. 0 months for CCC patients. Conclusion: TACP with the novel combination of mitomycin/gemcitabine represents a well tolerable, minimally invasive, and safe technique for the palliative treatment of advanced tumor stages, locally recurrent tumors, and metastases of the pelvis, the pancreas, and the liver. Even in multiple pretreated, therapy-resistant tumors a tumor response/growth control (= CR+PR+SD) could be achieved in 17 %/ 67 % (pelvis), 30 %/ 70 % (pancreas), and 36 %/ 71 % (liver). Patients with pancreatic carcinoma who responded to TACP had a significantly survival benefit compared to patients with tumor progression. Tumor-related complaints could be relieved in 54 % (pelvis) and 62. 5 % (pancreas). For all these reasons, intraarterial chemotherapy should be considered as a treatment option in palliative, oncological patient care...|$|R
