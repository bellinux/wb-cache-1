50|$|<b>A</b> popcorn <b>ceiling</b> (slang), {{also known}} as <b>a</b> cottage cheese <b>ceiling,</b> <b>a</b> stucco <b>ceiling</b> or {{formally}} <b>an</b> acoustic <b>ceiling,</b> is <b>a</b> term for a spray-on or paint-on ceiling treatment. It was the standard for bedroom and residential hallway ceilings for its bright, white appearance, ability to hide imperfections, and acoustical characteristics. In comparison, kitchen and living room ceilings would normally be finished in smoother skip-trowel or orange peel texture for their higher durability and ease of cleaning.|$|R

The other seven existing tenants of the building vacated their businesses after the building was sold, and were each paid a compensation sum.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2009, a {{photograph}} was taken at a DPJ rally for the House of Representatives election showing a banner that was hanging from <b>a</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The banner {{was made of}} two Hinomaru flags cut and sewn together to form {{the shape of the}} DPJ logo. This infuriated the LDP and Prime Minister Tarō Asō, saying this act was unforgivable. In response, DPJ President Yukio Hatoyama (who voted for the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem) said that the banner was not the Hinomaru and should not be regarded as such.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} {{were influenced}} by Inigo Jones, but executed by his heir John Webb, a fact confirmed many years later when the National Trust discovered Webb's plans during their formal takeover of the estate. The interiors mostly date from about 1835. The hall has a barrel-vaulted high ceiling with painted decoration and the dining room has panelled walls, tapestries and a decorated plaster ceiling. The library has <b>a</b> <b>ceiling</b> painting attributed to Guido Reni. The staircase is of white marble with turned balusters and a relief frieze, its ornamented ceiling being attributed to Giorgione.|$|E
50|$|The Library has <b>a</b> {{panelled}} <b>ceiling</b> with diamond motifs. It contains imitation Jacobean panelling and a Jacobean fireplace {{from the}} now-demolished Marton Hall.

5000|$|Ceilings are {{classified}} {{according to their}} appearance or construction. <b>A</b> cathedral <b>ceiling</b> is any tall ceiling area {{similar to those in}} a church. <b>A</b> dropped <b>ceiling</b> is one in which the finished surface is constructed anywhere from a few inches or centimetres to several feet or a few metres below the structure above it. This may be done for aesthetic purposes, such as achieving <b>a</b> desirable <b>ceiling</b> height; or practical purposes such as acoustic damping or providing a space for HVAC or piping. An inverse of this would be a raised floor. A [...] or barrel-shaped ceiling is curved or rounded upward, usually for visual or acoustical value, while <b>a</b> coffered <b>ceiling</b> is divided into a grid of recessed square or octagonal panels, also called a [...] "lacunar ceiling". <b>A</b> cove <b>ceiling</b> uses <b>a</b> curved plaster transition between wall and ceiling; it is named for cove molding, a molding with a concave curve. <b>A</b> stretched <b>ceiling</b> (or stretch <b>ceiling)</b> uses <b>a</b> number of individual panels using material such as PVC fixed to a perimeter rail.|$|R

5|$|The primary {{design change}} between the earlier F-5E and the F-5G {{was the use}} of a single General Electric F404 engine that was {{originally}} designed for the F/A-18 Hornet. The new engine provided 60% more thrust than the combined output of the F-5E's two General Electric J85s. This improved the aircraft's thrust-to-weight ratio from 1.0 to 1.13. The new engine gave a speed of over Mach2.0, <b>a</b> <b>ceiling</b> over 55,000ft (16,800m), an initial climb rate of 52,800ft per minute (16,100m/min).|$|E
5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} in {{imitation}} of the sky. It was reported in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is <b>a</b> <b>ceiling</b> over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a feature of the same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished {{to stay within the}} 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with <b>a</b> <b>ceiling</b> on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that {{the federal government}} was still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E

5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided <b>a</b> <b>ceiling</b> for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E
5|$|Exhibits include cannons {{at the gun}} ports with shot, {{ropes and}} firing equipment, and old muskets and matchlocks.

5|$|The 1998–99 NBA lockout was {{the third}} lockout of four {{in the history of}} the National Basketball Association (NBA). It lasted from July 1, 1998, to January 20, 1999, and forced the 1998–99 regular season to be {{shortened}} to 50 games per team and that season's All-Star Game to be canceled. NBA owners reopened the league's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in March 1998, seeking changes to the league's salary cap system and <b>a</b> <b>ceiling</b> on individual player salaries. The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) opposed the owners' plans and wanted raises for players who earned the league's minimum salary. After the two sides failed to reach an agreement, the owners began the lockout.|$|E
5|$|The Hall of Ambassadors ("Sala dos Embaixadores"), {{sometimes}} called the throne room or the Hall of Mirrors, was designed by Robillon in 1757 {{and is one of}} the largest reception rooms in the palace. This long low room has <b>a</b> <b>ceiling</b> painted by Francisco de Melo which depicts the Portuguese royal family attending a concert during the reign of Queen Maria I. The room is extremely wide and light, spanning the full width of the palace, with tall windows on both sides. Between each window is a semi-circular gilt console table above which are pier glasses adorned with crystal sconces. The throne dais, set in an apse, is flanked by gilded and mirrored columns, and the floor is a chequer board pattern of black and white marble tiles.|$|E
5|$|The chancel, {{which has}} <b>a</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{decorated}} by C. E.

A south porch was built in 1621 at the behest of Dr Robert Burton, whose arms are carved in the gable above the date. A candelabrum given by Ann Kendall in 1705 hangs in the chancel. The chancel ceiling was decorated with a pattern of gold stars on a blue background in 1914. Two years later, an altar was erected at the east end of the north aisle, and an aumbry placed in the north wall of the chancel. The royal arms of William IV are displayed in the tower.|$|E

40|$|The {{means for}} {{predicting}} ceiling jet temperature under <b>an</b> unconfined <b>ceiling</b> {{has been well}} established by the previous work under <b>an</b> unconfined <b>ceiling.</b> However, <b>a</b> room <b>ceiling</b> is usually enclosed by walls so a fire plume rises in a stratified environment {{in the event of}} room fire. Previous work under <b>an</b> unconfined <b>ceiling</b> will not be sufficient to predict the ceiling jet temperature in such a configuration. On the other hand, a two layer zone model is often used for predicting fire temperature in a stratified configuration but it only gives average condition in the upper layer, which is too crude to predict the near ceiling temperature to assess the actuation of ceiling mounted detectors and sprinklers. In this study, <b>a</b> formula for <b>ceiling</b> jet temperature in a two layer configuration was derived by combining previous work under <b>an</b> unconfined <b>ceiling,</b> upper layer temperature and layer interface height. The validity of the formula was examined by comparing the results of prediction and the experiments using the test fires prescribed in an ISO/TC 21 /SC 3 draft standard. The predicted ceiling temperatures generally exhibit satisfactory agreement with the measured temperatures...|$|R
