5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes {{hypercoagulability}} or a prothrombotic state) is an <b>abnormality</b> {{of blood}} coagulation {{that increases the}} risk of thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessels). Such abnormalities can be identified in 50% of people who have an episode of thrombosis (such as deep vein thrombosis in the leg) that was not provoked by other causes. A significant proportion of the population has a detectable <b>abnormality,</b> but most of these only develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of multiple congenital <b>abnormalities</b> and/or mental retardation (MCA/MR) {{is always a}} challenge to clinicians. The recognition of specific physical or behavioral characteristics can vastly improve diagnostic yield. Chromosomal <b>abnormalities</b> account for a high percentage in the etiology of MCA/MR. In this study, frequency of chromosomal <b>abnormalities</b> was 4. 81 % of 457 patients. Chromosomal <b>abnormalities</b> and polymorphisms were detected in 65 (14. 21 %) (structural and numerical chromosomal <b>abnormalities</b> in 22 patients and polymorphisms in 43) of 457 MR and/or MCA patients. Our results show that chromosomal <b>abnormalities</b> contribute much to the causation of multiple malformations and/or MR.

5|$|FH is {{classified}} as a type 2 familial dyslipidemia. There are five types of familial dyslipidemia (not including subtypes), and each are classified from both the altered lipid profile and by the genetic <b>abnormality.</b> For example, high LDL (often due to LDL receptor defect) is type 2. Others include defects in chylomicron metabolism, triglyceride metabolism, and metabolism of other cholesterol-containing particles, such as VLDL and IDL.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is an <b>abnormality</b> of the {{hip joint}} which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed in the database.|$|E

Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment <b>abnormality</b> associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphisms (normal variations) in {{particular}} genes {{have been linked}} with {{an increased risk of}} severe dengue complications. Examples include the genes coding for the proteins known as TNFα, mannan-binding lectin, CTLA4, TGFβ, DC-SIGN, PLCE1, and particular forms of human leukocyte antigen from gene variations of HLA-B. A common genetic <b>abnormality,</b> especially in Africans, known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, appears to increase the risk. Polymorphisms in the genes for the vitamin D receptor and FcγR seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies of}} FH cohorts suggest that {{additional}} risk factors are generally at play {{when a person}} develops atherosclerosis. In addition to the classic risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes, genetic {{studies have shown that}} a common <b>abnormality</b> in the prothrombin gene (G20210A) increases the risk of cardiovascular events in people with FH. Several studies found that a high level of lipoprotein(a) was an additional risk factor for ischemic heart disease. The risk was also found to be higher in people with a specific genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).|$|E

METHODS: The large population-based dataset of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital <b>Abnormalities,</b> 1980 - 1996. RESULTS: A total of 156 cases with unclassified multiple congenital <b>abnormalities</b> including microtia and anotia were analyzed according to the number of 2 - 9 component congenital <b>abnormalities.</b> The comparison of the distribution and frequency of component congenital <b>abnormalities</b> in these cases showed significant differences from the data of other unclassified multiple congenital <b>abnormalities.</b> Of the 156 cases, registry diagnosis was possible in 48 (30. 8 %) cases. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of available dataset of unclassified multiple anotia and microtia may help the delineation of new syndromes and associations with better prognosis and recurrence risk estimation, thus finally a better chance for their prevention...|$|R

5|$|The {{condition}} {{has been}} linked with genetic mutations in genes that code for certain ion channels that transport electrolytes (sodium and potassium) across cell membranes. The main ones are the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit and potassium inward rectifier 2.6; it is therefore classified as a channelopathy. The <b>abnormality</b> in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into cells, under conditions of high thyroxine (thyroid hormone) levels, usually with an additional precipitant.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} {{prominent}} {{features on the}} ECG: the P wave (atrial depolarisation), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarisation) and the T wave (ventricular repolarisation). As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. A downward deflection on the ECG implies cells are becoming more positive in charge ("depolarising") {{in the direction of}} that lead, whereas an upward inflection implies cells are becoming more negative ("repolarising") {{in the direction of the}} lead. This depends on the position of the lead, so if a wave of depolarising moved from left to right, a lead on the left would show a negative deflection, and a lead on the right would show a positive deflection. The ECG is a useful tool in detecting rhythm disturbances and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. Testing when exercising can be used to provoke an <b>abnormality,</b> or an ECG can be worn for a longer period such as a 24-hour Holter monitor if a suspected rhythm <b>abnormality</b> is not present at the time of assessment.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for {{hyperthermia}} includes reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine.

5|$|As {{many as half}} of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels {{may have}} a {{congenital}} blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers {{are the most common}} cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a congenital <b>abnormality</b> found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.|$|E
5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic <b>abnormality,</b> can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because {{of obstruction of}} the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital <b>abnormality.</b> Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E
