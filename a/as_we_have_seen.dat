5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> Hachiman {{played an}} {{important}} role in the evolution of temple-shrines, and is still the tutelary kami of many important temples, among them Tōdai-ji, Daian-ji, Yakushi-ji and Tō-ji.|$|E
25|$|If we use regular subdivisions and {{left-hand}} or right-hand Riemann sums, {{then the}} two terms on the left are equal to zero, since every endpoint except 0 and 1 will be irrational, but <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the term on the right will equal 1.|$|E
60|$|There, in {{the coffin}} lay no longer the foul Thing that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> so dreaded and grown to hate {{that the work of}} her {{destruction}} was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> her in life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that there were there, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> them in life, the traces of care and pain and waste. But these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.|$|R
60|$|She stopped {{suddenly}} {{as if to}} listen. I too listened; {{but there was no}} sound in the house: and I knew that the old priest was lying still in his coffin <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> him, solemn and truculent in death, an idle chalice on his breast.|$|R
6000|$|We {{passed between}} Lemnos and Mytilene, and saw them <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Elba and the Balearic Isles--mere bulky shapes, with the {{softening}} mists of distance upon them--whales in a fog, as it were. Then we held our course southward, {{and began to}} [...] "read up" [...] celebrated Smyrna.|$|R
25|$|The {{responsible}} government minister, King O'Malley, {{drove the}} first survey peg in the Canberra area on 20 February 1913 to mark commencement {{of work on}} the new city. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> on 12 March that same year, the city was formally named by the Governor-General's wife, Lady Denman, at a ceremony held on Capital Hill, the site of Australia's current Parliament House.|$|E
25|$|The {{anomalous}} {{dimensions in}} certain two-dimensional CFTs {{can be related}} to the typical fractal dimensions of random walks, where the random walks are defined via Schramm–Loewner evolution (SLE). <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> above, CFTs describe the physics of phase transitions, and so one can relate the critical exponents of certain phase transitions to these fractal dimensions. Examples include the 2d critical Ising model and the more general 2d critical Potts model. Relating other 2d CFTs to SLE is an active area of research.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> Wagner {{sketched out}} {{the theme for}} the Ride of the Valkyries on 23 July 1851; other than this, the {{earliest}} musical sketches for Die Walküre date from the summer of 1852. But {{it was not until}} 28 June 1854 that Wagner began to transform these into a complete draft of all three acts of the opera. This preliminary draft (Gesamtentwurf), which was completed by 27 December 1854, was written in pencil and shows a greater degree of orchestral elaboration than the corresponding draft of Das Rheingold.|$|E
60|$|There lay Lucy, {{seemingly}} just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> her {{the night}} before her funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever, and I {{could not believe that}} she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than before, and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.|$|R
60|$|I was {{too eager}} to wait for more, but ran to {{the banks of the}} river, which at that place was fully a mile wide. The moon was bright, and we could see the {{familiar}} sheet of ice as still and cold <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it every day for many months past.|$|R
60|$|It {{was at this}} {{touching}} {{moment that}} the pantaloon hobbled in, also dressed <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> him last, and carrying, unfortunately, a trayful of sausages, which at once increased the general gloom, for he announced, in his squeaky voice, {{that they were the}} very sausages that had lately been the dog.|$|R
25|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more.

25|$|If atheism {{is defined}} as disbelief in {{existence}} of a God, then Jainism cannot be labeled as atheistic, as it not only believes in existence of gods {{but also of the}} soul which can attain godhood. As Paul Dundas puts it – “while Jainism is, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> atheist in a limited sense of rejection of both the existence of a creator God and the possibility of intervention of such a being in human affairs, it nonetheless must be regarded as a theist religion in the more profound sense that it accepts the existence of divine principle, the paramātmā i.e. God, existing in potential state within all beings”.|$|E
25|$|First, the Legio Maria church {{recognises}} salvation through Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The discontinuity with orthodox {{theology is}} that the Son of God has been incarnated in multiple contexts, rejecting the orthodox doctrine of Christ taking a human body and soul for eternity. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in the above research, none of these incarnations are considered exclusive; they only serve to reveal Christ to people of different contexts. All who are saved through any of these incarnations of Christ will worship God together in heaven. Thus, for the Legio Church, salvation is found through Christ, as revealed in their particular Messias Simeo Ondeto.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2002, The Future of War {{was placed}} on the Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien index in Germany, meaning that it may not be advertised or sold to minors. According to band member Alec Empire, Future of War was notable for its [...] "left-rooted {{critique}} of the 'modern' high-tech-war, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it all some years previously during the Gulf War." ...|$|R

25|$|Both in {{the artistic}} {{and in the}} worldly sense, the career of Bellini was, on the whole, very prosperous. His long career began with Quattrocento styles but matured into the {{progressive}} post-Giorgione Renaissance styles. He lived to see his own school far outshine that of his rivals, the Vivarini of Murano; he embodied, with growing and maturing power, all the devotional gravity and much also of the worldly splendour of the Venice of his time; and he saw his influence propagated {{by a host of}} pupils, two of whom at least, Giorgione and Titian, equalled or even surpassed their master. Giorgione he outlived by five years; Titian, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> challenged him, claiming an equal place beside his teacher. Other pupils of the Bellini studio included Girolamo Galizzi da Santacroce, Vittore Belliniano, Rocco Marconi, Andrea Previtali and possibly Bernardino Licinio.|$|E
25|$|The {{logic of}} this {{concession}} points irresistibly to {{the contention that}} the Thirteenth Amendment operates only to protect the African race. This {{is evident from the}} fact that nowhere in the record does it appear that the parties charged to have been wronged by the defendants had ever been themselves slaves, or were the descendants of slaves. They took no more from the Amendment than any other citizens of the United States. But if, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> that denounces a condition possible for all races and all individuals, then a like wrong perpetrated by white men upon a Chinese, or by black men upon a white man, or by any men upon any man on account of his race, would come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and that protection of individual rights which, prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, was unquestionably within the jurisdiction solely of the states, would, by virtue of that Amendment, be transferred to the nation, and subject to the legislation of Congress.|$|E
25|$|In another {{paper with}} Simon Johnson at Massachusetts Institute of Technology called The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, the authors use a natural {{experiment}} {{in history to}} show that different institutions result in different levels of economic growth. The paper examines institutional choices {{during the colonial period}} of several nations in relation to the same nations' economic development today. It found that in countries where the disease environment meant that it was hard for colonizers to survive (high mortality rate), they tended to set up extractive regimes, which resulted in poor economic growth today. In places where it was easier for colonizers to survive (low mortality rates), however, they tended to settle down and duplicate institutions from their country of origin—especially from Britain, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in the colonial success of Australia and United States. Thus, the mortality rate among colonial settlers several hundred years ago has determined the economic growth of today's post-colonial nations by setting institutions on very different paths.|$|E
60|$|Yes, at {{last one}} thing did happen. The {{light from the}} sheet of flame died {{gradually}} away as the flame itself sank downwards into the abysses of the pit. But about this in itself there was nothing wonderful, for <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> with our own eyes from afar this fire varied much, and indeed it was customary for it to die down at the approach of dawn, which now drew very near.|$|R
60|$|When {{we walked}} out on the terrace of our hotel at Algeciras after breakfast, the first morning, we were greeted by the {{familiar}} form of the Rock of Gibraltar still advertising, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it three years before, a well-known American insurance company. It rose beyond five miles of land-locked water, which we were to cross every other day for three weeks on many idle and anxious errands, until we sailed from it at last for New York.|$|R

25|$|The {{diplomatic}} unrest {{around this}} question disturbed De Witt no end. His initial relations with Louis {{had been very}} amicable. In 1662 he renewed the old alliance with France, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> and this alliance was helpful in the conflict with England and Munster, when the French sent auxiliary troops to help shore up the Dutch eastern defenses in 1665. Except for the Caribbean, France did not {{take part in the}} war with England. As a matter of fact the new French West India Company, formed in 1664, took Cayenne by force away from the WIC in 1665, but the Dutch were forced to grin and bear this, because of the ongoing war with England at the time. But the way Louis was acting in the matter of the Spanish Netherlands made De Witt anxious that the old partition treaty should not become operational. It offered a number of equally unpalatable prospects for the Dutch: unwanted incorporation of Antwerp (the blockade of which was now enshrined in the peace treaty of 1648 with Spain) would open up that city's trade; and a resurgent France as an immediate neighbor would necessitate the building up of the standing army, an expense the regents wanted to avoid at all costs.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch States-Party regents were no pacifists. When Portugal {{refused to}} make amends for its reconquest of the colonies in Africa (Angola) and America (Dutch Brazil) from the WIC in 1648, the {{shareholders}} of that company who were heavily represented in Zeeland and in the land provinces (Overijssel and Guelders), convinced the States General to declare war on Portugal in 1657 (though the company had expressly been given sovereign powers {{to take care of}} its own affairs). Though this stretched Dutch naval resources rather thin, just at the time the business with Sweden in the Sound had to be dealt with, the Dutch blockaded Lisbon for a while, and Dutch privateers hampered Portuguese shipping. The Dutch did most of their damage in Ceylon and India, however, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> above. These Dutch successes stimulated England (that had been sabotaging the Luso-Dutch peace negotiations, because the war helped reserve Portuguese trade to themselves) to drop their objections to the Treaty of The Hague (1661). In this treaty, De Witt's conviction that trade was more important than colonial possessions, and that the war had been a mistake, got the upper hand. The Republic dropped its demands for restitution of the lost colonies in exchange for a handsome indemnity. But the damage to Luso-Dutch relations had already been done, and the Republic was never again able to replace England in Portuguese trade.|$|E
25|$|Schleiermacher classifies {{the virtues}} under the {{two forms of}} Gesinnung ("disposition, attitude") and Fertigkeit ("dexterity, proficiency"), the first {{consisting}} of the pure ideal element in action and the second the form it assumes in relation to circumstances, {{each of the two}} classes falling respectively into the two divisions of wisdom and love and of intelligence and application. In his system the doctrine of duty is the description of the method of the attainment of ethical ends, the conception of duty as an imperative, or obligation, being excluded, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> No action fulfills the conditions of duty except as it combines the three following antitheses: reference to the moral idea in its whole extent and likewise to a definite moral sphere; connection with existing conditions {{and at the same time}} absolute personal production; the fulfillment of the entire moral vocation every moment though it can only be done in a definite sphere. Duties are divided with reference to the principle that every man make his own the entire moral problem and act at the same time in an existing moral society. This condition gives four general classes of duty: duties of general association or duties with reference to the community (Rechtspflicht), and duties of vocation (Berufspflicht) — both with a universal reference, duties of the conscience (in which the individual is sole judge), and duties of love or of personal association.|$|E

60|$|I {{saw that}} she would not leave me unless she thought that I could make that frightful dive <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Juag make it. I glanced once downward; then with a mental shrug I assured her that I would dive the mo-ment that she reached the boat. Satisfied, she began the descent carefully, yet swiftly. I watched her for a moment, my heart in my mouth lest some slight mis-step or the {{slipping}} of a finger-hold should pitch her to a frightful death upon the rocks below.|$|R
60|$|First I saw Ragnall run {{up with a}} {{rifle and}} fire two barrels at the brute's head, of which he took no notice whatsoever. Then I saw his wife, who in this land {{was known as the}} Guardian of the Child, issuing from the portals of the second court, dressed in her goddess robes, wearing the cap of bird's feathers, {{attended}} by the two priestesses also dressed <b>as</b> goddesses, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> her on the morning of sacrifice, and holding in front of her the statue of the Ivory Child.|$|R
500|$|Michael Tedder of Vulture {{awarded the}} episode—along with [...] "Junior Salesman"—four stars out of five. He enjoyed Kevin's telling off the Senator for his poor {{treatment}} {{of his friends}} and family, and said [...] "that it came with Kevin's halting delivery just made it better." [...] However, he was critical of the Brian subplot, calling it [...] "the least interesting way this camera crew reveal could have gone". Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode a 7 out of 10, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. Despite noting that the show itself was still good in comparison to much of television, Cornet wrote that the episode {{is an example of the}} [...] "danger of needlessly dragging things out, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the waste of ending things before they have had the opportunity to reach their full potential in the past." [...] Cornet praised Kevin's [...] "truth bomb", writing that it [...] "worked beautifully", but she called [...] "the 'man behind the curtain' reveal ... a bitter disappointment" [...] and a [...] "cop-out" [...] to engage the audience.|$|E
500|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the significance of}} these formulae, the annihilation of a particle with its antiparticle in free space must result in the creation of at least two photons for the following reason. In the center of momentum frame, the colliding antiparticles have no net momentum, whereas a single photon always has momentum (since, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> it is determined by the photon's frequency or wavelength, which cannot be zero). Hence, conservation of momentum (or equivalently, translational invariance) requires that at least two photons are created, with zero net momentum. (However, it is possible if the system interacts with another particle or field for the annihilation to produce one photon, as when a positron annihilates with a bound atomic electron, it is possible for only one photon to be emitted, as the nuclear Coulomb field breaks translational symmetry.) The energy of the two photons, or, equivalently, their frequency, may be determined from conservation of four-momentum. Seen another way, the photon can be considered as its own antiparticle. The reverse process, pair production, is the dominant mechanism by which high-energy photons such as gamma rays lose energy while passing through matter. That process is the reverse of [...] "annihilation to one photon" [...] allowed in the electric field of an atomic nucleus.|$|E
