It was released on September 12, 2008 by Big Machine Records, as the lead single from Swift's second studio album Fearless (2008). The song was written about a love interest of Swift's who was not popular among Swift's family and friends. Because of the scenario, Swift related to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597) and {{used it as a}} source of inspiration to compose the song.

500|$|Whitney Balliett {{stated that}} Flanagan {{was the most}} {{consistent}} of the pianists influenced by Wilson, Tatum and Cole, and invariably created something new in his playing: he [...] "often states the melody with dissonant, levering chords played offbeat or staccato. Never decorative, they [...] reveal both a respect for the melody and an intense desire to alter it"; during his main improvising, he used [...] "interval-filled descending figures [...] charging rhythmic phrases whose accented first notes make the succeeding notes snap, double-time phrases that race ahead to clear the way, and legato phrases that form sauntering rear guards." [...] In a review of a 1989 concert, Feather commented that Flanagan used [...] "subtle dynamic shadings", while [...] "bursts of upsweeping chords sometimes lent an element of surprise, with a nimble left hand offering graceful filigree fills" [...] and occasional musical quotes that added humor. Other techniques he employed were, in Stanley Crouch's description, [...] "crooning effects achieved by manipulating the pedals, holding down keys long enough to sustain notes in decisively different ways, and working out inflections that evoke the voice – sighs, moans, swells, purrs". Critic John S. Wilson described Flanagan's solo piano style on ballads in 1978: [...] "He drifts through ballads with <b>a</b> <b>dreamy</b> langourous flow, {{but it is not}} a soft or flabby style. There is, beneath the surface, a vitality that gives it a lean, swinging character".|$|E
500|$|The album's {{style and}} themes are {{exemplified}} by the bookending track [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother", with Scott-Heron's bluesy, jazzy vocals and Afrocentric lyrics accompanied by Jackson's soulful piano arrangements. It features <b>a</b> <b>dreamy,</b> moody soundscape, produced by Jackson's Rhodes electric piano, which evokes the In a Silent Way-era jazz of Miles Davis. [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother" [...] has Scott-Heron criticizing the selfishness of certain members of his generation, {{as well as people}} for forgetting their common humanity. The song continues to examine the significance of a person's cultural roots, regardless of where they prove to blossom. [...] "Rivers of My Fathers" [...] is the album's longest track and features drummer Bob Adams' swing-style drum rim shots and pianist Jackson’s wide, blocky chords, play in a blue-influenced style. Scott-Heron uses the water motif, a common metaphor in African-American culture, to evoke feelings of home and freedom and represent faith, amid the frustrations of a modern black man. As the opening verse and chorus suggest, [...] "Looking for {{a way out of this}} confusion/I'm looking for a sign, carry me home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of my fathers, could you carry me home." [...] The narrator beseeches the [...] "river" [...] to deliver him home, which is revealed at the last seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently whispers [...] "Africa".|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] is {{credited}} as a ballad {{compared to the}} rest of the dance-fuelled tracks from The Fame. It is a 1980s-influenced synthpop and bubblegum pop song, while incorporating the [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] hook from Rihanna's single [...] "Umbrella", according to Freedom du Lac from The Washington Post. Gaga stated that the lyrics of [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] are about love and she explained that [...] "'Eh, Eh' is my simple pop song about finding someone new and breaking up with the old boyfriend." [...] Writer James E. Perone mentioned in his book The Album: A Guide to Pop Music's Most Provocative, Influential, and Important Creations that with the lyrics, Gaga maintained a focus on transitory relationships. Although the lyrics explained her former lover that she had found someone new and did not mean to hurt him with the news, the continuous repetition of the phrase [...] "nothing else I can say" [...] solidifies the transient nature of the relationship portrayed. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 94 beats per minute. Gaga's vocal range spans from B3 to C5 with the main key in which the song is set being E major. The song follows in the chord progression of E–B–Fm–E–B–Fm. Synthpop musician Frankmusik remixed the track for Gaga's 2010 album, The Remix, where he manipulated Gaga's vocals and created <b>a</b> <b>dreamy</b> quality with them, as noted by Nicki Escuedo from Phoenix New Times.|$|E

[...] Picking out [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] {{as one of the}} four top tracks of the album, Spence D of IGN Music added that the song slows things down, allowing for Knowles' [...] "crystal clear vocals to take some down time and relinquish up <b>a</b> <b>dreamy,</b> creamy sound that is playfully sensuous." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic described [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] as [...] "a deceptively sweet, rainbow-colored track" [...] where purrs - that are sound made by all species of felids and are a part of cat communication - are more like [...] "claws-out dismissals." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times called the song a [...] "cooing [...] sighing" [...] one. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was [...] "the only mid-tempo break" [...] until {{the very end of the}} album. Darryl Sterdan, writing for the Canadian website Jam!, said that the song is just about what you think. Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine commented that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] seems to be an obvious tracks produced by The Neptunes.

500|$|The film {{received}} widespread acclaim. Kate Stables {{wrote in}} Sight & Sound: [...] "Elegant restraint is the film’s watchword ... In this enjoyably deliberate film, each shot and scene is carefully composed {{to pay homage}} to 50s cinema, yet infused with an emotional ambiguity which feels decidedly contemporary." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said: [...] " [...] has made a serious melodrama about the geometry of desire, <b>a</b> <b>dreamy</b> example of heightened reality that fully engages emotions despite the exact calculations with which it's been made... 'Carol's' lush but controlled visual look is completely intoxicating. This is filmmaking done by masters, an experience to savor." [...] A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: [...] "At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, 'Carol' is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros. With sparse dialogue and restrained drama, the film is a symphony of angles and glances, of colors and shadows." [...] Amy Taubin from Film Comment said: [...] "The narrative, precisely chiseled by Phyllis Nagy from the ungainly novel, is deceptively simple ... What's remarkable about Carol is that it seems to exist entirely in the present moment—to be precise, in that electric, elastic, heart-stopping/heart-racing present of romantic desire. It is a film composed of gestures and glances, its delicacy a veiled promise of abandon. And it could not exist without the extraordinary performances of Blanchett and Mara." [...] David Stratton of The Australian wrote: [...] "The meeting of these two women is an electrifying scene; their eyes make contact, and nothing of significance is said, apart from the usual interaction between shopper and shop assistant, but Haynes and his wonderful actors make it very clear that something momentous has occurred — love at first sight." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Isobel" [...] was filmed {{for two days}} in a forest in Dolgellau, near Llangollen, Wales. The crew used a Mitchell S35 camera with varispeed {{to be able to}} rewind the camera and do superimpositions and masks, {{inspired}} by Georges Méliès' work. The final music video was projected in 35mm for the crew in a cinema in London; with its varying exposures, lighting effects and monochromatic scheme, it resembles an early film. [...] "Isobel" [...] represents the story of the title character Björk envisioned with Sjón. It tells the story of [...] "a wild child discovering urban culture through installations of toy fighter planes", over lush superimposed imagery. Like in the lyrics, where Björk takes the role of narrator and protagonist, she plays two different parts in the music video: Björk is seen as the Isobel who [...] "weaves and composes this world and this story on her organ", and as the Isobel who inhabits this primal world. Water is the primary feature of her world, Gondry using it as <b>a</b> <b>dreamy</b> transition tool between scenes. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine included the video in his list of the Top 10 Björk Music Videos, describing it as [...] "surreal [...] visually striking". Ed Gonzalez of the same publication described it as [...] "Jean Epstein-ian kabuki horror." [...] The music video for [...] "Hyperballad" [...] has been described as [...] "a techno-dream visual story full of flashing lights, buzzing static, and holograms." [...] It shows Björk as [...] "a character running through a landscape that simulates that of a computer game, only to throw herself off a cliff." [...] The clip is an attempt to reflect the song's story, so Gondry depicted Björk lying down as a dead body, with a holographic image of her singing superimposed on her. Rick Poynor writes, [...] "White metamorphosed her head, using cyberscan data, into a stone." [...] The video demonstrated the musician's [...] " [...] the computer's shape-shifting powers." [...] Music writer Carol Vernallis felt Gondry developed texture with an aesthetic that does not become [...] "too coy or sickly sweet" [...] by incorporating [...] "a whiff of death"; pointing out that in the video, [...] "Björk's head resembles a death mask". Henry Keazor and Thorsten Wübbena considered that the clip [...] " [...] taught us that electronic bodies are rather intangible, dematerialized, purer in a certain way." [...] The music video, with its play on the boundaries between real and virtual, has been absorbed by club culture, {{as a representative of the}} scene's visual forms of expression.|$|E
