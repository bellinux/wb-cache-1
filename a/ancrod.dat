50|$|<b>Ancrod</b> (current brand name: Viprinex) is a defibrinogenating agent {{derived from}} the venom of the Malayan pit viper. Defibrinogenating blood {{produces}} an anticoagulant effect. <b>Ancrod</b> is not approved or marketed in any country.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004 NTI {{acquired}} Empire Pharmaceuticals, {{which had}} one product: <b>ancrod</b> (Viprinex). Empire had been formed by former employees of Knoll Pharmaceuticals, the German {{company that had}} discovered and started developing <b>ancrod,</b> and had acquired the rights to <b>ancrod</b> in 2002, after Knoll's acquisition by Abbott Laboratories in 2001. [...] NTI also acquired a batch of unpurified venom in the acquisition, and had that purified for use in its clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|Effects {{on other}} {{clotting}} factors: Unlike thrombin, <b>ancrod</b> {{does not directly}} activate Factor XIII, nor does it produce platelet aggregation nor cause the release of ADP, ATP, potassium, or serotonin from platelets. Platelet counts and survival time remain normal during <b>ancrod</b> therapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ancrod</b> {{decreases}} the blood viscosity in affected arteries, leads to less intense pain, improves physical limb mobility, and facilitates physical and ergo therapy. Finally, <b>ancrod</b> {{decreases the}} likelihood of local thrombotic events. These mechanisms also account for ancrod's activity in other diseases.|$|E
50|$|As of 2017 <b>ancrod</b> was not marketed for {{any medical}} use.|$|E
50|$|Category X : <b>Ancrod</b> was {{not found}} to be {{teratogenic}} in animal studies, but some fetal deaths occurred as a result of placental hemorrhages in animals given high doses; therefore, it should not be used during pregnancy as the defibrinogenation mechanism of <b>ancrod</b> might be expected to interfere with the normal implantation of the fertilized egg.|$|E
50|$|In {{clinical}} trials for ischemic stroke, <b>ancrod</b> increased {{the risk of}} intracebrral hemorrhage.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ancrod</b> was intensively {{studied in}} ischemic stroke, {{starting}} {{at least by}} the early 1990s. [...] An RCT called [...] "STAT" [...] was published in 2000; it included 500 subjects and <b>ancrod</b> or placebo was administered within three hours of the stroke. Ancrad showed modest benefits but a trend toward increased intracranial haemorrhage. A clinical trial published in 2006 found no benefit if <b>ancrod</b> was given within a wider 6 hour treatment window. [...] Another trial was launched to explore the 6 hour window, but it was halted early in 2008 when an independent review committee looked at the interim data and found no signal of benefit.|$|E
50|$|Thrombocytopenia as {{side effect}} {{has never been}} noticed with <b>ancrod</b> in {{contrast}} to heparin.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001 Knoll was {{acquired}} by Abbott Laboratories, and in 2002 Abbott licensed the rights to <b>ancrod</b> to Empire Pharmaceuticals, a startup that included a Knoll employee who had worked on <b>ancrod.</b> [...] In 2004 Empire {{was acquired}} by Neurobiological Technologies. [...] NTI also acquired a lot of unpurified venom in the acquisition, and had that purified for use in its clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ancrod</b> became NTI's lead product; in 2006 Frieman {{estimated}} {{annual sales}} $500 million to $1 billion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ancrod</b> {{has been}} shown to be useful for {{maintaining}} anticoagulation in the presence of Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and thrombosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{half-life}} of <b>ancrod</b> is 3 to 5 {{hours and}} the drug is cleared from blood plasma, mainly renally.|$|E
5000|$|I.M.-Injection : <b>Ancrod</b> {{should not}} be {{injected}} i.m., because of rapid induction of neutralizing antibodies and thus drug resistance.|$|E
50|$|The {{substance}} {{is intended for}} subcutaneous injection and intravenous infusion, and indirectly inhibits , adhesion, and release of thrombocytes mediated through the action of a fibrinogen degradation product (FDP). It also cleaves and therefore inactivates {{a significant part of}} circulating plasma fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is often found in increased concentrations in arteriae with impaired circulation. This leads to a pathologically increased blood viscosity and thereby to a worsening of symptoms of the circulation disorder (more intense pain, decreased mobility of the limb and decreased temperature, need for partial or even total limb amputation). The blood viscosity in patients receiving <b>ancrod</b> is progressively reduced by 30 to 40% of the pretreatment levels. The decreased viscosity is directly attributable to lowered fibrinogen levels and leads to important improvements in blood flow and perfusion of the microcirculation. Erythrocyte flexibility is not affected by normal doses of <b>ancrod.</b> The rheological changes are readily maintained and the viscosity approaches pretreatment values very slowly (within about 10 days) after stopping <b>ancrod.</b> One of the cleavage fibrinogen products, termed 'desAA-Fibrin', acts as cofactor for the tPA-induced plasminogen activation and an increased fibrinolysis results in return (profibrinolytic activity of <b>ancrod).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Ancrod</b> was {{originally}} {{isolated from the}} venom of the Malayan pit viper (Agkistrodon rhodostoma, also termed Calloselasma rhodostoma) and is a serine protease.|$|E

50|$|Under {{the brand}} name Arwin, <b>ancrod</b> was marketed for several decades in Germany and Austria, until it was {{withdrawn}} in the 1980s. Arwin was a brand name of Knoll Pharma.|$|E
50|$|A small study {{compared}} to <b>ancrod</b> to heparin in preventing thrombosis when given to people undergoing arterial graft surgery to treat {{peripheral arterial disease}} and found little {{difference between the two}} agents.|$|E
50|$|The {{failure of}} <b>ancrod</b> in the 6-hour window for ischemic stroke trial in 2008 led to cuts in staff, {{an effort to}} sell of the company's assets, and finally to the {{dissolution}} of NTI in August 2009.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the venom}} of a {{different}} species of pit viper, Calloselasma rhodostoma, is used to isolate a thrombin-like enzyme called <b>ancrod.</b> This enzyme is used clinically to break down and dissolve thrombi (blood clots) in patients and lower blood viscosity to help prevent heart attack and stroke.|$|E
5000|$|The newly {{discovered}} diversity of squamate species producing venoms is {{a treasure trove}} for those seeking to develop new pharmaceutical drugs; many of these venoms lower blood pressure, for example.

50|$|Neurobiological Technologies, Inc. ("NTI") was a {{biotechnology}} {{company that}} was founded in 1987 by Enoch Callaway and John B. Stuppin to in-license and develop drugs primarily to treat neurological conditions; the company was dissolved in 2009 after the failure of its drug candidate <b>ancrod</b> in a Phase III trial for ischemic stroke.|$|E
5000|$|Specific {{side effects}} are local and {{systemic}} bleeding events. Local bleeding events may {{be treated with}} local pressure or surgical dressings, if necessary. Compared with other anticoagulants the risk of systemic bleeding is relatively low. If systemic bleeding is severe enough to warrant fast reversal of <b>ancrod</b> action, fibrinogen should be substituted (please refer to section 'special antidotes').|$|E
5000|$|The company {{collapsed}} when a Phase III {{trial of}} <b>ancrod</b> was halted early in December 2008 when an independent review committee {{looked at the}} interim data and found no signal of benefit. [...] One of its main investors was the Biotechnology Value Fund, which {{put pressure on the}} company to dissolve and pay out its investors. [...] It cut staff in early 2009, then sought to sell off its assets, and finally dissolved in August 2009.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ancrod</b> has {{a triple}} mode of action. The exact {{structure}} and chemical data such as molecular weight are unknown, {{but it has}} been elaborated that the glycosylation of the molecule is an important factor. Glycosylation is remarkably homogenous with the major oligosaccharide accounting for approximately 90% of the total sugar content. Some in vitro reactions have been explored in detail (see ref. #2, www.blckwell-synergy). It was found that ancrod's actions are FAD dependent and that the substance has interesting apoptotic properties (causing programmed cell death), which remain to be explored.|$|E
40|$|Fibrin {{formed in}} {{response}} to <b>ancrod,</b> reptilase, or thrombin was reduced by β-mercaptoethanol and examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was found that <b>ancrod</b> progressively and totally digested the α-chains of fibrin monomers at sites different than plasmin; however, further digestion of fibrin monomers by either reptilase or thrombin was not observed. Highly purified <b>ancrod</b> did not activate fibrin-stabilizing factor (FSF); however, the reptilase preparation used in these experiments, like thrombin, activated FSF and thereby promoted cross-link formation. Fibrin, formed by clotting purified human fibrinogen with <b>ancrod,</b> reptilase, or thrombin for increasing periods {{of time in the}} presence of plasminogen, was incubated with urokinase and observed for complete lysis. Fibrin formed by <b>ancrod</b> was strikingly more vulnerable to plasmin digestion than was fibrin formed by reptilase or thrombin. The lysis times for fibrin formed for 2 hr by <b>ancrod,</b> reptilase, or thrombin were 18, 89, and 120 min, respectively. Evidence was also obtained that neither <b>ancrod</b> nor reptilase activated human plasminogen. These results indicate that fibrin formed by <b>ancrod</b> is not cross-linked and has significantly degraded α-chains: as expected, ancrod-formed fibrin is markedly susceptible to digestion by plasmin...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ancrod</b> (Arvin) on slow {{intravenous}} administration converts fibrinogen into fibrin {{at a rate}} which does not cause intravascular thrombosis. The fibrin is eliminated from the circulation and the blood is thus rendered incoagulable. To test the efficacy of <b>ancrod</b> {{in the prevention of}} thrombosis after prosthetic replacement of the heart valves, the tricuspid valve was replaced with a polypropylene mitral valve in 17 calves, using cardiopulmonary bypass. Five calves were eliminated from the study. Eleven calves were treated with <b>ancrod,</b> and one untreated calf was used as a control. Four out of five prosthetic valves in calves treated with <b>ancrod</b> for up to 72 hours were free of thrombus formation, and one out of three at one week. In the long-term study, fibrinogen titres rose after varying intervals, in spite of continual treatment with <b>ancrod.</b> This `escape' of fibrinogen titres from the control of <b>ancrod</b> may be due to species resistance or to the development of immunity. Further study is in progress to elucidate this point and to gain further knowledge for the clinical application of <b>ancrod...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—Ancrod, {{derived from}} Malayan pit viper venom, {{has been tested}} as ischemic stroke {{treatment}} in clinical trials with inconsistent results. We studied the actions of <b>ancrod</b> on fibrinolysis pathways in patient plasma samples and endothelial cell culture systems. Methods—We analyzed fibrinogen levels during the first 6 hours of <b>ancrod</b> infusion in patients entered in the Stroke Treatment with <b>Ancrod</b> Trial. For the in vitro study, human brain microvascular endothelial cells incubated with plasminogen or with human brain microvascular endothelial cell-conditioned medium were co-incubated with <b>ancrod</b> and fibrinogen under normal or oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions over 6 hours. Results—Fibrinogen levels decreased both in vivo and in vitro. <b>Ancrod</b> generated fibrinopeptide A, caused visible clot formation, and reduced levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen in the human brain microvascular endothelial cell system and in a cell-free system with conditioned media. Conclusions—The in vitro results indicate that <b>ancrod</b> causes local fibrin formation and secondary depletion of tissue-type plasminogen activator by binding to fibrin clot. Ancrod-induced fibrin formation could result in cerebral microvascular occlusion and may explain the suboptimal clinical effects of <b>ancrod</b> in human stroke trials. (Stroke. 2011; 42 : 3277 - 3280.) Key Words: <b>ancrod</b> defibrinogenation fibrinogen fibrinolysis ischemic stroke <b>Ancrod</b> has long been viewed as a potential treatment foracute ischemic stroke. 1 – 6 Derived from the venom of the Malayan pit viper Calloselasma rhodostoma, <b>ancrod</b> pos-sesses a serine protease that cleaves fibrinopeptide A (FPA) from fibrinogen. 6 – 9 This fibrinogenolytic effect underlies ancrod’s potential clinical benefit, which {{would be based on}} limited clot propagation, reduced plasma viscosity, improved microcirculatory flow, and activation of endogenous fibrinolysis. 6 – 9 However, results of <b>ancrod</b> in clinical trials of ischemic stroke have not been uniformly successful. Whereas the Stroke Treatment with <b>Ancrod</b> Trial (STAT) showed a favorable benefit–risk profile for patients with ischemic stroke treated within 3 hours of stroke onset, 2 the Europea...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ancrod</b> {{improves}} {{survival in}} murine systemic lupus erythematosus. The effect of <b>ancrod,</b> a defibrinating agent, on murine lupus glomerulonephritis {{in the male}} BXSB mouse was studied to determine the relationship between macrophage procoagulant activity (PCA), fibrin deposition and glomerulonephritis. Marked renal disease and fibrin deposition were noted by three months of age in control mice, whereas little or no disease was seen in <b>ancrod</b> treated mice until five months of age. Similar high titers of anti-DNA antibodies and renal deposition of IgG were seen in both groups of mice. PC A rose with age in both <b>ancrod</b> treated and untreated mice, although it was significantly higher in control animals than in the <b>ancrod</b> treated group. Furthermore, <b>ancrod</b> therapy resulted in a decrease in plasma PCA inducing activity (PIF) {{and a decrease in}} the effectiveness of PIF to induce PCA in peritoneal macrophages in vitro. No mortality was observed in the 20 <b>ancrod</b> treated mice, whereas 10 of 20 control animals died. We conclude that defibrination with <b>ancrod</b> delays the development of renal fibrin deposition and glomerulonephritis and improves survival in BXSB mice. This was associated with a decrease in plasma PCA inducing activity and with an inhibitory effect on PCA induction. These results suggest that PCA contributes to injury in murine lupus glomerulonephritis by promoting fibrin deposition...|$|E

40|$|Background Intravenous tissue {{plasminogen}} activator is the only approved specific treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. <b>Ancrod,</b> a natural defibrinogenating agent from snake venom, has proved to have a favourable effect when given within 3 h after an acute ischaemic stroke. The European Stroke Treatment with <b>Ancrod</b> Trial was undertaken to assess the effects of <b>ancrod</b> when given within 6 h. Methods 1222 patients with an acute ischaemic stroke were included in this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Brain CT scans were done to exclude intracranial haemorrhages and large evolving ischaemic infarctions. Patients were randomly assigned <b>ancrod</b> (n= 604) or placebo (n= 618). The primary outcome was functional success at 3 months (survival, Barthel Index of 95 or 100, or return to prestroke level). The analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, trial number NCT 00343174. Findings Functional success at 3 months did not differ between patients given <b>ancrod</b> (42 %) and those given placebo (42 %) (p= 0. 94, OR= 0. 99, 95 % CI, 0. 76 - 1. 29).
