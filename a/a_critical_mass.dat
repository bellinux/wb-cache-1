A study used specially-scented roach-sized robots that appear to the roaches as real to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass,</b> the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was an unusually light place.|$|E
5|$|Peierls {{knew the}} {{importance}} {{of the size of the}} critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{properties}} of plutonium-239 were also studied; {{researchers found that}} when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy.

This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E

5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (Implosion) group. Serber and Tolman had conceived implosion during the April 1943 conferences {{as a means}} of assembling pieces of fissionable material together to form <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass.</b> Neddermeyer took a different tack, attempting to crush a hollow cylinder into a solid bar. The idea was to use explosives to crush a subcritical amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass.</b> The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched uranium due to the danger of forming <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass.</b> Highly enriched uranium was also far more valuable than natural uranium, {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched uranium tetrafluoride.|$|E

5|$|Smith's metallurgists {{found ways}} of {{fabricating}} boron, producing beryllium bricks, and heat-treating steel. They {{also had to}} work with uranium. Frank Spedding had developed a large-scale process for producing pure uranium metal at the Ames Laboratory which was fine for producing tons of feed for the nuclear reactors, but enriched uranium could not be handled in this way, as it would form <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass.</b> Smith was initially asked to produce cubes of uranium hydride, which he did, but the 1950s uranium hydride bomb tests were found to be inefficient, and the idea was set aside for the duration, although further work was carried out after the war. By July 1944, they were producing pure uranium metal in 200g amounts with a newly devised process.|$|E

5|$|X-10 {{supplied}} the Los Alamos Laboratory {{with the first}} significant samples of plutonium. Studies of these by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos revealed that it contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240, which has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. This meant that it would be highly likely that a plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass.</b> The Los Alamos Laboratory was thus forced to turn its development efforts to creating an implosion-type nuclear weapon—a far more difficult feat.|$|E

The model also predicts <b>a</b> lower <b>critical</b> <b>mass,</b> which research groups should strive to achieve to avoid extinction.

Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass.</b> The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion — a far more difficult engineering task.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{building}} reactors in 1943. A group was created in Bacher's P Division, the P-7 (Water Boiler) Group, {{under the leadership of}} Donald Kerst, that included Charles P. Baker, Gerhart Friedlander, Lindsay Helmholtz, Marshall Holloway and Raemer Schreiber. Robert F. Christy from the T-1 Group provided support with the theoretical calculations, in particular, a calculation of the critical mass. He calculated that 600 grams of uranium-235 would form <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> in a tamper of infinite size. Initially it was planned to operate the Water Boiler at 10kW, but Fermi and Samuel K. Allison visited in September 1943, and went over the proposed design. They pointed out the danger of decomposition of the uranium salt, and recommended heavier shielding. It was also noted that radioactive fission products would be created {{that would have to be}} chemically removed. As a consequence, it was decided that the Water Boiler would only run at 1kW until more operating experience had been accumulated, and features needed for high power operation were shelved for the time being.|$|E

5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier {{under the direction}} of the physicist Seth Neddermeyer. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>mass.</b> The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design. In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material. He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.|$|E
