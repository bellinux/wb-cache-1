5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing <b>antitragus.</b> The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue). The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix, <b>antitragus,</b> and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{specialized}} cartilage piercings have since become popular. These include the tragus piercing, <b>antitragus</b> piercing, rook piercing, industrial piercing, helix piercing, orbital piercing, daith piercing, and conch piercing. In addition, earlobe stretching, while common in indigenous cultures {{for thousands of}} years, {{began to appear in}} Western society in the 1990s, and is now a fairly common sight. However, these forms of ear piercing are still infrequent compared to standard ear piercing.|$|E
50|$|An <b>antitragus</b> {{piercing}} is a perforation of {{the outer}} ear cartilage {{for the purpose of}} inserting and wearing a piece of jewelry. It is placed in the <b>antitragus,</b> a piece of cartilage opposite the ear canal. Overall, the piercing has characteristics similar to the tragus piercing; the piercings are performed and cared for in much the same way.|$|E
50|$|The <b>antitragus</b> can be {{much larger}} in some other species, most notably bats.|$|E
50|$|The funnel locking {{apparatus}} is oval; its cartilage is ear-shaped {{with one or}} two projections and a central depression. In Grilmalditeuthis, the apparatus is fused (but nuchal articulation is free); in Chiroteuthis both the tragus and <b>antitragus</b> are present, while in Planctoteuthis, only the <b>antitragus</b> is present. Also absent in Planctoteuthis are the funnel valve, tentacle pads, and distal suckers on the fourth arms.|$|E
50|$|The antitragicus muscle, an {{intrinsic}} muscle of the ear, {{arises from the}} outer part of the <b>antitragus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Incisura {{anterior}} auris, or intertragic incisure, or intertragal notch, is {{the space}} between the tragus and <b>antitragus</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|The antitragicus {{arises from}} the outer part of the <b>antitragus,</b> and is {{inserted}} into the cauda helicis and antihelix.|$|E

50|$|In human anatomy, the antitragicus {{arises from}} the outer part of the <b>antitragus,</b> and is {{inserted}} into the cauda helicis (or tail of the helix) and antihelix.|$|E
50|$|The intertragic notch is {{a feature}} of {{mammalian}} ear anatomy. In humans, it is the space that separates the tragus from the <b>antitragus</b> in the outer ear.|$|E
50|$|Ears: The {{shape of}} the pinnae is abnormal, with the {{superior}} edge of the pinna being turned over more than usual. The size of the tragus, <b>antitragus</b> and lobule may be small.|$|E
5000|$|In humans, it {{is a small}} {{tubercle}} on {{the visible}} part of the ear; the pinna. The <b>antitragus</b> is located just above the earlobe and points anteriorly. It is separated from the tragus by the intertragic notch.|$|E
50|$|Understanding {{the first}} deformational element is well recognized, and, despite limited {{attention}} to the second element, once seen, it is easily understood. Therefore, understanding the third element leads to understanding the surgical-technical approach to correcting the isolated lower-pole and lobule prominence. The latter feature of conchal shape, while not the sole cause of lobular prominence, appears to play a key role. As the cartilage angle, between the concha cavum and the <b>antitragus,</b> becomes more acute (i.e. as the <b>antitragus</b> tips closer towards the concha), this supporting structure outwardly projects the lobule and the lower-third of the ear. This feature has a greater influence upon the lobule position than does the commonly described helical tail.|$|E
50|$|Six major {{forms of}} the funnel locking {{apparatus}} are recognised among teuthids (lazy-T shape, inverted-T shape, straight shape, triangular shape, oval with tragus and/or <b>antitragus,</b> and oval shape) and several more {{are found in the}} sepioids (including the boomerang shape and keyhole shape).|$|E
5000|$|Ear print {{analysis}} {{is used as}} a means of forensic identification intended as an identification tool similar to fingerprinting. An earprint is a two-dimensional reproduction of the parts of the outer ear that have touched a specific surface (most commonly the helix, antihelix, tragus and <b>antitragus).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of the muscle is to adjusts {{the shape of the}} ear by pulling the <b>antitragus</b> and cauda helicis towards each other. While the muscle modifies the auricular shape only minimally in the majority of individuals, this action could increase the opening into the external acoustic meatus in some.|$|E
50|$|Females {{are larger}} than males. Dark brown to black above, and lighter below. Wing {{membrane}}, face, and ears are black. Wing membrane has no pale margins as that of Indian pipistrell. Muzzle short and broad. Nostrils small, rounded, and placed between facial swellings. Small ears with prominent tragus and <b>antitragus.</b> Fur is dense, short, silky, and covers entire body.|$|E
50|$|A tragus {{piercing}} is the perforation of the tragus, which projects {{immediately in}} front of the ear canal, for the purpose of inserting and wearing a piece of jewelry. The piercing itself is usually made with a small gauge hollow piercing needle, and typical jewelry would be a small diameter captive bead ring or small gauge post style piercing jewelry. A related piercing is known as the <b>antitragus</b> piercing.|$|E
50|$|In animal anatomy, Henry's pocket, more {{formally}} {{known as}} a cutaneous marginal pouch, is a fold of skin forming an open pouch on the lower posterior part of the external ear. The pocket is situated in the location occupied by the <b>antitragus</b> in the human ear. It occurs {{in a number of}} species, but is particularly noticeable on the domestic cat, Felis catus, as well as some dog breeds.|$|E
50|$|The ear has a helical margin that {{is pulled}} upward and towards the back. The {{anterior}} superior margins are rolled. Tragus and <b>antitragus</b> are small, lobulated and equal in size. The manus {{has a unique}} raided pads; the interdigital pads are separated from the palm by a structure called deep flex urge line. The palm consist of two elongated central pads, a hypothenar pad and a thenar pad.|$|E
5000|$|Mastigotragus is a genus of whip-lash squid {{containing}} a single species. This species was originally placed within Mastigoteuthis, {{but has been}} subsequently separated from other species in that genus due to multiple morphological characters. This genus {{is characterized by a}} lack of <b>antitragus</b> in the funnel-locking cartilage, larger sucker rings on the tentacles, a particular photophore morphology, and relatively large eyelid photophore. This genus is Latin for 'whip-lash goat'.|$|E

5000|$|The tragus {{is a small}} pointed {{eminence}} of {{the external}} ear, situated {{in front of the}} concha, and projecting backward over the meatus. It also is the name of hair growing at the entrance of the ear. Its name comes from the Greek: tragos, goat, and is descriptive of its general covering on its under surface with a tuft of hair, resembling a goat's beard. The nearby <b>antitragus</b> projects forwards and upwards.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Description== Bourret's {{horseshoe}} bat is {{of similar}} size {{to many other}} horseshoe bats, being on average 8.5 cm in total length, and weighing about 11 g. The fur is brown in colour, varying from almost black to a lighter, cinnamon, shade, and is paler on the animal's underside. Distinguishing features of the bat include a long, narrow, skull, unusually large ears, and a uniquely shaped nose-leaf. Apart from the nose-leaf, they most closely resemble the king horseshoe bat, but are smaller, with a longer, narrower <b>antitragus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Guianan bonneted bat appears {{similar to}} other mastiff bats, with a body about 18 cm long, and a tail {{measuring}} about 4 cm. The fur is dark chocolate brown in colour, and only slightly paler on the underside than {{on the rest of}} the body. The most distinctive feature is a narrow band of white hair running along each flank to the forward part of the mesopatagium. The ears are large and rounded, positioned close together at the base, and mostly hairless, with a small tragus and long <b>antitragus.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is an insect-eating bat, 40-97 mm in length. Yellowish brown {{to black}} above, grey underneath, it is broad-faced with widely {{separated}} eyes. Its ears are short and rounded; the <b>antitragus</b> is square; its lips are not wrinkled; {{it has a}} broad snout. Mostly it is found at low elevations. Colonies of 50-77 roost in hollow branches of large trees. Males and females stay together throughout the year. Named after Arthur Greenhall, a scientist {{who was in charge}} of the rabies program at the Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory in Port of Spain, Trinidad.|$|E
50|$|The bats have large, rounded, {{ears with}} a {{well-developed}} <b>antitragus,</b> and a horseshoe-shaped nose-leaf, with a distinctive small projection on either side. There {{is also an}} additional serrated ridge of skin behind the main nose-leaf. Both females and males have an extra pair of teats in the pubic region. Although these are vestigial in the males, they can be as long as 4 cm in some females (almost half the body length), yet are never functional. These false teats may be only present to allow the young something {{to hold on to}} while clinging to their mothers.|$|E
50|$|Ear print {{analysis}} {{is used as}} a means of forensic identification intended as an identification tool similar to fingerprinting. An earprint is a two-dimensional reproduction of the parts of the outer ear that have touched a specific surface (most commonly the helix, antihelix, tragus and <b>antitragus).</b> The first ear print identification of a criminal was made in Switzerland in 1965 and ear print analysis has also been successfully used to solve crimes in the UK and the Netherlands. In addition to identification, the height of an ear imprint at a crime scene may also provide investigators with information regarding the stature of the perpetrator.|$|E
50|$|The head is {{relatively}} long and narrow, and the tongue {{is long and}} extensible, reaching up to 3 cm. A small, narrow, nose-leaf is found on the upper lip, which is otherwise smooth. Compared with some other bats, the ears are relatively small and widely separated, and lack an <b>antitragus.</b> As its name implies, the tailed tailless bat does normally have a tail, although this is very short, only 3 to 7 mm in length, and does not reach beyond {{the edge of the}} uropatagium (membrane between the legs), in which it is embedded. Some individuals, however, have no tail at all, and these were once thought to represent a different species.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{virtually}} identical in appearance to the Papuan pipistrelle (P. papuanensis). In both species the dorsum fur is bicolored, with a brown tip overlying the longer black {{base of the}} hair. The ventral fur in both species has a black base tipped with cinnamon brown, and The snout, lip, ear, wing, forearm, and hind foot are clove brown, with a lightly furred uropatagium. However, there are several key morphological differences. P. angulatus has a strongly concave forehead. The first upper incisor is bicuspid, and {{the height of the}} second upper incisor is less than the posterior cusp of this tooth. The tragus narrows only slightly at the apex and the <b>antitragus</b> is moderately high.|$|E
50|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing <b>antitragus.</b> The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue). The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix, <b>antitragus,</b> and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes.|$|E
50|$|C. 555-540 BC: {{figures of}} this period are simpler than before; their muscles are no longer {{separately}} accentuated. There {{is a tendency to}} flowing contour and a generalization of form. The tragus now sometimes assumes its natural form. The anterior part of the helix, which is directed backwards (crus helicis), is often prominent, and joined with the upper end of tragus. The <b>antitragus</b> is sometimes tentatively indicated, though wrongly placed. The anterior triangle of the neck is now better understood. Navel generally modelled as a depression. Indication of external oblique bulging over iliac crest. The lower boundary of abdomen occasionally forms a deep curve. Forearm and arm sometimes correctly semi-pronated; both directed towards body. Arms sometimes arched towards body below the armpit. Big toe projects a little further or same as second toe. Four smaller toes and toe nails curve gently downwards.|$|E
50|$|The {{developing}} auricle {{is first}} noticeable around the sixth {{week of gestation}} in the human fetus, developing from the auricular hillocks, which are derived from {{the first and second}} pharyngeal arches. These hillocks develop into the folds of the auricle and gradually shift upwards and backwards to their final position on the head. En route accessory auricles (also known as preauricular tags) may be left behind. The first three hillocks are derived from the 1st branchial arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. Cutaneous sensation to these areas is via the trigeminal nerve, the attendant nerve of the 1st branchial arch. The final three hillocks are derived from the second branchial arch and form the antihelix, <b>antitragus,</b> and lobule, respectively. These portions of the ear are supplied by the cervical plexus and a small portion by the facial nerve. This explains why vesicles are classically seen on the auricle in herpes infections of the facial nerve (Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II).|$|E
