50|$|Preventive {{maintenance}} therapy for the oral effects of TDO involve frequent dental cleanings, professional application of desensitizing medication, diet counseling, and oral hygiene instructions in proper home care and maintenance; medicated dental rinses and toothpastes are also prescribed as {{people suffering from}} TDO {{are more prone to}} oral hard tissue disease and early tooth loss. If restorative dentistry is performed without orthodontics to correct the protrusion of the lower jaw, a dental night guard worn <b>at</b> <b>bedtimes</b> on the upper or lower teeth to protect them from the effects of grinding may be recommended.|$|R

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>bedtime</b> on Christmas Eve, {{the family}} makes last-minute {{preparations}} at home, Marge tells everyone {{that no one}} can open presents until 7 AM and confiscates all of the alarm clocks. However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to wake up early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it. Bart hides the evidence outside beneath the snow in the front yard.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{intermediate}} (DI) {{was conducted}} at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad. A high-end DI system was imported and the process took six months to complete. Singer Chinmayi, who dubbed for Samantha in Eega, found the process difficult because the footage did not contain the animated fly. Rajamouli approached Anuj Gurwara to write the dialogue for the Hindi-dubbed version titled Makkhi. The Hindi dubbing began in Hyderabad, and Gurwara dubbed for Nani in the film. Ajay Devgan and his wife Kajol, acting as parents telling the film's story to their child <b>at</b> <b>bedtime,</b> provided voiceovers during the opening credits of Makkhi. The visuals accompanying the closing credits were altered to show the fly mimicking the antics of Devgan, Salman Khan, and Akshay Kumar.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal {{complaints}} {{are most often}} noted. The development of ulceration and/or bleeding requires immediate termination of treatment with diclofenac.

25|$|To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of peptic ulcers, indometacin should be prescribed at the lowest dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, usually between 50–200mg/day. It should always be taken with food. Nearly all patients benefit from an ulcer protective drug (e.g. highly dosed antacids, ranitidine 150mg <b>at</b> <b>bedtime,</b> or omeprazole 20mg <b>at</b> <b>bedtime).</b> Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, heartburn and mild diarrhea are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of indometacin.|$|E

60|$|The evening wore away slowly, and Cyril and Netta {{said little}} to one another, each absorbed {{in their own}} {{thoughts}} and doubts and perplexities. <b>At</b> last <b>bedtime</b> came, but not much sleep for either. Cyril lay awake, looking out into the darkness which seemed now to involve the whole physical and spiritual world; seeing in fancy a vast chaotic clashing universe, battling and colliding for ever against itself, without one ray of hope, or light, or gladness left in it anywhere. Netta lay awake, too, wondering what could have come over Cyril; and seeing nothing but a darkened world, in which Cyril's love was taken away from her, and all was cold, and dull, and cheerless. Each in imagination had lost the keystone of their own particular special universe.|$|R

25|$|Treatments are {{not always}} successful, {{especially}} when the cause of POIS in a particular patient has not been determined.

40|$|Neither public nor private {{agencies}} {{address the}} extensive religious involvement that {{children and youth}} receive in child care facilities and foster home placement situations. In a five-state mid-west study (N= 252), this paper examines religious practices in foster homes. The study identifies a strong Christian-based affiliation of foster homes. The findings illustrate the daily, weekly, and monthly religious rituals practiced in foster homes including grace <b>at</b> meals, <b>bedtime</b> prayers, church-going, and religious social groups activities. These activities complement the process of moral development in children through religious involvement. The pervasiveness of religious practices and beliefs as reported suggests that even when both parents of these out-of-home children do not stipulate a preference for a specific religiously-affiliated foster home, {{the experience of the}} foster child will probably include practices and education in a specific religious persuasion.

40|$|Mariana G Figueiro Lighting Research Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USAAbstract: Delayed sleep phase {{disorder}} (DSPD) {{is common}} among adolescents and further increases their susceptibility to chronic sleep restriction and associated detrimental outcomes, including {{increased risk of}} depression, drug and alcohol use, behavioral problems, and poor scholastic performance. DSPD is characterized by sleep onset that occurs significantly later than desired bedtimes and societal norms. Individuals with DSPD exhibit long sleep latencies when attempting to sleep <b>at</b> conventional <b>bedtimes.</b> Circadian sleep disorders such as DSPD can occur when there is misalignment between sleep timing and societal norms. This review discusses studies using light therapy to advance the timing of sleep in adolescents and college students, in particular on those suffering from DSPD. A discussion on how to increase effectiveness of light therapy in the field will also be provided. Keywords: circadian, melatonin, light, sleep, sleep phase disorder, adolescent...|$|R

40|$|Resurgence in {{the field}} of sleep {{initiation}} and thermoregulation has seen a number of investigators reporting relatively gradual increases in distal skin temperatures of the hands and feet prior to sleep onset <b>at</b> typical <b>bedtimes.</b> The present study extends upon prior knowledge by investigating whether: (1) this is a change of distal skin temperature triggered specifically by the attempt to fall asleep and (2) whether this relationship holds for various phases of the circadian rhythm whenever sleep is attempted. Fourteen healthy good sleepers participated in a modified 45 -h constant routine (CR) with multiple sleep onset latency tests (MSLT) conducted every half hour. After a brief decrease of finger temperature associated with small postural adjustments {{at the beginning of each}} sleep latency test, finger temperature showed rapid (0. 8 _C min) 1) increases of 1 – 3 _C leading up to the onset of sleep. This rapid increase of finger temperature was relatively consistent across the 45 -h CR, despite very significant circadian variation of the pre-MSLT baseline finger temperature and homeostatic decrease of sleep latency...|$|R
