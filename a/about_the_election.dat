5|$|The dispute {{affected}} William, {{since he}} had been appointed chancellor by Raymond and may have fallen out of favour after Raymond {{was removed from the}} regency. When Patriarch Amalric died on 6 October 1180, the two most obvious choices for his successor were William and Heraclius of Caesarea. They were fairly evenly matched in background and education, but politically they were allied with opposite parties, as Heraclius was one of Agnes of Courtenay's supporters. It seems that the canons of the Holy Sepulchre were unable to decide, and asked the king for advice; due to Agnes' influence, Heraclius was elected. There were rumours that Agnes and Heraclius were lovers, but this information comes from the partisan 13th-century continuations of the Historia, and there is no other evidence to substantiate such a claim. William himself says almost nothing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> and Heraclius' character or his subsequent patriarchate, probably reflecting his disappointment at the outcome.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} {{was characterized by}} lack of security, low voter turnout and low awareness of the people <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> and election process and widespread ballot stuffing, intimidation, and other electoral fraud. A second round run-off vote, announced under heavy U.S. and ally pressure, was originally scheduled for 7 November 2009, but it was cancelled after Abdullah refused to participate, and Hamid Karzai was declared President of Afghanistan for another 5-year term.|$|E

25|$|After the election, United Monroe members found over 800 {{voters in}} Kiryas Joel whose {{signatures}} {{did not match}} those on file, in addition to 25 they had challenged at the polls, three of whom were later investigated by the county sheriff; the rest were considered unfounded. Orange County District Attorney David Hoovler, elected along with Neuhaus, told the newspaper {{it was difficult to}} investigate the allegations since they could not verify the identity of either signer, if in fact there were two. The Record attempted to contact some of those voters; the only one they reached hung up when asked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{week before}} the presidential election, {{incumbent}} President Chen Shui-bian vowed to quit if Ma could provide legal documents of the invalidation of his green card. The DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh {{also said that he}} was willing to withdraw from the race if Ma could prove, using official documents, that his green card was invalidated twenty years ago. Ma responded the next day to the president that he should work on improving Taiwan's economy instead of caring <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> so much; earlier, Ma also provided copies of US non-immigrant visas issued to him during the 1980s and 1990s, claiming the card was invalid, as such visas are not issued to green card holders.|$|E
25|$|In 1683, Steno {{resigned}} as auxiliary bishop after an argument <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> {{of the new}} bishop, Maximilian Henry of Bavaria and moved in 1684 to Hamburg. There Steno became involved again {{in the study of}} the brain and the nerve system with an old friend Dirck Kerckring. Steno was invited to Schwerin, when it became clear he was not accepted in Hamburg. Steno dressed like a poor man in an old cloak. He drove in an open carriage in snow and rain. Living four days a week on bread and beer, he became emaciated. When Steno had fulfilled his mission, some years of difficult tasks, he wanted to go back to Italy. Before he could return, Steno became severely ill, his belly swelling day by day. Steno died in Germany, after much suffering. His corpse was shipped to Florence by Kerckring upon request of Cosimo III de' Medici and buried in the Basilica of San Lorenzo close to his protectors, the De' Medici family. In 1946 his grave was opened, and the corpse was reburied after a procession through the streets of the city.|$|E

500|$|St. Laurent {{was utterly}} {{confident}} {{of an election}} victory, {{so much so that}} he did not even bother to fill the sixteen vacancies in the Senate. He had been confident of re-election when Drew led the Tories, and, according to Liberal minister Lionel Chevrier, Diefenbaker's victory in the party leadership race increased his confidence by a factor of ten. At his press conference detailing his election tour, St. Laurent stated, [...] "I have no doubt <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> outcome." [...] He indicated that his campaign would open April 29 in Winnipeg, and that the Prime Minister would spend ten days in Western Canada before moving east. However, he indicated he would first go home to Quebec City for several days around Easter (April 21 in 1957). This break kept him out of the limelight for ten days at a time when Diefenbaker was already actively campaigning and making daily headlines. At a campaign stop in Jarvis, Ontario, St. Laurent told an aide that he was afraid the right-wing, anti-Catholic Social Credit Party would be the next Opposition. St. Laurent denied Opposition claims that he would resign after an election victory, and the 75-year-old indicated that he planned to run again in 1961, if he was still around.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{study done}} after the {{election}} gave a lot of insight on young voters. Thirty-seven percent of Americans ages 18–24 got election news from social networking sites.

2500|$|In November 2013, {{the party}} leader Gábor Vona, {{expressed}} optimism <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> {{saying that the}} party planned [...] "no less than election victory in 2014". He argued that Jobbik candidates had been faring well in local elections and that opinion surveys had showed that Jobbik {{was the most popular}} party among voters aged under 35. The party has prepared its election programme dubbed [...] "We'll say it, we'll solve it," [...] which focuses on guaranteeing people a livelihood, safety and order. Vona said his party would initiate a referendum on protecting Hungarian land and on amending Hungary's European Union accession treaty.|$|E
2500|$|The PNȚ {{finished}} a distant {{second in the}} November 1946 general election with 33 seats, well behind the Communist-dominated Bloc of Democratic Parties. [...] After the fall of Communism, some authors {{went as far as}} to claim that the PNȚ had actually won the election, but was denied victory due to widespread electoral fraud {{on the part of the}} pro-Communist Petru Groza government. [...] Later, historian Petre Ţurlea reviewed a confidential Communist Party report <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> [...] He concluded that had the election been conducted honestly, the PNȚ and the other opposition parties would have won enough votes between them to form a coalition government—albeit with far less than the 80 percent support long claimed by opposition supporters.|$|E
2500|$|Taft had {{supported}} the revolution that brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> of Francisco I. Madero {{as president of}} Mexico. [...] Wilson, who took office shortly after Madero's assassination in 1913, rejected the legitimacy of Huerta's [...] "government of butchers" [...] and demanded Mexico hold democratic elections. Wilson's unprecedented approach meant no recognition and doomed Huerta's prospects. Wilsonian idealism became a reason for American intervention in Latin America until the 1920s and 1930s, when moralistic interventions were abandoned in favor of realism. After Huerta arrested U.S. navy personnel in the port of Tampico Wilson sent his navy to occupy Veracruz. War between the United States and Mexico was averted through negotiations, and in 1916 his reelection campaign for president boasted he had [...] "kept us out of war." [...] Huerta fled Mexico and Carranza came to power.|$|E

2500|$|L. Paul Bremer was {{the leader}} of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. As the {{appointed}} authority, Bremer wanted national elections to take place only after the creation of a constitution that included basic principles <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> process. This led to the delay of the elections, which led to serious problems. It was during this time that the power vacuum within Baghdad was being filled by a Shi'a cleric, a factor that Bremer failed to take into account. Insurgency among Sunni civilians first became a problem when American troops first became a presence on Iraqi soil. This insurgency led to Bremer kicking all the Sunni Ba'thists out the Iraqi administration and the disbandment of the Iraqi army, which only prompted a harsh response from the American troops. This was a very poor decision on Bremer's part, according to Sánchez, who viewed the insurgency as mostly provoked by Bremer. He is quoted as saying, ...|$|E
