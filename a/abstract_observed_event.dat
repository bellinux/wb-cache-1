40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> The <b>observed</b> microlensing <b>events</b> {{towards the}} lmc {{do not have}} yet a {{coherent}} explanation. If they are due to Galactic halo objects, {{the nature of these}} objects is puzzling — half the halo in dark 0. 5 M ⊙ objects. On the other hand, traditional models of the lmc predict a self-lensing optical depth about an order of magnitude too low, although characteristics of some of the <b>observed</b> <b>events</b> favor a self-lensing explanation. We present here two models of the lmc taking into account the correlation between the mass of the stars and their velocity dispersion: a thin Mestel disk, and an ellipsoidal model. Both yield optical depths, event rates, and event duration distributions compatible with the observations. The grounds for such models are discussed, as well as their observational consequences...|$|R
40|$|Educating {{current and}} future generations of American {{children}} {{to live in an}} information society is a critical issue. It is compounded by the recognized need to provide life-long education for all citizens and to support a flexible workforce. Virtual reality (VR) technology has been widely proposed as a major technological advance that can offer significant support for such education. There are several ways in which VR technology is expected to facilitate learning. One of its unique capabilities is the ability to allow students to visualize <b>abstract</b> concepts, to <b>observe</b> <b>events</b> at atomic or planetary scales, and to visit environments and interact with events that distance, time, or safety factors make unavailable. The types of activities supported by this capability facilitate current educational thinking that students are better able to master, retain, and generalize new knowledge when they are actively involved in constructing that knowledge in a learning-by-doing situation. The potential of VR technology for supporting education is widely recognized. Several programs designed to introduce large numbers of students and teachers to the technology have been established, a number of academic institutions have developed research programs to investigate key issues, and some public schools are evaluating the technology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Monitoring {{business}} processes during their execution is one {{important aspect of}} business process management. Process monitoring requires <b>observed</b> <b>events,</b> which are recorded in information systems, to reason about, amongst others, process progress. Especially in manual executing process environments, the <b>observed</b> <b>events</b> are most likely sparse. Therefore, we introduce an approach {{increasing the number of}} <b>observed</b> <b>events</b> by capturing data state transition events, which occur after successfully writing a data object during process execution. ...|$|R

We follow the method developed by Benveniste, Fabre, and Haar to assign probabilities to configurations in a net unfolding thus avoiding the need for randomizing all concurrent interleavings of transitions. We consider different settings of the diagnosis problem, including estimating {{the likelihood that a}} fault may have happened prior to the most recent <b>observed</b> <b>event,</b> the likelihood that a fault will have happened prior to the next <b>observed</b> <b>event.</b> A novel problem formulation treated in this paper considers deterministic diagnosis of faults that occurred prior to the most recent <b>observed</b> <b>event,</b> and simultaneous calculation of the likelihood that a fault will occur prior to the next <b>observed</b> <b>event...</b>|$|R

40|$|Making {{inference}} {{in everyday}} life often requires people to make inferences about low frequency events. In the most extreme case, some types of object or event may have never been previously observed. An experiment is presented in which participants needed to infer the existence and number of unobserved event types, {{based solely on the}} frequency distribution of a set of <b>observed</b> <b>events.</b> Results indicate people’s inferences are sensitive to the shape of the distribution over the <b>observed</b> <b>events,</b> even when the number of <b>observed</b> <b>events</b> and event types is held constant, and that people are able to infer abstract rules that describe entire classes of event distributions. Human inferences are shown to be similar to those made by a hierarchical Bayesian model. Daniel Navarro[URL]...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new version of}} dynamic time warping for samples of <b>observed</b> <b>event</b> times that are modeled as time-warped intensity processes. Our approach is devel- oped within a framework where for each experimental unit or subject in a sample, one observes a random number of event times or random locations. As in our setting the number of <b>observed</b> <b>events</b> differs from subject to subject, usual landmark align- ment methods that require the number of events to be the same across subjects are not feasible. We address this challenge by applying dynamic time warping, initially by aligning the event times for pairs of subjects, regardless of whether the numbers of <b>observed</b> <b>events</b> within the considered pair of subjects match. The information about pairwise alignments is then combined to extract an overall alignment of the events for each subject across the entire sample. This overall alignment provides a useful description of event data and {{can be used as a}} pre-processing step for subse- quent analysis. The method is illustrated with a historical fertility study and with on-line auction data...|$|R
