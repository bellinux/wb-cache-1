Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had been formed by his experiences in Germany during the Weimar Republic, and alleged that the film's failure to mention this was motivated by a wish to portray Strauss <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> with American suburban culture, like Qutb.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the formation of a partner school in Qatar, the school came under fire from current and former pupils, as well <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> members of the public, due to the country's poor human rights record. An online petition was started by a former pupil in April 2016 challenging the decision to open the school, however, this proved unsuccessful and The Royal Grammar School Guildford in Qatar (RGSGQ) opened for pupils on 19 September 2016.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting Archaeoastronomy's {{development}} as an interdisciplinary subject, {{research in the}} field is conducted by investigators trained {{in a wide range of}} disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only rarely did they describe their work as astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} is a stressor in relationships. People {{are often}} <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> about failing {{to keep a}} partner satisfied as they are about meeting their own sexual needs. In fact, two of the top reasons people with SCI cite for wanting to have sex are for intimacy and to keep a partner. The frequency of sex correlates with {{the desire of the}} uninjured partner.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E
5|$|From 1974 to 1977, Oceanside police {{kept track}} of over 1,000 {{accidents}} that occurred along SR 76. A citizen action group known <b>as</b> <b>Concerned</b> Citizens for Highway 76 formed soon after. Caltrans began holding hearings again in 1979, proposing the building of an expressway {{as opposed to a}} freeway or to widening Mission Avenue. At one hearing, local officials criticized the delay, while others criticized the routing, the decision to build an expressway instead of a freeway, and building a route through an environmentally sensitive area. In May 1980, the state Assembly Transportation Committee approved a resolution that requested an answer from the governor at the time, Jerry Brown, and Caltrans as to why certain projects, including SR76, had not been started.|$|E

5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens of taxation unfairly, especially <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, The Love Below was {{identified}} as far more musically experimental. Its sound was described as jazz and funk with comparisons {{to the work of}} Prince.

Co was considered as the foremost authority in ethnobotany in the Philippines. Agham together with 14 other organizations conducted a fact-finding mission, which resulted in the formation of a coalition consisting of Co's family, friends, and supporters as well <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> civil-society groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{style is}} related to the {{landscape}} backgrounds of Hieronymous Bosch, although in his main works these function as a backdrop to his crowds of figures and are not <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> to include a variety of landscape elements; but those of smaller works such as his St. Jerome at Prayer anticipate the new style. In most respects the paintings retain the same elements as many 15th-century treatments of the same subjects but show, in modern cinematic terms, a long shot rather than a medium shot.|$|E
25|$|The other {{approach}} is to construct a whole new system of EU company law, that co-exists with the individual company laws of the member states. Companies would have the choice of operating either under national regulations or under the EU-wide system. However, this approach has been only somewhat {{more effective than the}} harmonization approach: while states are not <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> about having foreign traditions of corporate governance imposed on their companies, which the harmonization approach could well entail; they also wish to ensure that the EU-wide system would be palatable to the traditions of their national companies, so {{that they will not be}} put at a disadvantage compared to the other member states.|$|E

25|$|The {{work of the}} Gilbreths {{is often}} {{associated}} with that of Frederick Winslow Taylor, yet there was a substantial philosophical difference between the Gilbreths and Taylor. The symbol of Taylorism was the stopwatch; Taylor was concerned primarily with reducing process times. The Gilbreths, in contrast, sought to make processes more efficient by reducing the motions involved. They saw their approach as more concerned with workers' welfare than Taylorism, which workers themselves often perceived <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> mainly with profit. This difference led to a personal rift between Taylor and the Gilbreths which, after Taylor's death, turned into a feud between the Gilbreths and Taylor's followers. After Frank's death, Lillian Gilbreth took steps to heal the rift; however, some friction remains over questions of history and intellectual property.|$|E
25|$|The Whig Party {{was devastated}} by the 1852 elections, and upon {{entering}} office, Pierce was <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> about intra-party opposition {{as he was about}} the Whigs. The Compromise of 1850 had split both major parties along geographic lines. In several Northern states, some Democrats opposed to the compromise had joined with Free Soil Party to take control of state governments. In the South, many state parties had also been split by the compromise. Hoping to keep his own party unified, Pierce appointed both supporters and opponents of the Compromise of 1850 from both the North and South. This policy infuriated both supporters and opponents of the compromise, particularly in the South. Allies of former President Fillmore sought the creation of a Union Party consisting of pro-compromise Democrats and Whigs, and many Democrats worried that their party would suffer the fate of the Whigs.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 19th century {{evolutionary}} ideas were most strongly disputed by the premillennialists, who {{held to a}} prophecy of the imminent return of Christ based on a form of Biblical literalism, and were convinced that the Bible would be invalidated if any error in the Scriptures was conceded. However, hardly any of the critics of evolution at that time were <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> about geology, freely granting scientists any time they needed before the Edenic creation to account for scientific observations, such as fossils and geological findings. In the immediate post-Darwinian era, few scientists or clerics rejected the antiquity of the earth, the progressive nature of the fossil record. Likewise, few attached geological significance to the Biblical flood, unlike subsequent creationists. Evolutionary skeptics, creationist leaders and skeptical scientists were usually either willing to adopt a figurative reading of {{the first chapter of}} the Book of Genesis, or allowed that the six days of creation were not necessarily 24-hour days.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, the 19-year-old Douglas {{enrolled}} at Brandon College, a Baptist school affiliated with McMaster University, to {{finish high school}} and study theology. During his six years at the college, he {{was influenced by the}} Social Gospel movement, which combined Christian principles with social reform. Liberal-minded professors at Brandon encouraged students to question their fundamentalist religious beliefs. Christianity, they suggested, was just <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> with the pursuit of social justice as it was with the struggle for individual salvation. Douglas took a course in socialism at Brandon and studied Greek philosophy. He came first in his class during his first three years, then competed for gold medals in his last three with a newly arrived student named Stanley Knowles. Both later became ministers of religion and prominent left-wing politicians. Douglas was extremely active in extracurricular activities. Among other things, he became a champion debater, wrote for the school newspaper and participated in student government winning election as Senior Stick, or president of the student body, in his final year.|$|E
25|$|One notable {{criticism}} of penal substitution {{raised by the}} moral influence perspective concerns God's forgiveness. The moral influence framework depicts God <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> about only {{the present and future}} states of people's moral character, and not their past states. God desires people to become more loving. When people truly change, God is no longer concerned with their previous character and thus is willing to freely forgive their previous actions. The moral influence framework thus teaches that God's forgiveness is free and conditional only on repentance (i.e. moral change). This link between repentance and forgiveness is well-attested to in the New Testament. By contrast, moral influence advocates argue that the penal substitutionary theory portrays God as unable or unwilling to forgive wrong actions and requiring that there be full and complete punishment for all past wrongs, regardless of repentance. They often critique this idea on biblical grounds, pointing to numerous biblical instances of forgiveness and verses that appear to teach that forgiveness depends on repentance. Many also argue that penal substitution's depiction of God as demanding full punishment for every crime regardless of repentance is morally reprehensible and does not reflect a loving, forgiving God.|$|E
25|$|The moral {{influence}} {{doctrine of}} atonement is typically taught within a paradigm of salvation {{which focuses on}} positive moral change as the core of Christianity. God is depicted <b>as</b> <b>concerned</b> with whether a person's inner character is good or evil (where 'good' refers primarily to unselfish love toward others). In this system, God works to bring positive moral change within the hearts of individuals and to transform societies to become more loving. He acted to bring such change through {{the teachings of the}} Old Testament Law, the Jewish Prophets, and the teaching and example of Jesus. The inspiring power of Jesus' martyrdom and subsequent resurrection are also often cited as catalysts for moral change. Many holding a moral influence view also believe that the Holy Spirit works to help people toward moral change. In the moral influence view, it is generally believed that God will judge the souls of the dead in the afterlife based on their moral character, attested to by their conduct (a belief that many Evangelical Protestants reject). Most advocates of the view strongly endorse the concept of Free Will, insisting that humans are responsible for their actions and capable of change. However, some advocates (e.g. Augustine) have held the view that humans are incapable of moral change themselves and require God to radically alter their psychology through the Holy Spirit's working in them. The moral influence model of atonement is usually associated with a minimal doctrine of Original Sin or complete denial thereof, although not always (again Augustine is a notable exception).|$|E
