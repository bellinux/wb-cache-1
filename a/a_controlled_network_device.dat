40|$|ABSTRACT EMBEDDED NETWORK BASED MONITORING SYSTEM DESIGN by ?? Yongqing Cui 2009 Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering Computer Engineering Option California State University, Chico Fall 2007 With the {{widespread}} use of network technology, more and more monitoring and control systems in industry are connected with networks to implement remote monitoring and control of industrial systems. These systems are normally designed and implemented with high-end desktop computers or workstations because the connection with networks needs large computer resources such as fast execution speed and large memory capacity. Now, microcontrollers are widely used in industrial monitoring and control systems, especially for small-scale systems. How to connect these systems with networks is becoming a real challenge for design engineers because microcontrollers have limited hardware resources. For example, microcontrollers have only 1 k to several k bytes on-chip random access memory (RAM). xi This project focuses on the design and implementation of a monitoring system with <b>an</b> embedded <b>network</b> <b>control</b> <b>device</b> connected to <b>networks.</b> The system includes two parts: embedded <b>network</b> <b>control</b> subsystem and temperature monitoring subsystem. The first part focuses on the design and implementation of the embedded network subsystem.

40|$|Digital audio {{networks}} allow multiple {{channels of}} audio to be streamed between devices. This {{eliminates the need}} for many different cables to route audio between devices. An added advantage of digital audio networks is the ability to configure and <b>control</b> the <b>networked</b> <b>devices</b> from <b>a</b> common <b>control</b> point. Common <b>control</b> of <b>networked</b> <b>devices</b> enables <b>a</b> sound engineer to establish and destroy audio stream connections between <b>networked</b> <b>devices</b> that are distances apart. On a digital audio network, an audio transport technology enables the exchange of data streams. Typically, an audio transport technology is capable of transporting both control messages and audio data streams. There exist a number of audio transport technologies. Some of these technologies implement data transport by exchanging OSI/ISO layer 2 data frames, while others transport data within OSI/ISO layer 3 packets. There are some approaches to achieving interoperability between devices that utilize different audio transport technologies. A digital audio device typically implements <b>an</b> audio <b>control</b> protocol, which enables it process configuration and <b>control</b> messages from <b>a</b> remote controller. An audio control protocol also defines the structure of the messages that are exchanged between compliant devices. There are currently a wide range of audio control protocols. Some audio control protocols utilize layer 3 audio transport technology, while others utilize layer 2 audio transport technology. An audio device can only communicate with other devices that implement the same control protocol, irrespective of a common transport technology that connects the devices. The existence of different audio control protocols among <b>devices</b> on a <b>network</b> results in a situation where the devices are unable to communicate with each other. Furthermore, <b>a</b> single <b>control</b> application is unable to establish or destroy audio stream connections between the <b>networked</b> <b>devices,</b> since they implement different <b>control</b> protocols. When <b>an</b> audio engineer is designing an audio network installation, this interoperability challenge restricts the choice of devices that can be included. Even when audio transport interoperability has been achieved, common control of the devices remains a challenge. This research investigates protocol command translation as a means to enable interoperability between <b>networked</b> audio <b>devices</b> that implement different audio control protocols. It proposes the use of a command translator that is capable of receiving messages conforming to one protocol from any of the <b>networked</b> <b>devices,</b> translating the received message to conform to <b>a</b> different <b>control</b> protocol, then transmitting the translated message to the intended target which understands the translated protocol message. In so doing, the command translator enables common <b>control</b> of the <b>networked</b> <b>devices,</b> since <b>a</b> <b>control</b> application is able to configure and control devices that conform to different protocols by utilizing the command translator to perform appropriate protocol translation...|$|R

To create <b>a</b> planetary <b>control</b> <b>network,</b> points (usually craters) are identified on pixtures and their image coordinates are measured in pixels. Each control point must be measured on two or more images. The navigation team supplies discrete spacecraft positions and approximate camera-pointing angles. An analytical triangulation program is used to compute the coordinates of the control points and to improve the camera-pointing angles. <b>A</b> <b>control</b> <b>network</b> supports the compilation of maps of a particular reregion or an entire body. The maps may abe planimetric or topographic. A reference surface is used to approximate {{the shape of a}} body or to measure elevations. The reference surface is usually a sphere or spheroid, so the map can be displayd in many popular projections. Ideally, the reference surfaces for the Galilean satellites should beellipsoids, because they are in synchronous orbits and experience strong tidal forces. However, most popular projections such as Mercator, Lambert, and stereographic lose their elegant and convenient properties when the reference surface is an ellipsoid. Experiments were made to solve for the three axes as indipendent variables in the analytical triangulation. The results are of little use, as the control points are not uniformly distributed and the image resolutions vary greatly.
