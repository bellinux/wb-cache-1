5|$|Baldwin IV sent Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, {{along with}} other bishops, and Raynald of Châtillon to Antioch to mediate. After preparatory {{negotiations}} with the envoys in Latakia, Bohemond and Aimery met in Antioch. Bohemond agreed to restore confiscated church property and Aimery lifted the interdict, but Bohemond's excommunication remained in force because he refused to return to Theodora. Peace was not fully restored, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of the opposition fled to Armenian Cilicia.|$|E

5|$|Minton {{received}} a death {{threat in the}} form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to not vote for the court packing plan. Many Democrats, fearing their re-election prospects, joined with Republicans and defeated the bill. Minton was unhappy with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters, but as a result of his close connection with the bill <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of his party, he gained more influence with the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|This, in turn, {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of even greater excesses; to pay the Spartan garrison's wages, Critias <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> ordered each of the Thirty to arrest and execute a metic, or resident alien, and confiscate his property. Theramenes, protesting that this action was worse than the worst excesses of the democracy, refused to follow the order.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the lines}} began in 1636, but no {{ceremony}} was carried out to commemorate laying the foundation stone due to controversy surrounding the construction. Since fortification was expensive, the new Grand Master Giovanni Paolo Lascaris imposed a new tax on immovable property. This tax created dispute between the Order and the clergy, who protested to the Pope. Some priests also influenced the population {{to take part in}} a national protest, but plans leaked out to authorities <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> were arrested.|$|E

5|$|As Captain Picard and Commander Data (Brent Spiner) {{discuss the}} matter with the Ventaxian leader (Marcelo Tubert), a woman appears in the chamber, announcing herself as Ardra. She proves her {{identity}} by starting an earthquake at will, and transforming into both the Christian and then the Klingon devil. Ardra states that {{she has come to}} claim the planet. Picard is instantly suspicious and orders Data to examine the contract that supposedly was signed by Ardra <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of the planet a thousand years ago. Picard returns to the Enterprise afterwards, and Ardra appears on the bridge sitting in the Captain's chair. Security Chief Worf (Michael Dorn) tries to remove her without success, Data returns just then and confirms the language of the contract as well as Ardra's claim to the planet, including anything in orbit, including the Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{offered a}} public apology {{on behalf of}} the Government of Canada <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of the other federal parties in the Canadian House of Commons. Nine days prior, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was {{established}} to uncover the truth about the schools. The commission gathered statements from residential school survivors through public and private meetings at various local, regional and national events across Canada. Seven national events held between 2008 and 2013 commemorated the experience of former students of residential schools. In 2015, the TRC concluded with the establishment of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, and the publication of a multi-volume report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{meetings}} of the Puerto Rican Independence movement which met in St. Thomas were discovered by the Spanish authorities {{and the members of}} the movement were either imprisoned or exiled. In a letter dated October 1, 1824, which Venezuelan rebel leader José María Rojas sent to María de las Mercedes Barbudo, Rojas stated that the Venezuelan rebels had lost their principal contact with the Puerto Rican Independence movement in the Danish island of Saint Thomas and therefore the secret communication which existed between the Venezuelan rebels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of the Puerto Rican independence movements was in danger of being discovered.|$|E

5|$|The patent issue {{soon became}} a {{struggle}} between Prime Minister Robert Walpole (with {{the authority of the}} British Parliament) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of Ireland. All attempts by the Irish Privy Council and the Church of Ireland to prevent the release of the coinage proved fruitless. It was soon thought by many that William Conolly’s Commissioners of the Revenue might pay the soldiers stationed in Ireland with the new coin; if the soldiers were paid with the coin, then the merchants of Ireland would be forced to accept the coin from the soldiers or risk military reprisal or a loss of business. This worried the leadership of Ireland and they requested help in challenging Wood's patent and leading a boycott of the coin. Swift was asked by Archbishop King and Lord Chancellor Midleton to contribute to a pamphleteering campaign against Wood's coin.|$|E
5|$|The rebels sent envoys to the voivode {{to inform}} him about their grievances, but the envoys were {{captured}} and executed. The voivode invaded the rebels' camp, but the peasants resisted {{and made a}} successful counter-attack, killing many noblemen during the battle. To prevent the rebels from continuing the war, the bishop <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of the noblemen started negotiations with the rebels' envoys. Their compromise was recorded in the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. The agreement reduced the tithe by half, abolished the ninth (a seigneurial tax), guaranteed the peasants' right to free movement and authorized them to hold an annual assembly to secure {{the execution of the}} agreement.|$|E
5|$|On lap 155, {{the third}} caution was given; Gugelmin's engine failed on the frontstretch {{and stopped at}} turn one. Course {{officials}} were required to clear the track {{up to the first}} turn. All of the leaders, including Fernández, made pit stops for fuel. Most of the teams instructed their drivers to conserve fuel in the hope they could reach the end of the race. Moreno's car billowed smoke on lap 160 but continued. Da Matta gained the lead for the restart on lap 167. After restarting from third, Papis moved into the lead two laps later. Kannan took over the first position on the 171st lap, before Junqueira passed him on the next lap. A section of front wing became disloged from Moreno's car while entering turn three on lap 176, which triggered the fourth caution. During the caution, CART Chief Stewart Chris Kneifel announced the distance of the event would be reduced from 250 to 230 laps because of fading sunlight, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> elected to make pit stops. Moreno remained the leader at the lap-183 restart but was overtaken by Junqueira in turn one. After restarting third, Tagliani fell to sixth. Carpentier passed Junqueira for the lead two laps later.|$|E

5|$|The Z-4 Plan was a {{proposed}} basis for negotiations {{to end the}} Croatian War of Independence with a political settlement. It was drafted by Peter W. Galbraith, Leonid Kerestedjiants and Geert-Hinrich Ahrens {{on behalf of a}} mini-Contact Group comprising United Nations envoys and diplomats from the United States, Russia and the European Union. The co-chairs of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, were closely involved in the political process surrounding the plan. The document was prepared in the final months of 1994 and early 1995 before being presented to Croatian President Franjo Tuđman <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 30 January 1995. Although Tuđman was displeased with the proposal, the RSK authorities—influenced by Serbian President Slobodan Milošević—refused to receive the document, let alone discuss it. Milošević was concerned that the plan might be used to force the settlement of a crisis in Serbia's Kosovo province.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{team was}} largely that which had opposed the Claimant {{in the civil}} case, minus Coleridge. Hawkins led the team, his main assistants being Charles Bowen and James Mathew, both future judges. The Claimant's team was significantly weaker; he would not reengage Ballantine, and his other civil case lawyers declined to act for him again. Others refused the case, possibly because they knew {{they would have to}} present evidence concerning the seduction of Katherine Doughty. The Claimant's backers eventually engaged Edward Kenealy, an Irish lawyer of acknowledged gifts but known eccentricity. Kenealy had previously featured in several prominent defences, including those of the poisoner William Palmer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> of the 1867 Fenian Rising. He was assisted by undistinguished juniors: Patrick MacMahon, an Irish MP who was frequently absent, and the young and inexperienced Cooper Wyld. Kenealy's task was made more difficult when several of his upper-class witnesses refused to appear, perhaps afraid of the ridicule they anticipated from the Crown's lawyers. Other key witnesses from the civil case, including Moore, Baigent and Lipscombe, likewise would not give evidence at the criminal trial.|$|E
