Most of the films that are awarded the Golden Film have taken <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> to reach the target audience figure. Only Full Moon Party (2002) and Black Book (2006) have reached the criterion, for respectively 75,000 and , during their opening weekends.|$|E
5|$|While most jumping spiders {{are active}} hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, {{generally}} resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree barks, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} he reached his teens, Gygax had a {{voracious}} appetite for pulp fiction authors such as Robert Howard, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Burroughs. Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, a few months after his father died, he {{dropped out of high school}} in his junior year. He briefly joined the Marines, but after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, he was given a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother. From there, he commuted to a job as shipping clerk with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to Avalon Hill's new wargame Gettysburg, and Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games.|$|E
25|$|When in distress, the bongo emits a bleat. It uses {{a limited}} number of vocalisations, mostly grunts and snorts; females have a weak mooing contact-call for their young.

25|$|In a {{case-control study}} done {{following}} 5,286 Californians over a 28-year {{period in which}} variables were controlled for (i.e. age, race/ethnicity, gender, education level), participants who went to church on a frequent basis (defined as attending a religious service once <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>more)</b> were 36% less likely to die during that period.

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{religious}} affiliation, 96.1% {{of the population}} is Romanian Orthodox, 1.2% is Roman Catholic, 0.5% is Muslim, and 0.4% is Romanian Greek Catholic. Despite this, only 18% of the population, of any religion, attends a place of worship once <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> The life expectancy of residents of Bucharest in 2003–2005 was 74.14 years, around two years higher than the Romanian average.

25|$|According to the 2011 census, 93.6% {{of ethnic}} Romanians in Romania {{identified}} themselves as Romanian Orthodox (in comparison to 86.8% of Romania's total population, including other ethnic groups). However, the actual rate of church attendance is significantly lower and many Romanians are only nominally believers. For example, according to a 2006 Eurobarometer poll, only 23% of Romanians attend church once <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> A 2006 poll conducted by the Open Society Foundation found that only 33% of Romanians attended church once a month or more.|$|E
25|$|The Pigtail Ordinance was {{proposed}} {{as a solution}} to the overcrowding of jails due to the 1870 Sanitary Ordinance, which was originally meant to prevent unsafe tenement conditions in San Francisco. When in violation of the Sanitary Ordinance, one could either pay a fine or serve <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> in jail; for thousands of impoverished Chinese immigrants, free room and board was a welcome punishment. Ostensibly to prevent outbreaks of lice and fleas, the Supervisors began requiring that all prisoners' heads be shaved. Many equal rights advocates, however, claimed the Supervisors' true intent was to stem the tide of willing Chinese convicts.|$|E
25|$|In 1841, he {{was made}} surgeon to the Finsbury Dispensary, but this {{appointment}} did not give him any experience in the graver operations of surgery. He was appointed lecturer on general anatomy (microscopic anatomy) and physiology at the hospital in 1843, and warden of the hospital college then founded. For the next eight years, he lived {{within the walls of}} the hospital, in charge of about 30 students resident in the little college. Besides his lectures and his superintendence of the resident students, he had to enter all new students, to advise them how to work, and to manage the finances and the general affairs of the school. Thus, he was constantly occupied with the business of the school, and often passed <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> without going outside the hospital gates.|$|E

The results consolidate {{the validity of the}} basic model and show that freshness, convenience (distance), gender and the presence of children in the household had a significant effect on the frequency of shopping. In contrast, factors such as owning a refrigerator as well as income did not have a significant effect in shaping consumer shopping behaviour. ...|$|R
25|$|A {{qualified}} sleep specialist {{should be}} consulted for {{the diagnosis of}} any sleep disorder so the appropriate measures can be taken. Past medical history and a physical examination {{need to be done}} to eliminate other conditions that could be the cause of insomnia. After all other conditions are ruled out a comprehensive sleep history should be taken. The sleep history should include sleep habits, medications (prescription and non-prescription), alcohol consumption, nicotine and caffeine intake, co-morbid illnesses, and sleep environment. A sleep diary can be used {{to keep track of the}} individual's sleep patterns. The diary should include time to bed, total sleep time, time to sleep onset, number of awakenings, use of medications, time of awakening and subjective feelings in the morning. The sleep diary can be replaced or validated by the use of out-patient actigraphy for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> using a non-invasive device that measures movement.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Tenedos is {{referred}} to in Greek and Roman mythology, and archaeologists have uncovered evidence of its settlement from the Bronze Age. It would stay prominent through the age of classical Greece, fading {{by the time of}} the dominance of ancient Rome. Although a small island, Tenedos's position in the straits and its two harbors made it important to the Mediterranean powers over the centuries. For nine months of the year, the currents and the prevailing wind, the Etesian, came, and still come, from the Black Sea hampering sailing vessels headed for Constantinople. They had to wait <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> at Tenedos, waiting for the favorable southerly wind. Tenedos thus served as a shelter and way station for ships bound for the Hellespont, Propontis, Bosphorus, and places farther on. Several of the regional powers captured or attacked the island, including the Athenians, the Persians, the Macedonians under Alexander the Great, the Seleucids and the Attalids.|$|E

500|$|The {{transports}} {{always took}} off in daylight; weather reports were not available before dawn, and the fighter escort could not operate in darkness. Weather was a constant hazard over the Owen Stanley Range, and clouds could build up faster than an aircraft could climb. Poor flying weather, either over Port Moresby or over the target, could ground the transports for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> at a time. Weather and rough airstrips increased the amount of maintenance required to keep the planes flying. So too did the climate. The high humidity encouraged the growth of fungus which shorted out electrical components; metal surfaces were subject to corrosion; and lubrication oils evaporated in the high temperatures. Critical spare parts were often out of stock, and their delivery was an important role of the intra-theatre air transport. Availability did not just mean the transports; {{there was also the}} fighter escorts, which were normally based at another field. If they could not fly, or were required for another mission, then the transports could not fly. For planning purposes, a C-39 planeload was reckoned at [...] with [...] of fuel, while that of the larger C-53 was reckoned at [...] with [...] of fuel; but loading charts were not available in 1942, and aircraft were sometimes overloaded.|$|E

60|$|Gilbert Gildersleeve's heart gave another bound, {{still more}} violent than before. But again he {{repressed}} with difficulty all external symptoms of his profound agitation. This {{was very strange}} news. Then somebody else was suspected instead of himself. In one way that was bad; for Gilbert Gildersleeve had a conscience {{and a sense of}} justice. But, in another way, why, it would save time for the moment, and divert attention from his own personality. Better anything now than immediate suspicion.

25|$|Parasitoid wasps that parasitize tessaratomids {{usually come}} from the {{families}} Eupelmidae, Scelionidae, and Encyrtidae. Adult female parasitoid wasps will search out eggs laid by tessaratomoids. Upon finding some, they will thrust their ovipositors into them and lay eggs inside. The eggs of parasitoid wasps hatch and develop inside the tessaratomid eggs, feeding on the tessaratomid embryo and eventually killing it. Infested eggs characteristically turn darker in color as the wasp larva matures. After about <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> adult wasps will then emerge from the now empty egg.|$|R
