40|$|Abstract: This {{study is}} {{motivated}} {{to reveal the}} relationship between urban density <b>and</b> <b>car</b> use per capita, which most of preceding studies supported. First we re-examined the relationship by converting to that between total urban area <b>and</b> total <b>car</b> kilometers. Next, with person trip surveys conducted in Asian and American cities, the factors affecting both total urban area <b>and</b> total <b>car</b> kilometers were analyzed. We studied total urban area, <b>car</b> kilometers <b>and</b> their relationship with average travel speed and modal share, which were found to significantly affect these elements. Finally, we revealed that increase in average travel speed <b>and</b> <b>car</b> share contributed {{to the expansion of}} both total urban area <b>and</b> total <b>car</b> kilometers. It is proposed that the efficiency of public transportation, in terms of travel speed, could have the effect of constraining urban area <b>and</b> <b>car</b> use...|$|R
5|$|Breeding {{densities of}} this waxwing are {{typically}} {{low compared to}} other passerines, usually less than ten birds per square kilometre (26per square mile) even in good habitat, although up to 35Â·6birds per square kilometre (92per square mile) {{have been found in}} Russia. One brood each year is normal. Maximum recorded ages are 5years 10months in North America and more than 13years 6months in Europe. The average life expectancy is unknown.

5|$|In 1930, {{a history}} of the Boston Transcript, the most resolutely anti-union of Boston's {{newspapers}} in 1919, perpetuated its original account of urban chaos during the strike's first nights.

5|$|In Puerto Vallarta, about 100mi (164km) {{southeast}} of the landfall location, the storm surge resulted in an estimated damage total of US$5million, primarily to hotels. The surge flooded the hotels and other waterfront areas, and extended up to 330feet (100m) inland. Waist-deep floodwaters swept away vans <b>and</b> <b>cars,</b> ruining several vehicles. The passage of the hurricane destroyed 150stores near the ocean and extensively damaged three hotels. Damage to the city's port was minor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are physiologically {{important}} enzymes which {{participate in}} many gastrointestinal {{processes such as}} acid and bicarbonate secretion and metabolic pathways including gluconeogenesis and ureagenesis. The genomic data {{suggests that there are}} thirteen enzymatically active members of the mammalian CA isozyme family. In the present study, we systematically examined the mRNA expression levels of all known CA isozymes by quantitative real-time PCR in eight tissues of the digestive system of male and female mice. Results The CAs expressed in all tissues were Car 5 b, <b>Car</b> 7, <b>and</b> <b>Car</b> 15, among which Car 5 b showed moderate <b>and</b> <b>Car</b> 7 <b>and</b> <b>Car</b> 15 extremely low expression levels. Car 3, Car 12, <b>Car</b> 13, <b>and</b> <b>Car</b> 14 were detected in seven out of eight tissues <b>and</b> <b>Car</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>Car</b> 4 were expressed in six tissues. Importantly, Car 1, <b>Car</b> 3, <b>and</b> <b>Car</b> 13 showed very high expression levels in certain tissues as compared to the other CAs, suggesting that these low activity isozymes may also participate in physiological processes other than CA catalysis and high expression levels are required to fulfil their functions in the body. Conclusion A comprehensive mRNA expression profile of the 13 enzymatically active CAs in the murine gastrointestinal tract was produced in the present study. It contributes to {{a deeper understanding of the}} distribution of CA isozymes and their potential roles in the mouse digestive system. </p...|$|R

5|$|Iron {{and steel}} are used widely in the {{construction}} of roads, railways, other infrastructure, appliances, and buildings. Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel skeleton. Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. In addition, it sees widespread use in major appliances <b>and</b> <b>cars.</b> Despite growth in usage of aluminium, it is still the main material for car bodies. Steel is used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails, and screws and other household products and cooking utensils.|$|E
