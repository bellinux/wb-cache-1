500|$|Thomas was {{admitted}} to the emergency ward at St Vincent's Hospital at 1:58am. He was comatose, and his medical notes state that the [...] "impression upon admission was acute <b>alcoholic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> damage to the brain by alcohol, for which the patient was treated without response". Caitlin flew to America the following day and was taken to the hospital, by which time a tracheotomy had been performed. Her reported first words were, [...] "Is the bloody man dead yet?" [...] She was allowed to see Thomas only for 40 minutes in the morning but returned in the afternoon and, in a drunken rage, threatened to kill Brinnin. When she became uncontrollable, she was put in a straitjacket and committed, by Feltenstein, to the River Crest private psychiatric detox clinic on Long Island.|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} {{transcranial}} electrostimulation (TES) {{was used for}} treating patients with <b>alcoholic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> {{against the background of}} the basic treatment, which includes nootropics, normotimics, soporifics, over-all strengthening therapy and other devices. The course of treatment consisted of 10 daily procedures lasting for 30 minutes. The TES influence was evaluated according to the clinical state, the neurologic status, including EEG (electroencephalogram), the psychometric scales were also used for evaluating the manifestation of depression, anxiety and working memory in comparison with appropriate indices in the control group of patients, who were being treated by the traditional method. TES led to normalization of health state, neurologic status and vegetative innervation, the reduction in pathologic inclination, which corresponded to general improvement of the state of patients, EEG indices and psychometric scale...|$|E
40|$|Neuropathological {{finding of}} {{central nervous system}} of a patient with chronic {{alcoholism}} were reported. A 41 -year-old male patient was admitted to a mental hospital in order to treat chronic alcoholism associated with schizophreniform psychosis, Moreover {{he had had a}} history of amphetamine dependence 20 years prior to admission. Three years later, the patient developed chronic recurrent epigastralgia, dyspepsia and vomiting. 24 hours prior to death, he fell into a coma, which was soon followed by respirato-circulatory collapse. Autopsy of the central nervous system disclosed : scattered petechial hemorrhages and overproduction and dilatation of small vessels in 1); the midbrain quadrigeminal body, 2); gray matter near the fourth ventricle and 3); medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. While the mammilary body, which was thought to be the most common site of involvement in <b>alcoholic</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> was completely spared both macro-and microscopically. The problem of the distribution of the lesions in Wernicke's encephalopathy was discussed in comparison with the so called adult tyoe of Leigh's subacute necrotizing encephalopathy...|$|E
50|$|Chromatolysis {{has been}} {{reported}} in patients with <b>alcoholic</b> <b>encephalopathies.</b> Central chromatolysis was observed mainly among neurons in the brainstem, particularly in the pontine nuclei and the cerebellar dentate nuclei. Nuclei of cranial nerves, arcuate nuclei, and posterior horn cells were also affected. Studies examining patients with <b>alcoholic</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> give evidence of central chromatolysis. Mild to severe degeneration of spinal cord tracks has been observed in patients with Marchiafava-Bignami disease and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, both forms of encephalopathy linked to alcohol.|$|R
40|$|Clinical and postmortem {{findings}} of a case that had combined <b>alcoholic</b> pellagra <b>encephalopathy</b> and Wernicke disease are described. This 51 -year-old malnourished and chronic alcoholic man presented with progressive mental deterioration, pellagra dermatitis, hypertonus of the neck and other musculatures, myoclonic jerks with bizarre involuntary movements, in addition to total external ophthalmoplegia and gait disturbance. After administration of multivitamins, including thiamine and nicotinamide, these neurologic abnormalities were dramatically improved in a few days. However, the patient died thereafter because of sepsis associated with pneumonia. Postmortem examination revealed marked abnormalities in CNS, characterized by diffuse atrophy of gray matter and widespread neuronal degeneration and characteristic central chromatolysis in pontine nuclei, dentate nuclei, cranial nerve nuclei in the brain stem, Betz cells of the cerebral cortex, and Clarke's column and anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. There were also atrophy and gliosis of the mammillary bodies, degeneration and vascular proliferation of periaqueductal gray matter, and massive gliosis around the third ventricle. These neuropathological changes were compatible with symptoms of both <b>alcoholic</b> pellagra <b>encephalopathy</b> and Wernicke's disease, {{but they were also}} strongly suspected on clinical grounds...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol misuse {{and alcohol}} {{withdrawal}} {{are associated with}} a variety of neuropsychiatric syndromes, some of which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. B vitamin deficiency is known to contribute to the aetiology of a number of these syndromes, and B vitamin supplementation thus plays a significant part in prophylaxis and treatment. In particular, the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS), due to thiamine deficiency, ij a common condition in association with alcohol misuse, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Nicotinamide deficiency may result in a rarer condition, <b>alcoholic</b> pellagra <b>encephalopathy,</b> which often has a similar clinical presentation to WKS. This review considers the role of B vitamins in the aetiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric syndromes associated with alcohol misuse, with particular emphasis on WKS...|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{cases of}} {{neurological}} syndrome due to severe hyponatræmia were investigated. Serum-sodium levels ranged between 120 and 98 meq. per litre. Neurological signs included disorders of consciousness (stage I and II coma) sometimes associated with pyramidal signs or epileptic attacks. In all {{cases where the}} electroencephalogram was recorded, it showed diffuse theta and delta waves. Hypokalæmia was frequent. In no case were there signs of intracranial hypertension. Necropsy in three cases, after correction of hyponatræmia, showed no lesions of cerebral œdema, but there were lesions characteristic of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> in two cases. In all twelve cases, a sodium-depletion factor lay at {{the origin of the}} hyponatræmia, often associated with a dilution factor. In the seven most severe cases of hyponatræmia there was beer potomania. The importance of this factor in the pathogenesis of hyponatræmia may be explained by sodium deficiency in the diet, the absorption of large quantities of water, and the possible role of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone in these alcoholic patients. Under adequate treatment the neurological symptoms disappeared in all cases. © 1971. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroduction: The antrochoanal polyp is a {{prevalent}} pathology in {{teenagers and}} young adults. It usually presents with nasal obstruction. Patient and method: Case report: An 80 -year-old male with <b>alcoholic</b> <b>encephalopathy,</b> chronic bronchial disease of unknown etiology and polypoid chronic rhinosinusitis {{came to the}} emergency service with severe dyspnea without laryngeal features. Anterior rhinoscopy showed a polypoid mass in left nostril that prevented the visualization with nasal endoscopy. Examination of the mouth revealed a large polypoid mass involving nasopharynx and extends to hypopharynx until the laryngeal side of epiglottis. CT was requested urgently. ResultsCT demonstrated an almost complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus, left complex ethmoid cells {{and the presence of}} a soft-tissue mass, passing through the maxilary ostium into the posterior nasal cavity and choana. Mass caudal extention was located close to the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis and partially occupying the laryngeal vestibule conditioning the air way. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery was performed urgently with clinical remission. ConclusionsIn case we are treating a patient with severe dyspnea, we must determinate the etiology and localization of it, in order to decide the best treatment option. Dyspnea´s features dismissed the laryngeal site. Complementary image studies give us information about the extension. Antrochoanal polyp cases causing dyspnea are unsual, but we must think of it, or in pharyngeal formations, every time dyspnea improves with a cervical extention...|$|E
30|$|Benzodiazepines and opioid {{withdrawal}} syndromes {{may represent}} an important cause of delirium after discontinuation of sedation. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome often is evoked {{in a patient}} {{with a history of}} alcohol dependence who develops encephalopathy [78]. The predominance of psychomotor agitation and autonomic signs are suggestive of the diagnosis. The benefit of alcohol withdrawal prophylaxis is unproven. Early and aggressive titration of medication guided by symptoms is the only feature associated with improved outcomes. In malnourished or <b>alcoholic</b> patients, Wernicke’s <b>encephalopathy</b> must always be evoked and treated with intravenous thiamine, especially if there is evidence of ophthalmoplegia or ataxia [79]. Thiamine deficiency can be aggravated by infusion of glucose. Tobacco dependency is a risk factor for delirium in critically ill patients, which may be prevented by use of nicotine patch in chronic smokers [80]. Numerous iatrogenic and/or environmental factors also may aggravate brain dysfunction, such as use of physical restraints, excessive noise, or underexposure to light in the ICU [81, 82].|$|R
40|$|AbstractSubacute {{encephalopathy}} with seizures {{in chronic}} alcoholism (SESA) was first described in 1981 by Niedermeyer who reported alcoholic patients presenting with confusion, seizures and focal neurological deficits and is quite distinct from patients presenting with typical alcohol withdrawal seizures. EEG often reveals periodic discharges and spikes, but SESA presenting with non-convulsive status epilepticus {{has rarely been}} described. We report a case of SESA with non-convulsive status epilepticus in a patient who was initially suspected of having a typical alcohol withdrawal seizure. A 61 year old woman {{with a history of}} chronic alcoholism was admitted at an outside hospital for confusion thought to be secondary to an alcohol withdrawal seizure. She had right hemiparesis and later developed right facial twitching that did not respond to intravenous fosphenytoin and levetiracetam. She was transferred for further management. Upon arrival, lorazepam and fosphenytoin were given and right face clonic movements resolved. However, continuous EEG monitoring revealed ongoing non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Following treatment with IV valproate and lacosamide, there was resolution of NCSE. SESA is likely an under recognized clinical syndrome that is quite distinct from typical alcohol withdrawal seizures and requires a different diagnostic and management approach. NCSE is likely to account for the encephalopathy and focal neurological deficits seen in patients presenting with the clinical syndrome of SESA. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion is warranted and continuous EEG monitoring is recommended for <b>alcoholic</b> patients with <b>encephalopathy</b> and focal neurological deficits...|$|R
