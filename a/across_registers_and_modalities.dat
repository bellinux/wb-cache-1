40|$|Although {{there have}} been {{numerous}} investigations of 				laryngeal muscle activity during phonation in the chest <b>and</b> 				falsetto/head <b>registers</b> in trained <b>and</b> untrained classical 				singers and non-singers, no research has been conducted 				examining laryngeal muscle activity during phonation in the 				chestmix register, a register used extensively by many female 				commercial singers, particularly for the production of higher 				frequencies. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the 				hypothesis that commercial singers produce chestmix by 				maintaining or increasing adduction of the vocal processes and 				by engaging the thyroarytenoid muscle to a greater degree than 				they would to produce a head register sound. Simultaneous 				recordings of thyroarytenoid and cricothyroid muscle activity, 				videonasendosopy, and audio were obtained from seven female 				commercial singers (5 trained, 2 untrained) during sustained 				phonation and song phrases produced in chest, chestmix, headmix, 				<b>and</b> head <b>registers.</b> Thryoarytenoid <b>and</b> cricothyroid muscle 				activity was normalized to a percent of mean maximum activity 				<b>and</b> compared <b>across</b> <b>registers</b> <b>and</b> frequencies both within 				subjects and across subjects. Video stills of vocal processes 				adduction patterns were rated for degree of vocal processes 				adduction <b>and</b> also compared <b>across</b> <b>register</b> <b>and</b> frequency within 				and across subjects.

Interjudge 				and intrajudge reliability tests were performed for both the 				vocal processes adduction rating and audio sample rating tasks. 				Results from the study confirmed the hypothesis and showed that 				thyroarytenoid activity and adduction of the vocal processes was 				greater for chestmix than headmix or head, particularly during 				production of higher frequencies, but less than for chest 				productions.

40|$|Due to the ad-hoc specication methodology, typical ASIC de-signs {{are highly}} {{unbalanced}} {{with respect to}} the timing criticality of their logic paths. Traditional combinational synthesis does not support borrowing of timing slack <b>across</b> <b>registers</b> <b>and</b> therefore may result in a drastic overdesign of many paths and an overall loss of performance. This can be particularly harmful when paths are sped up through resizing which incurs an exponential cost in area. In this paper we present how clock latency scheduling inter-leaved with combinational optimization can be applied to optimize the performance and area of designs. In contrast to a retiming-based approach, we show that clock latency scheduling is compu-tationally more efcient for inclusion in an inner synthesis loop and can also perform slack balancing which provides a good starting point for heuristic area minimization. Our preliminary experiments applying the presented ow based on an industrial synthesis tool to standard benchmark circuits and customer ASIC designs show an average improvement in performance of 17 % and in area of 2 %. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} characterisation of multiword expressions (MWEs) is tightly {{connected to}} their actual occurrences in data {{and to their}} representation in lexical resources. We present three lexical resources for Italian MWEs, namely an electronic lexicon, a series of example corpora and a database of MWEs represented around morphosyntactic patterns. These resources are matched against, and created from, a very large web-derived corpus for Italian that spans <b>across</b> <b>registers</b> <b>and</b> domains. We can thus test expressions coded by lexicographers in a dictionary, thereby discarding unattested expressions, revisiting lexicographers’s choices {{on the basis of}} frequency information, {{and at the same time}} creating an example sub-corpus for each entry. We organise MWEs on the basis of the morphosyntactic information obtained from the data in an electronic, flexible knowledge-base containing structured annotation exploitable for multiple purposes.

40|$|Typical ASIC {{designs are}} highly {{unbalanced}} {{with respect to}} the timing criticality of their combinational logic paths. This is mainly due to the ad-hoc manual design specification of the register transfer level (RTL), which does not use any information regarding the sequential timing criticality. Traditional logic synthesis does not support “borrowing ” of timing slack <b>across</b> <b>registers,</b> <b>and</b> the optimization is restricted by fixed positions of the registers. This may result in a suboptimal solution, in a loss of performance, and unnecessary area and power consumption. This paper explains the concept of clock scheduling and retiming used by Encounter RTL Compiler (RC) to optimize <b>across</b> <b>register</b> boundaries. Retiming is a structural transformation which changes the positions of the registers without modifying the input-output behavior of the circuit. The reader will understand how the area, the number of registers, or the delay of the design is minimized. Computational results show the tradeoff between these two objectives. Practical applications are discussed: Registers may have different control signals, enable signals, or reset signals. This leads to the multiclass retiming problem and the reset line justification problem. Retiming used to be a difficult challenge for equivalence checking. However, together with Encounter Conformal Logic Equivalence Checker (LEC) the verification is now simple: RC writes out checkpoint netlist files and one script, which LEC can then process to automatically verify the golden RTL against the final netlist. We present a case study showing how retiming was used by Focus Semiconductor, a division of Focus Enhancements, on a 1. 5 M instance UWB baseband chip. Retiming substantially improved the Quality of Results (QoR) and helped to meet the design objectives. CDNLive! Silicon Valley 2006 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – To {{discuss the}} gender {{dimension}} of migration and human rights, {{and to provide}} an assessment of how to improve human rights protections for migrant women workers in janitorial services <b>and</b> night clubs <b>across</b> <b>registered</b> <b>and</b> unregistered migrant women workers in North Cyprus. Design/methodology/approach – A survey is done to establish the employment conditions of migrant women workers in both sectors. The conditions are evaluated to assess the compliance with North Cyprus labor and immigration legislation and international human rights protocols. Findings – <b>Registered</b> <b>and</b> unregistered segment of the janitorial services and unregistered segment of sex industry are dominated by Turkish migrant women. The registered part of sex industry is dominated by Eastern European migrant women mostly due to the legislative framework within which these two activities operate, primarily with respect to immigration requirements and also {{as it pertains to}} the remunerative potential of activity. No evidences of human rights abuses of Turkish immigrants in either segment of the cleaning services sector are founded but lack of knowledge of their conditions in unregistered sex work. Eastern European migrants working in the registered segment of the sex industry suffer human rights and basic migrant rights abuses {{at the hands of the}} state and the employer. Research limitations/implications – Lack of knowledge of Turkish migrant women workers' conditions in unregistered segment of sex work limits the findings of the research. A survey across unregistered Turkish sex workers is suggested for future research. Practical implications – Legalization of commercial sex among registered konsomatrices would provide an opportunity for labor rights legislation to be fully applied to their primary income-earning activities. Most of the human and immigrant rights violations are the result of legislation applied to nightclubs and work visas for konsomatrices. Improvements in the legislation and work visas for konsomatrices would guarantee the women to have access to assistance in case of human rights violations. Originality/value – The paper provides practical suggestion for the improvement of human rights protections for migrant women workers in North Cyprus.

40|$|Abstract Background Environmental {{pollution}} as a {{cause of}} congenital anomalies is sometimes suspected because of clustering of anomalies in areas of higher exposure. This highlights questions around spatial heterogeneity (clustering) in congenital anomaly rates. If spatial variation is endemic, then any one specific cluster is less remarkable, though the presence of uncontrolled geographically clustered risk factors is suggested. If rates are relatively homogeneous across space other than around specific hazards, then evidence for these hazards causing the clusters is strengthened. We sought to estimate the extent of spatial heterogeneity in congenital anomaly rates in the United Kingdom. Methods The study population covered about one million births from five registers in Britain from 1991 – 1999. We estimated heterogeneity across four geographical levels: register area, hospital catchment, electoral ward, and enumeration district, using a negative binomial regression model. We also sought clusters using a circular scan statistic. Results Congenital anomaly rates clearly varied <b>across</b> <b>register</b> areas <b>and</b> hospital catchments (p 0. 2). Adjusting for socioeconomic deprivation and maternal age made little difference to the extent of geographical variation for most congenital anomaly subtypes. The two most significant circular clusters (of four ano-rectal atresias and six congenital heart diseases) contained two or more siblings. Conclusion The variation in rates between <b>registers</b> <b>and</b> hospital catchment area may have resulted in part from differences in case ascertainment, and this should be taken into account in geographical epidemiological studies of environmental exposures. The absence of evidence for variation below this level should be interpreted cautiously in view of the low power of general heterogeneity tests. Nevertheless, the data suggest that strong localised clusters in congenital anomalies are uncommon, so clusters around specific putative environmental hazards are remarkable when observed. Negative binomial models applied at successive hierarchical levels provide an approach of intermediate complexity to characterising geographical heterogeneity. </p...|$|R

40|$|Restricted until 2 April 2009. One of the {{fundamental}} principles of sociolinguistics is that language is not homogeneous and that no single person speaks {{in the same way}} all the time. Numerous studies have provided evidence of linguistic variation across situations of use in English (e. g. Bell 1984; Biber 1988; Biber and Finegan 1994). However, under special conditions when a language is restricted to very familiar situations, speakers might not show register variation (Dressler 1982). For most heritage speakers of Spanish in the U. S., English is the dominant language while Spanish is largely restricted to home and family interactions. This dissertation explores the hypothesis of variation <b>across</b> <b>registers</b> in Spanish as a heritage language. Additionally, it examines speakers of Spanish as a second language since Spanish is also their non-dominant language.; For the purpose of studying <b>register</b> <b>and</b> style variation, this dissertation focuses on several linguistic features that are expected to vary in relation to the type of register: discourse particles, contractions, and various lexical choices. The data analyzed come from recorded spoken samples produced in Spanish by heritage and second language speakers and collected in three situations of use: conversations, interviews, and presentations, ranging on a scale from less to more formal.; The results indicate that both heritage and second language speakers show linguistic variation in their Spanish <b>across</b> <b>registers.</b> The results also reveal some quantitative as well as qualitative differences between the production of heritage and second language speakers <b>across</b> <b>registers.</b> These contrasts are the result of the different input to which the speakers have been exposed to during acquisition.; This dissertation contributes to further our understanding of bilingualism by examining Spanish as a heritage and as a second language <b>across</b> different <b>registers,</b> which has not been previously investigated. It provides evidence of variation in a relatively small range of registers in the speakers' non-dominant language. This is an important finding since it shows that even when the use of the language is largely restricted to a particular domain (home and family interactions for heritage speakers and classroom interactions for second language learners), we can still find register variation...|$|R

However, certain topic areas lack representation {{in terms of the}} quantity and quality of review literature available. The objectives of this paper are to identify the quantity, as well as quality, of review-level evidence available on the effectiveness of public health interventions for public health decision makers. Methods Searches conducted on [URL] produced an inventory of public health review literature in 21 topic areas. Gaps and areas of wealth in the review literature, as well as the proportion of reviews rated methodologically strong, moderate, or weak were identified. The top 10 topic areas of interest for <b>registered</b> users <b>and</b> visitors of [URL] were extracted from user profile data and Google Analytics. Results Registered users' top three interests included: 1) healthy communities, 2) chronic diseases, and 3) nutrition. The top three preferences for visitors included: 1) chronic diseases, 2) physical activity, and 3) addiction/substance use. All of the topic areas with many (301 +) available reviews were of interest to registered users and/or visitors (mental health, physical activity, addiction/substance use, adolescent health, child health, nutrition, adult health, and chronic diseases). Conversely, the majority of registered users and/or visitors did not have preference for topic areas with few (≤ 150) available reviews (food safety and inspection, dental health, environmental health) with the exception of social determinants of health <b>and</b> healthy communities. <b>Across</b> <b>registered</b> users' <b>and</b> visitors' topic areas of preference, 80. 2 % of the reviews were of well-done methodological quality, with 43. 5 % of reviews having a strong quality rating and 36. 7 % a moderate review quality rating. Conclusions In topic areas in which many reviews are available, higher level syntheses are needed to guide policy and practice. For other topic areas with few reviews, it is necessary to determine whether primary study evidence exists, or is needed, so that reviews can be conducted in the future. Considering that less than half of the reviews available on [URL] are of strong methodological quality, the quality of the review-level evidence needs to improve across the range of public health topic areas. </p...|$|R
