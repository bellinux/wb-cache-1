50|$|Conduct {{usually takes}} the form of statements, either oral or in writing; nevertheless, other forms of conduct, such as {{physical}} contact or gestures, could also arise. The principles are the same as those applicable to the <b>Aquilian</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
500|$|Contrectatio meant [...] "handling" [...] and was {{established}} as the prohibited action associated with furtum {{before the end}} of the republic. Furtum had in the early and mid-Republic required the carrying away of a thing. This was widened and there are several examples from the classical Rome and later where it is even hard to find physical contact in any sense. Contrectatio extended to dealing with the thing as if the owner, and [...] "physical interference" [...] can be considered a more accurate term than just touching. The idea of furtum, and conrectatio in particular, broadened during the republic to complement the narrowly defined Lex Aquilia. This did, for example, include using a borrowed thing in a way which went beyond that agreed with the lender (furtum usus), such as borrowing a horse and riding it for longer than agreed. During the Republic, no distinction was made in language between furtum usus and furtum in general. Contrectio included what might be thought of as fraud: knowingly accepting a wrongful payment, or embezzlement, for example. The case of wrongful payment is problematic, because a mistaken payment still transferred ownership; it seems contradictory that the receiver was granted ownership and still liable for theft. To accept a thing as a pledge knowing that it did not belong to the pledgor was also furtum [...] not merely acting as an accomplice. Plautus, a playwright, suggests that failing to report a theft after the fact was furtum, but this should not be assumed. The development of contrectio as the preferred prohibited act accompanied that of the criminal law, the actio doli (for fraud) and the <b>Aquilian</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fault {{must be in}} {{the form}} of {{intention}}. One cannot be held liable for having negligently insulted or defamed another, or for having negligently invaded another's privacy. The intention element is the same as that discussed under the <b>Aquilian</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
50|$|Again, the wrongfulness {{element is}} the same as that under the <b>Aquilian</b> <b>action.</b> The test is one of {{objective}} reasonableness. One has {{to determine whether or not}} the plaintiff's personality right was infringed in an unlawful way and without justification. The applicable defences are different, however.|$|E
5000|$|The Roman-Dutch {{action for}} pain and {{suffering}} (Afrik aksie weens pyn en lyding), or action for solatium, developed in the 17th century partly from the <b>Aquilian</b> <b>action,</b> partly {{from the use of}} reparative fines (or zoengeld, compositie) under Dutch customary law. This action may be raised on five essential heads of liability: ...|$|E
50|$|The primary {{object of}} {{an award for}} damages is to {{compensate}} {{the person who has}} suffered harm. In respect of a claim in terms of the <b>Aquilian</b> <b>action,</b> there is only one function: to restore the plaintiff's patrimony and, as far as possible, to place him in the position he would have occupied in had the delict not been committed. Money is considered an adequate replacement for the lost patrimony. Damages under the <b>Aquilian</b> <b>action</b> do not serve to assuage wounded feelings or to compensate for inconvenience or discomfort or annoyance. (Any element of attachment or affection for a damaged article, for example, is excluded.) Where harm admits of exact monetary quantification, the plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence to make an accurate assessment. A court will not make an arbitrary award in the absence of available evidence. Where damages cannot be computed exactly, a court may exercise its own judgment in the matter, provided it has a factual basis for so doing.|$|E
50|$|One obvious {{prerequisite}} for liability {{in terms of}} the law of delict is that the plaintiff must have suffered harm; {{in terms of the}} <b>Aquilian</b> <b>action,</b> that harm must be patrimonial, which traditionally meant monetary loss sustained due to physical damage to a person or property. Now, however, patrimonial loss also includes monetary loss resulting from injury to the nervous system and pure economic loss. A plaintiff may claim compensation both for loss actually incurred and for prospective loss, including, for instance, the loss of earning capacity, future profits, income and future expenses.|$|E
5000|$|The delictual inquiry [...] "is {{in fact a}} loss-allocation exercise, the {{principles}} and rules of which are {{set out in the}} law of delict." [...] The classic remedy for a delict is compensation: a claim of damages for the harm caused. If this harm takes the form of patrimonial loss, one uses the Aquilian action; if pain and suffering associated with bodily injury, a separate action arises, similar to the <b>Aquilian</b> <b>action</b> but of Germanic origin; finally, if the harm takes the form of injury to a personality interest (an injuria), the claim is made in terms of the actio injuriarum.|$|E
40|$|LLM (Estate Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The trustee has a {{fiduciary}} responsibility {{towards the}} parties {{with an interest}} in the trust. The parties {{with an interest in}} the trust may have certain expectations and requirements of the trustee. The main responsibility and accountability ascribed to and expected of the trustee are for the proper maintenance and administration of the trust and its assets. The parties with an interest in the trust may be classified according to how closely involved or affected they are by the existence of the trust. The parties closest to the trust are listed as the founder, beneficiaries and co-trustees. Parties with a judiciary, legislative and administrative interest in the trust include the Master of the High Court, the High Court and the auditors as well as accountants of the trust. The parties with an interest in the trust may not be satisfied with the actions or performance of the trustee. These parties may seek actions and remedies to hold the trustee accountable. These actions and remedies may be found in legislation, the literature, common law or court judgements. It would also be in the trustee’s interest to be informed of the different actions and remedies that could be utilised to hold him accountable. Different types of action are available to hold the trustee accountable, including civil and criminal remedies. The Trust Property Control Act 57 of 1988 does not provide for criminal remedies, but provides an array of civil remedies to hold trustees accountable. The <b>Aquilian</b> <b>action</b> is also available to parties to hold a trustee accountable who committed a breach of trust. The focus of the mini-dissertation is to determine the landscape of remedies and actions available to parties with an interest in the trust in order to hold the trustee accountable. Master...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{will explore}} the revolutionary progression {{in the provision}} of monetary damages and the availability thereof due to the change in South Africa’s legal system from Parliamentary sovereignty to Constitutional supremacy after the enactment of the final Constitution in 19961. The Constitution of South Africa brought with it the concepts of justification and accountability as the Bill of Rights enshrines fundamental rights and the remedies for the infringement of same. The available remedies for the infringement of a fundamental right flow from two sources, being either from the development of the common law remedies in line with the Bill of Rights or alternatively from Section 38 of the Constitution, which provides for a remedy which provides ‘appropriate’ relief. The question that will be raised in this dissertation is, ‘does appropriate relief include an award of delictual damages?’ or a question related thereto ‘is an award of monetary damages an appropriate remedy?’ The motivation for this dissertation arises from the plethora of case law, especially in the Eastern Cape, that has come to the fore in the last sixteen years, highlighting the injustice of cancellations of social assistance grants and the non-payment of such in South Africa’s social security system, as well as the precedent that was set by our Constitutional Court and Supreme Court in remedying that injustice. The central case to this dissertation is that of Kate v Member of Executive Council for Department of Welfare, Eastern Cape 2005 1 SA 141 SECLD; Member of Executive Council, Department of Welfare, Eastern Cape v Kate 2006 (4) SA 478 (SCA), which is generally regarded as having {{paved the way for the}} granting of monetary damages for the infringement of an individual’s constitutional right as same require legal protection. Firstly the past approach to damages will be explored in relation to South Africa’s common law, being the Roman-Dutch law. The common law <b>Aquilian</b> <b>action</b> is the focal point of this dissertation in relation to the common law in that the granting of damages for the infringement of an individual’s social assistance right (being a specific constitutional right framed within the 1996 Constitution) results in pure patrimonial loss which in our common law system was remedied by the actio legis Aquilae. In delict, an award of damages is the primary remedy, aimed at affording compensation in respect of the legal right or interest infringed. After the common law system of damages has been explored, this dissertation will then examine the changes that have developed therefrom, and largely shaped by the current state of disorganization in the National Department of Welfare coupled with the all encompassing power of the final Constitution. The final Constitution provides the power, in section 38 of the 1996 Constitution, for the court to award a monetary remedy for the breach of a constitutional right. The question, however, is “does the award of monetary damages not merely throw money at the problem, whereas the purpose of a constitutional remedy is to vindicate guaranteed rights and prevent or deter future violations?” The battle for domination between the common law approach and the constitutional approach to damages is witnessed as the two systems eventually amalgamate to form an essentially new remedy, unique to South Africa. South Africa’s new system is aligned with the Constitution as the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and underpins the awarding of all damages and, especially, the awarding of constitutional damages. For the sake of completeness, alternatives to monetary damages will also be canvassed in this dissertation. It is hoped that the reader will, in the end, realize that the final Constitution is the supreme law of the land and as such dictates the manner and form in which damages are provided. If such provision is not in alignment with the Constitution, it will be declared invalid. The flexibility of our common law is put to the test, yet it is found to be adaptable to the ever-developing boni mores of society exemplified in the embracing constitutional principles and the production of this new remedy. The courts develop the common law under section 39 (2) of the Constitution in order to keep the common law in step with the evolution of our society and the ever changing nature of bonos mores.
