5|$|The action quickly {{revealed}} {{a breakdown in}} discipline amongst Benbow's captains. He had intended that the 64-gun HMS Defiance under Captain Richard Kirkby would lead the line of battle, but Kirkby was not maintaining his station. Benbow {{decided to take the}} lead himself, and the Breda pulled ahead, followed by the 50-gun HMS Ruby under Captain George Walton. The two maintained contact with the French throughout the night, but the other five ships refused to close. The chase ensued until 24 August, with only Benbow, Walton, and Samuel Vincent aboard HMS Falmouth making active efforts to bring the French to battle. At times, they bore the brunt of the fire of the entire squadron. The Ruby was disabled on 23 August, and Benbow ordered her to retire to Port Royal. The French resumed the action <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the morning on 24 August, the entire squadron closing on the Breda from astern and pounding her. Benbow himself was hit by a chain-shot that broke his leg and he was carried below.|$|E

Due to bad weather, he was only able to transfer to the Portuguese frigate Pérola on February 9, which arrived in England accompanied by two British ships. On January 22, the Gazeta de Lisboa (English: Lisbon Gazette) published an open letter from the Ministério da Justiça (English: Ministry of Justice) which permitted any general demonstrations of jubilation (unless otherwise prohibited by law). The prince's ship arrived in Lisbon on February 22 and was met by cannon salvos from ships along the Tagus River and from the hilltops, beginning <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon. The river was filled with ships when the Pérola arrived.|$|E

25|$|On April 5, in his Red Sox debut, David Price {{struck out}} ten Indians batters and earned the win. He became the fifth Red Sox pitcher {{to win an}} opening day game in his debut for the ball club and the first since Pedro Martínez did it in 1998. Mookie Betts went deep in the third innings, scoring Jackie Bradley, Jr. and gave Boston an early 2–0 lead. In a four-hit inning, Cleveland brought two runners home and the game was tied <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> {{the bottom of the}} fourth. In the sixth, on a Travis Shaw single, Hanley Ramírez took third base from first, and scored on a Brock Holt blooper to left field. Travis Shaw took third on a Blake Swihart ground out and scored on a wild pitch by Corey Kluber. Junichi Tazawa and Koji Uehara retired all batters they faced in the seventh and eighth {{respectively}} and with Craig Kimbrel warming in the bullpen and Dustin Pedroia on first, David Ortiz hit his fifth opening day home run of his career, extending the lead to 6–2. Although not a save situation, Kimbrel made his Red Sox debut in the ninth and shut the door, allowing a walk and striking out two.|$|E
500|$|... "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] was the album's third {{single in}} Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Denmark and fourth in France. The song {{received}} mixed reviews. Some critics {{compared it to}} nineties Europop while the others criticized it for bringing the party-like nature of the album {{to a halt and}} thus being an embarrassment to the album. It failed to match the success of the previous singles in Australia and New Zealand by reaching 15 and nine, respectively. It peaked <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> Sweden and at seven in France.|$|E

500|$|In September 1992, {{the concerts}} went ahead as {{scheduled}} but Zappa could only appear <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> Frankfurt due to illness.

Zappa received a 20-minute ovation. G-Spot Tornado was performed with Canadian dancer Louise Lecavalier. It was his last professional public appearance as the cancer was spreading {{to such an extent that}} he was in too much pain to enjoy an event that he otherwise found [...] "exhilarating". Recordings from the concerts appeared on The Yellow Shark (1993), Zappa's last release during his lifetime, and some material from studio rehearsals appeared on the posthumous Everything Is Healing Nicely (1999).|$|E
500|$|As the 1985–86 season approached, McDonald endured {{questions}} about whether he was reaching the point where age and injuries meant {{he could no longer}} be an effective NHL player. Hoping to prove himself, he set a goal of playing all 80games for the Flames. He succeeded, and scored 28goals and 71points in the process, despite dislocating his thumb in the pre-season and suffering minor knee and hip injuries {{during the course of the}} year. [...] He later said it was a matter of pride to him not to miss a game. In the playoffs, McDonald was witness to one of the most infamous mistakes in NHL history. [...] With the score tied <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the seventh game of the Smythe Division final against Edmonton, McDonald chased Oilers' rookie Steve Smith around the Edmonton net. Smith attempted to pass the puck forward, but inadvertently hit the back of goaltender Grant Fuhr's skate, deflecting the puck into his own net.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of an ascent of Helvellyn {{for the pleasure of}} doing so is contained in James Clarke's guidebook of 1787. He quotes the account of an unnamed gentleman from Penrith who wanted to eat his dinner on Midsummer Day while sitting in a snowdrift on top of Helvellyn. The man left home <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the morning, rode to Glencoyne and left his horse at a house in the valley there. He started to walk up the mountain at between four and five in the morning and after five hours hot and hard work he reached the snow and the summit. The snow was covered with dust so he had to dig for clean snow to eat with his dinner. He returned by a different route, reaching Glencoyne ten hours after leaving it. This story seems to reflect the colder climatic conditions of the eighteenth century, during the so-called [...] "Little Ice Age".|$|E

500|$|On his hiring, Baker explained, [...] "I did the Dino De Laurentiis {{version of}} King Kong in 1976 {{and was always}} {{disappointed}} because I wasn't {{able to do it}} as realistically as I wanted. I thought Apes would {{be a good way to}} make up for that." [...] In addition to King Kong, Baker previously worked with designing ape makeup on , , and the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young. The makeup took 4.5 hours to apply and 1.5 hours to remove. Burton explained, [...] "it's like going to the dentist <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the morning and having people poke at you for hours. Then you wear an ape costume until nine at night." [...] Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially [...] "more animal-like; flying through trees, climb walls, swing out of windows, and go ape shit when angry." [...] For a month and a half before shooting started, the actors who portrayed apes attended [...] "ape school". Industrial Light & Magic, Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences. Rick Heinrichs served as the production designer and Colleen Atwood did costume design.|$|E
500|$|In July 1965, {{the single}} [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] peaked <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. and {{at four in}} the UK charts. At over six minutes, the song altered what a pop single could convey. Bruce Springsteen, in his speech for Dylan's inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said that on first hearing the single, [...] "that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind". In 2004 and in 2011, Rolling Stone listed it as number one of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". The song opened Dylan's next album, Highway 61 Revisited, [...] named after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans. The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar and Al Kooper's organ riffs. [...] "Desolation Row", backed by {{acoustic}} guitar and understated bass, offers the sole exception, with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as [...] "an 11-minute epic of entropy, which {{takes the form of a}} Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters, some historical (Einstein, Nero), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary (T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoppus {{attributed}} the album's delay {{to the band}} learning to work by themselves without Finn, and both DeLonge and Hoppus expressed frustration during the sessions at the band's cabal of publicists, managers and attorneys (which DeLonge described as [...] "the absolute diarrhea of bureaucracy"). A result of the band's split was each members hiring his own attorney, and, during the sessions of Neighborhoods, the band had four managers. Later, {{it was revealed that}} DeLonge and Hoppus would go months without direct communication, only speaking through their managers. Hoppus moved to London with his family late in the recording process, also complicating matters. Under pressure, the band released a statement in April that effectively rescheduled all European tour dates due to the album's prolonged recording. The decision — a [...] "hugely expensive" [...] one — was protested by DeLonge but pushed forward by Barker, who felt the trio had made commitments to only tour with new material. [...] The biggest argument of the recording process ensued, which resulted in Geffen Records setting a July 31 deadline for the record amid concerns about the volatility of the band, explaining there would be penalties if the album was not turned in on time. DeLonge joked that, [...] "We'll probably actually drive it to the (Geffen) president's house <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the morning and hand it through his bedroom window at the last possible minute." [...] The band, as a whole, only entered the studio for [...] "one or two weeks" [...] following the release of the statement in the spring, with only three days dedicated to writing. Recording lasted through May and into the summer, and {{by the time of the}} July 31 deadline, the record was near completion and finally completed over August.|$|E

500|$|Puros Trankazos (Huge Hits) was {{released}} by Fonovisa Records on July 16, 2011 in the United States. The compilation album includes three tracks not available on other albums, such as [...] "Olvídame", performed by Julión Álvarez y su Norteño Banda, the underground hit [...] "La Hummer y el Camaro" [...] by Voz de Mando, and [...] "Como la Gelatina" [...] written by Espinoza Paz and performed by Vagón Chicano. Another song written by Espinoza Paz, [...] "Dónde Estás Presumida" [...] by Chuy Lizárraga and his Banda Tierra Sinaloense is included. The track reached the top 10 on the Billboard Latin Songs chart. Larry Hernandez, Voz de Mando and Violento, are new acts that perform narcocorridos (songs that tell the stories of drug dealers and their exploits). Hernández performs [...] "El Ardido", a ballad of lost love, which peaked at number 3 in the Regional Mexican Airplay chart. [...] "Gracias a Dios" [...] by Violento peaked at number four in the Latin Songs chart and <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the Regional Mexican chart. [...] "No Me Dejes con Las Ganas" [...] by Los Horóscopos de Durango, named their departure from the duranguense style and their incursion to banda, became a top ten single for the band. Fidel Rueda performs [...] "Me Encantaría", a song that became a number-two hit on the Latin Charts in the United States, kept from the top by Maná's [...] "Lluvia al Corazón". [...] "Increíble" [...] by Banda Sinaloense MS de Sergio Lizárraga and [...] "No Me Digas" [...] by El Chapo also charted in the United States. The last track on the album is [...] "Las Vacaciones del Jefe" [...] by Alfredo Olivas, a song about not killing people lately and taking a vacation, which was written by Olivas.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{no signs}} of the {{garrison}} yielding. They treated Cromwell's summons lightly and miscalculated {{the power of his}} heavy guns. By the evening of 13 October two wide breaches had been effected, and <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the morning it was resolved to storm the place at six, when the sky would be growing clear before the rising of the sun. The weary soldiers were directed to snatch a brief rest, but Cromwell spent part at least of the remainder of the night in meditation and prayer.

[...] Describing the hectic conditions she was under while recording, she stated, [...] "I was running from studio one to studio three and I was running back and forth doing the vocals, the piano, the guitar, the harmonies, and the doubles.” Perri stated that sometimes they would record two songs in one day, forcing Perri to mentally prepare to sing about one relationship in 2007, then sing another other song with different emotions about a relationship in 2008. Perri stated that she was [...] "ripping [...] stitches" [...] to ensure that a certain song was sung with the right emotions, later adding that it took such an emotional toll on her that she would be driving home later that night crying <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the morning, forcing herself to pull over and drink a milkshake.|$|E

2500|$|The January term brought miserable {{weather and}} a {{struggle}} {{to keep up with}} his studies. Around this time, he had an earnest conversation with John Herbert about going into Holy Orders, and asked him whether he could answer yes to the question that the Bishop would put in the ordination service, [...] "Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit".

2500|$|In {{spite of}} Columbus coming {{in as the}} second-place seed in the Eastern Conference bracket, many people {{expected}} Colorado to [...] "upset" [...] Columbus in their quarterfinal fixture. The Rapids hosted the Crew in the first leg on October 30; while Columbus would host Colorado a week later, on November 6. In the first leg, hosted in Commerce City, the Rapids won their match thanks to a 23rd-minute goal from club captain Pablo Mastroeni. [...] The lone goal gave the Rapids a goal advantage headed to Columbus a week later. In the second quarterfinal leg against the Crew, the Rapids fell 1–0 thanks to a 22nd-minute goal from Eddie Gaven. Things looked more convincing for Columbus when Robbie Rogers doubled the lead 2–0 in the 70th. With a 2–1 aggregate lead overall, Columbus look destined to make their {{first trip to the}} Eastern Conference championship since 2008. Fourteen minutes later, Rapids striker Conor Casey ruined the clean sheet for Crew backup keeper, Andy Gruenebaum and the aggregate score was leveled at two apiece. [...] After half an hour of additional time, the match was still equal <b>at</b> <b>two.</b> <b>In</b> a penalty kick shootout, a last-shot miss from Brian Carroll saw the Rapids advance to the semifinals and the Crew eliminated in the MLS Cup quarterfinals for the second consecutive year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project of}} co-writing was {{expedited}} by the {{collaboration between the}} four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in Birdman came from Skype sessions <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> the morning where he and Giacobone were [...] "cracking each other up". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said [...] "We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, {{and a lot of}} decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be [...] "very, very sure about what was on the page." [...] As a result, it took {{about a year and a}} half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: [...] "You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. Birdman looks like a good idea now, but [...] we did not know how we would land." ...|$|E
