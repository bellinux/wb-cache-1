A RSFCL in form of superconducting modular device was designed and constructed using 50 m-length of YBCO coated conductor tapes for operation under 1 kV / 1 kA and <b>acting</b> <b>time</b> of 0. 1 s. In order to increase the <b>acting</b> <b>time</b> the RSFCL was combined with an air-core reactor in parallel to increase the fault limiting time up to 1 s.
