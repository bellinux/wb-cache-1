5|$|Because WALL-E overtly critiques consumerism, it also critiques Disney's {{production}} {{values and}} aesthetic, without being too obvious. In the DVD commentary, Stanton {{said that he}} has been asked if it was his intention to make <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>about</b> consumerism.

5|$|In 2003, a Minnesota {{resident}} named Lyle Christiansen {{watched a}} television {{documentary about the}} Cooper hijacking and became convinced that his late brother Kenneth was D. B. Cooper. After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then the author and film director Nora Ephron (who he hoped would make <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>about</b> the case), he contacted a private investigator in New York City. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book postulating that Christiansen was the hijacker.

5|$|On the Art of the Cinema is {{mandatory}} reading for North Korean students of literature. North Korean filmmakers must also study the work, or even memorize it.

Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all.

5|$|The festival {{turned out}} to be a huge success, both {{critically}} and financially. The show attracted the attention of entertainment executives, including Columbia Pictures, which met with Laliberté and Gauthier under the pretense of wanting to make <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>about</b> Cirque du Soleil. Laliberté was unhappy with the deal, claiming that it gave too many rights to Columbia, which was attempting to secure all rights to the production. Laliberté pulled out of the deal before it could be concluded, and that experience stands out as a key reason why Cirque du Soleil remained independent and privately owned for 28 years, until Guy Laliberte announced in April 2015 that he was selling his majority stake to a group headed by a U.S. private equity firm, and its Chinese partners.|$|E
