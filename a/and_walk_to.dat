5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{cynical and}} despairing over his recent break-up with ex-girlfriend Felicia, the normally-grumpy Bolander (Ned Beatty) is unusually cheerful {{as a result}} of his budding romantic relationship with Linda (Julianna Margulies), a much younger (26-year-old) waitress. Nervous about his first real date with her, Bolander asks Howard (Melissa Leo) to go on a double-date with him, along with Howard's boyfriend, prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek). The double date goes well until a lonely Munch crashes, joins the table and ruins the mood of the evening complaining about his romantic woes. Bolander, Munch and Linda leave together <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> Fort McHenry, where Linda offers Munch words of encouragement. Impressed with her, Munch leaves Linda and Bolander alone, where they happily watch a fireworks show.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} shots of several skyscrapers in New York, which are {{followed}} by scenes of the band performing in a warehouse that has {{been converted into a}} stage (similar to Vino's bar which is where the band used to regularly perform before they became popular). The crowd at the concert is seen singing along with the band. The video continually cuts the singer walking through Brooklyn in a dark dress and makeup. She walks through a train station, streets and the Brooklyn Bridge. During the bridge of the song, Lee runs through the Brooklyn Bridge and jumps on the other side, landing on her feet. At the end of the video, the band meet up <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the beach where they walk into the sea. The final shot shows the band walking in the sea as the video fades out.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to his temptations <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of the table}} where Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends. The video was made available to download digitally via iTunes on May 12, 2008.|$|E

At least 14 Muslim transmigrants from Lombok and Java subsequently disappeared after being abducted from another town by an estimated 100 masked militants who had ordered the locals to gather at the village hall. Witnesses described the militia as having a list of names of people to abduct and several trucks to transport them.|$|E
500|$|Joyce {{tested the}} sea-ice on 18 April {{and found it}} firm, but the {{following}} day a blizzard from the south swept all the ice away. The ambience at Hut Point was gloomy, and the unrelieved diet of seal was depressing. This seemed particularly to affect Mackintosh, and on 8 May, despite the urgent pleadings of Joyce, Richards and Ernest Wild, he decided to risk the re-formed ice <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> Cape Evans. Victor Hayward volunteered to accompany him. Joyce recorded in his diary: [...] "I fail to understand how these people are so anxious to risk their lives again". Shortly after their departure a blizzard descended, and the two were never seen again.|$|E

500|$|On June 29, Jiyuan reappeared in Beijing, telling reporters, [...] "I came to Beijing {{in search}} of help." [...] He {{said that he had}} made two {{unsuccessful}} attempts to flee from custody before succeeding on his third try. While his official monitors were on the phone, Jiyuan fled to a friend's home, where he remained for two days. He removed the sim card and battery from his cell phone to prevent being tracked. [...] "I did not sleep or get any new clothes, I could not risk being arrested," [...] he recalled. They rented a car and drove to Beijing, and Jiyuan recalled that [...] "I assumed there would be government people at the train station." [...] Whenever they neared police officers, he would {{get out of the car}} <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> prevent being spotted.|$|E
500|$|The five {{survivors}} slowly recovered {{their strength}} with {{a diet of}} seal meat. The ice was too thin for them to risk the final trip to Cape Evans, and the monotony of their diet and surroundings became wearisome. On 8 May [...] Mackintosh announced that he and Hayward intended to risk the ice <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> Cape Evans. Against the strenuous objections of their companions they departed, and within the hour disappeared into a blizzard. The others went {{to look for them}} after the storm and found only tracks leading {{to the edge of the}} broken ice. Mackintosh and Hayward were never seen again. They had either fallen through the thin ice or had been carried out to sea on an ice floe. Richards, Joyce and Wild waited until 15 July to make the trip to Cape Evans, where they were at last reunited with Stevens, Cope, Jack and Gaze.|$|E
500|$|In {{their first}} game after the All-Star Break in 1970, the Pirates opened the stadium against Cincinnati on Thursday, July 16. The team donned new uniform {{designs for the}} first time that day, a similar plan was for new [...] "mini-skirts" [...] for female ushers however the ushers union {{declined}} the uniform change for female workers. [...] A parade was held before opening ceremonies. [...] The expansive parking lot, both Pirates and Steelers team offices, the Allegheny Club (VIP Club) and the press boxes and facilities were not opened until weeks later due to extended labor union work stoppages. [...] Instead of allowing cars to park, the team instructed fans to park downtown <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the stadium over bridges or take shuttle buses. [...] The opening of Three Rivers marked the first time the Pirates allowed beer to be sold in the stands during a game since the early 1960s.|$|E

500|$|As a Nazi Party {{member and}} war profiteer, Schindler must flee the {{advancing}} Red Army to avoid capture. The SS guards in Schindler's factory {{have been ordered}} to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to, {{so that they can}} [...] "return to [...] families as men, instead of murderers." [...] He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: [...] "Whoever saves one life saves the world entire." [...] Schindler is touched, but also deeply ashamed, as he feels he should have done even more. As the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) wake up the next morning, a Soviet soldier arrives to announce that they have been liberated. The Jews leave the factory <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> a nearby town.|$|E
500|$|An inter-title {{confirms}} Helen's {{death by}} announcing {{the parents have}} gone on [...] "a visit to their lost darling". The scene cuts to a grassy cemetery with lines of tombstones separated by a loose line of two trees. Helen's parents approach her grave, marked {{by a group of}} flowers and a temporary marker at the head. Shep follows behind and pauses by a tree as Helen's parents kneel and pause to grieve. The camera cuts to Shep, who appears sad with his eyes only half open. After the parents finish grieving, they stand up <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the stage left. Shep stays under the tree for a moment before approaching the grave. Through an overheard split, Shep is shown to be reminiscing about the party. The next scene shows Shep back home, lying on his side in apparent despair. His master tries to get Shep to eat some food, but the Collie refuses and turns on his side. His master pets him, confused as to what has his pet troubled so, but he gives up and departs.|$|E
500|$|Gestation in {{elephants}} typically lasts {{around two}} years with interbirth intervals usually lasting four to five years. Births tend to take place during the wet season. Calves are born [...] tall and weigh around [...] Typically, only a single young is born, but twins sometimes occur. The relatively long pregnancy is maintained by five corpus luteums (as opposed to one in most mammals) and gives the foetus more time to develop, particularly the brain and trunk. As such, newborn elephants are precocial and quickly stand <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> follow their mother and family herd. A new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd members. Adults {{and most of the}} other young will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks. For the first few days, the mother is intolerant of other herd members near her young. Alloparenting – where a calf is cared for by someone other than its mother – takes place in some family groups. Allomothers are typically two to twelve years old. When a predator is near, the family group gathers together with the calves in the centre.|$|E

500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin housed three {{separate}} studios and several amenities, including a swimming pool, gym, sauna, photographic studio, and bedroom suites. In contrast to most recording studios, its interior was spacious and exposed to natural light. At the studio complex, Raphael, D'wayne, and Riley recorded extensively {{into the night}} {{and went out to}} enjoy the nightlife, before returning to the studio. They often dimmed the lights, burned incense, and drank wine to set the mood when recording, which D'wayne explained in Musician, [...] "We try to make it real calm and mellow. 'Cause {{you want to be able}} to get into what you're singing." [...] They also immersed themselves in the local dancehall scene and attended late-night block parties that lasted until dawn. D'wayne later recalled his nightlife experiences with the group in Maravel: [...] "We'd heard dancehall, but we didn't really know anything about it before going there. We would go to these block parties and you could hear them from almost a mile away. You'd just park on the street <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the party along with four or five thousand other people, all partying with these giant speakers all over the place. And this happened just about every weekend." ...|$|E

He instead saw Brody get out <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the rear, apparently trying to free it. [...] "What struck me was how calm she was—she didn't seem to be panicking, or in a hurry at all, even though the gate was down," [...] he said later. [...] "She wasn't in a hurry at all, {{but she had to}} have known that a train was coming." [...] Brody looked at him, and he motioned to her to come back in his direction, although he allows that she may not have seen him due to the glare from his headlights. Brody then returned to her vehicle and, according to Hope, seemed to pause as if she was adjusting her seat belt. The train was getting closer and the situation more urgent. [...] "The thing's dinging, red lights are flashing, it's going off," [...] he said. [...] "I just knew she was going to back up—never in my wildest dreams did I think she'd go forward." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ultimately, in {{response}} to traffic and parking issues associated with these games (while Cal games drew {{a large number of}} students who live on or near campus <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the games, Raider games attracted fans from a larger geographic area who were used to tailgating at the Coliseum and were more likely to drive to games), the City of Berkeley passed a Professional Sports Events License Tax in which the city collected 10% of all gate receipts, making the staging of professional games inside the city cost-prohibitive. [...] The Raiders were granted an injunction from the city collecting the tax, arguing that the tax was a regulatory measure rather than a revenue measure, and was therefore an improper regulation on land held in trust by the Regents of the University of California. [...] However, the grant of the injunction was reversed by the California Court of Appeals, who found it to be a revenue measure, {{despite the fact that the}} city had made the measure immediately effective [...] "due to danger to the public peace, health, and safety of the City of Berkeley as a result of the holding of professional sports events there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the district assembled {{in a city of}} the district and spent the night in the town square. Early in the morning, their leader said: [...] "Let us rise and go up to Zion, to the house of the Lord our God." [...] Those who lived near Jerusalem brought fresh figs and grapes, and those who lived far away brought dried figs and raisins. Leading the pilgrimage procession was an ox with horns overlaid with gold wearing a crown of olive branches. The sounds of the flute announced the pilgrims' coming until they neared Jerusalem when they sent messengers ahead and arranged their first fruits ( [...] , bikkurim) for presentation. A delegation of the Temple's leaders and treasurers came out to meet them, varying in relation to the procession. Jerusalem's artisans would stand and greet them, saying: [...] "People of such and such a place, we welcome you." [...] They played the flute until they reached the Temple Mount. On the Temple Mount, even King Agrippa would carry the basket of first fruits on his shoulder <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the Temple Court. As the procession approached the Temple Court, Levites would sing the words of [...] "I will extol You, O Lord, for You have raised me up, and have not suffered my enemies to rejoice over me." ...|$|E

[...] Mumtaz also added that she had memories of having workied with him {{and said that she}} had been crying the whole morning, but was happy that she had met the ailing Khanna in Mumbai in June 2012, when the two discussed their respective battles with cancer. While Shahid Kapoor quoted: [...] "RIP to the 1st king of romance... Rajesh Khanna." [...] Subhash Ghai added that Khanna [...] "was the powerhouse of the Hindi film industry. I met him on the set of Aradhna, he had some kind of energy and you will be charged when he is around you. His name will be written in golden words."
