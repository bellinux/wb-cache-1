40|$|A cultura do feijoeiro (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) pode ser afetada por muitas doenças e dentre elas destaca-se a antracnose, causada pelo fungo Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. O acaricida <b>azocyclotin</b> (AZ) foi avaliado {{in vitro}}, em plântulas e em condições de campo, quanto ao efeito em C. lindemuthianum. Foram avaliados sete tratamentos in vitro: 1) testemunha; 2) AZ- 1 mg L- 1; 3) Trifenil hidróxido de estanho (THE) - 1 mg L- 1; 4) AZ- 10 mg L- 1; 5) THE- 10 mg L- 1; 6) AZ- 100 mg L- 1 e 7) THE- 100 mg L- 1 e 13 tratamentos in vivo: 1) testemunha; 2) AZ aplicado 24 horas antes da inoculação (AZ- 24); 3) THE- 24; 4) AZ- 48; 5) THE- 48; 6) AZ- 72; 7) THE- 72; 8) AZ- 96; 9) THE- 96; 10) AZ- 120; 11) THE- 120; 12) AZ- 144 e 13) THE- 144. <b>Azocyclotin</b> foi avaliado à dose de 125 g i. a. 100 L- 1 de água e trifenil hidróxido de estanho a 41, 25 g i. a. 100 L- 1. Os delineamentos experimentais foram inteiramente ao acaso, com cinco repetições. Em condições de campo, foi realizado um experimento com seis tratamentos. Os tratamentos e as doses em g ha- 1 de i. a foram: 1) {{tebuconazole}} + trifenil hidróxido de estanho (100 + 200); 2) tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin (40 + 100); 3) trifloxystrobin (125); 4) tebuconazole + <b>azocyclotin</b> (100 + 500); 5) <b>azocyclotin</b> (500) e 6) testemunha. O delineamento foi em blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições. Para a avaliação in vitro foram medidos diâmetros ortogonais do crescimento micelial do fungo em BDA; in vivo e no campo usou-se escala de notas de 1 a 9, sendo 1 = sem sintoma e 9 = igual ou mais de 25 % de área foliar afetada. In vitro, o tratamento 7 proporcionou maior inibição do desenvolvimento micelial. Em plântulas, observou-se controle de C. lindemuthianum até 144 horas, pelos dois produtos. Uma nova constatação em campo foi o controle de antracnose pelo acaricida <b>azocyclotin,</b> em que se observou também efeito sobre mancha-angular e mancha-de-alternária. Concluiu-se que o acaricida <b>azocyclotin</b> é eficiente no controle da antracnose do feijoeiro, semelhante ao trifenil hidróxido de estanho. The control effect of <b>azocyclotin</b> acaricide was tested to common bean anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, in vitro, seedlings and in field conditions. The treatments in vitro were: 1) Test; 2) <b>Azocyclotin</b> (AZ) - 1 AZ- 1 mg. L- 1; 3) Triphenil sthanic hydroxide (THE) - 1 mg L- 1; 4) AZ- 10 mg L- 1; 5) THE- 10 mg L- 1; 6) AZ- 100 mg L- 1 and 7) THE- 100 mg L- 1 and in vivo treatments were: 1) Test; 2) AZ applyed 24 hours before inoculation (AZ- 24); 3) THE- 24; 4) AZ- 48; 5) THE- 48; 6) AZ- 72; 7) THE- 72; 8) AZ- 96; 9) THE- 96; 10) AZ- 120; 11) THE- 120; 12) AZ- 144, and 13) THE- 144. <b>Azocyclotin</b> was evaluated at 125 g. 100 L- 1 {{of water and}} fenthin hydroxide at 41, 25 g a. i. 100 L- 1. The experiments were set up as a completely randomized design, with 5 repetitions. In field conditions, the treatments (g ha- 1 a. i.) included: 1) tebuconazole + fentin hydroxide- 100 + 200; 2) tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin- 40 + 100; 3) trifloxystrobin- 125; 4) tebuconazole + azocyclotin- 100 + 500; 5) <b>azocyclotin</b> - 500 and 6) without chemical. The experimental design was done using randomized blocks, with 4 replicates. The mycelial growth was determined through reading the fungi radial growth in BDA culture media. In vivo and in field conditions, evaluations were made with a scale of 1 to 9, where 1 = without symptoms and 9 = equal or more than 25 % of foliar area with anthracnose symptoms. In vitro test, the treatment 7 presented the most effective mycelial development inhibition. <b>Azocyclotin</b> and triphenil sthanic hydroxide controlled dry bean anthracnose when applied until 144 hours before inoculation. A new field record was the control of bean anthracnose with <b>azocyclotin</b> acaricide, with effect on both to angular leaf spot and alternaria leaf spot.

Phyllopoda and nauplia of copepods reacted sensitively whereas direct effects on rotifers and ostracodes were not observed. Within the phytoplankton, picoplankton = 135 mu g/L and blooms of less sensitive species were observed. Anaerobic microbial degradation activity in the sediment was stimulated in microcosms with high plankton mortality, but microbial biomass, measured as dehydrogenase activity, was not affected. Changes in meiozoobenthon structure were evident in microcosms treated with >= 135 mu g/L <b>azocyclotin.</b> The results indicate that under the experimental conditions nominal concentrations of 135 mu g/L <b>azocyclotin</b> applied as soil slurry had severe effects on the biocenoses...|$|E
40|$|O ácaro Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes) é importante em cafeeiro (Coffea spp.) por ser o vetor do vírus da mancha-anular, doença responsável por queda de folhas e má qualidade da bebida do café, e o ácaro-vermelho Oligonychus ilicis (McGregor) por reduzir a área foliar de fotossíntese. Ácaros da família Phytoseiidae, de várias espécies, são eficientes predadores associados aos ácaros-praga. Conduziu-se este trabalho com o objetivo de estudar o controle dos ácaros-praga com spirodiclofen e <b>azocyclotin,</b> e o impacto sobre fitoseídeos. Em laboratório foram estudados os efeitos ovicida, tópico, {{residual}}, tópico mais residual e a seletividade fisiológica aos fitoseídeos; em casa-de-vegetação foi avaliada a persistência no controle às duas espécies de ácaros-praga; e em campo foi avaliada a eficiência apenas no controle de B. phoenicis. Os bioensaios foram realizados em arenas de folhas destacadas. O efeito ovicida foi avaliado em ovos no início e final de incubação. Os efeitos residual, tópico e tópico mais residual foram avaliados pela mortalidade de larvas, ninfas e adultos aos oito dias, e a persistência até 30 dias após a aplicação. A seletividade aos fitoseídeos foi avaliada, pelo efeito na mortalidade e reprodução de fêmeas adultas, em teste residual em superfície de vidro. Spirodiclofen e <b>azocyclotin</b> (SC) mostraram eficiente ação ovicida, principalmente para ovos de B. phoenicis no início de incubação. Para ovos de O. ilicis, somente o spirodiclofen apresentou efeito ovicida. Em geral, os efeitos tópico e residual associados melhoraram a eficiência dos produtos no controle das fases pós-embrionárias de ambas as espécies. O spirodiclofen apresentou seletividade aos ácaros predadores, já o <b>azocyclotin</b> foi nocivo. Em campo, ambos os acaricidas mostram-se altamente eficientes na redução de todas as fases pós-embrionárias do ácaro B. phoenicis, principalmente nas folhas. The mite Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes) {{is important}} in coffee plants (Coffea spp.) for being the vector of the coffee ringspot virus, disease responsible for leaf fall and bad quality of the coffee beverage. The red spider mite Oligonychus ilicis (McGregor) is also important for reducing the area of photosynthesis in leaves. Mites of the family Phytoseiidae are efficient predators associated to the pest-mites. The objective of this work was to study {{the control of the}} pest-mites with spirodiclofen and <b>azocyclotin,</b> and the impact on phytoseiids. Studies were carried out in laboratory conditions on the ovicidal, topical, residual, topical plus residual effects, and the physiological selectivity for the phytoseiids. The persistence of the products in the control of the pest-mites was studied in semi-field conditions. In field-test only was evaluated the efficiency in the control of B. phoenicis. Bioassays were made in detached leaves. The ovicidal effect was evaluated in eggs in {{the beginning and end of}} incubation; the residual, topical and topical plus residual effects on larvae, nymphs and adult were assessed through mortality evaluation eight days after spraying, while the persistence was evaluated until 30 days after spraying. The phytoseiids selectivity was evaluated in a glass surface residual test through the adult female's mortality and reproduction effect. Spirodiclofen and <b>azocyclotin</b> (SC) showed efficient ovicidal action, mainly for eggs of B. phoenicis in the beginning of incubation. For eggs of O. ilicis only the spirodiclofen presented ovicidal effect. In general, the associated topical plus residual effects improve the performance of the products in the control of the post-embryonic phases of both species. The spirodiclofen presented selectivity for the predator mites; the <b>azocyclotin</b> was already noxious. In the field, both acaricides showed highly efficiency in the reduction of all the post-embryonic phases of the pest-mite B. phoenicis, mainly in the leaves...|$|E
40|$|The {{fate of the}} organotin {{acaricide}} <b>azocyclotin</b> was {{studied in}} fresh water microcosms. The 14 C-labelled test substance was applied particle bound by simulating a runoff event in concentrations of 5, 15, 35, 135 und 405 mu g/l, respectively. The fate of the parent compound and its metabolites in water and sediment were analyzed {{over a period of}} 7 months. Effects on plankton and benthon as well as physico-chemical water parameters are reported by Fliedner et al. The results elucidate that sedimentation of the particles coated with the pesticide is relatively fast. Shortly after application distribution and solubilizing processes and metabolism are starting. <b>Azocyclotin</b> is quickly hydrolyzed to cyhexatin. According to its solubility cyhexatin is mainly sorbed to sediment and the layer of biota in direct contact with sediment. About 20 per cent of the applied radioactivity was concentrated in this biota layer as cyhexatin. More mobile metabolites are concentrated in the water phase (water and biota of the water phase). For cyhexatin a DT 50 value of 68 d and a DT 90 value of 300 d could be calculated. Cyhexatin is mineralised, therefore no stable metabolites could be detected...|$|E
40|$|The {{predatory mite}} Euseius alatus DeLeon has been {{reported}} in several economic crops in Brazil, with certified importance in fruit trees and coffee. In order to establish an integrated pest management program it is important to determine the efficient pesticides in pests control, but presenting low impact to predators. This work had the objective of evaluating the toxicity of acaricides (abamectin, <b>azocyclotin,</b> diafenthiuron, dicofol, sulphur, fenpropathrin, fenpyroximate, propargite, tetradifon) to eggs and adult females of E. alatus. Leaf discs of "feijão de porco" (Canavalia ensiformes L.) containing 10 eggs of E. alatus were immersed into the acaricides dilutions, during five seconds, and dried for 30 minutes under room temperature. Treated eggs were observed up to 72 h to determine egg survival. The residual effect of the same acaricides to adult females of E. alatus was studied using arena constituted by treated leaf disc. Ten adult females were confined per arena, 30 minutes, 24 h and 72 h after immersing the discs into the acaricides dilutions. Mortality was measured 24, 48 and 72 h after confining the females on the treated leaf discs. All tested acaricides showed low impact on egg survival, except for fenpropathrin that caused reduction of egg survival at rate of 66 %. The acaricides <b>azocyclotin,</b> diafenthiuron, tetradifon and abamectin caused 100 % of mortality to adult females. Otherwise, diafenthiuron (500 g de a. i. /Kg), fenpyroximate (50 g de a. i. /L), propargite (720 g de a. i. /L) and tetradifon (80 g de a. i. /L) caused lower impact to adult females of E. alatus and, therefore, being of potential recommendation into an integrated pest management...|$|E
40|$|In an {{integrated}} approach for {{the determination of}} fate and effects of pesticides in stagnant aquatic systems used in the higher tier risk assessment concept for pesticides aquatic microcosm systems were developed and optimized regarding the expenditure of effort and time. The suitability for the pesticides registration procedure was proved with respect to quality and limitations of applicability. The objective of {{the first part of}} the project (Final Report of Project 126 05 105, January 28, 1996) was to develop the test system and to prove its principal suitability for microcosm studies. In the second part of the project (present report) open questions related to the influence of sediment quality and mode of application on the test results should be investigated. Contrary to the first study unit, loamy sediments were used. Potential impact by spraydrift and runoff was simulated for sparingly soluble and water soluble pesticides, and the resulting effects were comparatively investigated. As in {{the first part of the}} project, isoproturon and <b>azocyclotin</b> were applied as test substance. The conclusions drawn from the results of both study units have been integrated in a guidance document on the applicability of aquatic microcosms in the scope of pesticides' registration. For both substances the degradation rate in the sandy system was higher compared to the loamy system, where the substances are absorbed more strongly. Due to the considerably slower water flow through the sediment core only low amounts of isoproturon were transported offsite. A comparison of effects was done only for the studies with <b>azocyclotin</b> varying sediment quality, regulation of macronutrient concentrations, limiting of the periphyton as well as light conditions and duration of the preincubation period. Despite these differences, with respect to the primarily affected biocoenoses (zooplankton) the same conclusions were drawn from the obtained results. This shows that the test systems are comparatively stable towards varying test conditions. To achieve a higher reproducibility the variability can be further decreased by regulating the system according to the proposals given in the guidance document presented in the Annex. For all studies a comparison of the sensitivity of the phyllopodes occurring in the microcosms with the daphnids from standard laboratory tests related to the actual effects concentrations in the water did not differ with 1, 5 - 4 #mu#g/l (decrease of abundances in the microcosms) and 5, 7 #mu#g/l (EC_ 5 _ 0, laboratory).

40|$|Abstract. - The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to check the effect of chlorpyrifos (Lorsban) on Lycosa terrestris, the most dominant ground spider in the agroecosystem of Punjab, Pakistan. For this purpose topical and residual bioassay tests were performed. Probate analysis showed that this insecticide is highly toxic for both sexes. The calculated LD 50 values were less than field dose. Results of residual bioassays showed that this insecticide is highly toxic to spiders even after one month of its exposure. Negative effects of this insecticide not only reduces the biological control potential of L. terrestris but also poses a serious threat to other natural predators of agroecosystems. Key words: Agroecosystem, residual toxicity, ground spiders. Spiders are the most abundant natural predators of insects in terrestrial ecosystems and consume large number of prey without damaging the plants (Lang et al., 1999; Hanna et al., 2003). Many studies have demonstrated that spiders can significantly reduce prey densities in agricultural fields (Symondson et al., 2002; Pearce and Zalucki, 2006; Schmidt et al., 2009). Agricultural fields that are frequently sprayed with pesticides often have low spider population (Amalin et al., 2000).

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to {{determine}} the residual toxicity of the main pesticides used in citrus, on Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) under laboratory conditions. For this, it was used the residual contact bioassay. Citrus leaves of the variety Pêra were sprayed in a Potter tower. The residual action was evaluated at 2 hours and 1; 3; 5; 7; 10; 14 e 21 days after treatment. Ten adult females of N. californicus were transferred to each ring, together with an enough amount of Tetranychus urticae nymphs and adults to feed the predator. Mortality evaluations were performed at 72 hours after treatment. Bioassays indicate that the pesticides: acrinathrin, deltamethrin, dinocap, sulphur, fenpropathrin, fenbutatin oxide and propargite were innocuous to N. californicus. On the other hand, abamectin, <b>azocyclotin</b> e cyhexatin caused mortalities of 29. 8; 32. 0 e 34. 1 %, respectively, two hours after transference. Dicofol, pyridaben and chlorfenapyr were extremely toxic to the predator mite, causing 100 % of mortality two hours after the application. This way, to this population of N. californicus, the releases can be performed safely 3 days after the application, except for cyhexatin (5 days), dicofol and pyridaben (14 days) and chlorfenapyr (21 days), without risk of significant adult mortality rates due to the application of pesticides...|$|E

Inicialmente, o experimento foi instalado em um pomar de citros, em que foram selecionadas 10 plantas que continham frutos com verrugose. Realizou-se a aplicação de calda sulfocálcica (8 g i. a. L- 1 de água) em cinco plantas e as outras cinco plantas permaneceram sem aplicação de produto fitossanitário. Protegeram-se, com copos de plástico transparente de 500 mL, 64 frutos nas plantas tratadas com calda e 64 frutos nas plantas não-tratadas, totalizando 128 frutos protegidos. Decorridos 30 dias da aplicação, os frutos foram colhidos e levados para o laboratório. Estes frutos foram parcialmente parafinados, deixando-se em cada fruto uma arena de 2, 5 cm de diâmetro com verrugose e sem parafina, delimitada com cola entomológica. Em seguida, procedeu-se à aplicação sobre os frutos em Torre de Potter dos seguintes acaricidas nas concentrações expressas em mg de ingrediente ativo por litro de água: {{propargite}} a 720 mg, óxido de fenbutatina a 400 mg, cyhexatin a 250 mg, <b>azocyclotin</b> a 250 mg, fenpyroximate a 50 mg, dicofol a 960 mg e dinocap a 738 mg e a testemunha sem aplicação de acaricida. Após 1, 7 e 16 dias da aplicação, transferiram-se para cada fruto 10 ácaros B. phoenicis para avaliar a mortalidade. Constatou-se que os resíduos de calda sulfocálcica não prejudicaram a eficiência dos acaricidas avaliados no controle de B. phoenicis. The {{objective was}} to assess the influence of lime sulfur residues on the acaricidal efficiency against Brevipalpus phoenicis mite. Initially, the experiment was conducted in a citrus orchard where 10 plants presenting scab fruits were selected. Secondly, the application of lime sulfur (8 mg a. i. L- 1 of water) was performed in five plants, and the other five plants remained without application. Next lime sulfur application, 64 fruits in the plants with lime sulfur application were protected with plastic cups and others 64 fruits also were protected in the plants without lime sulfur application with plastic cups. After 30 days of field application, fruits were harvested and transported to the laboratory. These fruits were partially waxed, leaving an arena of approximately 2. 5 cm in diameter with scab and without paraffin and entrapped with entomological glue. Afterwards, acaricides application were done following the concentration expressed in mg of active ingredient per liter of water: propargite (720 mg), fenbutatin oxide (400 mg), cyhexatin (250 mg), <b>azocyclotin</b> (250 mg), fenpyroximate (50 mg), dicofol (960 mg), dinocap (738 mg) and control treatment by using the petri dish-Potter tower method.

40|$|The cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Genn. and Two-Spotted Spider Mites (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae Koch are {{emerging}} as important sucking pests of cotton crop. The indiscriminate {{use of pesticides}} against insect pests {{have resulted in the}} development of resistance among these pests as well as environmental and health hazards. The use of microbial control agents is an important approach to combat this menace. The present study was therefore, carried out to determine the efficacy of some strains of entomopathogenic fungi viz.,Metarhizium anisopliae, Isaria fumosorosea, Lecanicillium muscarium and Beaveria bassiana against all immature stages of whitefly and eggs and adult females of TSSM in the Department of Entomology at University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan and Department of Pure and Applied Ecology, Swansea University, Swansea U. K. for the bioassays on whitefly. The potential of various entomopathogenic fungi was evaluated on 2 nd instar nymphs of whitefly and four of them were found promising. The detailed studies were carried out on other immature stages of whitefly with the promising strains. The dosemortality response was observed by using serial dilutions, 1 ï¿½ 105 to 1 ï¿½ 108 conidia mL- 1 against most susceptible stage using detached leaf immersion method for whitefly and spraying the detached leaf for bioassay with TSSM. All tested fungal isolates caused mortality in the tested stages of both insects under consideration except eggs of whitefly for which very low susceptibility was observed. The L. muscarium (V 17) isolate was highly virulent among the tested ones for whitefly nymphs while Pf (n 32) isolate was highly virulent against both the stages of TSSM. The mortality of each stage was recorded daily up to 8 days for both the insects under study. The % mortality significantly differed based on fungal isolates, stage of the insect and conidial concentrations. The % mortality increased with increasing the dose of conidial concentration of each fungal isolate in each insect. For whitefly, the most virulent isolate, (V 17) has LC 50 value of 1. 9 ï¿½ 105 conidia mL- 1 and it killed about 89. 58 % of the treated second instar nymphs 8 days post treatment while its LT 50 value at higher concentration is 4. 03 days. For TSSM, the most virulent isolate was Pf (n 32) with lowest LC 50 value of 9. 1 ï¿½ 104 conidia mL- 1 on 8 th day and LT 50 value of 4. 58 days at 1 ï¿½ 108 conidia mL- 1. It killed about 82. 16 % of the inoculated females 8 days post treatment. The results indicated that L. muscarium and I. fumosorosea strains have potential as microbial control agent against cotton whitefly and mites, respectively, in Pakistan. The studies were also carried out to determine the LC 50 values and also efficacy of some commercial insecticides and acaricides against whitefly and TSSM in the laboratory. Four different insecticides were evaluated in the lab against 2 nd instar nymphs of whitefly on cotton. All the tested insecticides caused significant mortality of whitefly from 3 - 5 days post treatment. However, the most effective insecticides for whitefly, up to 5 days were Mospilonï¿½ and Confidorï¿½ with very low LC 50 values while others were also equally effective but with high LC 50 values. Similarly, the chlorfenapyr 36 SC, pyridaben 15 EC and fenpyroximate 5 SC proved to be the best miticides among the tested ones for the control of TSSM based on their LC 50 values. The nine commercial pesticides and their effects on germination of conidia and mycelial growth of highly efficacious fungal strains viz., I. fumosorosea and L. muscarium were investigated in vitro. There was a significant variation in conidial germination as well as mycelial growth by all tested pesticides depending upon the dose of pesticide and type of fungus. Among the pesticides tested <b>azocyclotin</b> was proved to be highly toxic to germination of spores as well as mycelial growth followed by pyridaben, acetamiprid and propergite while buprofezin was the least toxic. Isaria was proved to be more sensitive at field recommended doses than Lecanicillium strain to all pesticides. Generally, among all pesticides used the insecticides were more compatible to fungi than acaricides although these also inhibited germination of spores and fungal growth to some extent. The combined application of pesticides with selective fungi proved to be synergistic giving more control than used alone. The combined effects were tested under greenhouse conditions on potted plants. Buprofezin, acetamiprid, imidacloprid and diafenthuron were used against 2 nd instar nymphs of whitefly while chlorfenapyr, pyridaben and fenpyroximate were used against TSSM. Only buprofezin and imidacloprid insecticides showed synergistic effects and others additive while no one showed antagonistic results. Chlorfenapyr combined with fungus yielded highest mortality among acaricides tested. However, further investigations under field conditions may reveal more comprehensive results...|$|E
