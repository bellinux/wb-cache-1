25|$|The local {{residents}} and authorities in Amityville, New York, <b>are</b> <b>unhappy</b> <b>with</b> {{the attention that}} The Amityville Horror brings to the town and tend to decline requests to discuss it publicly.

When the History Channel made its documentary about The Amityville Horror in 2000, no member of the Historical Society would discuss the matter on camera.|$|E
25|$|Over 95% of {{cross-border}} trade {{within the region}} is unofficial and undocumented, carried out by pastoralists trading livestock. The unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to {{other countries in the}} Horn and the wider Eastern Africa region, including Somalia and Djibouti, generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure). This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration. However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allow disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, governments <b>are</b> <b>unhappy</b> <b>with</b> lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.|$|E
