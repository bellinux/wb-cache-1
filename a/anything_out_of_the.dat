5|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Fauxlivia and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) investigate {{reports of a}} Fringe event in the Rosencrantz building, and speak with Derek, who tells them he has not noticed <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary. The two leave, and Derek is left paging sadly through a photo album filled with pictures {{of him and his}} late wife and their daughters.|$|E
5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production {{expected it to}} be <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary. It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E
25|$|Nyíri's {{proposition}} {{was immediately}} criticised by Ottó Gyürk, {{pointing to the}} fact that with such a permissive deciphering method one can get <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code. Also, the mere fact that Nyíri makes an uncritical allusion to the fringe theory that the Hungarian language descended from Sumerian, discredits his enterprise.|$|E

25|$|The defence case {{began on}} the morning of 12 March 2012 and lasted half a day. The court heard from a number of {{witnesses}} who worked in the offices of Infrastructure Managers Ltd, who spoke {{to the fact that they}} did not see <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary at the premises in Thistle Street on 4 May 2010. Mr Gilroy declined to give evidence in his own defence.|$|E
25|$|The dynasty is {{regarded}} as the greatest native Yemeni state since the fall of pre-Islamic Himyarite Kingdom. They were of Turkic descent. They claimed an ancient Yemenite origin to justify their rule. The Rasulids were not the first dynasty to create a fictitious genealogy for political purposes, nor were they doing <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary in the tribal context of Arabia. By claiming descent from a solid Yemenite tribe, the Rasulids brought Yemen to a vital sense of unity in an otherwise chaotic regional milieu.|$|E
25|$|The seasons between 1924 and 1927 saw {{a slight}} {{dropping}} off from Barratt, though he remained {{an important part}} of the Nottinghamshire side. In Wisden 1925, he was singled out for consistency. In both 1924 and 1925, he took more than 90 wickets at an average of less than 20 runs per wicket, but in 1926, that fell to just 66 wickets at a cost of 32 runs apiece. The recovery to 75 wickets at 21.14 in 1927 owed something to his fourth return of eight wickets in an innings, eight for 53 against Worcestershire at Trent Bridge. Nor was the batting <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary: he failed to pass 50 in 1924, 1925 or 1926, and reached a highest of only 57 in 1927.|$|E

25|$|Very {{soon after}} arrival over the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea), at 10:35., North Korea {{reacted to the}} {{presence}} of the EC-121, but not {{in a way that would}} jeopardize the mission. At 12:34 local time, roughly six hours into the mission, the Army Security Agency and radars in Korea detected the takeoff of two North Korean Air Force MiG-21s from East Tongchong-ni near Wonsan and tracked them, assuming that they were responding in some fashion to the mission of Deep Sea 129. In the meantime the EC-121 filed a scheduled activity report by radio on time at 13:00 and did not indicate <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary, but this was the last message sent from the plane. Twenty-two minutes later the radars lost the picture of the MiGs and did not reacquire it until 13:37, where they were closing with Deep Sea 129 for a probable intercept.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} care home where Roland lives. When they gently {{ask him about}} the night of the murder, he tells them he had not seen <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary. He also {{inadvertently}} reveals his mathematical prowess by rapidly counting the star designs visible on Scully's blouse; however, his handwriting does not match the fourth sample taken from the whiteboard. The discussion ends when Roland experiences a violent vision and has {{what seems to be a}} fit. Later that night, Roland has another vision in which he sees someone killing Keats. He appears at the lab and murders Keats by submerging his head in a tank of liquid nitrogen. Keats' frozen body is left to shatter as Roland begins typing at one of the computers.|$|E
500|$|Belisarius {{knew that}} success for his {{expedition}} relied on gaining {{the support of}} the local population, which had largely retained its Roman identity and to which he presented himself as a liberator. Thus on the next day of the landing, when some of his men stole some fruit from a local orchard, he severely punished them, and assembled the army and exhorted them to maintain discipline and restraint towards the native population, lest they abandon their Roman sympathies and go over to the Vandals. Belisarius' pleas bore results, for, as Procopius reports (The Vandalic War, I.17), [...] "the soldiers behaved with moderation, and they neither began any unjust brawls nor did <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way, and , by displaying great gentleness and kindness, won the Libyans to his side so completely that thereafter he made the journey as if in his own land".|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{impressive}} specification on paper, the design did suffer from some limitations. Nick Speakman of software developer Binary Designs {{pointed out that}} “the custom chips are very powerful, but they {{require a lot of}} programming talent to get <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them. <b>The</b> screen handling also isn't as fast as we anticipated it to be.” ...|$|R
500|$|Sunderland lost 1–0 away to Manchester City on 5 November after a goal from Stephen Ireland. Manager, Roy Keane, {{expressed}} his frustration in a post match interview saying [...] "We didn't deserve anything. I don't feel we did {{enough to get}} <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. I don't think their keeper had too many saves to make, did he?". 10 November was the first Tyne–Wear derby of the season. Danny Higginbotham put Sunderland into the lead shortly after half time, but James Milner drew Newcastle level on the 68th minute after his cross beat goalkeeper Craig Gordon into the far post. Sunderland {{had a chance to}} win the game when ex-Newcastle forward Michael Chopra headed against the bar minutes from full-time. Sunderland ended the month on a low as they were beaten 7–1 away to Everton on 24 November. Dwight Yorke scored Sunderland's only goal just before half time. Roy Keane said [...] "It's hard to take, but we lose as a team and I picked the team and sorted the tactics so I have no problem taking responsibility for what happened." ...|$|E
500|$|As captain, Johnson {{was noted}} for his public {{relations}} skills and his gift for public speaking. [...] He was optimistic by nature, with {{a belief in}} [...] "guts and determination". [...] However, he was seen as insensitive at times; Bill Johnston took offence when Johnson attempted to rouse him during a practise session: [...] "Just cos {{you are one of}} the old blokes in the side doesn't mean you don't have to bloody well put in you know." [...] At times his optimism could appear artless and naive. Ian Craighis successor as Australian captainwas critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: [...] "I don't think [...] was ever realistic about the situation. [...] I supposed he felt obliged to make rallying speeches, but the team knew what was going on." [...] Pat Crawford felt [...] "Johnson couldn't get <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players, whereas the guys would have busted a gut for [...] ". [...] He was seen by some of his team mates as [...] "dictatorial" [...] with [...] Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead-in match before 1956 Test series in England.|$|E
500|$|Part of Whitman's {{role at the}} Attorney General's {{office was}} {{interviewing}} former Confederate soldiers for Presidential pardons. [...] "There are real characters among them", he later wrote, [...] "and you know I have a fancy for <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary." [...] In August 1866, he took a month off in order to prepare a new edition of Leaves of Grass which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher. He {{hoped it would be}} its last edition. In February 1868, Poems of Walt Whitman was published in England thanks to the influence of William Michael Rossetti, with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved. The edition became popular in England, especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer Anne Gilchrist. Another edition of Leaves of Grass was issued in 1871, the same year it was mistakenly reported that its author died in a railroad accident. As Whitman's international fame increased, he remained at the attorney general's office until January 1872. He spent much of 1872 caring for his mother who was now nearly eighty and struggling with arthritis. He also traveled and was invited to Dartmouth College to give the commencement address on June 26, 1872.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's utterly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{question}}," [...] said Aunt Janet seriously. When Aunt Janet said seriously that <b>anything</b> was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{question it}} meant that {{she was thinking about}} it, and would probably end up by doing it. If a thing really was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question she merely laughed and refused to discuss it at all.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{though the}} {{transmitters}} {{were set up}} under tents, they often experienced problems with short-circuiting caused by the moisture that constantly surrounded them. Back-up units were not always available, which meant that often transmitters had to be [...] "jury-rigged" [...] {{in order to get}} <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them. <b>The</b> hot and humid air also warped the discs (records) containing the recorded programming.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the testimonies for {{the first}} charge, Downer pointed out they need not prove that Zuma did <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{ordinary}} to help Shaik as [...] "you can corrupt a politician by paying him to do something he is paid to do every day." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the police}} {{described}} him as [...] "the leader of the Italian criminals in Harlem" [...] and that [...] "his consent was necessary before <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way {{could be done in}} Harlem's Little Italy." [...] Speculation about the reason behind the arrests was {{that it could have been}} an attempt to smash Gallucci's vice ring. He was well known for being involved with prostitution rackets and was also known as the [...] "King of the White Slavers" [...] in the press. He was charged with carrying a concealed weapon, a transgression of the Sullivan Act, but was released on a US$10,000 bail. The case failed to reach court, a fact that many attributed to his political connections.|$|E

60|$|A slight mist {{had risen}} {{as early as}} four o'clock on Saturday. By night-fall the {{atmosphere}} was a little dense, but the lamp-posts were still clearly visible {{at a distance of}} some feet, and nobody, accustomed to living in London, would have noticed <b>anything</b> much <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common.

[...] "I’ve seen a lot of launches," [...] commented Launch Director Michael D. Leinbach during the conference, [...] "and this was the most visibly beautiful launch I’ve ever seen." [...] After reaching orbit, the STS-119 crew got to work on their orbit operations, opening the payload bay doors, deploying the Ku band antenna, and activating and checking out the shuttle's robotic arm. The crew also downlinked the imagery taken of the external tank separation.|$|E
2500|$|Other reasons {{include the}} passage not being {{something}} a devout Jew such as Josephus would write (especially, [...] "if it be lawful {{to call him}} a man" [...] and [...] "doer of incredible deeds"), as his writing was usually sophisticated and would have explained <b>anything</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary to his Gentile audience, such as explaining what the word [...] "Christ" [...] means, why Jesus was called that and further explanations such as how he won over many Jews and Greeks, as he did for every other group (see [...] ), or why he would mention Jesus [...] "appearing" [...] in the [...] "third day"—a Christian creed—without explaining it and how {{no one seemed to}} notice this passage until the 4th century, not even Origen who quotes Josephus extensively in his works, thus leading mythicists to think that the Testimonium Flavianum is a forgery of the 4th century, perhaps written by Eusebius in order to provide an outside Jewish authority for the life of Jesus.|$|E
