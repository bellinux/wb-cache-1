It is also important to note that the hadith appeared in the mushaf of Ubay because it was for his own personal use, in other words, his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and hadith, since it was not meant for general use and he himself knew well what to make of his own notes. The same is true of the other copies of the Quran, which some of the Companions had for their own personal use.|$|E

He won another gold at the 2003 World Youth Championships. He set a new championship record in the 200 m {{with a time of}} 20.40 s, despite a 1.1 m/s head wind. Michael Johnson, the 200 m world-record holder, took note of Bolt's potential but worried that the young sprinter might be over-pressured, stating, [...] "It's <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he does three, four, five years down the line". Bolt had also impressed the athletics hierarchy, and he received the IAAF Rising Star Award for 2002.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{enjoyed the}} process of making the film: [...] "The TV {{schedule}} is tight, and you don't always {{have a lot of time}} to work on your drawings." [...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. [...] "There's a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story." [...] The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|When {{discussing}} the conception for her second studio album with L.A. Reid—Chairman and CEO of The Island Def Jam Music Group—Rihanna talked about experimenting with different music by incorporating some rock on the album. In February 2006, Rihanna {{announced that she}} was going to release her second studio album in April 2006 under the name A Girl like Me. When asked about the album in an interview with MTV News, Rihanna stated: [...] "Vocally I've matured so much, and lyrically I'm speaking about stuff I would never sing about [...] Now I'm singing about experiences that I've gone through and stuff that other 18-year-old girls go through, so it's all about progression." [...] In regards to the title of the album, Rihanna explained: [...] "It's called A Girl like Me because it's a very personal album, it's my baby. It's <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> it's like to be a girl like me, speaking of personal experiences as well as things that girls like me have gone through." ...|$|E
2500|$|Discussing {{the fight}} that breaks out {{involving}} Alfie and the suspects, among others, a source {{from the show}} told Inside Soap that [...] "Kat's heart is in her mouth! Everyone she cares about is involved", adding, [...] "Who knows where it could end—and what might be said." [...] Kat's lover leaves a bandage with [...] "I love you" [...] written on it, and the source said this means the affair is turning into something more serious, [...] " [...] it even more messy". They added [...] "There are interesting times ahead", but said that nobody else would be eliminated at that time, and the stand-in was still used for filming. The source later said that the affair was [...] "turning into more than just sex" [...] and that Kat's lover [...] "seems to be giving Kat something that Alfie can't—and that's {{bad news for the}} Moons' marriage." [...] Speaking of Kat and Alfie's relationship and the fact that Alfie finds the bandage, they said, [...] "Alfie hasn't got any idea at <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> Kat's up to [...] so he isn't looking out for signs that she's cheating on him. In fact, he thinks they're in a good place right now. Finding the [...] might not have the impact Kat's fearing. If only Alfie opened his eyes, it might dawn on him that this sudden declaration of love scrawled in lipstick is quite bizarre, to say the least." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} has made numerous brief {{returns to the}} serial as a guest character. In 1993, she was featured in a special week of episodes, filmed on-location in Paris, France, where Frank discovered, to his horror, that Diane was pregnant with an unknown foreign man's baby. In June 1994, Diane returned to Walford {{as part of a}} storyline involving her father's disappearance. In 1997, another week's worth of episodes set in Paris reunited Ricky and Diane. Shortly after, the character returned to the soap's setting of Walford, but Lawrence reportedly quit weeks after making her comeback. She had since commented on her reasons for quitting so soon: [...] "Going back to EastEnders was like going back to school and none of your friends are there. I was [...] there with people like Nick Berry (Simon Wicks) and Letitia Dean (Sharon Watts) and they'd all gone. One of the young actors, who will remain nameless, made me a coffee and started telling me <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> it was like. He had no idea I'd been in the soap before." [...] In addition, Lawrence was suffering physically as she was still getting over injuries she sustained from a car accident and was forced to remove a neck brace for filming purposes. On-screen, the character departed to travel with her musician boyfriend, abandoning her young son in her brother's care. Bosses at EastEnders had reportedly been keen for Lawrence to remain on the show, as they were hoping for an on-screen reunion of the Butcher family; Mike Reid had agreed to reprise his role as Frank, though Diane departed before his reintroduction.|$|E
