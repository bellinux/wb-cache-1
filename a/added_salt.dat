25|$|Butter is a {{dairy product}} {{containing}} up to 80% butterfat (in commercial products) which is solid when chilled and {{at room temperature}} in some regions and liquid when warmed. It is made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk to separate the butterfat from the buttermilk. It is generally used as a spread on plain or toasted bread products and a condiment on cooked vegetables, {{as well as in}} cooking, such as baking, sauce making, and pan frying. Butter consists of butterfat, milk proteins and water, and in some types, <b>added</b> <b>salt.</b> Butter may also be sold with added flavourings, such as garlic butter.|$|E

25|$|Polyelectrolytes {{that bear}} both {{cationic}} and anionic repeat groups are called polyampholytes. The {{competition between the}} acid-base equilibria of these groups leads to additional complications in their physical behavior. These polymers usually only dissolve when there is sufficient <b>added</b> <b>salt,</b> which screens the interactions between oppositely charged segments. In case of amphoteric macroporous hydrogels action of concentrated salt solution {{does not lead to}} dissolution of polyampholyte material due to covalent cross-linking of macromolecules. Synthetic 3-D macroporous hydrogels shows the excellent ability to adsorb heavy-metal ions {{in a wide range of}} pH from extremely diluted aqueous solutions, which can be later used as an adsorbent for purification of salty water All proteins are polyampholytes, as some amino acids tend to be acidic, while others are basic.|$|E
25|$|Finally at 8pm on April 21, 1975, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu officially {{resigned}} {{from his position}} as the President of the Republic of Vietnam upon learning that Xuan Loc had fallen that morning. In his final effort to save South Vietnam, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu gambled his political career by sending the very last units of the South Vietnamese army to Xuan Loc {{in an attempt to}} hold off the North Vietnamese 4th Army Corps. Ultimately, however, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu's effort came too late. The defeat at Xuan Loc only <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> into the wound of Nguyễn Văn Thiệu's political career, as the National Assembly grew hostile towards his handling of the war. One day after Nguyễn Văn Thiệu's departure to Taiwan, Trần Văn Hương was appointed as South Vietnam's President, and he was ordered to seek a negotiated peace with North Vietnam at any cost, to the disappointment of many in South Vietnam's political elite, who argued that the situation could have been different if Thieu had gone earlier.|$|E

2500|$|The {{conformation}} of any polymer {{is affected}} {{by a number of}} factors: notably the polymer architecture and the solvent affinity. In the case of polyelectrolytes, charge also has an effect. Whereas an uncharged linear polymer chain is usually found in a random conformation in solution (closely approximating a self-avoiding three-dimensional random walk), the charges on a linear polyelectrolyte chain will repel each other [...] via double layer forces, which causes the chain to adopt a more expanded, rigid-rod-like conformation. If the solution contains a great deal of <b>added</b> <b>salt,</b> the charges will be screened and consequently the polyelectrolyte chain will collapse to a more conventional conformation (essentially identical to a neutral chain in good solvent).|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} dietary salt intake on {{important}} population outcomes such as mortality is controversial. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the association between the dietary habit of <b>adding</b> <b>salt</b> to food and mortality in older men. Design, participants, setting and measurements: A risk factor questionnaire which contained a question about the dietary habit of <b>adding</b> <b>salt</b> to food was completed by 11742 community recruited older men between 1996 and 1999. The men were followed by means of the Western Australia Data Linkage System until November 30 th 2010. Deaths due to cardiovascular diseases and cancers were identified using ICD- 10 codes in the ranges I 00 –I 99 and C 00 -D 48, respectively. The association between the frequencies of <b>adding</b> <b>salt</b> to food and mortality was assessed using Kaplan Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazard analysis. Results: Median follow-up for survivors was 12. 5 years (inter-quartile range 8. 3 – 13. 2 years).
