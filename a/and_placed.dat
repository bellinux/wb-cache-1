While reflecting upon the focus of this column—that is, the possibility of changing meaning in light of space and place—as I ran through a forest in the heart of Toronto, I heard a noise.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, at {{the beginning}} of 2000 s, Single Head architectural technology was adapted for use in the Pick <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> machine. Single Head is the general acceptance of particular product architecture and is characteristic of technical evolution in a Pick <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> machines. Single Head architectural technology actually dominated the Pick <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> machine market. A dominant design often emerges in response to the opportunity to obtain economies of scale or to take advantage of externalities (Arthur, 1988). The K as a front runner of OSAT, adapted it in spite of having plenty of its own technologies because customers such as Samsung has strongly required it. Figure 1 presents the operation principle of Single Head Pick <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> Module. By utilizing the single head, Pick <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> machines pick the die from on wafer <b>and</b> <b>placing</b> them in the holes. Single Head technology is principle operation method, thus architecture technology. The K having accumulated knowledge about the operation principle of the Pick <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> machine began the innovation, because single Head component had a time lag during the process from picking the die to placing it the hole. Also the time required to move the die hindered quality control. Real time product inspection is much more important for OSATs.|$|R
