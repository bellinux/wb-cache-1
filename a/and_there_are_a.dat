Bournemouth has the third largest community of surfers in the UK and in 2009 an artificial surf reef, one of only four in the world, was constructed there. The reef failed to deliver the promised grade 5 wave, suffered a series of delays and ran over budget, finally costing Â£3.2 million.|$|E

There is also evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism, with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations have been noted.|$|E

5|$|As a seaside resort, {{the economy}} is mainly based around tourism; there are several hotels and guest houses near the seafront, to {{accommodate}} the influx of visitors during the summer.

The elderly population has led to many health and social care jobs at local care homes.

5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E
5|$|The {{county is}} drained by several {{important}} rivers which flow southwards into the Bristol Channel, especially the River Towy, and its several tributaries, {{such as the}} River Cothi. The Towy is the longest river flowing entirely within Wales. Other rivers include the Loughor (which forms the eastern boundary with Glamorgan), the River Gwendraeth and the River Taf. The River Teifi forms much of the border between Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of towns in the Teifi Valley which have communities living {{on either side of}} the river and hence in different counties. Carmarthenshire has a long coastline which is deeply cut by the estuaries of the Loughor in the east and the Gwendraeth, Tywi and Taf, which enter the sea on the east side of Carmarthen Bay. The coastline includes notable beaches such as Pendine Sands and Cefn Sidan sands, and large areas of foreshore are uncovered at low tide along the Loughor and Towy estuaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} been {{inhabited}} since pre-Roman times. It {{was used as}} a holiday destination in Roman Britain for occupants of Camulodunum (Colchester). Fishing has been a key industry on the island since then, particularly oysters, and along with tourism makes up {{a significant part of the}} island's economy. The Church of St Peter & St Paul in West Mersea is thought to have existed since the 7th century, while the Church of St Edmund in East Mersea dates from around the 12th or 13th centuries. The island became popular with smugglers from the 16th to the 19th century. It became a focal point for troops in both world wars, and a number of observation posts can still be found on the island. Tourism remains popular, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of beach huts and holiday parks on the island. A week-long festival of boat racing, Mersea Week, takes place every summer.|$|E

5|$|The thorax and abdomen are {{segmented}} {{and have}} a rigid cuticle made up of overlapping plates composed of chitin. The three fused thoracic segments bear three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. The forewings, known as tegmina, are narrow and leathery while the hindwings are large and membranous, the veins providing strength. The legs are terminated by claws for gripping. The hind leg is particularly powerful; the femur is robust and has several ridges where different surfaces join and the inner ridges bear stridulatory pegs in some species. The posterior edge of the tibia bears a double row of spines <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> pair of articulated spurs near its lower end. The interior of the thorax houses the muscles that control the wings and legs.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{important}} trees species and specimens; a Grand Fir in Argyll is the tallest tree in the United Kingdom and the Fortingall Yew may be the oldest tree in Europe. The Arran Whitebeams, Shetland Mouse-ear and Scottish Primrose are endemic flowering plants <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> variety of endemic mosses and lichens. Conservation of the natural environment is well developed and various organisations {{play an important role in}} the stewardship of the country's flora. Numerous references to the country's flora appear in folklore, song and poetry.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{is located}} on the western side of central {{southern}} Great Britain. To the north and west is the Irish Sea, and to the south is the Bristol Channel. The English counties of Cheshire, Shropshire, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire lie to the east. Much of the border with England roughly follows the line of the ancient earthwork known as Offa's Dyke. The large island of Anglesey lies off the northwest coast, separated from mainland Wales by the Menai Strait, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of smaller islands.|$|E

5|$|Other leisure {{facilities}} include the Keelman's Way, a 14-mile designated cycle and walking route which stretches from Wylam station to Bill Quay and which passes along the riverbank at Felling Shore. Named from the keelboats used to transport coal {{from the various}} collieries in the area, the route was extended into Newburn in 2012 when a Gateshead blue plaque was laid in memory of its creator, Councillor Roy Deane. Also at Felling Shore, at Green Lane, is Friar's Goose marina and the adjacent Friar's Goose Water Sports Club, a privately owned and increasingly popular club predominantly attended by middle-aged patrons who undertake various activities such as sailing, yachting and angling on the River Tyne. Felling Cricket Club has been based at High Heworth Lane at Felling since 1961 and compete locally, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> wide selection of public houses, including the Wheatsheaf at Carlisle Street, the Blue Bell in Victoria Square, the Portland Arms at Split Crown Road and the Pear Tree Inn at Sunderland Road which are all locally listed as places of special local interest.|$|E
5|$|Water megamasers {{were the}} first type of megamaser discovered. The first water megamaser was found in 1979 in NGC 4945, a galaxy in the nearby Centaurus A/M83 Group. The first {{hydroxyl}} megamaser was found in 1982 in Arp 220, which is the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy to the Milky Way. All subsequent OH megamasers that have been discovered are also in luminous infrared galaxies, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> small number of OH kilomasers hosted in galaxies with lower infrared luminosities. Most luminous infrared galaxies have recently merged or interacted with another galaxy, and are undergoing a burst of star formation. Many {{of the characteristics of}} the emission in hydroxyl megamasers are distinct from that of hydroxyl masers within the Milky Way, including the amplification of background radiation and the ratio of hydroxyl lines at different frequencies. The population inversion in hydroxyl molecules is produced by far infrared radiation that results from absorption and re-emission of light from forming stars by surrounding interstellar dust. Zeeman splitting of hydroxyl megamaser lines may be used to measure magnetic fields in the masing regions, and this application represents the first detection of Zeeman splitting in a galaxy other than the Milky Way.|$|E
