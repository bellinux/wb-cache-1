5|$|López de Salcedo moved Trujillo upslope {{from its}} {{previous}} swampy location. In 1528, López de Salcedo {{spent a month}} in the Olancho Valley, which at this time was likely to have been inhabited by Pech. He attempted to bring the inhabitants under his control, spurring them into preparation to resist further Spanish incursions. He hanged several indigenous leaders who taken part in the attack on Natividad de Nuestra Señora, and imposed such harsh obligations upon the natives that they burned their villages and their crops and fled into the mountains. In Olancho, López de Salcedo unsuccessfully clashed with rival Spaniards that he found still there. Unrest among the natives spread widely, from Comayagua to as far south as Nicaragua, causing difficulties in procuring provisions, <b>and</b> <b>presenting</b> constant danger to the expedition. Nevertheless, he continued onwards to León, in Nicaragua. At about this time, Pedrarias was appointed governor of Nicaragua after vigorously protesting his loss of governorship over Castilla del Oro.|$|E

5|$|Tiny {{amounts of}} 210Po are {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} laboratory and for teaching purposes—typically {{of the order of}} , in the form of sealed sources, with the polonium deposited on a substrate or in a resin or polymer matrix—are often exempt from licensing by the NRC and similar authorities as they are not considered hazardous. Small amounts of 210Po are manufactured for sale to the public in the United States as 'needle sources' for laboratory experimentation, and they are retailed by scientific supply companies. The polonium is a layer of plating which in turn is plated with a material such as gold, which allows the alpha radiation (used in experiments such as cloud chambers) to pass while preventing the polonium from being released <b>and</b> <b>presenting</b> a toxic hazard. According to United Nuclear, they typically sell between four and eight such sources per year.|$|E
