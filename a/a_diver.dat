5|$|<b>A</b> <b>diver</b> {{who only}} {{breathes}} gas at atmospheric pressure when free-diving or snorkelling will not usually need to decompress {{but it is}} possible to get decompression sickness, or taravana, from repetitive deep free-diving with short surface intervals.|$|E

25|$|Diving medicine, {{also called}} undersea and {{hyperbaric}} medicine (UHB), is the diagnosis, treatment {{and prevention of}} conditions caused by humans entering the undersea environment. It includes the effects {{on the body of}} pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how relationships of <b>a</b> <b>diver's</b> fitness to dive affect <b>a</b> <b>diver's</b> safety.|$|R
5|$|It is {{necessary}} to know the approximate length of time that <b>a</b> <b>diver</b> can breathe from a given cylinder so that a safe dive profile can be planned.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Diver</b> {{breathes}} a {{compressed gas}} mixture that contains inert gas which dissolves {{in the various}} tissues during the pressure exposure. When the ascent is initiated, the inert gas is off-loaded {{as soon as a}} suitable gradient is created.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} stop is {{a period}} <b>a</b> <b>diver</b> must spend at a relatively shallow constant depth during ascent after a dive to safely eliminate absorbed inert gases from the body tissues to avoid decompression sickness. The practice of making decompression stops is called staged decompression, as opposed to continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|A second {{effect is}} that <b>a</b> <b>diver</b> {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, {{and will have}} residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. This means that the diver should consider any dive done before equilibration as a repetitive dive, {{even if it is}} the first dive in several days.|$|E

5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy at their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent <b>a</b> <b>diver</b> from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack. The diver ascends along the shotline, and may use it purely as a visual reference, or can hold on to it to positively control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to fasten <b>a</b> <b>diver</b> to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|On 6 October 2012 the Finnish {{newspaper}} Helsingin Sanomat {{reported that}} the wreck of Pallada had been discovered by <b>a</b> <b>diver</b> group outside Hanko near the coast of Finland in 2000, but the group had waited until 2012 before publishing their find.|$|E
5|$|Recreational scuba divers {{commonly}} breathe nitrox containing up to 40% oxygen, while technical divers use pure oxygen or nitrox containing up to 80% oxygen. Divers who breathe oxygen fractions {{greater than}} of air (21%) {{need to be}} trained in the dangers of oxygen toxicity and how to prevent them. In order to buy nitrox, <b>a</b> <b>diver</b> has to show evidence of such qualification.|$|E

5|$|Some {{training}} agencies {{teach the}} concept of minimum gas, rock bottom gas management or critical pressures which allows <b>a</b> <b>diver</b> to calculate an acceptable reserve to get two divers to the surface in an emergency from any point in the planned dive profile.|$|E
5|$|The diver ascends {{along the}} shotline, and may use it purely {{as a visual}} reference, or can {{hold on to it}} to {{positively}} control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand.

5|$|The {{history of}} breath-hold diving goes {{back at least}} to {{classical}} times, and there is evidence of prehistoric hunting and gathering of seafoods that may have involved underwater swimming. Technical advances allowing the provision of breathing gas to <b>a</b> <b>diver</b> underwater at ambient pressure are recent, and self-contained breathing systems developed at an accelerated rate following the Second World War.|$|E

50|$|By today's standards, the Omega Marine {{was no more}} <b>a</b> <b>divers</b> watch {{than the}} Rolex Oyster which preceded it. Indeed, the Rolex Oyster had {{more in common with}} <b>a</b> modern <b>divers</b> watch than the Omega, since it had a metal {{bracelet}} instead of the leather band of the Omega.|$|R
5|$|The no {{decompression}} limit (NDL) or no stop time, is {{the interval}} that <b>a</b> <b>diver</b> may theoretically spend {{at a given}} depth without having to perform decompression stops. The NDL helps divers plan dives {{so that they can}} stay at a given depth and ascend without stopping while avoiding unacceptable risk of decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|Yarbrough's 1937 {{tables were}} based on a Haldanean 3 {{compartment}} model with compartment half-times of 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Ascent rate was chosen to be 25ft per minute, which was a convenient rate to pull up <b>a</b> <b>diver</b> in standard dress.|$|E
5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten <b>a</b> <b>diver</b> to a shot line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the anchor line. In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E
