They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E

The experimental group was tasked with two activities: the first activity was to remember a string of letters, and was intended activate all elements of the phonological loop. The second activity <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> to assess whether given phrases rhymed, and was intended to only activate certain sub-systems involved in vocalization, but specifically not the phonological storage.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the thinking process the boys had and to draw conclusions about the logic processes they had used, which was a psychometric technique of research. Piaget also used the psychoanalytic method initially developed by Sigmund Freud. The purpose of using such method was to examine the unconscious mind, as well as to continue parallel studies using different research methods. Psychoanalysis was later rejected by Piaget, as he thought it was insufficiently empirical (Mayer, 2005).|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{observed}} {{the effects of}} volunteerism (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being. In a study of older adults, those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live, and lower in depression, anxiety, and somatization. Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health, but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages. One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% {{of those who did}} not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one. A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality. Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being. A study that <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} further {{investigate}} {{the reversal of}} the bystander effect, van Bommel performed a second experiment, also reported in the article, with a sample size of 111 students. Unlike the first study, they wanted all participants in the forum to be indistinguishable from other bystanders on the forum. Therefore, the manipulation of public self-awareness was induced independently from the Internet forum. The procedure was identical to the first study, with a few variations. To induce public awareness in this study, webcams were mounted on participant’s computers. Participants {{could not see the}} video feed, but to make this more salient, they <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> before they started to check whether the camera was on by looking at a LED-indicator underneath the webcam. To make the conditions resemble each other as close as possible, they <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> in the camera absent condition to check if the LED-indicator for Num-Lock was on. Similar to the first experiment, five different messages were presented to the participants and the number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants. [...] Once again, the results were as expected. When the camera was not present, the bystander effect existed with the average amount of help being 1.5. However, when a camera was present, the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help doubling to 3. That said, the findings revealed the importance of public self-awareness in the bystander effect.|$|E
2500|$|As {{an example}} of how {{behavioral}} methods can be used in psycholinguistics research, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding using the lexical decision task. He <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> to make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words. Sometimes the strings would be actual English words requiring a [...] "yes" [...] response, and other times they would be nonwords requiring a [...] "no" [...] response. A subset of the licit words were related semantically (e.g., cat-dog) while others were unrelated (e.g., bread-stem). Fischler found that related word pairs were responded to faster when compared to unrelated word pairs. This facilitation suggests that semantic relatedness can facilitate word encoding.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{study done}} by Aknin, Norton, & Dunn (2009), {{researchers}} <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> from across the income spectrum to report their own happiness and to predict the happiness of others and themselves at different income levels. [...] In study 1, predicted happiness ranged between 2.4-7.9 and actual happiness ranged between 5.2-7.7. [...] In study 2, predicted happiness ranged between 15-80 and actual happiness ranged between 50-80. [...] These findings show that people believe that money does more for happiness than it really does. However, some research indicates that while socioeconomic measures of status do not correspond to greater happiness, measures of sociometric status (status compared to people encountered face-to-face on a daily basis) do correlate to increased subjective well-being, {{above and beyond the}} effects of extroversion and other factors.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{behavioral}} paradigm involves priming effects, wherein {{participants are}} presented {{first with a}} prime {{and then with a}} target word. [...] The response time for the target word is affected by the relationship between the prime and the target. [...] For example, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding using the lexical decision task. She <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> to make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words. Sometimes the strings would be actual English words requiring a [...] "yes" [...] response, and other times they would be nonwords requiring a [...] "no" [...] response. A subset of the licit words were related semantically (e.g., cat-dog) while others were unrelated (e.g., bread-stem).

2500|$|In {{order for}} thought {{suppression}} and its effectiveness to be studied, researchers {{have had to}} find methods of recording the processes {{going on in the}} mind. One experiment designed with this purpose was performed by Wegner, Schneider, Carter & White. They <b>asked</b> <b>participants</b> to avoid thinking of a specific target (e.g. a white bear) for five minutes, but if they did, they were told then to ring a bell. After this, participants were told that for the next five minutes they were to think about the target. There was evidence that unwanted thoughts occurred more frequently in those who used thought suppression compared to those who were not. Furthermore, there was also evidence that during the second stage, those who had used thought suppression had a higher frequency of target thoughts than did those who hadn't used thought suppression; later coined the rebound effect. This effect has been replicated and can even be done with implausible targets, such as the thought of a [...] "green rabbit". From these implications, Wegner eventually developed the [...] "ironic process theory".|$|E
40|$|Trace eyeblink {{conditioning}} (with a trace interval � 500 msec) {{depends on}} {{the integrity of the}} hippocampus and requires that participants develop awareness of the stimulus contingencies (i. e., awareness that the conditioned stimulus [CS] predicts the unconditioned stimulus [US]). Previous investigations of the relationship between trace eyeblink conditioning and awareness of the stimulus contingencies have manipulated awareness or have assessed awareness at fixed intervals during and after the conditioning session. In this study, we tracked the development of knowledge about the stimulus contingencies trial by trial by <b>asking</b> <b>participants</b> to try to predict either the onset of the US or the onset of their eyeblinks during differential trace eyeblink conditioning. <b>Asking</b> <b>participants</b> to predict their eyeblinks inhibited both the acquisition of awareness and eyeblink conditioning.

Acquisition of knowledge about the stimulus contingencies and acquisition of differential trace eyeblink conditioning developed approximately in parallel (i. e., concurrently).

In previous work (Kim et al., 2016), clinicians were asked {{to what extent the}} behaviors are “biologically based” or “psychologically based” in general, rather than about specific types of biological and psychological causes. Yet, there are many different kinds of both biological explanations (e.g. brain structure, genetics) and psychological explanations (e.g. in terms of cognition, emotion, or intentions). To what extent would shifts in attributions generalize across these types of biological and psychological causation? We tested these questions in Experiment 1 by <b>asking</b> <b>participants</b> to make judgments about several different types of biological and psychological causation for disordered behavior.|$|R
