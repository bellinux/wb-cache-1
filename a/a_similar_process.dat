5|$|At the University of Illinois, Polish-born {{research}} engineer Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner {{was working}} independently on <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>process.</b> On June 9, 1922, {{he gave the}} first reported U.S. demonstration of a sound-on-film motion picture {{to members of the}} American Institute of Electrical Engineers. As with Lauste and Tigerstedt, Tykociner's system would never be taken advantage of commercially; however, De Forest's soon would.|$|E

5|$|Electrolysis of {{a mixture}} of {{beryllium}} fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of beryllium iodide was investigated following the success of <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>process</b> {{for the production of}} zirconium, but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Alma Books, Whitehead states {{that the concept of}} the book originated from an article about the naming process for new pharmaceuticals such as Prozac. The article made Whitehead question how <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>process</b> is used to assert a certain control over one's environment (his example is a boulevard named after a particular person), and yoking the two concepts {{was the beginning of the}} ideas that led to his composition of the novel.|$|E
5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. <b>A</b> <b>similar</b> <b>process,</b> generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E

5|$|As part of Strasburg's {{rehabilitation}} {{from his}} Tommy John surgery, {{and as a}} precaution due to his low innings total in 2011, the Nationals decided {{to limit the number}} of innings Strasburg would throw in the 2012 season. Although the number was never official, rumors started that Strasburg's limit would be between 160 and 180 innings. It was also decided that Strasburg's shutdown would be final; he would not pitch in the playoffs. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the surgeon who operated on Strasburg's elbow, agreed in 2011 that Strasburg's 2012 innings total should be limited, although he did not consult with Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo or Strasburg during the season. Teammate Jordan Zimmermann underwent <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>process</b> the year before.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, the {{extractive}} industries of the West of Scotland underwent a metamorphosis. The small pits were either worked out or were mechanised and merged. <b>A</b> <b>similar</b> <b>process</b> took place in the iron and steel production industries, and the medium scale iron works in many locations closed down. Many railway branch lines had been heavily dependent on business from the mineral industries, and could not be sustained when they had gone, but some continued as passenger lines where they served sizable communities.|$|E
5|$|These extreme {{difficulties}} in melting the metal limited {{the possibilities for}} handling iridium. John Isaac Hawkins was looking to obtain a fine and hard point for fountain pen nibs, and in 1834 managed to create an iridium-pointed gold pen. In 1880, John Holland and William Lofland Dudley were able to melt iridium by adding phosphorus and patented the process in the United States; British company Johnson Matthey later stated they had been using <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>process</b> since 1837 and had already presented fused iridium {{at a number of}} World Fairs. The first use of an alloy of iridium with ruthenium in thermocouples was made by Otto Feussner in 1933. These allowed for the measurement of high temperatures in air up to 2000°C.|$|E

5|$|With {{the growing}} {{industrialization}} that accelerated during the 20th and 21st century, Italian society gradually moved from an agricultural base to an urban and industrial center. This change weakened traditional culture {{in many parts}} of society; <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>process</b> occurred in other European countries, but unlike them, Italy had no major initiative to preserve traditional musics. Immigration from North Africa, Asia, and other European countries led to further diversification of Italian music. Traditional music came to exist only in small pockets, especially as part of dedicated campaigns to retain local musical identities.|$|E
5|$|In May 1940, Germany {{invaded the}} Netherlands, and the {{occupation}} government began to persecute Jews by {{the implementation of}} restrictive and discriminatory laws; mandatory registration and segregation soon followed. Otto Frank tried to arrange for the family to emigrate to the United States – the only destination that seemed to him to be viable – but this possibility was blocked from June 1941, as the U.S. government was concerned that people with close relatives still in Germany could be blackmailed into becoming Nazi spies. The Frank sisters were excelling in their studies and had many friends, but {{with the introduction of}} a decree that Jews could attend only Jewish schools, they were enrolled at the Jewish Lyceum. Anne became a friend of Jacqueline van Maarsen in the Lyceum. In April 1941, Otto took action to prevent Pectacon from being confiscated as a Jewish-owned business. He transferred his shares in Pectacon to Johannes Kleiman and resigned as director. The company was liquidated and all assets transferred to Gies and Company, headed by Jan Gies. In December, Otto followed <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>process</b> to save Opekta. The businesses continued with little obvious change and their survival allowed Otto to earn a minimal income, but sufficient to provide for his family.|$|E
5|$|The moons of Jupiter and Saturn {{are thought}} to have formed through co-accretion, <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>process</b> to that {{believed}} to have formed the planets in the Solar System. As the young gas giants formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. Whereas Jupiter possesses four large satellites in highly regular, planet-like orbits, Titan overwhelmingly dominates Saturn's system and possesses a high orbital eccentricity not immediately explained by co-accretion alone. A proposed model for the formation of Titan is that Saturn's system began with a group of moons similar to Jupiter's Galilean satellites, but that they were disrupted by a series of giant impacts, which would go on to form Titan. Saturn's mid-sized moons, such as Iapetus and Rhea, were formed from the debris of these collisions. Such a violent beginning would also explain Titan's orbital eccentricity.|$|E

5|$|The {{universe}} {{continued to}} decrease in density {{and fall in}} temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. Symmetry breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form. After about 10−11 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle accelerators. At about 10−6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 1010 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. <b>A</b> <b>similar</b> <b>process</b> happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons.|$|E
