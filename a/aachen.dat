5|$|The 256,300 man strong U.S. First Army, {{commanded}} by General Courtney Hodges, {{was ordered to}} break through the Siegfried Line around the area of <b>Aachen,</b> in order to reach the Rur river. Although the First Army began to encircle the area around <b>Aachen</b> in early September, the Battle of <b>Aachen</b> did not end until 21 October. The city cost the Americans roughly 3,000 casualties, but had opened the path to the Rur (river) river. Despite the casualties taken the ground gained was comparatively worthless, and the fighting for <b>Aachen</b> had not necessarily brought German defeat any closer.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of <b>Aachen</b> {{had cost}} both the Americans and Germans dearly; the former {{suffered}} over 5,000 casualties, {{while the latter}} lost over 5,000 casualties and 5,600 taken prisoner. Since 2 October 1944, the 30th Infantry Division suffered roughly 3,000 men killed and wounded, while the 1st Infantry Division took at least 1,350 casualties (150 killed and 1,200 wounded). The Germans lost another 5,100 casualties during the fighting in <b>Aachen</b> itself, including 3,473 prisoners. In {{the process of the}} battle, the Wehrmacht lost two complete divisions and had another eight severely depleted, including three fresh infantry divisions and a single refitted armored division; this was largely attributed to how they fought, as although an equivalent of 20 infantry battalions had been used during various counterattacks against the 30th Infantry Division alone, on average each separate attack only involved two infantry regiments. During the conflict, the Germans also developed a respect for the fighting ability of American forces, noting their capability to fire indiscriminately with overwhelming amounts of artillery fire support and armored forces. Both the 30th Infantry and 1st Infantry divisions received distinguished unit citations for their actions at <b>Aachen.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Battle of <b>Aachen</b> {{was a major}} combat {{action of}} World War II, fought by American and German forces in and around <b>Aachen,</b> Germany, between 12 September–21 October 1944. The city had been {{incorporated}} into the Siegfried Line, the main defensive network on Germany's western border; the Allies had hoped to capture it quickly and advance into the industrialized Ruhr Basin. Although most of Aachen's civilian population was evacuated before the battle began, {{much of the city}} was destroyed and both sides suffered heavy losses. It was one of the largest urban battles fought by U.S. forces in World War II, and the first city on German soil to be captured by the Allies. The battle ended with a German surrender, but their tenacious defense significantly disrupted Allied plans for the advance into Germany.|$|E

5|$|The {{same day}} (12 October), to the south, two German {{infantry}} regiments attempted to retake Crucifix Hill from GIs of the 1st Infantry Division. In fierce fighting the Germans temporarily {{took control of}} the hill, but were dislodged {{by the end of the}} day, with both regiments virtually destroyed. From 11–13 October, Allied aircraft bombarded <b>Aachen,</b> selecting targets closest to American lines; on 14 October, the 26th Infantry Regiment was ordered to clear an industrial zone on the edge of <b>Aachen</b> in preparation for the attack on the city itself. On 15 October, in an effort to widen the gap between the two American pincers, the Germans again counterattacked the 1st Infantry Division; although a number of heavy tanks managed to break through American lines, the bulk of the German forces were destroyed by artillery and air support. On the next day, the Germans attempted to mount local counterattacks with the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division, but, after sustaining heavy losses, were forced to suspend further offensive action.|$|E
5|$|A new forward {{headquarters}}, Alsos Forward North (AFwdN), {{was opened}} at <b>Aachen,</b> and on 8 February the Alsos Mission reopened its forward headquarters in Strasbourg as Alsos Forward South (AFwdS). In March, the U.S. Twelfth Army Group launched Operation Lumberjack, an offensive {{to clear the}} Germans west of the Rhine. Pash, who was promoted to colonel on 6 March, led an Alsos Mission detachment into Cologne on 7 March, but little additional information was found.|$|E
5|$|Albert of <b>Aachen</b> says William's second {{desertion}} {{occurred in}} June 1098, along with William of Grand-Mesnil, {{a relative of}} Bohemond. On the road away from Antioch, they joined Stephen of Blois, another leader of the crusade who had also fled the siege. They travelled back towards Constantinople, but on the way met Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, who was advancing to Antioch with a relief army. They convinced him of the futility of the crusader siege and the emperor turned back to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Arnhem {{restored}} much of Model's self-confidence, {{which had}} been shaken by the experience of Normandy. From September to December, he fought another Allied thrust to a standstill, this time by Omar Bradley's U.S. 12th Army Group into the Hürtgen Forest and <b>Aachen.</b> While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of his units than at Arnhem, he still kept himself fully informed on the situation, slowing the Allies' progress, inflicting heavy casualties and taking {{full advantage of the}} fortifications of the Westwall, known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line.|$|E
5|$|Felix Magath {{took over}} and led Bayern to two {{consecutive}} doubles. Prior {{to the start of}} the 2005–06 season, Bayern moved from the Olympiastadion to the new Allianz Arena, which the club shares with 1860 Munich. On the field, their performance in 2006–07 was erratic. Trailing in the league and having lost to Alemannia <b>Aachen</b> in the cup yet again, coach Magath was sacked shortly after the winter break.|$|E
5|$|In January 2003, van Grunsven {{sustained}} a fracture of a bone in her upper leg {{in a fall}} from a horse in training, and required surgery. A metal plate was embedded in her leg to immobilize the bone during the healing process, and van Grunsven recovered, winning the 2003 Dutch Dressage Championships in June. In September, she underwent a second surgery to have the plate removed. In 2004, {{she became the first}} Dutch rider to win the CHIO <b>Aachen</b> dressage competition, a top international competition.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Harry Holtby (born 18 September 1990) is a German {{professional}} footballer who plays as a midfielder for Bundesliga club Hamburger SV. Holtby began his professional career with Alemannia <b>Aachen</b> before signing for Schalke two years later. He was subsequently loaned to Bochum and Mainz {{before returning to}} Gelsenkirchen where he lifted the Supercup in 2011. He then spent two seasons in England with Premier League sides Tottenham and Fulham between 2013 and 2014 before returning to Germany to sign for Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{strength}} of the American and British bomber fleets had increased. Based in Britain, they began operations against German targets. The first thousand-bomber raid was staged on Cologne on 30 May 1942. Air raids continued on targets further from Britain after auxiliary fuel tanks were installed on American fighter aircraft. Göring refused to believe reports that American fighters had been shot down as far east as <b>Aachen</b> in winter 1943. His reputation began to decline.|$|E
5|$|Sarah, however, did {{not like}} being away from England, and often complained that they were {{received}} with full honours in Europe, but were in disgrace at home. Sarah found life travelling the royal courts difficult, remarking that they were full of dull company. She took the waters at <b>Aachen</b> in Germany on account of her ill health, corresponded with those in England who could supply her with political gossip, and indulged in her fascination with Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer was {{appointed}} Gruppenkommandeur IV./NJG1 on 1 March 1944, taking over {{command of the}} Gruppe from Jabs who was given command of NJG1. He was promoted to Hauptmann on 1 May 1944. Schnaufer became an ace-in-a-day {{for the first time}} on 25 May 1944 when he claimed five RAF bombers shot down between 01:15 and 01:29 for victories 70 to 74. The bombers had targeted the railway marshalling yard at <b>Aachen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), {{under the}} command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, set their sights on the {{occupation}} of the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland. General George S. Patton's Third Army was given the task of occupying the French region of Lorraine, while General Courtney Hodges's First Army was ordered to break through the front near <b>Aachen.</b> Hodges had initially hoped to bypass the city itself, believing it to be held only by a small garrison, which would presumably surrender once isolated.|$|E
5|$|The Greeks also {{conveyed}} {{the names of}} the victors at the Olympic Games to various cities using homing pigeons. In the early 19th century, the Dutch government used the system in Java and Sumatra. And in 1849, Paul Julius Reuter started a pigeon service to fly stock prices between <b>Aachen</b> and Brussels, a service that operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed.|$|E
5|$|These {{forces were}} {{supported}} by the Ninth Air Force, which had pin-pointed 75% of the pillboxes along the frontlines and planned an opening bombardment including 360 bombers and 72 fighters; fresh aircraft {{would be used for}} a second aerial wave, which included the use of napalm. With the Germans having few anti-aircraft batteries and severely limited support from the Luftwaffe, Allied dominance of the sky over <b>Aachen</b> was near total.|$|E
5|$|A panel {{very similar}} in {{description}} {{was purchased by}} the <b>Aachen</b> art collector Barthold Suermondt sometime during the 1860s and catalogued in 1869 with a detailing of the frame's inscription. This work was thought {{to have come from}} Nantes, suggesting it was the same as the panel mentioned in 1851. The Suermondt collection was acquired by the Berlin museum in May 1874, as part of an acquisition of 219 paintings. The painting was stolen in March 1877, generating worldwide news coverage; it was recovered ten days later, but without the original frame. The 1875 Berlin museum catalogue attributes a van Eyck imitator; the 1883 catalogue describes the original as lost and the Berlin painting a copy. Soon after, however, its authenticity was verified, and the 1904 Berlin catalogue attributed Jan.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{churches are}} not the only source of {{inspiration}} that researchers attribute to the Round Church. Some scholars link its design to an Armenian influence, perhaps brought to Bulgaria by craftsmen from the Caucasus. In general, churches with such an antiquated plan in the Balkans are associated with the migration of Cappadocian, Armenian, or Georgian monks. Another possible model for the Round Church in Preslav may well be found in Carolingian architecture from the time of Charlemagne, and particularly the Palatine Chapel in <b>Aachen,</b> western Germany, with which it shares some characteristics. At the time of the Round Church's construction, Bulgaria was in direct contact with the Frankish Empire. One trait of the Round Church that is claimed by scholars to be a very recognisable Carolingian influence is the presence of a monumental westwork.|$|E
5|$|Claudius {{also wrote}} commentaries {{on the books}} of Leviticus, the {{historical}} books of the Old Testament, the Gospel of Matthew, and all Pauline epistles, of which the commentary on the Epistle to Galatians shows some of his views prefigure those expressed by both the Waldensians and Protestants centuries later. It was once {{thought that he had}} in fact founded the Waldensians, however this was disproved in the 19th century. His epistles on 1 and 2 Corinthians, however, dedicated to Theodemir, abbot of Psalmody, and a possible student of his, were sent to <b>Aachen</b> by the dedicatee to be condemned by the assembled bishops of the realm. The Corinthian commentaries were unpublished, though it was these commentaries that sparked the controversy concerning icons and pilgrimages.|$|E
5|$|For {{six days}} prior to the {{beginning}} of the American offensive, Allied heavy artillery targeted German defenses around <b>Aachen.</b> Although the heavy bombardment forced the German LXXXI Corps to halt all daylight personnel and supply movements, it had little effect on the pillboxes and strongpoints. The opening aerial bombardment on 2 October also caused little damage to German defensive positions; the 450 aircraft which took part in the first wave failed to register a single direct hit on any German pillbox. Their targets had been largely obscured by thick smoke from the Allied artillery barrage. As the aircraft finished their assault, the artillery resumed bombarding the front lines, firing 18,696 shells from 372 gun tubes within a couple of hours.|$|E
5|$|Francis Stephen {{was elected}} Holy Roman Emperor on 13 September 1745. Prussia {{recognised}} Francis as emperor, and Maria Theresa once again recognised {{the loss of}} Silesia by the Treaty of Dresden in December 1745, ending the Second Silesian War. The wider war dragged on for another three years, with fighting in northern Italy and the Austrian Netherlands; however, the core Habsburg domains of Austria, Hungary and Bohemia remained in Maria Theresa's possession. The Treaty of <b>Aachen,</b> which concluded the eight-year conflict, recognised Prussia's possession of Silesia, and Maria Theresa ceded the Duchy of Parma to Philip of Spain. France had successfully conquered the Austrian Netherlands, but Louis XV, wishing to prevent potential future wars with Austria, returned them to Maria Theresa.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of higher education. The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386) being the oldest. It is followed by the Leipzig University (1409), the Rostock University (1419) and the Greifswald University (1456). The University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many European and Western universities. In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence: Humboldt University Berlin, the University of Bremen, the University of Cologne, TU Dresden, the University of Tübingen, RWTH <b>Aachen,</b> FU Berlin, Heidelberg University, the University of Konstanz, LMU Munich, and the Technical University of Munich.|$|E
5|$|Having {{impressed}} in {{the second}} division with <b>Aachen,</b> Holtby was courted {{by a number of}} Bundesliga sides ahead of the 2009–10 season. Schalke emerged as the successful suitors and in July 2008 signed him on a four-year deal for a reported fee of €2.5 million. He was handed his debut for the club on 1 August 2009 by manager Felix Magath, with whom he would later fall out with, in a 4–0 DFB Pokal win over Germania Windeck. He featured nine times in the league, during which he registered two assists, and twice in the cup before being loaned to fellow Bundesliga side Bochum in January {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, after Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party won {{the federal}} election, Edith Frank and the {{children}} went to stay with Edith's mother, Rosa, in <b>Aachen.</b> Otto Frank remained in Frankfurt, but after receiving an offer to start a company in Amsterdam, he moved there to organize the business and to arrange accommodations for his family. He began working at the Opekta Works, a company that sold fruit extract pectin, and found an apartment on the Merwedeplein (Merwede Square) in the Rivierenbuurt neighbourhood of Amsterdam. By February 1934, Edith {{and the children}} had joined him in Amsterdam. The Franks were among 300,000 Jews who fled Germany between 1933 and 1939.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 13th century mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzmán. The studia conventualia and studia generalia of the mendicant orders played {{a large role}} in the {{transformation}} of Church sponsored cathedral schools and palace schools, such as that of Charlemagne at <b>Aachen,</b> into the prominent universities of Europe. Scholastic theologians and philosophers such as the Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas studied and taught at these studia. Aquinas' Summa Theologica was an intellectual milestone in its synthesis of the legacy of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Harry Holtby {{was born}} on 18 September 1990 in Erkelenz, West Germany. He began playing {{football}} {{at the age of}} four with amateur side Sparta Gerderath, a club with whom his father had also previously played, before signing for Borussia Mönchengladbach when he was 11-years old. He spent three seasons in Gladbach's academy before the club let him go in 2004, deeming him to be too small and slow to make it as a professional footballer. Following his release, Holtby elected to sign for Alemannia <b>Aachen</b> in the second tier of German football at the age of 14.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Italy {{a number}} of banks in Florence {{collapsed}} due to internal problems in Florence, contributed by King Edward III of England defaulting on some of his loans. Most notably, the Bardi family went bankrupt in this year. Italy also suffered a famine, {{making it difficult for}} the Papacy to recruit troops for the attack on Smyrna. The Venetians, however, organized an alliance uniting several European parties (Sancta Unio), composed notably of the Knights Hospitaller, which carried out five consecutive attacks on İzmir and the Western Anatolian coastline controlled by Turkish states. In the realm of technology, papermaking reached Holland, and firearms made their way to Northern Germany in this year. The earliest records in the area place them in the city of <b>Aachen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Metternich's {{primary focus}} {{remained}} on preserving unity among the Great Powers of Europe and hence his own power as mediator. He was also concerned by liberal-minded Ioannis Kapodistrias' increasing influence over Tsar Alexander and the continual threat of Russia annexing {{large areas of}} the declining Ottoman Empire (the so-called Eastern Question). As he had earlier envisaged, by April 1818 Britain had drawn up, and Metternich pushed through, proposals to have a Congress at <b>Aachen,</b> then a Prussian frontier town, six months later. Meanwhile, Metternich was advised to go to the spa town of Karlsbad to treat the rheumatic tension in his back. It was a pleasant month-long trip, although it was there he received news of {{the death of his father}} at the age of 72. He visited the family estate at Königswart and then Frankfurt in late August to encourage the member states of the German Confederation to agree on procedural issues. He could also now visit Koblenz for the first time in 25 years and his new estate at Johannisberg. Travelling with Emperor Francis, he was warmly greeted by the Catholic towns along the Rhine as he progressed towards <b>Aachen.</b> He had arranged in advance for newspapers to cover the first peacetime congress of its kind. As discussions began, Metternich pushed for the withdrawal of allied troops from France and means for preserving the unity of the European powers. The former was agreed almost immediately; but on the latter agreement extended only to maintaining the Quadruple Alliance. Metternich rejected the Tsar's idealistic plans for (among other things) a single European army. His own recommendations to the Prussians for greater controls on freedom of speech was equally hard for other powers such as Britain to support openly.|$|E
5|$|Peters' show record {{before the}} 1992 Summer Olympics {{made him a}} hopeful {{to compete for the}} US team. However, his {{citizenship}} papers were not processed in time to compete in the Olympic trials, and so he did not compete in Barcelona. Peters won his first Olympic medal when he rode with the US dressage team to a bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, together with Robert Dover, Michelle Gibson and Guenter Seidel. Peters, riding Floriano, was an alternate for the US team at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and did not compete. In 2006, with an aging Floriano, Peters and the US team won bronze at the 2006 World Equestrian Games. Soon after, he began riding TC Ravel, who would become his most successful horse. Despite being gelded while in quarantine after his shipment from the Netherlands and suffering an injury in 2007 that prevented training, Ravel carried Peters to a qualification for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In individual dressage competition at the Games, Peters placed fourth, riding Ravel. The US team finished fourth at the 2008 Games, but was disqualified after team member Courtney King's horse tested positive for felbinac, a banned substance. In 2009, Peters and Ravel had the highest scores in all three portions of the prestigious German <b>Aachen</b> World Equestrian Festival Grand Prix competition, leading them to be the first American pair to be named the <b>Aachen</b> Grand Prix Champions.|$|E
5|$|Rudolf Caracciola {{was born}} in Remagen, Germany, on 30 January 1901. He was the fourth child of Maximilian and Mathilde, who ran the Hotel Fürstenberg. His {{ancestors}} had migrated during the Thirty Years' War from Naples to the German Rhineland, where Prince Bartolomeo Caracciolo (nephew of Spanish-allegiance Field Marshal Tommaso Caracciolo) had commanded the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress near Koblenz. Caracciola was interested in cars from a young age, and from his fourteenth birthday {{wanted to become a}} racing driver. He drove an early Mercedes during the First World War, and gained his driver's license before the legal age of 18. After Caracciola's graduation from school soon after the war, his father wanted him to attend university, but when he died Caracciola instead became an apprentice in the Fafnir automobile factory in <b>Aachen.</b>|$|E
