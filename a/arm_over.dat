5|$|In 1959–60, {{the season}} {{started with a}} Test trial between the XIs of Lindwall and Benaud. Meckiff claimed a match total of 4/90 for Lindwall's men and was {{selected}} for the Test tour of Pakistan and India. Before the team departed, Meckiff demonstrated his new bowling action, which used a rigid left arm during the run-up, before swinging the <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> during the delivery stride. Over the next two years, sceptics and sporting opponents mostly regarded his action as fair, and said so in public. He was not called for throwing in either India or Pakistan, meaning that he had played in five nations without being sanctioned.|$|E
5|$|In January 2002, Mustaine {{was hospitalized}} {{for the removal}} of a kidney stone and was {{administered}} pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas, where he suffered a peculiar injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced by falling asleep with his left <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> the back of a chair, caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist with his left hand.|$|E

Stanlistening to the action from her houseleaves the place by car, following which she and her boyfriend are presented sitting {{at opposite ends of}} a bed. The singer is eventually left by the male alone in the room, with him being shown entering a supermarket while Stan lays on the ground near a piano. Later, he gets back to her house again, but Stan closes the door in his face. Subsequently, she is portrayed traveling with a red car previously shown in the beginning, arriving at an old vehicle and holding a bird on her <b>arm.</b> <b>Over</b> the rest of the music video, the singer is shown meeting her love interest face to face two more times, including a performance of the song to a bar's crowd in which he is featured, sporting a white dress and head accessory. Her suitor ends struggling with alcohol issues. Scenes interspersed through the main video present the singer laying over the abandoned vehicle, and playing the piano in her room.|$|E

25|$|He {{also took}} his first wicket of the tour in the second innings, ending with 1/21 from 14 overs. After batting {{for much of the}} first and second day, Miller was rested from his bowling duties during the first innings and was not asked to roll his <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> until the third day, once the other Australian bowlers had done most of the damage after asking the hosts to follow on. At this point, Miller had scored 421runs in the first seven days of May without being {{dismissed}} by a bowler, and the media began to speculate that he could score 1000runs in one month, something that had been done on a tour only by Bradman. This was hampered when he was rested from the match against Surrey at The Oval after playing in three consecutive first-class matches. Australia easily won the match by an innings.|$|E
25|$|In 1985/86 {{the club}} lost their {{equivalent}} of Chappell, Lillee and Marsh, with Salter, Lloyd and Kline all departing the club. Despite record playing numbers, peaking with 15 teams in 1986/87, {{and the introduction}} of the veterans XI in 1988/89, the next few seasons saw the 1st XI languish in {{the bottom half of the}} ladder, but remained in Chandler Shield. Following a year where the highest ranked senior side was the 8th placed reserve side, John Sharman was recruited to the club as captain/coach in 1990/91. His work ethic on the training field rubbed off on the field, as the top 3 teams all made finals. Sharman also brought with him an array of talent, including determined opening batsman Andrew Hood, Campbell Horlock and all-rounder Harry Drysdale. And with the emergence of Warrandyte juniors Tony Sturesteps, Gerald Walshe and David Mooney, the 1st XI were becoming competitive again, returning to the finals in 1992/93. They lost the semi final to Ainslie Park, which would start one of the great RDCA rivalries. The next season, local fruit shop owner and former Australian test cricket Rodney Hogg was talked into rolling the <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> again. Despite being 42 years old at the time, was still extremely quick when in the mood, and terrorised many a batsmen in his 2 seasons at Warrandyte.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Office fansite [...] "OfficeTally", Celotta said she and Lieberstein had only about one weekend to finish the script and distribute it to the actors, so there was little discussion about their individual volleyball abilities. Once the scripts were circulated, the writers learned that Jenna Fischer was {{not very good at}} volleyball and had trouble making certain motions with her <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> her head due to a previous injury. As a result, director Ken Kwapis arranged for stunt doubles to perform some of the volleyball moves; a handful of scenes were also shot with Pam doing an overhead motion with the ball being added later using computer-generated imagery. The opening credits were trimmed down to ten seconds and no post-credits scene was used {{in order to keep the}} episode within the network-mandated 21 minutes and 35 seconds. The producers considered making the episode an hour long like other season finales from past seasons, like [...] "The Job" [...] and [...] "Goodbye, Toby", but they found they did not have enough plot points to conclude in [...] "Company Picnic" [...] and would have had trouble filling a full hour.|$|E
500|$|Phase One of the Shuttle–Mir Program {{began on}} February 3, 1994, with {{the launch of}} Space Shuttle Discovery on its 18th mission, STS-60. The eight-day mission was the first shuttle flight of that year, the first flight of a Russian Cosmonaut, Sergei Krikalev, aboard the American shuttle, and marked the start of {{increased}} cooperation in space for the two nations, 37 years after the Space Race began. Part of an international agreement on human space flight, the mission was the second flight of the Spacehab pressurized module and marked the hundredth [...] "Getaway Special" [...] payload to fly in space. The primary payload for the mission was the Wake Shield Facility (or WSF), a device designed to generate new semiconductor films for advanced electronics. The WSF was flown {{at the end of}} Discoverys robotic <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> the course of the flight. During the mission, the astronauts aboard Discovery also carried out various experiments aboard the Spacehab module in the Orbiter's payload bay, and took part in a live bi-directional audio and downlink video hookup between themselves and the three Cosmonauts on board Mir, Valeri Polyakov, Viktor Afanasyev and Yury Usachev (flying Mir expeditions LD-4 and EO-15).|$|E

2500|$|The {{minimum payment}} on an Option ARM can jump {{dramatically}} if its unpaid principal balance hits the maximum limit on negative amortization (typically 110% to 125% {{of the original}} loan amount). If that happens, the next minimum monthly payment will be {{at a level that}} would fully amortize the <b>ARM</b> <b>over</b> its remaining term. [...] In addition, Option ARMs typically have automatic [...] "recast" [...] dates (often every fifth year) when the payment is adjusted to get the ARM back on pace to amortize the ARM in full over its remaining term.|$|E

But when they arrived they were rushed to Buckingham Palace and the man with the turkey in the shoebox still had it under his <b>arm.</b> <b>Over</b> the protests of an equerry, he — Montague — is alleged to have still carried the box when presented to His Majesty George V.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{moving to}} Melbourne in 1967 Walker joined the Melbourne Cricket Club. Although {{he earned a}} {{reputation}} as a batsman as a junior, he was given an opportunity to open the bowling attack for Melbourne, which showed his true cricket potential. His strange bowling action, bowling right <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> his right leg, earned Walker the nickname of [...] "Tanglefoot" [...] which was quickly shortened to [...] "Tangles". He made his first-class debut for Victoria in February 1969 against Queensland, the final match of Victoria's 1968–1969 Sheffield Shield season. Despite taking five wickets in the match, he did not get a chance to play in the 1969–1970 season due to the depth in Victoria's bowling. He earned a second match in December 1970 and became a regular in the 1971–72 season, playing a total of 135 matches for Victoria.|$|E

2500|$|If the {{defending}} team 'knocks on' or touches the ball when it's in the air, {{and the ball}} is immediately regathered by the attacking team, the referee may elect to restart the tackle count in lieu of awarding a scrum; known as the zero tackle rule because the next tackle is counted as 'tackle zero' and not the usual 'tackle one'. The zero tackle rule cannot {{be used in a}} set that was started by the zero tackle rule. On awarding the zero tackle rule, the referee will shout [...] "Back to zero!" [...] or [...] "Six again", and wave one <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> his head with fingers clenched into a fist, indicating the attacking side's next tackle is tackle zero. If a player collects the ball directly from an opposition kick in general play, the first time he is tackled does not register on the tackle count. If the receiving player kicks or passes the ball prior to being tackled then this does not apply.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{above average}} height, Fleetwood-Smith was broad-shouldered and solidly built. He possessed strong wrists and fingers, {{developed}} by squeezing a squash ball, which {{enabled him to}} spin the ball hardteammates and opponents spoke of the [...] "buzzing" [...] or [...] "fizzing" [...] noise that the ball made on its way toward the batsman after leaving his hand. Fleetwood-Smith's approach to bowling was uncomplicated. Following a very brief five-pace run up to the wicket, he brought his <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> quickly to deliver at a pace considered fast for a spin bowler. His three variations were the off-break (spinning into the right-hand batsman), the wrong 'un (spinning away) and the top spinner, which Hammond believed to be his best ball. He did not bother with varying his pace or flight: the only concession he made to tactical considerations was {{a signal to the}} wicket-keeper, to let him know which of the three variations he was about to deliver. Therefore, he rarely engaged in an extended strategic battle with a batsman in the manner of Grimmett or O'Reilly. The danger to the batsman lay in his unpredictability; he bowled all of his variations with no discernible change to his bowling action and needed no help from the pitch to extract turn.
