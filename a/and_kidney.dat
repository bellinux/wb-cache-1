5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake {{is associated with}} a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{concerns}} of long-term adverse side effects such as calcification of arteries <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> stones, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for {{the combination of}} dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9-18 years {{are not supposed to}} exceed 3,000 mg/day; for ages 19-50 not to exceed 2,500 mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to exceed 2,000 mg/day. The EFSA set UL at 2,500 mg/day for adults but decided the information for children and adolescents was not sufficient to determine ULs.|$|E
5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell {{will usually}} pursue most creatures that it encounters. This {{includes}} the skunk, and the breed {{is prone to}} skunk toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the skunk spray is absorbed by the dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.|$|E

These include tuberous sclerosis, which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and pneumothorax <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{fluorine}} {{is highly}} toxic to living organisms. Its effects in humans start at concentrations lower than hydrogen cyanide's 50 ppm and {{are similar to}} those of chlorine: significant irritation of the eyes and respiratory system as well as liver <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> damage occur above 25 ppm, which is the immediately dangerous to life and health value for fluorine. Eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm, and inhalation of 1,000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5|$|However, stool {{cultures}} {{should be}} performed in those with blood in the stool, those {{who might have been}} exposed to food poisoning, and those who have recently traveled to the developing world. It may also be appropriate in children young than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} acute {{exposure}} of intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA) on {{the activity of}} superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), amount of reduced glutathione (GSH) and content of ascorbic acid (ASC) has been studied in brain, liver <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> of male mice. Animals (n = 144) were treated KA with one dose, i. e. 12 mg/kg body weight or saline solution. The influence of KA on the tested parameters after 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours was estimated. After the injection of KA {{it has been found}} that the activity of SOD, GSHPx and CAT is very clearly reduced in the brain {{and to a lesser extent}} in liver <b>and</b> <b>kidneys.</b> Simultaneously a decrease in the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the brain, liver <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> was accompanied by a decrease of the amount of GSH and ASC. A decrease in the activity of SOD, CAT, GSHPx (after 2 and 4 h) and amount of GSH and ASC in the brain, liver <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> suggests that oxidative stress plays important role in the pathogenesis of KA in mice. The obtained results suggest that KA not only is toxic to the brain but also for the liver <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> of mice...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of diazinon and propoxur on liver <b>and</b> <b>kidneys,</b> following long term exposure of rabbits. Methods: Ten New Zealand white female rabbits were used. The animals were divided into 5 groups, consisting of 2 animals each. Diazinon (groups 1 and 2) and propoxur (groups 3 and 4) were administered at 2 different doses, and group 5 served as the control group. Histopathological lesions in the liver <b>and</b> <b>kidneys,</b> oxidative stress <b>and</b> oxidative DNA damage were evaluated. Results: Both pesticides induced focal inflammation and fibrosis in the liver <b>and</b> <b>kidneys.</b> The low dose of propoxur induced a significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC), with no difference in reduced glutathione (GSH), while the high dose of propoxur induced an increase in GSH with no change in TAC. For diazinon-exposed animals, the opposite findings were observed. Both diazinon and propoxur induced a statistically significant oxidative DNA damage in the liver <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> <b>and</b> a subsequent increase in telomerase activity in these tissues, possibly as a counteracting mechanism. Furthermore, systemic inflammation, as depicted by the dose-dependent increase in telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), was observed in propoxur treated animals. Conclusions: Histopathological lesions, oxidative stress and genotoxic effects were induced in liver <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> following long term exposure of rabbits to diazinon and propoxur.

5|$|Liver <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> {{disease can}} affect the {{biological}} activity of analgesics. When people with diminishing liver or kidney function are treated with oral opioids they must be monitored for the possible need to reduce dose, extend dosing intervals, or switch to other opioids or other modes of delivery. The benefit of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be weighed against their gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals are {{associated}} with C.australis in healthy ecosystems. The most common epiphytes are ferns, astelias and orchids. Old trees often carry large clumps of the climbing fern Asplenium, and in moist places, filmy ferns <b>and</b> <b>kidney</b> ferns cling to the branches. Astelia species and Collospermum often establish in the main fork of the tree, and one tree can host several species of native orchid. Other common epiphytes include Griselinia lucida, {{as well as a}} range of mosses, liverworts, lichens and fungi. Two fungus species which infect living tissue—Phanaerochaeta cordylines and Sphaeropsis cordylines—occur almost exclusively on C.australis.|$|E

40|$|Hematological, {{biochemical}} and histopathological examinations {{were conducted}} on rats administered orally 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg of Methomyl. Furthermore, mechanism of the toxic action of the drug was investigated. 1. Serum cholinesterase activity was inhibited and the clinical signs that could be associated with anticolinesterase activity appeared on animals after administration of each dose of the drug. 2. No hematological changes were observed. 3. Biochemical studies revealed the disorders in functions of livers <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> of rats receiving 5 mg/kg of Methomyl. Histopathological alterations were seen in lungs of rats administered 5 mg/kg and over of Methomyl, and also in livers <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> of animals which received 15 mg/kg of the drug. 4. Rats administered 5 mg/kg and over of methomyl had a decrease in superoxide dismutase activity, an increase in serum lipoperoxide level {{and a decrease in}} serum α-tocopheraol level. The results abtained suggest that superoxide free radical may be concerned in the lesions of lungs, livers <b>and</b> <b>kidneys</b> of animals which received the drug. 5.
