5|$|As of April 2008, 38 {{species are}} {{considered}} by the IUCN to be near threatened or worse and therefore at risk of extinction. Antbirds are neither targeted by the pet trade nor {{large enough to be}} hunted; the principal cause of the decline in antbird species is habitat loss. The destruction or modification of forests has several effects on different species of antbirds. The fragmentation of forests into smaller patches affects species that are averse to crossing gaps as small as roads. If these species become locally extinct in a fragment, this reluctance to cross unforested barriers makes their re-establishment unlikely. Smaller forest fragments are unable to sustain mixed-species feeding flocks, leading to local extinctions. Another risk faced by antbirds in fragmented habitat is increased nest predation. An unplanned experiment in fragmentation occurred on Barro Colorado Island, a former hill in Panama that became an isolated island during the flooding caused by the creation of the Panama Canal. Numerous species of antbird formerly resident in the area were extirpated, in no small part due to increased levels of nest predation on the island. While the species lost from Barro Colorado are not globally threatened, they illustrate the vulnerability of species in fragmented habitats and help explain the declines of some species. The majority of threatened species have very small natural ranges. Some are also extremely poorly known; for example the Rio de Janeiro <b>antwren</b> is known only from a single specimen collected in 1982, although there have been unconfirmed reports since 1994 and it is currently listed as critically endangered. Additionally, new species are discovered at regular intervals; the Caatinga <b>antwren</b> was described in 2000, the acre antshrike in 2004, the sincorá <b>antwren</b> in 2007, and the description of a relative of the Paraná <b>antwren</b> discovered in 2005 in the outskirts of São Paulo is being prepared. While not yet scientifically described, conservation efforts have already been necessary, as the site of discovery was set out to be flooded to form a reservoir. Consequently, 72 individuals were captured and transferred to another locality.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of the antbirds is entirely Neotropical, with {{the vast majority of}} the species being found in the tropics. A few species reach southern Mexico and northern Argentina. Some species, such as the barred antshrike, have a continental distribution that spans most of the South and Middle American {{distribution of}} the family; others, such as the ash-throated <b>antwren,</b> have a tiny distribution.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of antbirds is {{soft and}} not brightly coloured, {{although}} it is occasionally striking. The colour palette of most species is blackish shades, whitish shades, rufous, chestnut and brown. Plumages can be uniform in colour or patterned with barring or spots. Sexual dimorphism – differences in plumage colour and pattern {{between males and females}} – is common in the family. Overall the pattern within the family is for the males to have combinations of grey, black or white plumage and the females having buff, rufous and brown colours. For example, the male dot-winged <b>antwren</b> is primarily blackish, whereas the female has rust-coloured underparts. In some genera, such as Myrmotherula, species are better distinguished by female plumage than by male. Many species of antbirds have a contrasting 'patch' of white (sometimes other colours) feathers on the back (known as interscapular patches), shoulder or underwing. This is usually concealed by the darker feathers on the back but when the bird is excited or alarmed these feathers can be raised to flash the white patch. dot-winged antwrens puff out white back patches, whereas in bluish-slate antshrikes and white-flanked antwrens the white patch is on the shoulder.|$|E
40|$|<b>Antwrens</b> of {{the genus}} Myrmotherula (Formicariidae) are common members of mixed flocks in the {{understory}} of neotropical forest, but rarely follow army ants {{more than a few}} minutes as a flock passes. <b>Antwrens</b> that glean in open foliage (axillaris, longipennis) and ones that forage on dead foliage (fulviventris and relatives) apparently have to canvass large areas too rapidly to stay with slow-moving ants. <b>Antwrens</b> that glean low foliage of vertical seedlings (guttata, hauxwelli, gularis) can stay near ants only in such patches, despite close resemblance to sallying and hence less microhabitat-limited Hylophylax antbirds, some of which follow ants regularly...|$|R

500|$|The antbirds are a {{group of}} small to {{medium-sized}} passerines that {{range in size from}} the large giant antshrike, which measures 45cm (18in) and weighs 150 g (5.29 oz), to the tiny 8-cm (3in) pygmy <b>antwren,</b> which weighs 7 g (0.25oz). In general terms, [...] "antshrikes" [...] are relatively large-bodied birds, [...] "antvireos" [...] are medium-sized and chunky, while [...] "antwrens" [...] include most smaller species; [...] "antbird" [...] genera can vary greatly in size. Members of this family have short rounded wings that provide good manoeuvrability when flying in dense undergrowth. The legs are large and strong, particularly in species that are obligate ant-followers. These species are well adapted to gripping vertical stems and saplings, which are more common than horizontal branches in the undergrowth, and thus the ability to grip them is an advantage for birds following swarms of army ants. The claws of these antbirds are longer than those of species that do not follow ants, and the soles of some species have projections that are tough and gripping when the foot is clenched. Tarsus length in antbirds is related to foraging strategy. Longer tarsi typically occur in genera such as the Thamnophilus antshrikes that forage by perch-gleaning (sitting and leaning forward to snatch insects from the branch), whereas shorter tarsi typically occur in those that catch prey on the wing, such as the Thamnomanes antshrikes.|$|E
500|$|Many species {{participate}} in mixed-species feeding flocks, forming {{a large percentage}} of the participating species within their range. Some of these are core or [...] "nuclear species". These nuclear species share territories with other nuclear species but exclude conspecifics (members of the same species) and are found in almost all flocks; these are joined by [...] "attendant species". Loud and distinctive calls and conspicuous plumage are important attributes of nuclear species as they promote cohesion in the flock. The composition of these flocks varies geographically; in Amazonia species of Thamnomanes antshrike are the leading nuclear species; elsewhere other species, such as the dot-winged antwrens and checker-throated antwrens, fill this role. Other species of <b>antwren</b> and antbird join them along with woodcreepers, ant-tanagers, foliage-gleaners and greenlets. The benefits of the mixed flock are thought to be related to predation, since many eyes are better for spotting predatory hawks and falcons. Comparisons between multi-species feeding flocks in different parts of the world found that instances of flocking were positively correlated with predation risk by raptors. For example, where Thamnomanes antshrikes lead the group they give loud warning calls in the presence of predators. These calls are understood and reacted to by all the other species in the flock. The advantage to the Thamnomanes antshrikes is in allowing the rest of the flock, which are typically gleaners, to act as beaters, flushing prey while foraging which the antshrikes can obtain by sallying. Similar roles are filled in other flocks by other antbird species or other bird families, for example the shrike-tanagers. Within the feeding flocks competition is reduced by microniche partitioning; where dot-winged antwrens, checker-throated antwrens and white-flanked antwrens feed in flocks together, the dot-wings feed in the densest vines, the white-flank in less dense vegetation, and the checker-throats in the same density as the latter but in dead foliage only.|$|E

5000|$|The 27 Australasian [...] "wren" [...] {{species in}} the family Maluridae are unrelated, as are the New Zealand wrens in the family Acanthisittidae, the <b>antwrens</b> in the family Thamnophilidae, and the wren-babblers of the family Timaliidae.|$|R
5|$|The antbird family {{contains}} over 200 species, variously called <b>antwrens,</b> antvireos, antbirds and antshrikes. The names {{refer to}} the relative sizes of the birds (increasing in the order given, though with exceptions) rather than any particular resemblance to the true wrens, vireos or shrikes. In addition, members of the genus Phlegopsis are known as bare-eyes, Pyriglena as fire-eyes and Neoctantes and Clytoctantes as bushbirds. Although the systematics of the Thamnophilidae is based on studies from the mid-19th century, when fewer than half the present species were known, comparison of the myoglobin intron 2, GAPDH intron 11 and the mtDNA cytochrome b DNA sequences has largely confirmed it. There are two major clades – most antshrikes and other larger, strong-billed species as well as Herpsilochmus, versus the classical <b>antwrens</b> and other more slender, longer-billed species – and the monophyly of most genera was confirmed.|$|R

5|$|Antbirds are {{a family}} of Passerines found from Argentina north to Mexico. There are {{a great variety of}} antbirds, with antbirds, <b>antwrens</b> and antshrikes. Antshrikes are small, often handsomely marked birds. There is only one species of antbird {{recorded}} in the United States; an audio recording of a barred antshrike from Harlingen, Texas, in September, 2006.|$|R
5|$|The antbirds {{are a large}} {{passerine}} bird family, Thamnophilidae, found across subtropical {{and tropical}} Central and South America, from Mexico to Argentina. There are more than 200 species, known variously as antshrikes, <b>antwrens,</b> antvireos, fire-eyes, bare-eyes and bushbirds. They {{are related to the}} antthrushes and antpittas (family Formicariidae), the tapaculos, the gnateaters and the ovenbirds. Despite some species' common names, this family is not closely related to the wrens, vireos or shrikes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fasciated antshrike}} feeds on large insects and other prey in the mid-story, from 5 - 20 m off the ground.

Insects taken include grasshoppers, bugs, beetles and caterpillars, as well as spiders and even lizards, amphibians and occasionally fruit. They will join mixed species feeding flocks with <b>antwrens</b> and foliage-gleaners that pass through their territories, and will also follow army ants to take prey flushed by them, but they are not obligate ant-followers.|$|R

5|$|Almost all antbirds lay two eggs. A few {{species of}} antshrike lay three eggs, {{and a smaller}} number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of {{tropical}} birds compared to more temperate species of the same size, possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed. Both parents participate in incubation, although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for chicks to hatch is 14–16 days in most species, although some, such as the dusky antbird, can take as long as 20 days. The altricial chicks are born naked and blind. Both parents brood the young until they are able to thermoregulate, although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night. In common with many songbirds, the parents take faecal sacs for disposal away from the nest. Both parents feed the chicks, often bringing large prey items. When the chicks reach fledging age, after 8–15 days, attending parents call their chicks. As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to speed up the process of fledging. After fledging, chicks spend the first few days well hidden as the parents bring them food. Chicks of some species may not become independent of the parents for as long as four months in some <b>antwrens,</b> but two months is more typical {{for the rest of the}} family.|$|R
50|$|The Sincorá <b>antwren</b> {{was only}} {{described}} in 2007. While traditionally placed {{in its own}} genus Stymphalornis, the marsh <b>antwren</b> belongs in Formicivora.
