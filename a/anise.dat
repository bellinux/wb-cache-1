5|$|Roget and Yerchael {{join forces}} with Belgar, the Oracle of Shadows from the holy city of Wendel, who discovers that <b>Anise</b> is hoping to use the dark energy from the mirrors to turn herself into a goddess. Roget and his allies journey to the Mirage Castle to confront <b>Anise,</b> only for her to finish pulling the dark energy from the mirrors before they can stop her. The dark energy kills Inath and the Mirage Bishop, and <b>Anise</b> {{combines}} her form with a possessed Peddan general to create the Goddess of Doom. The allied forces fight and defeat the Goddess, ending the threat from Pedda, and return to their home countries.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{containing}} phytoestrogens {{have been}} administered for centuries for gynaecological {{disorders such as}} fertility, menstrual, and menopausal problems. Among these plants are Pueraria mirifica, kudzu, angelica, fennel, and <b>anise.</b>|$|E
5|$|A year of {{wandering}} later, {{the dark}} energy {{has begun to}} affect other countries in Fa'Diel. Keldric discovers in Jadd that Ritzia plans to release the Mavolian energy to cover the whole world. He and Faye journey back to Illusia, only to discover Ritzia seemingly possessed and {{saying that it is}} their destiny to rule the world. After she runs away, Keldric meets a masked stranger who tells him that he was the one to close the portal centuries ago, sealing up the Maiden who had opened it, <b>Anise,</b> inside. He also reveals that Stroud is Keldric's older brother. When Keldric and Faye reach the portal, they find Stroud and Ritzia fighting. Stroud is trying to prevent Ritzia, possessed by <b>Anise,</b> from destroying the world, but is being mutated by the dark energy. Keldric defeats the mutated Stroud, and then fights Ritzia. Realizing {{that the only way to}} close the portal is to defeat <b>Anise,</b> he is forced to kill Ritzia along with her. The spirits of Ritzia and Faye then merge with the Tree of Mana, the portal is sealed, and Illusia is restored.|$|E
5000|$|Haruto Kisugi is the Yellow Rose Rhode Knight. Although he {{is a real}} knight, he {{has been}} cast out from the Rose Rhode Knights because of his {{disappearance}} during the [...] "Yellow Rose Incident". He was <b>Anise's</b> elementary schoolmate {{and they were very}} close before they went to separate high schools. He transferred to Shoubi Academy as part of Schwartz's plan to double confirm <b>Anise's</b> missing choker and at the same time, take revenge on the White, Black, Blue (who took over his place) and especially the Red (who was the previous generation True Rose) Rose Rhode Knight.|$|R
50|$|Years later, she reappears at the doorsteps of Schwartz's house, {{carrying}} a baby. It {{turns out that}} the baby is her daughter and she begged him {{to take care of her}} daughter. She also begged Schwartz not to let her daughter know of her true status. After giving her daughter to Schwartz, <b>Anise's</b> Mother was never seen again.|$|R
50|$|Heihachi {{is one of}} {{the bonus}} {{characters}} available to play as or against in Anna Kournikova's Smash Court Tennis for the PlayStation (alongside fellow Namco characters) and is an unlockable character in Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2. He also makes guest appearances in the role-playing game Tales of the Abyss (as one of <b>Anise's</b> custom dolls) and in Pac-Man Fever (alongside several other Namco characters).|$|R
5|$|Sonoma {{county has}} a Zinfandel-producing land area {{second only to}} that of San Joaquin County. The county {{contains}} the warm Dry Creek Valley AVA, known for its juicy Zinfandel with bright fruit, balanced acidity and notes of blackberry, <b>anise</b> and pepper. Dry Creek Valley produces Zinfandel {{in a variety of}} styles ranging from the high-alcohol Amador style to balanced, spicy wines.|$|E
5|$|The {{taste of}} the red wine depends on the {{ripeness}} of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas, whereas blackberry, <b>anise</b> and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone.|$|E
5|$|When {{they were}} first cultivated, carrots were grown for their {{aromatic}} leaves and seeds rather than their roots. Carrot seeds {{have been found in}} Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC. Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, <b>anise,</b> dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century; the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca, which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.|$|E
5000|$|Ninufa is the pet of Itsushi and {{the guardians}} of the Rose Cards. He was {{responsible}} for knocking off <b>Aníse's</b> choker, resulting in him finding {{out that she was}} the missing Rose Princess. Ninufa has an appearance of a bat, though he can also transform into a dragon. The creature tends to talk in a slang style with the words [...] "da" [...] used regularly and is unusually seen eating at least once per chapter. Among the four current Rose Knights, he is personally closer to Seiran.|$|R
40|$|The {{south-west}} monsoon {{period is}} generally 	 an offseason for the fisherfolk who use non-	 mechanised fishing crafts {{along the west}} coast of 	 India, on account of the extremely rough con	 ditions of the sea. However, in some parts of 	 Kerala, areas adjoining the coast become oc	 casionally very calm due to the formation of mud 	 banks while other coastal areas are highly surf 	 ridden. The calm areas formed near to the shore 	 are of varying extent, from aboutlOkm 2 to 25 km 2 	 and provide safe harbourage to the non-mech	 <b>anised</b> crafts when fishing in other regions is 	 almost impossible. Launching and landing of 	 vessels are easy at the mud bank areas...|$|R
50|$|Yakoh Hasuzaki is a pop idol of {{the group}} Rhodecia, {{together}} with Idel Suzumura. Their group is popular among high school girls, with their songs topping popularity contests. He was enrolled to <b>Anise's</b> school with Idel. Matching to his Lime Rose, Yakoh has lime green hair. He generally wears a tired or gentle expression. He is usually seen wearing his Rhodecia outfit. Yakoh is Idel's antithesis. Despite being a pop idol, he is very calm and reserved in any situation. In the story, Yakoh thanks Idel suddenly for everything and collapses. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital. Schwartz heals him and Yakoh takes a temporary residence at Schwartz's apartment to heal. His hobby is (giving) massages and he dislikes green juice (Idel's specialty).|$|R
5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and fennel. Many of these plants grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. <b>Anise</b> was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E
5|$|The region spans a {{wide variety}} of {{cultures}} with distinct cuisines, in particular (going anticlockwise around the region) the Maghrebi, Levantine, Ottoman (Turkish), Greek, Italian, Provençal (French), Spanish, and Portuguese. However, the historical connections of the region, as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region's climate and economy, mean that these cuisines share dishes beyond the core trio of oil, bread, and wine, such as roast lamb or mutton, meat stews with vegetables and tomato (for example, Spanish andrajos and Italian ciambotta), and the salted cured fish roe, bottarga, found across the region. Spirits based on <b>anise</b> are drunk in many countries around the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|They soon {{learn that}} the king of Pedda and Roget's {{childhood}} friend, Inath, has been driven mad and is launching Operation Psi {{with the aim of}} taking over the world. Roget and Yerchael journey to the other nations in order to help stop the Peddan army. They join forces with the rulers and warriors of several countries, including the defeated Amazons of Laurent, the rebels of Nevarla, which has allied itself with Pedda, and the warriors of Valsena and Altena. As they fight the Peddan army, they discover that Inath is installing Black Mirrors in the conquered kingdoms, which are corrupting those around them. Roget and Yurchael are joined in their quest by the elemental spirits, which are concerned about the mirrors. After confronting Roget's twin brother, the Mirage Bishop, they discover that Inath and the Mirage Bishop have been corrupted by the ancient witch <b>Anise,</b> who is planting the mirrors in order to summon a dark energy for her own power.|$|E
5000|$|The titular {{character}} made numerous appearances {{outside of}} her video game, mostly in Namco's other video games. Both Momo (and Wonder Momo) appeared {{as one of}} the playable characters in the Japan-only, tactical RPG title Namco x Capcom, partnering with Beraboh Man. The character often covered herself, alluding to the original game. Some artifacts, models and costumes based on her appeared in some other Namco titles. She appeared as a magnus card in the Namco RPG Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, made a cameo appearance as one of <b>Anise's</b> dolls in Tales of the Abyss, had her normal self appear {{as one of the}} various floats that appear in the bonus stages of Marvel Land, and had her [...] "Wonder" [...] costume appear in Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology 2 and in Catalogue 4 in the Xbox 360 game The Idolmaster.|$|R
40|$|This era of {{globalisation}} {{is characterized}} by an ongoing international fragmentation of production where the supply chain is split up {{in more and more}} parts. The traditional Ricardian theory of trade in products governed by comparative advantages is replaced by a modern theory of trade in tasks. This trend requires new entrepreneurial skills in the organisation of production. Tasks are outsourced to those places in the world where the lower production costs outweigh the additional transaction costs associated with the fragmentation of production. This managing of transaction costs, which we label transaction management, has become a major entrepreneurial skill in transaction economies like the Netherlands. It is determinant for the make or buy 9 ̆d and location decisions. This paper investigates the practice of transaction management by using data from in-depth interviews with seven companies in the Netherlands which are actually engaged in this modern way of org <b>anising</b> production. It shows that the various ways of coping with transaction costs in the organisation of production {{play an important role in}} the strategic decision making of the internationally operating entrepreneurs. However, transaction costs are only intuitively dealt with in organising production. Therefore it seems that support from more formal argumentation, based on the theories of transaction cost economics and new institutional economics, is warranted...|$|R
25|$|India is {{the leader}} in {{production}} of <b>anise,</b> badian (star <b>anise),</b> fennel and coriander.|$|E
25|$|Fennel {{is widely}} cultivated, both in its native range and elsewhere, for its edible, {{strongly}} flavored leaves and fruits. Its aniseed flavor comes from anethole, an aromatic compound {{also found in}} <b>anise</b> and star <b>anise,</b> and its taste and aroma are similar to theirs, though usually not as strong.|$|E
25|$|Seeds: Commonly used seeds include tonka bean, carrot seed, coriander, caraway, cocoa, nutmeg, mace, cardamom, and <b>anise.</b>|$|E
25|$|A spirit {{known as}} aguardiente, {{distilled}} from molasses and often infused with <b>anise,</b> with additional sugarcane juice added after distillation, {{is produced in}} Central America and northern South America.|$|E
25|$|The spices, often {{wrapped in}} {{cheesecloth}} or a soaking bag {{to prevent them}} from floating all over the pot, usually contain cloves, star <b>anise,</b> coriander seed, fennel, cinnamon, black cardamom, ginger, and onion.|$|E
25|$|In baking, Pernod <b>Anise</b> {{is often}} used as a {{substitute}} if absinthe is unavailable. In preparing the classic New Orleans-style Sazerac cocktail, various substitutes such as Pastis, Pernod, Ricard, and Herbsaint {{have been used to}} replace absinthe.|$|E
25|$|Fennel {{seeds are}} {{sometimes}} confused {{with those of}} <b>anise,</b> which are similar in taste and appearance, though smaller. Fennel is also used as a flavoring in some natural toothpastes. The seeds are used in cookery and sweet desserts.|$|E
25|$|Fennel {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} in its native range the mouse moth and the Old-World swallowtail. Where it has been introduced in north America it may be used by the <b>anise</b> swallowtail.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, phytoestrogenic {{plants have}} been used for centuries in the {{treatment}} of menstrual and menopausal problems, as well as for fertility problems. Plants used that have been shown to contain phytoestrogens include Pueraria mirifica, and its close relative, kudzu, Angelica, fennel and <b>anise.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{a highly}} {{aromatic}} and flavorful herb with culinary and medicinal uses and, along with the similar-tasting <b>anise,</b> {{is one of the}} primary ingredients of absinthe. Florence fennel or finocchio is a selection with a swollen, bulb-like stem base that is used as a vegetable.|$|E
25|$|D. ambrosioides {{is used as}} a leaf vegetable, herb, and {{herbal tea}} for its pungent flavor. Raw, it has a resinous, {{medicinal}} pungency, similar to oregano, <b>anise,</b> fennel, or even tarragon, but stronger. The fragrance of D. ambrosioides is strong but difficult to describe. A common analogy is to turpentine or creosote. It has also been compared to citrus, savory, and mint.|$|E
25|$|During this period, rakı was {{produced}} by distillation of grapes pomace (cibre) obtained during wine fermentation. When the amount of pomace was not sufficient, alcohol imported from Europe would be added. If <b>anise</b> was not added, {{it would take the}} name düz rakı ("straight rakı"), whereas rakı prepared with the addition of gum mastic was named sakız rakısı (gum rakı) or mastikha.|$|E
25|$|Biscotti – {{generally}} <b>anise</b> flavored, often nut studded, hard cookie {{that may}} alternatively contain dried fruit or chocolate are common as well; often dipped in coffee rather than sweet dessert wines as in Italy. American biscotti {{are almost always}} loaf-type cookies that are sliced and rebaked to crispness, while the term refers to almost all forms of cookie in Italy.|$|E
25|$|Pizzelle - {{traditional}} Italian waffle cookies {{made from}} flour, eggs, sugar, butter or oil, and flavoring (usually <b>anise</b> or anisette, less commonly vanilla or lemon zest). Originally from Abruzzo, brought {{over to the}} United States by Abruzzese immigrants. Popular during Christmas in the Northeastern United States among Italian-Americans and especially in Philadelphia and other cities where large numbers of Abruzzese immigrants settled.|$|E
25|$|Toothpaste {{comes in}} a variety of colors, and flavors {{intended}} to encourage use of the product. Three most common flavorants are peppermint, spearmint, and wintergreen. Toothpaste flavored with peppermint-anise oil is popular in the Mediterranean region. These flavors are provided by the respective oils, e.g. peppermint oil. More exotic flavors include Anethole <b>anise,</b> apricot, bubblegum, cinnamon, fennel, lavender, neem, ginger, vanilla, lemon, orange, and pine. Alternatively, unflavored toothpastes exist.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} artisanally {{produced}} liqueurs (distilled, flavored alcoholic beverages) in Argentina, for example those flavored with orange, egg, <b>anise,</b> coffee, cherry and, inevitably, dulce de leche. The Hesperidina {{is a type}} of liqueur made from orange peels, invented in Argentina around 1890. One may also encounter chitronchelo or (in Italian) citroncello, based on lemon. This beverage arrived with immigrants from the Mezzogiorno, and is produced both artisanally and industrially (for example, at Mar del Plata).|$|E
25|$|Basil is {{possibly}} native to India, {{and has been}} cultivated there for more than 5,000 years. It was thoroughly familiar to the Greek authors Theophrastus and Dioscorides. It is a tender plant, {{best known as a}} culinary herb prominently featured in Italian cuisine, and also {{plays a major role in}} Southeast Asian cuisines of Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Taiwan. Depending on the species and cultivar, the leaves may taste somewhat like <b>anise,</b> with a strong, pungent, often sweet smell.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{botanicals}} or flavouring {{agents for}} gin, besides the required juniper, often include citrus elements, such as lemon and bitter orange peel, {{as well as}} a combination of other spices, which may include any of <b>anise,</b> angelica root and seed, orris root, licorice root, cinnamon, almond, cubeb, savory, lime peel, grapefruit peel, dragon eye (longan), saffron, baobab, frankincense, coriander, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cassia bark or others. The different combinations and concentrations of these botanicals in the distillation process cause the variations in taste among gin products.|$|E
25|$|Egg challah {{sometimes}} {{also contains}} raisins and/or saffron. After the first rising, {{the dough is}} rolled into rope-shaped pieces which are braided, though local (hands in Lithuania, fish or hands in Tunisia) and seasonal (round, sometimes with a bird's head in the center) varieties also exist. Poppy or sesame (Ashkenazi) and <b>anise</b> or sesame (Sephardic) seeds may {{be added to the}} dough or sprinkled on top. Both egg and water challah are usually brushed with an egg wash before baking to add a golden sheen.|$|E
