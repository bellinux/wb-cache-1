6000|$|The world {{exists for}} the {{education}} of each man. There is no age or state of society or mode of action in history to which there is not somewhat corresponding in his life. Every thing tends in a wonderful manner to abbreviate itself and yield its own virtue to him. He should see that he can live all history in his own person. He must sit solidly at home, and not suffer himself to be bullied by kings or empires, but know that he is greater than all the geography and all the government of the world; he must transfer the point of view from which history is commonly read, from Rome and Athens and London, to himself, and not deny his conviction that he is the court, and if England or Egypt have any thing to say to him he will try the case; if not, let them for ever be silent. He must attain and maintain that lofty sight where facts yield their secret sense, and poetry and annals are alike. The instinct of the mind, the purpose of nature, betrays itself in the use we make of the signal narrations of history. Time dissipates to shining ether the solid angularity of facts. No <b>anchor,</b> <b>no</b> cable, no fences avail to keep a fact a fact. Babylon, Troy, Tyre, Palestine, and even early Rome are passing already into fiction. The Garden of Eden, the sun standing still in Gibeon, is poetry thenceforward to all nations. Who cares what the fact was, when we have made a constellation of it to hang in heaven an immortal sign? London and Paris and New York must go the same way. [...] "What is history," [...] said Napoleon, [...] "but a fable agreed upon?"

60|$|After a {{while we}} moved. The water was about a foot deep, and the bottom clean white marl, with little patches of vegetation. Crabs and crab-holes were numerous. I saw a small shark {{and a couple of}} rays. When we got to the middle of a big flat I saw the big, white, glistening tails of {{bonefish}} sticking out of the water. We dropped anchor and, much excited, were about to make casts, when R. C. lost his hat. He swore. We had to pull up anchor and go get the hat. Unfortunately this scared the fish. Also it presaged a rather hard-luck afternoon. In fishing, as in many other things, if the beginning is tragedy all will be tragedy, growing worse all the time. We moved around up above where I had seen these bonefish, and there we dropped <b>anchor.</b> <b>No</b> sooner had we gotten our baits overboard than we began to see bonefish tails off at quite some distance. The thing to do, of course, was to sit right there and be patient, but this was almost impossible for us. We moved again and again, but we did not get any nearer to the fish. Finally I determined that we would stick in one place. This we did, and the bonefish began to come around. When they would swim close to the boat and see us they would give a tremendous surge and disappear, as if by magic. But they always left a muddy place in the water. The speed of these fish is beyond belief. I could not cast where I wanted to; I tried again and again. When I did get my bait off at a reasonable distance, I could feel crabs nibbling at it. These pests robbed us of many a good bait. One of them cut my line right in two. They seemed to be very plentiful, and that must be why the bonefish were plentiful, too. R. C. kept losing bait after bait, which he claimed was the work of crabs, but I rather believed it to be the work of bonefish. It was too windy for us to tell anything about the pressure of the line. It had to be quite a strong tug to be felt at all. Presently I felt one, and instead of striking at once I waited to see what would happen. After a while I reeled in to find my bait gone. Then I was consoled by the proof that a bonefish had taken the bait off for me. Another time three bonefish came along for my bait and stuck their tails up out of the water, and were evidently nosing around it, but I felt absolutely nothing on the line. When I reeled in the bait was gone.|$|E

The trust anchor therefore constitutes a single point of failure. This is not acceptable for mission-critical communication systems such as the future aeronautical telecommunications network that will support air traffic control communications.

40|$|An {{ever-increasing}} {{number of}} cables and pipelines are being {{laid on the}} bottom of lakes, channels, rivers, seas, and oceans. Various hazards threaten these pipelines and cables, which in case of occurrence can cause (severe) environmental and/or economic damage. Pipelines and cables can be protected against these attacks by dumping protective rock layers over the pipelines or cables. The main hazard concerning this research is the attack of a dragging anchor preceded by the cutting process of the anchor chain while dragged over / through the rock cover. For dragging anchors the effect of any lifting force is detrimental to its holding capacity. A good design of the rock cover can reduce the cutting of an anchor chain in the rock cover, resulting in an earlier lifting of the <b>anchor.</b> <b>No</b> generally applicable design tool exists for dimensioning these rock covers and especially in relation to anchor chains. Therefore the objective is set to find and test a theoretically based relation for the interaction between an anchor chain and a protective rock layer. The simplified solutions for describing the interaction between an anchor chain and clay are used as a basis for the interaction between the chain and rocks. The interaction forces are described as uniformly distributed forces in parallel and lateral directions of the anchor chain. There are several types of rock covers feasible but the loosely dumped rock cover on top of the existing seabed is chosen for this research. The bearing capacity of the rock berm is modelled as the bearing capacity of a strip footing on a shallow foundation. Since the bearing capacity equations do not provide information of loads in the lateral direction to the strip footing the formulas are adjusted to the research situation. A theoretical model with dimensionless normalized axis is used. The model describes a failure curve with all possible combinations of parallel and lateral forces applied to the rock berm by the anchor chain and normalised by the bearing capacity of the rock berm. A physical model has been designed to validate the theoretical model. In the physical model five different anchor chains have been dragged through three different sizes of rock covers with a few different constant anchor holding capacities. The forces {{on both sides of the}} rock cover are indirectly measured by the load cells on both sides of the model. The guiding wheels in the model cause significant friction in the model during dragging. In experiments without the presence of a rock cover a friction factor is determined to quantify the force loss over a guiding wheel. This friction factor lies within a range of 0. 10 <friction factor< 0. 16. It turned out that this friction factor has a major influence on every single data point when plotted in the theoretical model plot. However correlation is found between the data sets acquired by the experiments and the normalized failure curve presented above with the use of a semi-arbitrarily determined friction factor for each experiment. The semi-arbitrarily friction factor lies within the range specified above and is only changed when structural modifications to the model are made. The bearing capacity of the rock berm, which is mainly influenced by the effective width of the anchor chain and the internal friction angle of the rocks, only determines the location of the acquired data in the theoretical model plot. Different bearing capacities scale the dataset into the origin. Because of the uncertainty of the exact bearing capacity of the rock cover research on this subject is recommended. With the bearing capacity known the location of the acquired dataset on the theoretical normal plot can be determined. It is also recommended to do new physical model tests in which the forces on both sides of the rock berm can be directly measured eliminating the effect of friction in guiding wheels.

40|$|This Bachelor’s thesis “The Construction of Crime and Punishment in Estonian Television News Broadcasts” {{analyzes}} the news broadcasts {{of the three}} Estonian television channels, in order to clarify how crime and punishment is constructed in the news broadcasts. Three periods were analyzed: 20 - 26 August 2001, 29 October - 4 November 2001, and 21 - 27 January 2002. During the researched period the news programs of the three channels broadcasted a total of 521 news items prepared by the editors (not including foreign and sports news), to which five longer topic treatment {{in the second half}} of the Päevapeegel (Mirror of the Day) program on Kanal 2 are added. Using the critical discourse analysis method, a total of 57 TV news items (including news on criminal cases and those with a criminal context) are analyzed in the course of this paper. The “News on Criminal Cases” category consists of news items, which were related to specific criminal cases (proceedings) —alluded to by an event, the news item text or photo. The “News with a Criminal Context” includes the following types of news items: (1) the news item is not directly related to a criminal case, although the journalistic discourse gives the news item a criminal connotation (text, including word usage); (2) a sequel to a specific criminal case (an expansion of the topic); (3) the text of the news item refers to a possible crime, although the news item does not treat it; (4) crime and punishment themed stories, that is the news item is not directly connected to the event, but reports on the processes and trends in the field of activity. During the periods under observation, there were 31 news items related to criminal cases on the air, in which 20 different criminal cases were reported. There were a total of 7 court news items (on 5 different court proceedings). There were 26 news items with a crime context. A comparison of the analyzed weeks shows that TV news places a greater value on crime news than court news. Namely, the TV channels did not broadcast a single court report during the first analyzed week, and only two during the second week. In order to for the news sample to contain the necessary number of court stories, the analysis period had to be increased to three weeks. This range expresses the subject preferences and values of the events by TV channels. Having analyzed the TV news for three weeks, two basic approaches can be highlighted: - News focused on events: related mostly to the events in the beginning phases of a criminal proceedings; - News focused on individuals: news reporting on pre-trial proceedings (except for the start) and news reporting on court proceedings. Reporting of criminal events In the beginning phase of criminal proceedings (19 news items) TV news was focused on what happened. In legal discourse, we are dealing with a phase in which everything is still open or the investigation has not yet clarified what exactly happened and who the participants were. TV news provides an overview of what happened, describing this and showing the consequences. The news used information received from investigative institutions, alluding to it and/or quoting from it. In this phase, the most interviews were used. In addition to investigative institutions, witnesses were also heard from. In this phase, the existence of photos was of significant importance, of the event or its consequences. The occurrence was constructed in the news items on the principle: the event creates the news. Mostly, what happened was shown and a description of what happened was given (for instance, setting fires, explosions, accidents). These news items do not present strict legal discourses, but rather a story is told. Based on this, the majority of the news items failed to mention that a criminal proceeding had been started. Only once did the start of the criminal proceedings form the focus of the story. In the news items regarding the start of criminal proceedings, the press usually constructs what has happened as an accident, without providing it with a legal evaluation. This, however, means that news about accidents is already pre-valued by the TV channel, that is, they are reported irregardless of the legal context. This, however, clouds the concept and limits of a criminal act. I believe that none of the viewers doubt that the killing of another person is a criminal act, but do the viewers know that causing the death of a person in, for instance, a traffic accident is also accompanied by criminal liability? This is not explained by TV news. If, in the start of criminal proceedings phase, TV news refers to the suspect, then analysis shows that in the first mention this was definitely done with an accusatory undertone (naming the person as the one responsible for the event in a very definite tone of voice), and in the next mention the person is called the suspect. When referring to the suspect, no more than the first name and age is mentioned. Already naming the individual as definitely guilty in the suspect phase, or in one news item, naming the person first as a suspect and then as the one responsible for the act or the culprit, cannot be considered to be proper. In legal discourse, we are dealing with different states of the process: the suspect need not become the accused, and the accused need not become the guilty party. These are terms which should be used more exactly in the press. In one news item, the full name and age of the victim was mentioned, this cannot considered to be proper, since the victim was not a public figure. During the pre-trial investigation, the criminal case can be lengthened, ended, bail determined, etc. —this can be considered to be the pre-trial investigative phase. Reporting on these phases, the TV news became focused on individuals. This also pictorially. In these news items, the individuals connected to criminal cases are more important than the acts. From the analysis we can see that news items were often shortened to the point that the legal discourse in the news text became inaccurate, and for instance, from some of the news items it was not clear which specific individual was under suspicion and which specific act was being investigated. The information was provided from investigative institutions (usually the specific source was alluded to), which was usually the only source of information used. Of the analyzed news items, in only one case was the representative of the accused given the opportunity to speak. These news items were lacking substance regarding the status of the individual in the criminal proceeding process. The news items usually limited themselves to information that we are dealing with a criminal proceeding started against individual X. Whether the individual is recognized as a suspect or whether charges have been filed against him/her was not included in the news discourse. This however violates the presumption of innocence, because a person is labeled within a criminal context before the investigation is completed and a court resolution arrived at. Such news puts the person under so-called public pressure and connects them to a negative background. Such news is also characterized by the fact that archival material was used in the broadcasts to illustrate the text. This, however, emphasizes an individual-based approach even more. Reporting on court proceedings Court news was reported in only seven of 31 criminal news items, and of the seven, four reported on verdicts. During the analysis period, Kanal 2 did not report on a single criminal case or verdict. News items reporting on court discourse were also centered on individuals and were influential or persuasive regarding verdicts and/or public opinion. The news reporting on court verdicts focused on punishment. It should be added that only guilty verdicts were reported on. The news focused on the description of the crime and on what the investigative institutions had ascertained during the preliminary investigation. The extent of the punishment was also predicted in the news. Thereby, the news discourse places the accused into the role of a guilty party, which cannot be considered to be proper and ethical. In these news items, the TV news show the accused (mostly in a wide shot). From the analysis, it became clear that TV 3 constructs cases with verdicts with the emphasis on the decision, but the person of the accused is brought into focus. TV 3 news highlighted whether a person admitted his/her guilt or not, whether he/she regretted his/her act or not. In these stories, the position of the guilty party is described in such a way that one can get the impression that the criminal is not a criminal but “an unfortunate victim of fate. ” When reporting on court themes, ETV centered on investigative institutions, or bringing out the connection between the investigations’ results and verdicts was emphasized. The news format for criminal cases The start of criminal proceedings phase is characterized by the fact that they are usually prepared by an editor (reporter) and interviews are used. In these news items, pictures of what has happened (the consequences) are important. In the phases following the start of criminal proceedings, TV news uses a short news format. This means that the news is read by the <b>anchor,</b> <b>no</b> interviews are used, and pictorially, archival materials are used. Short news items are also characterized by the fact that they are centered on individuals and often shorten legal discourse to the point, that what the specific person is suspected of, or what specific act is being investigated is lost. Thereby the individual is emphasized and a negative context is created from his/her actions. Information sources for the news. From an analysis of the sources, it becomes clear that the news use information from the investigative institutions in all phases of the crime and administration of justice: providing an overview of what has happened and reflecting the results of the preliminary investigation. This is expressed in both the number of speaking participants and how much they are quoted. In the start of the criminal proceedings phase, the news also includes commentaries from witnesses. At the same time, from an analysis of the text, it becomes clear that quite often news without a direct source reference is presented. In these news items, an overview of what has happened, or the result of a preliminary investigation, is also presented. This raises the question, why is a specific source not quoted? Is this the result of shortening the news item or does one not wish to identify the information source. However, the volume of information from investigative institutions in TV news expresses the actual bent of the news content. TV news prefers to give the floor to investigative institutions that are in positions of power in a criminal proceeding rather than to the suspects, which creates a situation in which information supports the accusations and positions of investigative bodies and thereby sets the other party in an unequal position. News with a criminal context was analyzed separately in the paper. The analysis brought out stories in which a criminal context is created for a news item, or the journalistic discourse presents what has happened as a criminal news item. This is, in practice, accompanied by the accusation of a person in an action (calling it a crime) which in actuality is lacking a connection with a discourse of criminal law. An example is the news of the financing of the Tallinn Integration Project. In the news, the media started to search for corruption (by analyzing monetary allocations), since the chairman of the Tallinn City Council audit commission had alluded to this. In the news, the incident was called a “corruption scandal. ” However, by reporting on this news, the press became a political “plaything. ” Although the news was just reporting on the phase when the city was conducting an internal audit, the TV news primarily amplified the opinion of the audit commission. This shows the influence of the first source of information on the development of the news discourse. In the analyzed period, the visit of Elfraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, to Estonia was reported and its relationship with the possible connection of overseas Estonian Harry Männil to Nazi crimes. The topic was characterized as a type of crime and also by the fact that Zuroff accused an (overseas) Estonian. From the analysis it becomes clear, the TV news started to produce news based on Zuroff’s words, “I have new evidence regarding Männil’s guilt. ” It is important to emphasize that the press did not see the evidence, but the news started to evaluate its competency and trustworthiness. The press did not wait for the evaluation of the security police regarding the documents, but decided that “they contained nothing new” even before an official position was presented. This expresses one of the trends in media: news is produced even when there are no concrete facts beyond someone’s opinion. From an analysis of news with a criminal context, another trend in TV news becomes clear: the press does not connect events with specific criminal cases, that is, these are not placed in a legal context. Actually, the press does not pose the question: what is the present event connected to? This is expressed, for instance, in the news reporting on the Lada Petko case or the Hiiumaa air crash. Therefore, one of the primary problems in the discourse of TV news is an unduly individual-centered approach to the criminal process, in which the presumption of innocence is violated. A second problem that can be highlighted is that the attention of TV news is proportionally greater on the crime discourse than on recording the administration of justice. Thereby, TV news neglects one of its assignments, to offer the public a balanced and object treatment of what is happening in society. In the reporting of criminal proceedings, the main emphasis should be focused on the court proceeding phase, so that both the accused and the accuser can explain and defend their positions. Thereby individuals would not groundlessly attract the negative attention of the media in the suspect phase. During the analysis period, a Code of Criminal Procedure was in force which allowed for investigative results to be revealed only with the permission of the investigator and to the extent allowed by him/her. In the current Code of Criminal Procedure, only the prosecutor has the right to reveal investigative results. In order to evaluate whether the given change in legislation has been accompanied by an actual change in the news discourse, the analysis would have to be repeated. This analysis can provide the point of departure and comparison material for this...|$|E
