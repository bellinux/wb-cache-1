5|$|If the {{selectors}} are right, Egar is wrong, {{and if he}} {{is incapable}} of interpreting the laws correctly, he should not stand in first-class cricket. On the other hand if the selectors as a body threw Meckiff into this arena merely to be tested by the opinion of a single umpire, they <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> guilty of passing the buck, and of exposing both the bowler and the umpire to extreme embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of {{this idea}} point out that moralists during Bosch's era {{believed}} that it was woman'sultimately Eve'stemptation that drew men into a life of lechery and sin. This would explain why the women in the center panel <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> among the active participants in bringing about the Fall. At the time, the power of femininity was often rendered by showing a female surrounded by a circle of males. A late 15th-century engraving by Israhel van Meckenem shows a group of men prancing ecstatically around a female figure. The Master of the Banderoles's 1460 work the Pool of Youth similarly shows a group of females standing in a space surrounded by admiring figures.|$|E
25|$|There are {{curvature}} {{terms for}} the spatial {{components of the}} invariant interval as well, but the effects on planetary orbits and the like are tiny.

25|$|Taxis {{are very}} common and {{relatively}} accessible price-wise. They have different colours and fares in different cities, though a highly contrasted black-and-yellow design {{is common to}} the largest conurbations. Call-taxi companies (radio-taxis) are very common, while the remisse is another form of hired transport: they <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like call-taxis, but do not share a common design, and trip fares are agreed beforehand instead of using the meter. Although, there are often fixed prices for common destinations.|$|E
25|$|While {{standards}} {{that put the}} emphasis on operational reliability satisfy most users and the industry, certain groups of dedicated hobby modellers who were dissatisfied with the scale inaccuracies {{in the name of}} reliability have developed alternative scale standards where prototype proportions are maintained to the extent possible. These alternative standards are called finescale standards. Finescale standards <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> restricted to discerning hobbyists since, by definition, finescale model railways are generally less reliable and more expensive to manufacture, which makes them unsuitable for mass-production products.|$|E
25|$|In Singapore, {{language}} {{planning is}} associated with government planning. In this top-down approach, the government influences the acquisition of languages and their respective functions within the speech community through the education system. Language planning aims to facilitate effective communication within the speech community, which {{can result in a}} language shift or language assimilation. The goals of language planning <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> dependent on the political and social forces present in Singapore during two distinct periods: Colonisation by the British and the Post-Independence period after 1965.|$|E

25|$|Race flavolimbatus, Oberthür (The Andamans) – Closely {{resembles the}} dissimils form of clytia; differs as follows: {{both males and}} females {{distinctly}} larger, the white markings similar but proportionately larger, {{with the exception of the}} streaks in the discoidal cells of both forewings and hindwings, which are narrower and less firmly defined; on the hindwing there is a terminal row of ochraceous-yellow spots on the upper as well as on the underside, while those on the underside <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> larger than in P. clytia, dimorph dissimilis. The dark form clytia or any race of it is apparently unknown in the Andamans.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of rarity (perceived or known), condition, completeness and originality determines the price a collector {{is willing to}} pay for any given edition. Rarity arguably has the strongest influence on value as editions known to be very rare (e.g. those published in the periods when paper restrictions applied during both World Wars) <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> more expensive than comparable editions from the surrounding decades. Editions such as the 1916 containing the obituary and career details of W. G. Grace; 1934, detailing the 'Bodyline' series of 1932–33; 1949, the Australian 'Invincibles' tour of 1948; 1965, the first to have a yellow dust jacket: All are rare and expensive for specific reasons.|$|E
25|$|Scrapple is {{typically}} made of hog offal, {{such as the}} head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the broth to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned to the pot and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{a matter of the}} region and the cook's taste.|$|E

25|$|Gesualdo's {{published}} music {{falls into}} three categories: sacred vocal music, secular vocal music, and instrumental music. His most famous compositions are his six books of madrigals, published between 1594 and 1611, {{as well as}} his Tenebrae Responsoria, which <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like madrigals, except that they use texts from the Passion, a form (Tenebrae) used by many other composers. In addition to the works which he published, he left a large quantity of music in manuscript. This contains some of his richest experiments in chromaticism, as well as compositions in such contemporary avant-garde forms as monody. Some of these were products of the years he spent in Ferrara, and some were specifically written for the virtuoso singers there, the three women of the concerto di donne.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, {{supporters}} of fox hunting {{regard it as}} a distinctive part of British culture generally, the basis of traditional crafts and {{a key part of}} social life in rural areas, an activity and spectacle enjoyed not only by the riders but also by others such as the unmounted pack which may follow along on foot, bicycle or 4x4. They see the social aspects of hunting as reflecting the demographics of the area; the Home Counties packs, for example, are very different from those in North Wales and Cumbria, where the hunts <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the activity of farmers and the working class. The Banwen Miners Hunt is such a working class club founded in a small Welsh mining village, although its membership now is by no means limited to miners, with a cosmopolitan make up.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 Frank Sherwood Rowland, Chemistry Professor at the University of California at Irvine, and his {{postdoctoral}} associate Mario J. Molina {{suggested that}} long-lived organic halogen compounds, such as CFCs, might {{behave in a}} similar fashion as Crutzen had proposed for nitrous oxide. James Lovelock had recently discovered, during a cruise in the South Atlantic in 1971, that almost all of the CFC compounds manufactured since their invention in 1930 were still present in the atmosphere. Molina and Rowland concluded that, like , the CFCs would reach the stratosphere where they would be dissociated by UV light, releasing chlorine atoms. A year earlier, Richard Stolarski and Ralph Cicerone at the University of Michigan had shown that Cl is even more efficient than NO at catalyzing the destruction of ozone. Similar conclusions were reached by Michael McElroy and Steven Wofsy at Harvard University. Neither group, however, had realized that CFCs were a potentially large source of stratospheric chlorine—instead, they had been investigating the possible effects of HCl emissions from the Space Shuttle, which <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> smaller.|$|E

25|$|The Pelagornithidae had {{extremely}} thin-walled bones widely pneumatized {{with the}} air sac extensions of the lungs. Most limb bone fossils <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> crushed for that reason. In life, the thin bones and extensive pneumatization enabled the birds to achieve large size while remaining below critical wing loadings. Though 25kg/m2 (5lb/ft2) {{is regarded as the}} maximum wing loading for powered bird flight, there is evidence that bony-toothed birds used dynamic soaring flight almost exclusively: the proximal end of the humerus had an elongated diagonal shape that could hardly have allowed for the movement necessary for the typical flapping flight of birds; their weight thus cannot be easily estimated. The attachment positions for the muscles responsible for holding the upper arm straightly outstretched were particularly well-developed, and altogether the anatomy seems to allow for an ability of holding the wings rigidly at the glenoid joint unmatched by any other known bird. This is especially prominent in the Neogene pelagornithids, and less developed in the older Paleogene forms. The sternum had the deep and short shape typical of dynamic soarers, and bony outgrowths at the keel's forward margin securely anchored the furcula.|$|E
25|$|The {{last three}} days <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{connected}} and are sometimes described as a blur. The third day of the convention, June 20, 1969, began with tense conversations between RYM, RYM II, and PL who fought over how to proceed with SDS as a whole. The question of black nationalism {{and the role of}} women in SDS caused much disagreement. RYM thought that black nationalism was important and backed it, while RYM II merely agreed that it existed and PL very strongly opposed to it. Like black nationalism, when it came to the “matter of women’s liberation,” PL thought that it was more important for women to “focus upon the ‘class struggle’”. RYM disagreed, instead proposing that women’s focus be in “anti-imperialism and anti-racism,” but in a more prominent and powerful role. To PL’s beliefs, Bernardine Dohrn, Mike Klonsky, and others “responded by declaring that it was impossible to remain in the same organization with people who opposed self-determination in practice and demanded an immediate split”. After this, Dohrn “announced that she was walking out and invited all those who agreed with her to follow”.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} crafts made in the state, which are often distinguished by the use of certain materials and of certain designs. The best known of these is the carving of figures from ironwood (palo fierro in Spanish), which is a very dense, almost black wood that sinks in water. This wood was often used in braziers in the past because it would burn for a very long time. This carving is the specialty of the Yaquis and the Seris. Before it can be carved, this wood must be dried thoroughly, a process that can take up to five years. If this is not done, the wood takes on an ochre color, rather than its characteristic shiny near black. Objects made from this wood are almost always decorative in nature {{in a wide variety of}} shapes such as sahuaro and other cacti, eagles, turtles, dolphins and other flora and fauna of the state, along with crosses. The last is popular among indigenous groups as it is believed that such guard against the envy of others and other ills. Objects made of this wood <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in demand on the international market, but indigenous craftsmen cannot compete with factory made pieces.|$|E

25|$|There {{are eight}} {{boarding}} houses, nine {{including the one}} no longer in operation, on the campus. The houses are run by a small team of teachers. The House Master (HM) has overall responsibility and is helped by the Assistant House Master (AHM). Either or both of these will be present at the daily house meeting and will oversee homework to make sure pupils are studying. The HM will organise any special house events, decide who the house captain {{will be for the}} term as well as choosing a captain to take care of other house related goings on. The HM is also the person who most pupils would talk to if they had a problem although all teachers are available for help. Both the HM and the AHM normally have residences within the houses and so <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> part of the house. Each house has a matron who helps the pupils through their daily routine as well as a tutor to help the pupils in their studies. The year a pupil is in, and the amount of rooms in the house decides which pupils are allowed a room of their own, although it is normally decided that younger years share whilst senior pupils get their own rooms. All pupils rotate rooms each term.|$|E
