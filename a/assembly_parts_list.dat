40|$|The {{growing demand}} for food {{challenges}} our current farming methods, motivating the search for new paradigms for agricultural production. In this work, the GroBot is presented as an open-source model for the fourth agricultural revolution. This indoor cultivation system was fabricated to provide a replicable supply of produce, using modular parts that are easily to machine, assemble, and manufacture. Off-the shelf, low cost components and publically available designs ensure accessibility for the average person, enabling peer-produced knowledge and community participation. Networked data and software will further support the GroBot system, building off past maker movements like the RepRap 3 D printer and Linux operating system. The initial prototypes were optimized, evaluating the materials, structures, manufacturing, and assembly processes. A hardware <b>assembly</b> manual and <b>parts</b> <b>list</b> were created {{with the goal of}} mobilizing growers, farmers, and hackers to participate in iterative development and information sharing. Through its technological, biological, and social platform, the GroBot forms the foundation for the future of food at both the consumer and industrial scale. by Emma Feshbach. Thesis: S.

40|$|In modern {{assembly}} to order systems, {{components and sub-assemblies}} warehouse locations and dimensions are critical decisional variables since they can provide high flexibility level to assembly activities, reducing both handling and holding costs. The structural diversity between <b>assembly</b> <b>parts</b> concerning the components consumption, transportation and storing can largely influence the stoking policies [16]. The problem gets more complex if the correct physical location areas for common <b>assembly</b> <b>parts</b> must be chosen [12, 21]. The study in hand concerns components warehouse centralization/decentralization choices. The theoretical model proposed in this study involves multiple assembly lines destinations, with known locations and consumption rates for a given <b>assembly</b> <b>part.</b> The problem {{is to determine the}} number of decentralized supermarkets and their optimal locations in order to well service different assembly lines in a JIT environment. Specifically, the paper applies an innovative step by step decision-making procedure to support the decision-making of materials management policies: the model proposed considers materials morphological diversity, load unit transportation costs, load unit inventory costs, space availability for warehouses and supermarkets and the commonality degree between products families...|$|R
