5|$|Moira {{explains}} {{that while some}} ghosts in the house only wish for the living to suffer the same fates they did, other ghosts <b>are</b> <b>innocent</b> and {{do not wish to}} see any more bloodshed. The Harmons realize the house is a danger to those living in it and resolve to protect future residents by scaring them away. Both of Moira's ghostly forms (Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge) and other ghosts, including nurse Gladys (Celia Finkelstein), Beau (Sam Kinsey), the exterminator (W. Earl Brown), and the Black Dahlia (Mena Suvari), join the Harmons to protect the Ramoses, a new family that moved in, against malicious ghosts.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors <b>are</b> <b>innocent</b> and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with economic analyst and commentator Neil Cavuto on Fox News Channel, June 26, 2007, in speaking of income tax resistance, Paul said that he supports the right of those who engage in nonviolent resistance when they believe a law is unjust, bringing up the names of Martin Luther King, Jr., Lysander Spooner, and Mahatma Gandhi as examples of practitioners of peaceful civil disobedience; but he cautioned that those who do {{should be aware that}} the consequences could be imprisonment. He said that current income tax laws assume that people are guilty and they must then prove they <b>are</b> <b>innocent,</b> and he believes this aspect of tax law is unfair. However, he said that he prefers to work for improved tax laws by getting elected to Congress and trying to change the laws themselves rather than simply not paying the tax.|$|E

25|$|After a death {{sentence}} is affirmed in state collateral review, the prisoner may file for federal habeas corpus, which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts. Federal habeas corpus {{is a type of}} collateral review, and {{it is the only way}} that state prisoners may attack a {{death sentence}} in federal court (other than petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal habeas corpus is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal constitutional rights. Prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth new evidence that they <b>are</b> <b>innocent</b> of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling. According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death penalty cases are reversed through federal habeas corpus.|$|E
25|$|Furious {{at their}} escape, Leontes now {{publicly}} accuses {{his wife of}} infidelity, and declares that the child she is bearing must be illegitimate. He throws her in prison, over the protests of his nobles, and sends two of his lords, Cleomenes and Dion, to the Oracle at Delphos for what he is sure will be confirmation of his suspicions. Meanwhile, the queen gives birth to a girl, and her loyal friend Paulina takes the baby to the king, {{in the hopes that}} the sight of the child will soften his heart. He grows angrier, however, and orders Paulina's husband, Lord Antigonus, to take the child and abandon it in a desolate place. Cleomenes and Dion return from Delphos with word from the Oracle and find Hermione publicly and humiliatingly put on trial before the king. She asserts her innocence, and asks for the word of the Oracle to be read before the court. The Oracle states categorically that Hermione and Polixenes <b>are</b> <b>innocent,</b> Camillo an honest man, and that Leontes will have no heir until his lost daughter is found. Leontes shuns the news, refusing to believe it as the truth. As this news is revealed, word comes that Leontes' son, Mamillius, has died of a wasting sickness brought on by the accusations against his mother. Hermione, meanwhile, falls in a swoon, and is carried away by Paulina, who subsequently reports the queen's death to her heartbroken and repentant husband. Leontes vows {{to spend the rest of}} his days atoning for the loss of his son, his abandoned daughter, and his queen.|$|E

500|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{identify}} the influence of Kafka's legal background and the role of law in his fiction. Most interpretations identify aspects of law and legality as important in his work, in which the legal system is often oppressive. The law in Kafka's works, rather than being representative of any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces. These are hidden from the individual but control the lives of the people, who <b>are</b> <b>innocent</b> victims of systems beyond their control. Critics who support this absurdist interpretation cite instances where Kafka describes himself in conflict with an absurd universe, such as the following entry from his diary: ...|$|E
500|$|Kwame Opam at The Verge {{chose to}} examine rape {{and the nature}} of consent in the season. Comparing Jessica Jones to other {{television}} series that have depicted rape (Game of Thrones, Orange Is the New Black, and Outlander), Opam felt that [...] "since rape is one of the show’s core themes, we never need to see it... rape is a foundational part of the text, and its presence is constant. Even if it’s invisible, it’s always there." [...] He also felt the season took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means, especially in terms of power and consent, concluding, [...] "Jessica Jones moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating, rather than as spice for a story...Maybe we don’t need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is. Maybe our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all." [...] The Guardians Lili Loofbourow also discussed the season's depiction of rape and consent, noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act, and saying, [...] "however exceptional Kilgrave’s power seems, the moral quagmire it produces is all too common. It’s the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault. It’s the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets <b>are</b> <b>innocent.</b> It’s the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays “of her own free will”. It’s the condition of...any person, really, who agrees, whatever the context, to consent to forgo consent in the future." [...] Loofbourow also discussed the character of Simpson, comparing his power-inducing red pill to the anti-feminist [...] "red pillers", and noting that his taking of the pills [...] "renders him not just dangerously delusional, but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill’s effects." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thomson {{concedes that}} a third party indeed cannot make the choice to kill either the person being crushed or the child.

[...] To liken this to pregnancy, the mother can be thought to be the house, the fetus the growing-child. [...] In such a case, the mother’s life is being threatened, and the fetus is the one who threatens it. [...] Because for no reason should the mother’s life be threatened, and also for no reason is the fetus {{threatening}} it, both <b>are</b> <b>innocent,</b> and thus no third party can intervene. But, Thomson says, the person threatened can intervene, by which justification a mother can rightfully abort.|$|E

Kitazawa was inspired by pachinko machines, strongly associated with a [...] "dirty mood" [...] as they are gambling devices, however when seen outside of context <b>are</b> <b>innocent</b> game cabinets. Kitazawa felt that how the identity of what a pachinko machine is changes depending on the conceptions of people, and that this expressed the messages of the song well. Kitazawa {{was inspired by the}} chorus lyric identity ga nai to create a video primarily in grey sale, and focused much of the video on light and shadow. The Kino Flo fluorescent tubes used on the band performance scenes of the video were made to resemble fish bones, relating to the meaning of the band's name in Japanese.|$|E

2500|$|According to Harel, the {{civilian}} casualty ratio dropped steeply to 1:28 in late 2005, meaning one civilian killed for every 28 targets killed. Harel credited this {{drop to the}} new IAF chief Eliezer Shkedi's policies. The ratio rose again in 2006 to 1:10, a fact that Harel blamed on [...] "several IAF mishaps". However, in 2007 and 2008 the ratio dropped {{to a level of}} less than 1:30, or 2–3 percent of the total casualties being civilian. Figures showing an improvement from 1:1 in 2002 to 1:30 in 2008 were also cited by Jerusalem Post journalist Yaakov Katz. Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School stated that the 2008 figure of 1:30 represents the lowest civilian to combatant casualty ratio in history in the setting of combating terrorism. Dershowitz criticized the international media and human rights organizations for not taking sufficient note of it. He also argued that even this figure may be misleading because not all civilians <b>are</b> <b>innocent</b> bystanders.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{religious}} leaders denounced the attack. The Sephardi Chief Rabbi said [...] "I am simply ashamed that a Jew carried out such a villainous and irresponsible act", {{and suggested that}} he be buried outside the cemetery. His Ashkenazi counterpart, Yisrael Meir Lau, called it [...] "a desecration of God's name". Rabbi Yehuda Amital of Gush Etzion said Goldstein had [...] "besmirched the Jewish nation and the Torah". Some rabbis reacted with ambivalence to the massacre, and a few praised Goldstein and called his undertaking [...] "an act of martyrdom". In eulogizing Goldstein, Rabbi Israel Ariel called him a [...] "holy martyr", and questioned the innocence of the victims by claiming they {{were responsible for the}} massacre of Hebron's Jews in 1929. Rabbi Dov Lior of Kiryat Arba said he was a saint whose [...] "hands <b>are</b> <b>innocent,</b> his heart pure", and compared him to the martyrs of the Holocaust. At the time, settler rabbi Yitzhak Ginzburgh was the only prominent Orthodox rabbi who praised the massacre. He has since been detained several times for espousing extremist views.|$|E
