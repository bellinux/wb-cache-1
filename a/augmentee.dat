40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn assignment model is developed which considers augmentation probabilities when assigning Marine officers Military Occupational Specialties (MOSs) at The Basic School (TBS). The {{goal is to}} increase the expected number of <b>augmentees</b> in those MOSs that are chronically short in company and field grade officers. Results are compared to the current process of assigning MOSs based on a 'quality spread' achieved by dividing the TBS class and MOSs available into thirds and to a similar policy of division into halves. Regardless of the model used, the expected number of <b>augmentees</b> does not vary appreciably from the historical averages. Not adhering to the quality spread policy in the past has not impacted augmentation probabilities greatly. Dividing the class into halves vice thirds provides approximately the same expected number of <b>augmentees</b> as the current policy and would give more officers {{from the top of the}} class one of the their top choices. The only other change to assignment policy which may be warranted is restricting assignment for several MOSs (MOS 4002 -data processing, 7208 -air defense, and 7210 -air support) to assignment from the top third or half of the class[URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|R
