The President {{appoints}} as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, {{is likely}} to command the confidence {{of a majority of}} the MPs. This is <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>that</b> the President exercises in his personal discretion. The President then acts in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister to appoint other Ministers from among the Members of Parliament. These Ministers, together with the Prime Minister, form the Cabinet. The Cabinet has the general direction and control of the Government and is collectively responsible to Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume control}} of Jeremy, a sword-wielding, melee-focused character, and Alysa, who uses {{crossbows}} to deliver ranged attacks. The game {{can be played}} as a single player game, in which the player alternates between controlling Jeremy and Alysa, or as a local co-op game, in which two players play cooperatively, with one controlling each character. Blood Knights does not support online co-op. Like most hack and slash games, the control scheme is minimal. When controlling Jeremy, players can chain attacks using one button (the X button on the Xbox 360), and can use a number of special attacks that have a cooldown timer, including a heavy blow, a whirlwind attack, and <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>that</b> draws distant enemies to Jeremy. While controlling Alysa, the game functions as a twin-stick shooter, in which movement is controlled by one thumbstick or set of keys, and firing weapons {{is controlled by the}} other thumbstick or another set of keys. Alysa also has special attacks, including the ability to fire flaming arrows and a grenade attack. In single player gameplay, the player can switch between Jeremy and Alysa by pressing a button (the Y button on the Xbox 360). Players can transfer health, in the form of blood, between the two playable characters, healing one {{at the expense of the}} other.|$|E

25|$|Fractals are {{different}} from other geometric figures {{because of the way}} in which they scale. Doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its volume scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere resides in). But if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>that</b> is not necessarily an integer. This power is called the fractal dimension of the fractal, and it usually exceeds the fractal's topological dimension.|$|E
25|$|Bismarck {{was sixteen}} {{years older than}} Friedrich; before the latter became terminally ill, Bismarck did not expect he would live to see Wilhelm ascend to the throne and thus had no {{strategy}} to deal with him. Conflicts between Wilhelm and his chancellor soon poisoned their relationship. Their final split occurred after Bismarck tried to implement far-reaching anti-socialist laws in early 1890. The Kartell majority in the Reichstag, including the amalgamated Conservative Party and the National Liberal Party, was willing to make most of the laws permanent. However, it was split about the law granting the police the power to expel socialist agitators from their homes, <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>that</b> had been used excessively at times against political opponents. The National Liberals refused to make this law permanent, while the Conservatives supported only {{the entirety of the}} bill, threatening to and eventually vetoing the entire bill in session because Bismarck would not agree to a modified bill.|$|E
25|$|There, Leo is {{revealed}} as {{a son of}} Hephaestus, Piper as a daughter of Aphrodite and Jason as a son of Jupiter, though Hera tells him he is her champion. In the Aphrodite cabin, Piper is horrified {{to discover that the}} head councilor, Drew, is abusing her position as well as the rare gift of charmspeaking (which Piper also possesses) {{to take advantage of the}} other Aphrodite campers. In the Hephaestus cabin, it {{is revealed}} that Leo has the rare ability to conjure fire (<b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>that</b> has not been seen for centuries), but does not use nor tell anyone about it out of guilt about his mother's death seven years prior. Meanwhile, Jason finds out about his sister Thalia Grace, a demigod daughter of Zeus and a Hunter of Artemis. Shortly thereafter, the three are given a quest to rescue Hera from danger. In the woods, Leo discovers a mechanical bronze dragon (made by the Hephaestus campers long ago) that he names Festus (Happy) and starts to repair him. After encountering Boreas, Piper, Jason, and Leo soon discover that their enemies are working under orders from Gaea, the Greek primordial goddess of the Earth, to overthrow the gods. Throughout their journey, they run into three Cyclopes, Medea, Midas, and Lycaon and eventually manage to save Coach Hedge. Thalia and Jason meet each other for the first time since Jason was captured by Hera when he was an infant.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{revolves}} around a {{central theme of}} language—written and spoken, truth and myth—and the power inherent {{in all of its}} forms, <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>that</b> is often only present in the deconstruction of communication. González Echevarria argues that [...] "Dr. Francia's fear of the pasquinade, his abuse of [...] his constant worry about writing all stem from {{the fact that he has}} found and used the power implicit in language itself.

500|$|According to Lord Scarman, Zamir {{limited the}} scope of {{judicial}} review to the Wednesbury principle – in other words, the court will not intervene to quash a decision of a statutory authority unless it can be shown that the authority acted unreasonably. He held that although the principle is correct in appropriate circumstances, [...] "it cannot extend to interference with liberty unless Parliament has unequivocably enacted that it should". He emphasized that if Parliament wished to exclude judicial review of the exercise of <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>that</b> restrained liberty, [...] "it must make its meaning crystal clear". On the facts, since Parliament had not clearly expressed any intention to exclude judicial review of discretion exercised by the immigration authorities, the statutory provision in question fell within the precedent fact category. Ultimately, Khera's appeal was allowed as the authorities had not successfully demonstrated that he had obtained permission to enter the UK by deception. Conversely, since Khawaja had clearly deceived an immigration officer concerning his marital status, his appeal was dismissed.|$|E

500|$|Following the expedition, {{more than}} 1,100species of animal life, 212 of them {{previously}} unknown to science, were catalogued. However, {{there was no}} official acknowledgement from London, where {{under the influence of}} Markham the work of the SNAE tended to be ignored or denigrated. Its members were not awarded the prestigious RGS Polar Medals, which were bestowed on members of the Discovery Expedition when it returned home two months after Scotia. Polar Medals would also be awarded after each of Sir Ernest Shackleton's later expeditions, and after Douglas Mawson's Australasian expedition. Bruce fought unavailingly for years to right what he considered a grave injustice, a slight on his country and on his expedition. Some of the aversion of the London geographical establishment may have arisen from Bruce's overt Scottish nationalism, reflected in his own prefatory note to Rudmose Brown's expedition history, in which he said: [...] "While Science was the talisman of the Expedition, Scotland was emblazoned on its flag; and it may be that, in endeavouring to serve humanity by adding another link to the golden chain of science, we have also shown that the nationality of Scotland is <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>that</b> must be reckoned with".|$|E

In Bologna, the Argo II, the crew's trireme, is raided by the Kerkopes; Leo goes after them to retrieve his stolen Archimedes's sphere, and takes an agricultural book belonging to Triptolemus and an astrolabe made by Odysseus as recompense.

500|$|Several {{videos were}} {{intended}} to demonstrate the album's central theme of [...] "finding the beauty in imperfection". While working on [...] "Flawless", Beyoncé was reminded of her loss on television competition Star Search as a child, which she saw as a defining moment in her career, and believed that the competition had {{taught her how to}} embrace imperfection in the future. The theme was represented in the videos by the recurring use of trophies, which the singer saw as referencing [...] "all of the sacrifice I have made as a kid, all of the time that I lost". It was also carried into how the visuals were created, with the videos for [...] "Drunk in Love", [...] "Yoncé", [...] "No Angel", [...] "XO" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] shot without prior preparation, as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them. Noting some of the visuals' explicit content and exposure of her body, Beyoncé said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>that</b> women should have, and not lose after becoming a mother.

500|$|A {{predominant}} {{theme of}} the dictator novel is power, which according literary critic Michael Valdez Moses, in his 2002 review of Feast of the Goat, {{is linked to the}} theme of dictatorship: [...] "The enduring power of the Latin American dictator novel had {{everything to do with the}} enduring power of Latin American dictators". As novels such as El Señor Presidente became more well-known, they were read as ambitious political statements, denouncing the authority of dictators in Latin America. As political statements, dictator novel authors challenged dictatorial power, creating a link between power and writing through the force wielded by their pen. For example, in Roa Bastos's I, The Supreme, the novel revolves around a central theme of language and the power inherent in all of its forms, <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>that</b> is often only present in the deconstruction of communication. González Echevarría argues that: Dr. Francia's fear of the pasquinade, his abuse of Policarpo Patiño ..., [...] his constant worry about writing all stem from the fact that he has found and used the power implicit in language itself. The Supremo defines power as being able to do through others what we are unable to do ourselves: language, being separate from what it designates, is the very embodiment of power, for things act and mean through it without ceasing to be themselves. Dr. Francia has also realized that he cannot control language, particularly written language, that it has a life of its own that threatens him.|$|E
500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi {{who is a member}} of the astronomy club,Translated quote: [...] "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." [...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story. One of the sub-themes in the story is magic.Translated quote: [...] "If you could use sorcery, what do you think would happen?" [...] Uraha, Yukito's mother,Translated quote: [...] "I had inherited the ability to control puppets without touching them from my mother." [...] and Yukito himselfTranslated quote: <b>A</b> <b>power</b> <b>that</b> can move a puppet without touching it. To me, it's a power that's nothing out of the ordinary.
