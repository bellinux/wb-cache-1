5|$|A 1990 study {{claimed that}} {{diazepam}} has <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> misuse potential {{relative to other}} benzodiazepines, and that some data suggests that alprazolam and lorazepam resemble diazepam in this respect.|$|E
5|$|A Scottish {{study showed}} that {{mortality}} in common house martins occurred mostly outside the breeding season and averaged 57%. Females that had raised two clutches in a season had <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> mortality than those that were single-brooded, {{but there was no}} such correlation for the males.|$|E

50|$|Although {{an engine}} with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> design T1 has <b>a</b> <b>high</b> {{corrected}} flow at low T1 conditions, the SOT is low, {{resulting in a}} poor net thrust. Only at high T1 conditions is there the combination of <b>a</b> <b>high</b> corrected flow and <b>a</b> <b>high</b> SOT, to give good thrust characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} heuristic is {{the differential}} speed, which controls cake transport. <b>A</b> <b>high</b> differential speed would {{give rise to}} <b>a</b> <b>high</b> solids throughput. <b>A</b> <b>high</b> differential speed also reduces cake residence time.|$|R

5|$|Activity {{gradually}} declined {{over the}} next two years but stabilized at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> level than before 1975. The increased level of fumarolic activity has continued at Mount Baker since 1975, but no other changes suggest that magma movement is involved.|$|E

5|$|Alprazolam {{and other}} benzodiazepines may also cause the {{development}} of physical dependence, tolerance, and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment. There is <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> chance of withdrawal reactions if the drug is administered in <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> dosage than recommended, or if a person stops taking the medication altogether without slowly allowing the body to adjust to a lower-dosage regimen.|$|E
5|$|Although {{cardiovascular}} risk factors, such as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, {{are associated}} with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> risk of onset and course of AD, statins, which are cholesterol lowering drugs, have not been effective in preventing or improving {{the course of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|Beef is an {{excellent}} source of zinc, selenium, phosphorus, iron, and B vitamins. Bison meat is lower in fat and cholesterol than beef, but has <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> protein content.|$|E

30|$|Urban {{sustainability}} {{is defined}} as a multi-layered concept and aesthetics is equally important as economic viability or ecological value, not more or less important. Sustainability is not similar to environmental quality. <b>A</b> <b>high</b> environmental quality only does not guarantee <b>a</b> <b>high</b> sustainability. Similarly, <b>an</b> urban environment with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> environmental quality or <b>a</b> <b>high</b> economic value, but without beauty is also not sustainable.|$|R

5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E
