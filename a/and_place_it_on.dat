This is more difficult than the regular Australian Rescue challenge because the participants must construct a device to secure the object and lift it onto the platform.|$|E

According to the Florentine Codex, Lib. 12, f.6r., Moctezuma also ordered that his {{messengers}} carry the highly symbolic penacho (headdress) of Quetzalcoatl de Tula to Cortés <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his person. As news about the strangers reached the capital city, Moctezuma became increasingly fearful and considered fleeing the city but resigned himself to what he {{considered to be the}} fate of his people.|$|E

25|$|Before eating, most dining places provide {{either a}} {{hot or cold}} towel or a plastic-wrapped wet napkin (o-shibori). This is for {{cleaning}} hands before eating (and not after). It is rude {{to use them to}} wash the face or any part of the body other than the hands, though some Japanese men use their o-shibori to wipe their faces in less formal places. Accept o-shibori with both hands when handed the towel by a server. When finished, fold or roll up the oshibori <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the table. It is impolite to use o-shibori towels to wipe any spills on the table.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, Kemper has {{continued}} to display potentially threatening behavior. [...] On one occasion, when Douglas' colleague Robert Ressler was in a cell alone with Kemper, Kemper—who at the time weighed —noticed the apprehension in Ressler after he had pressed a hidden button repeatedly to call a guard to open the cell yet not received a response and told him [...] "Relax. They're changing the shift," [...] but remarked: [...] "If I went apeshit in here, you'd be {{in a lot of}} trouble, wouldn't you? I could screw your head off <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the table to greet the guard." [...] Ressler verbally sparred with Kemper until the guard arrived, ultimately leaving unharmed with Kemper displaying no physical aggression. Kemper also stated afterwards that he was joking, but Ressler never entered a cell alone again with Kemper and it became FBI policy to interview serial killers in pairs.|$|E
500|$|The death-lay's {{version of}} the bishop's death was {{different}} from the vita. The bishop's killer was called Lalli. Lalli's wife Kerttu falsely claimed to him that upon leaving the manor, their ungrateful guest Henry, travelling around on his own in the middle of winter, had without permission or recompense, through violence, taken food, cake from the oven and beer from the cellar, for himself and hay for his horse, and left nothing but ashes. This is supposed to have enraged Lalli so that he immediately grabbed his skis and went in pursuit of the thief, finally chasing Henry down on the ice of Lake Köyliönjärvi. There he killed him on the spot with an axe. Lalli then proceeded to steal the late holy man’s hat, called a mitre, <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his own head. When Lalli’s mother questioned him about where he found the hat, he attempted to take it off, but with it came his scalp. Lalli then died a painful death.

500|$|Vancouver won {{the first}} game of the series in Chicago 2–1 in double overtime, but fell behind in game two 3–1. During the game the Canucks felt that referee Bob Myers was making {{questionable}} calls against them. A series of events in the third period ignited tempers. First, Vancouver had a goal disallowed. Soon after, there was a perceived non-call against Chicago, followed by a fourth consecutive penalty called against the Canucks. Denis Savard scored on the power play to put the Black Hawks up 4–1. This enraged the Canucks' bench. Assistant coach Ron Smith yelled out [...] "We give up, we surrender, we give up." [...] Williams suggested to Neilson that he throw sticks onto the ice in protest. Neilson noted that he had done that before, and he had a better idea. He proceeded to take a white towel <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the end of a hockey stick holding it up in a mock surrender; some of the Canucks' players followed suit.Neilson was ejected from the game along with two players. Vancouver goaltender, Richard Brodeur later noted that although they lost the game the atmosphere in the dressing room was so positive it was as if they had won.|$|E
500|$|Food {{was mostly}} served on plates or in stew pots, and diners would take their share from the dishes <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> trenchers of stale bread, wood or pewter {{with the help}} of spoons or bare hands. In lower-class {{households}} it was common to eat food straight off the table. Knives were used at the table, but most people were expected to bring their own, and only highly favored guests would be given a personal knife. A knife was usually shared with at least one other dinner guest, unless one was of very high rank or well-acquainted with the host. Forks for eating were not in widespread usage in Europe until the early modern period, and early on were limited to Italy. Even there {{it was not until the}} 14th century that the fork became common among Italians of all social classes. The change in attitudes can be illustrated by the reactions to the table manners of the Byzantine princess Theodora Doukaina in the late 11th century. She was the wife of Domenico Selvo, the Doge of Venice, and caused considerable dismay among upstanding Venetians. The foreign consort's insistence on having her food cut up by her eunuch servants and then eating the pieces with a golden fork shocked and upset the diners so much that there was a claim that Peter Damian, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, later interpreted her refined foreign manners as pride and referred to her as [...] "...the Venetian Doge's wife, whose body, after her excessive delicacy, entirely rotted away." [...] However this is ambiguous since Peter Damian died in 1072 or 1073, and their marriage (Theodora and Domenico) took place in 1075.|$|E

[...] The piece {{is now part of}} the forces controlled by that player. This is termed dropping the piece, or just a drop.|$|E

2500|$|As well as altars in the {{structural}} sense, it became customary in the West {{to have what}} in Latin were referred to as altaria portatilia (portable altars), more commonly referred to in English as [...] "altar stones". When travelling, a priest could take one with him <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> an ordinary table for saying Mass. They were also inserted into the centre of structural altars especially those made of wood. In that case, it was the altar stone that was considered liturgically to be the altar. The Pontificale Romanum contained a rite for blessing {{at the same time}} several of these altar stones. In the East the antimension served and continues to serve the same purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Ford {{grew up in}} an {{extended}} family of farmers in Wayne County a few miles from Detroit, Michigan in the late 19th century. At the time, farm work was extremely arduous, because on the typical farm virtually nothing could get done without manual labour or animal labour as the motive power. As his interest in automobiles grew, he also expressed a desire to [...] "lift the burden of farming from flesh and blood <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> steel and motors." [...] In the early 20th century, he began to build experimental tractors from automobile components. Four years after founding the Ford Motor Company in 1903, Ford finished his first experimental tractor in 1907 on Woodward Avenue in Detroit, referring to it as the [...] "Automobile Plow". Approximately 600 gasoline-powered tractors were in use on American farms in 1908. Fordson tractor design was headed by Eugene Farkas and József Galamb, both involved {{in the design of the}} successful Ford Model T automobile.|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the service, {{the priest}} and deacon, {{accompanied}} by acolytes with candles and incense, bring the Epitaphios in procession from the Holy Table {{into the center of the}} church <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a table which is often richly decorated for that purpose. [...] The Gospel Book is laid on top of the epitaphios. In some Greek churches, an elaborately carved canopy, called a kouvouklion, stands over the Epitaphios. This bier or catafalque represents the Tomb of Christ, and is made of wood, usually elaborately carved. On Good Friday morning, the bier is decorated with spring flowers, mostly white, red, and purple, until it is covered by the flowers in its entirety. [...] The Tomb is often sprinkled with flower petals and rosewater, decorated with candles, [...] and ceremonially censed as a mark of respect. The bells of the church are tolled, and in traditionally Orthodox countries, flags are lowered to half-mast. Then the priest and faithful venerate the Epitaphios as the choir chants hymns. In Slavic churches, the service of Compline will be served next, during which a special Canon will be chanted which recalls the lamentations of the Theotokos.|$|E

2500|$|Dillahunt took {{inspiration}} from Andrew Cunanan, {{the man who}} killed Gianni Versace, when he recalled the brutality in which Cunanan murdered a man just for his car. Dillahunt recalls how an FBI profiler noted that this type of rage is typically directed toward someone the perpetrator knows, yet Cunanan managed to pull some element from his own life <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> this random person who attempted to stand his ground against the would-be carjacker. To Dillahunt, that was how he wanted to approach Krug. To him, Mari actually shows that she is not afraid of Krug, which causes him to go [...] "crazy". That being said, the actor felt like the scene where his character rapes Mari was {{one of the hardest things}} emotionally to film. He notes that part of him was happy that Sara Paxton was cast as Mari, because they had worked together in the past, so they knew each other. On the other hand, he felt uncomfortable acting out such a scene with a person he considered to be a friend. Paxton echoed his sentiments to Craven, who stated the actress expressed to him a greater feeling of trust that the person who would have to do these [...] "horrible" [...] things to her was someone she knew, and as a result made them at least partially more bearable to act.|$|E
