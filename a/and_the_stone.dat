5|$|Although it {{was popular}} with {{travelling}} vendors, particularly of small fancy goods, {{the maintenance of}} the market cross was costly and unpopular with Norwich's citizens. In 1732 the cross was demolished, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> was sold for £125. In 2005 the base of the cross was rediscovered in excavations during renovation of the market area, but has since been re-covered. Its site is now outlined in red stones embedded in the market floor.|$|E
5|$|Following his assassination, many {{associates}} of Elagabalus {{were killed or}} deposed, including his lover Hierocles. His religious edicts were reversed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> of Elagabal {{was sent back to}} Emesa. Women were again barred from attending meetings of the Senate. The practice of damnatio memoriae—erasing from the public record a disgraced personage formerly of note—was systematically applied in his case.|$|E

5|$|The {{foundations}} of the last mansio built at the site, and its associated bath-house, were uncovered by archaeologists in 1912–13.

This work left, in some lower stratified levels, traces of the two earlier wooden mansiones.|$|E
5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone,</b> which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E
5|$|Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle {{relates to}} the nine {{phenomena}} that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; {{the water from the}} tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt {{in the direction of the}} Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.|$|E

After this, Takua is threatened by Makuta, and abandons Jaller {{in an attempt to}} shield him. Makuta then releases three more Rakhshi, who attack the Earth village of Onu-Koro as Takua arrives. Tahu, Kopaka, Lewa and Gali arrive to help the Earth Toa Onua <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Toa Pohatu: during the battle, Tahu is further corrupted and goes insane, forcing the Toa to capture him and flee. Takua decides to rejoin Jaller, while Gali and the other Toa purge the Rakhshi poison from Tahu, resulting in his reconciliation with Gali.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Ottoman Turkish {{architecture}} {{are located}} in the Old Bazaar. Mosques in Skopje are usually simple in design, with a square base and a single dome and minaret. There entrance is usually emphasised by a portico, as on Mustafa Pasha Mosque, dating from the 15th century. Some mosques show some originality in their appearance: Sultan Murad and Yahya Pasha mosques have lost their dome and have a pyramidal roof, while Isa Bey mosque has a rectangular base, two domes and two side wings. The Aladža Mosque was originally covered with blue faience, but it disappeared in the 1689 Great Fire. However, some tiles are still visible on the adjoining türbe. Other Turkish public monuments include the 16th-century clock tower, a bedesten, three caravanserais, two Turkish baths <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Bridge, first mentioned in 1469.|$|E
5|$|Other masks provide {{situational}} benefits. For example, the Great Fairy's Mask helps retrieve stray fairies {{scattered throughout}} the four temples, the Bunny Hood allows Link to run faster, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Mask renders Link invisible to most non-playable characters and enemies. Less valuable masks are usually involved only in optional side-quests or specialized situations. Examples include the Postman's Hat, which grants Link access to items in mailboxes, and Kafei's Mask, which initiates a long side-quest to receive the Couple's Mask.|$|E

5|$|Several {{buildings}} were constructed {{on the summit}} during the Saxon and early medieval periods; they have been interpreted as an early church and monks' hermitage. The head of a wheel cross dating from the 10th or 11th century has been recovered. The original wooden church was destroyed by an earthquake in 1275, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> Church of St Michael built on the site in the 14th century. Its tower remains, {{although it has been}} restored and partially rebuilt several times. Archaeological excavations during the 20th century sought to clarify the background of the monument and church, but some aspects of their history remain unexplained. The Tor is mentioned in Celtic mythology, particularly in myths linked to King Arthur, and has a number of other enduring mythological and spiritual associations.|$|E
5|$|The abbey {{was founded}} in the 7th or 8th century, damaged by Viking raids and rebuilt and refounded in the 10th century. It owned and managed local land. The {{buildings}} were expanded from the 12th to 16th centuries until its dissolution in 1538. Most of the buildings were demolished <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> used in local buildings, although the Abbot's House and reredorter survive. Some of the tiles and other decorative features from the monastic church were reused in the adjacent parish Church of St Peter and St Paul. Since 1927 the ruins have been in public ownership.|$|E
5|$|The chapel {{underwent}} a two-year, $10 million restoration between 2000 and 2002. Despite {{the complexity of}} the work, the chapel remained open throughout the restoration.

At the time, two experts working on the stained glass restoration called it the largest such project that had ever been undertaken in the United States; too large for a single studio, it was divided among studios in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York.|$|E

5|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Ypres were well {{prepared for a}} siege {{by the time the}} English and their allies arrived and attacked the city on 8 June 1383. Dwellings in the outlying suburbs had been abandoned; the timber from them was used to strengthen the earth ramparts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> gates of the city. A mission had been dispatched to Paris to replace artillery powder stocks. The city was well organised under the command of the Castellan of Ypres, John d'Oultre, and had been divided into different defensive sectors. Although the ramparts were low, they were well protected with a double wet ditch, a high thorny hedge reinforced with stakes and a wooden stockade and fire-step.|$|E
5|$|The priory prospered {{until the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540, {{when it was}} {{abolished}} along with England's other monastic communities. The priory buildings were demolished <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> re-used in other buildings in Guisborough. The east end of the priory church was left standing with its great window forming a distinctive arch, a well-known landmark used as a symbol for Guisborough. It {{became part of the}} estate of the Chaloner family, who acquired it in 1550. The east window was preserved by them as part of a Romantic vista adjoining their seat, Gisborough Hall, from which the priory takes its idiosyncratically spelled name. It is owned by the Chaloners but is in the care of English Heritage as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|The straight, {{symmetrical}} stone columns {{found in}} the Polonnaruwa Vatadage are quite similar to those seen in buildings of the Anuradhapura period. The foot of each column is carved {{in the shape of}} a lotus flower. Archaeologist Senarath Paranavithana has suggested that these stone columns had supported a wooden roof. This is widely accepted, and nails and roof tiles found in excavations seem to support this. However, another theory is that the Vatadage did not have a roof, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> columns were used to hang lamps, curtains or Buddhist symbols.|$|E

5|$|The {{walls of}} Caernarfon were {{built at the}} same time as the castle, under the overall {{supervision}} of Master James of Saint George, Edward's chief architect in North Wales. Between 1283 and 1284, Richard the Engineer acted as James' deputy on the site; later, between 1295 and 1308, Walter of Hereford performed a similar role, and may have also been responsible for earlier work on the walls as well. Huge amounts of labourers were mobilised from across England for the task, massed at Chester and then brought into Wales for each summer building season. Work on the walls progressed quickly, albeit in uneven bursts: local houses were demolished to make way for the fortifications <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> walls and gates were probably finished by 1292. The cost of building the town walls was around £3,500, a large sum for the period.|$|E
5|$|Thompson has a keen {{interest}} in music and has played the guitar for several years. He often takes the instrument to work with him, as a means of occupying himself during takes. The actor is part of a group: the Rusholme Ruffians, formed by himself and two of his fellow schoolmates while they were still at Radcliffe Riverside High. The Rusholme Ruffians have performed at venues throughout the UK and the band's set list includes their own material, as well as songs by home-town influences such as Morrissey, The Smiths, Oasis, James <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Stone</b> Roses. Thompson has expressed an interest in getting into the music industry later in life.|$|E
5|$|All {{seventeen}} of the confirmed {{heads in}} the Olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains {{are the source of}} the stone for the monuments. These boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes, which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads. Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head. The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head1 and Nestepe Colossal Head1 (also known as Tres Zapotes MonumentsA andQ) came from the same hill.|$|E
