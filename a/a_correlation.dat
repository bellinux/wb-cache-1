40|$|The {{notion that}} there is <b>a</b> {{positive}} <b>correlation</b> between teaching and research has been challenged {{over the last three}} decades. Some studies have claimed that teaching and research are activities independent from each other. Other studies have found <b>a</b> negative <b>correlation</b> between the two activities. Consequently, the existence of <b>a</b> positive <b>correlation</b> between teaching and research cannot be taken as a given. This article contends that <b>a</b> positive <b>correlation</b> between teaching and research is possible, {{but it has to be}} constructed through the deliberate adoption of active strategies. Such <b>a</b> positive <b>correlation</b> is only possible with institutional support. The article examines the literature regarding the nexus between teaching and research and identifies the various arguments for and against the existence of <b>a</b> positive <b>correlation</b> between the two. The article then describes how <b>a</b> positive <b>correlation</b> between teaching and research can be deliberately achieved by clarifying the meanings of teaching, research and the relationship between the two. Lastly, the article proposes some active strategies that can be used to enhance the positive correlation between teaching and research within the discipline of law...|$|R

In Georgia, crayfish accounted for two-thirds of the prey in the summer diet, and their remnants were present in 98% of the summer spraint.

5|$|The {{cause of}} {{rumination}} syndrome is unknown. However, studies have drawn <b>a</b> <b>correlation</b> between hypothesized causes {{and the history}} of patients with the disorder. In infants and the cognitively impaired, the disease has normally been attributed to over-stimulation and under-stimulation from parents and caregivers, causing the individual to seek self-gratification and self-stimulus due to the lack or abundance of external stimuli. The disorder has also commonly been attributed to a bout of illness, a period of stress in the individual's recent past, and to changes in medication.|$|E

The results indicated {{that in terms of}} Acculturation, Hmong ranked highest in integration, then separation, assimilation, and lastly marginalization. Questions on each dimension of integration, separation, assimilation, and marginalization were analyzed and positive correlations were found between the youngest of the generations, the length of residency in the United States, and the ability to speak, read, and write in English. In contrast, the older the age of the participant when they came to the United States had <b>a</b> positive <b>correlation</b> with separation. The ability to speak, read, and write in English had <b>a</b> positive <b>correlation</b> with assimilation, and the older the age of coming to the United States had <b>a</b> positive <b>correlation</b> with marginalization.

While this {{alone does not}} prove that Stylidium species are themselves carnivorous, the hypothesis is that the association arose because Stylidium species and the known carnivorous plants obtain scarce nutrients using the same source, namely captured insects. Preliminary proof is given that the trapping mechanisms of two associated plants are the same (the tentacles of Byblis and Drosera), though this may be only a coincidence and further research must be done.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the link}} between {{performance}} in chess and general intelligence is often assumed, researchers have largely failed to confirm its existence.

5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} <b>a</b> <b>correlation</b> between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E

Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so that coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{studying}} the horses rate their body condition {{on a scale}} of one (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone. The horses tend to remain in above average condition, despite the harsh environment in which they live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through <b>a</b> <b>correlation</b> to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites.
