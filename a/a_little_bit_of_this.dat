He then moved from the United States to Salzburg, Austria to play professional American football, before returning to become a pilot flying F-16s for the Air National Guard, as well as an instructor pilot with Duluth's 179th Fighter Squadron. His second publication, and first novel, Unknown Rider (1995), was a fictional manifestation of his experience achieving the title “Fighter Pilot”. He summed up his writing process saying, “When I was training to fly the F-16 at Kingsley Field in Oregon, each evening, after a day of flying fighters, I sat down and typed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> book… All I had to do was invent a few characters, put them in an airplane, and make them the heroes of the stories that filled the air.” ...|$|E

50|$|Parish's most {{well-known}} character, Amelia Bedelia, is extremely literal minded and interprets idioms and other verbal expressions literally, which amusingly causes great havoc in each story. This idea originated in conversations between Parish and Greenwillow Books founder Susan Hirschman about the author's observations of her third grade students. Amelia {{works as a}} household cook and occasional servant, jobs that Parish did in her home when she was young. She uses no recipes, but, by intuitively combining <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{and a little bit}} of that, her cakes and cookies and meals are always delicious. She is such a good cook that her employers cannot fire her, despite the disastrous way she misinterprets their instructions: prune the shrubs, scale and ice the fish, file the letters, run over the tablecloth with an iron, shorten these dresses, serve coffee with porridge, heat a can of soup, and so on. The author's word-play, and Amelia Bedelia's fundamental goodness and childlike simplicity appeal to youngsters who are beginning to see and enjoy more than one meaning in a word or a phrase.|$|E
5000|$|Cyrus [...] "CyFi" [...] Finch age 15, is {{introduced}} just after Lev {{is separated from}} Risa and Connor. This character helps Lev learn to scavenge for food in the food courts of malls. Not much is known about him at first, other than he's a proud Umber. [...] "Umber" [...] is explained in the book as a word invented to describe blacks. The inventor of the word was [...] "this artist dude - mixed-race himself, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> {{a little bit of}} that". CyFi explains that the artist painted darker skin tones with a paint named [...] "Umber," [...] and that [...] "it just stuck". Later on, the reader learns that CyFi was originally a storked child who was taken in by two fathers. Unlike Connor, Risa, and Lev, CyFi is not an Unwind. Rather, he ran away from his family because the thoughts from an Unwind's temporal lobe, which he received after a car accident, spontaneously took over his own thoughts. Because part of his brain once belonged to an Unwind, CyFi considers himself one-eighth Tyler, the Unwind, and seven-eighths himself. He describes himself as an ancestor of the 'Deep South' - this later shows the reader the difference/changing between Cyrus and Tyler. Tyler was Unwound because of his constant stealing, and we learn that the part of his brain that he is alive in, Tyler does not understand that he is no longer living in his own body. CyFi's case is unusual because brain transplants are normally done with tiny pieces from multiple donors. However, CyFi's fathers paid off a doctor to acquire one full piece of the temporal lobe. This helps CyFi maintain his high IQ, but also results in compulsive orders from the donor. Cyrus constantly fights between the disorder he is now dealing with (kleptomania) and being himself. Also, because of the portion of the brain he received, he often feels Tyler's emotions and, on rare occasions, swears he can actually even see the boy in the mirror.|$|E
