25|$|Of all the Australian possums, the rock-haunting {{ringtail}} possum {{lives in}} the most tightly knit family groups. Adults and their young will stay within 2–3 metres of each other throughout the night. The family groups are generally made up of about 4 individuals, although group sizes of 2 to 10 individuals have been reported. The possum spends most of its time sheltered within rock piles or crevices. After dark it moves from its rocky home into the nearby trees where it feeds. This possum is secretive, difficult to trap and avoids contact and confrontation as far as possible. It is primarily terrestrial, moving into the trees only to feed. This distinguishes it from its close, mostly arboreal relatives. Its eye-shine is very bright in a spotlight but unlike most possums, it doesn't freeze when caught in <b>a</b> <b>bean</b> of light. Instead, it retreats to its rock shelter or crevices where it hides with its head in the crevice but its body exposed.|$|E
500|$|In his {{preface to}} the second volume of Tales and Stories (1863) Andersen claims to have heard the story in his childhood, but the tale {{has never been a}} {{traditional}} one in Denmark.

Prior to its {{incorporation}} {{as a city}} in July 1963, the area which is now Coral Springs was part of [...] of marshy lands bought by Henry Lyons between 1911 and 1939. After several floods in 1947, Florida created the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District (now the South Florida Water Management District). Canals and levees drained much of the area upon which Coral Springs was built. After the land was drained and cleared, most of the area was used as <b>a</b> <b>bean</b> farm. After Lyons' death in 1952, his heirs changed the focus to cattle.|$|E

500|$|John Gregorson Campbell {{was born}} near Loch Linnhe at Kingairloch, Argyll in 1836, the fourth child and second son of Helen MacGregor and Captain Campbell, an {{officer for the}} ship Cygnet.

500|$|Peng {{was born}} in 1898 {{in the village of}} Shixiang, Xiangtan County, Hunan. His {{personal}} name at birth was [...] "Dehua". Peng's family lived in a thatched-straw hut and owned approximately 1.5 acres of irrigated land, on which the family grew bamboo, sweet potatoes, tea, cotton, and various vegetables. His father also operated <b>a</b> <b>bean</b> curd shop. The income from the land and shop supported an extended family of eight people, including Peng, his three brothers, his parents, his grandmother, and a grand-uncle. Peng's grand-uncle had joined and fought for the Taiping rebellion, and used to tell Peng about the old Taiping ideals: that everyone should have enough food to eat, that women should not bind their feet, and that land should be redistributed equally. Peng later described his own class background as [...] "lower-middle peasant".|$|E
500|$|Tales {{of extreme}} {{sensitivity}} are infrequent in world culture {{but a few}} have been recorded. The 11th-century Kathasaritsagara by Somadeva tells {{of a young man}} who claims to be especially fastidious about beds. After sleeping in a bed on top of seven mattresses, and newly made with clean sheets, the young man rises in great pain. A crooked red mark is discovered on his body, and upon investigation a hair is found on the bottom-most mattress of the bed. [...] An Italian tale called [...] "The Most Sensitive Woman" [...] tells of a woman whose foot is bandaged after a jasmine petal falls upon it. The Brothers Grimm included a [...] "Princess on the Pea" [...] tale in an edition of their Kinder- und Hausmärchen, but removed it after they discovered that it belonged to the Danish literary tradition. A few folk tales feature a boy discovering a pea or <b>a</b> <b>bean</b> assumed to be of great value. After the boy enters a castle and is given a bed of straw for the night he tosses and turns in his sleep, attempting to guard his treasure. Some observers are persuaded that the boy is restless because he is unaccustomed to sleeping on straw, and is therefore of aristocratic blood.|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Meades ate at The Restaurant for The Times in late 1993, {{and noted}} the {{evolution}} of some dishes and sauces from White's days at Harveys. These included making the pig's trotter dish more [...] "delicate", and only using the white part of the leeks in a pressed leek and langoustine starter. Meades also noticed that White had [...] "tempered" [...] the sauces served with meat and fish, referring to their previous versions as [...] "assault courses". He praised a new roasted salmon and tapenade dish, calling it [...] "of breathtaking quality", {{and the work of}} pastry chef Roger Pizey. Meades later listed The Restaurant as the second best in the country at the end of 1994, placed only behind Phil Vickery, having recently taken over from Gary Rhodes, at the Castle Hotel, Taunton. He gave both restaurants an equal nine stars out of ten. When celebrity chef Keith Floyd listed his five favourite restaurants for The Guardian in September 1994, he included The Restaurant in third place, saying [...] "The food is exquisite.

500|$|The {{mammalian}} excretory system involves many components. Like {{most other}} land animals, mammals are ureotelic, and convert ammonia into urea, which {{is done by}} the liver as part of the urea cycle. Bilirubin, a waste product derived from blood cells, is passed through bile and urine with the help of enzymes excreted by the liver. The passing of bilirubin via bile through the intestinal tract gives mammalian feces a distinctive brown coloration. Distinctive features of the mammalian kidney include the presence of the renal pelvis and renal pyramids, and of a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla, which is due to the presence of elongated loops of Henle. Only the mammalian kidney has <b>a</b> <b>bean</b> shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multilobed reniculate kidneys of pinnipeds, cetaceans and bears. Most adult placental mammals have no remaining trace of the cloaca. In the embryo, the embryonic cloaca divides into a posterior region that becomes part of the anus, and an anterior region that has different fates depending on the sex of the individual: in females, it develops into the vestibule that receives the urethra and vagina, while in males it forms the entirety of the penile urethra. However, the tenrecs, golden moles, and some shrews retain a cloaca as adults. In marsupials, the genital tract is separate from the anus, but a trace of the original cloaca does remain externally. Monotremes, [...] which translates from Greek into [...] "single hole", have a true cloaca.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Gray, citing several Supreme Court cases (Brown v. Piper, , , and Jones v. U.S., 137 U.S. 202, 216) {{stated that}} when words have {{acquired}} no special meaning in trade or commerce, the ordinary meaning {{must be used}} by the court. In this case dictionaries cannot be admitted as evidence, but only as aids to the memory and understanding of the court. Gray acknowledged that botanically, tomatoes are classified as a [...] "fruit of the vine"; nevertheless, they are seen as vegetables because they were usually eaten as a main course instead of being eaten as a dessert. In making his decision, Justice Gray mentioned another case where it had been claimed that beans were seeds [...] Justice Bradley, in Robertson v. Salomon, 130 U.S. 412, 414, similarly found that though <b>a</b> <b>bean</b> is botanically a seed, in common parlance <b>a</b> <b>bean</b> is seen as a vegetable. While on the subject, Gray clarified the status of the cucumber, squash, pea, and bean.|$|E
