25|$|A betrothal feast is in progress, for Gyges {{has become}} King of Lydia and is to wed Nisia. Courtiers and nobles are present. The priests enter {{to conduct the}} {{marriage}} ceremony. They bring a sacrificial table. Gyges, crowned, leads his bride towards the table, places <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the holy flame and takes a vow. Nisia does the same, but the flame expires {{and there is a}} clap of thunder. The people are astonished at this portent and the priests withdraw from the table. Gyges, enraptured with Nisia, ignores the warning, takes the Queen towards the gardens and commands the festival to begin.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the sources}} agree that the first murder in January or February 1828 was either that of a miller named Joseph lodging in Hare's house, or Abigail Simpson, a salt seller. The {{historian}} Lisa Rosner considers Joseph the more likely; a pillow was used to smother the victim, while later ones were suffocated by <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the nose and mouth. The novelist Sir Walter Scott, who took {{a keen interest in}} the case, also thought the miller was the more likely first victim, and highlighted that [...] "there was an additional motive to reconcile them to the deed", as Joseph was suffering from a fever and had become delirious. Hare and his wife were concerned that having a potentially infectious lodger would be bad for business. Hare again turned to Burke and, after providing their victim with whisky, Hare suffocated Joseph while Burke lay across the upper torso to restrict movement. They again took the corpse to Knox, who this time paid £10. Rosner considers the method of murder to be ingenious: Burke's weight on the victim stifled movement—and thus the ability to make noise—while it also prevented the chest from expanding should any air get past Hare's suffocating grip. In Rosner's opinion, the method would have been [...] "practically undetectable until the era of modern forensics".|$|E

Handgags are common [...] and are often associated with damsel-in-distress phenomena.|$|E

We are investigating every incident of the lives of the Paroubeks since they came to Chicago in order to trace a possible enemy. It will surprise me if the criminals are not arrested within a week." [...] To the Chicago Tribune he stated, [...] "We have one or two theories, but nothing specific enough to even talk about. I intend to place more men on the case tomorrow." [...] Lt. Costello returned to investigating the anonymous letters. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported Hoffman's and Paroubek's theory as fact.|$|E
