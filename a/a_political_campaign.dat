5|$|After Mao Zedong's communists won the Chinese Civil War and {{established}} the People's Republic of China in 1949, Shangguan Yunzhu continued her acting career {{under the new}} government. In 1951 she married her third husband Cheng Shuyao (程述尧), manager of Shanghai's Lyceum Theatre. She {{gave birth to a}} son named Wei Ran (韦然). However, Cheng Shuyao was soon embroiled in the Five-anti Campaign, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>campaign</b> launched by Mao against the capitalist class in 1952. He was accused of embezzlement and confessed to the charges under pressure. Shangguan decided to divorce Cheng; their marriage lasted less than two years. She later had another relationship with the director He Lu (贺路).|$|E
5|$|W. W. Thomas, {{superintendent}} of the Springfield public-school system, believed that home-ownership and citizenship responsibilities {{were a part of}} education and was a key instigator of the project. He involved students in the governmental duties associated with the project, which used the manager-commission form of government to run the lilliputian city. Concepts such as women’s suffrage and political ambition came into play. A 14-year-old orphaned girl was elected Tiny Town's mayor and a 15-year-old boy became its city manager, defeating sixteen other nominees in <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} speculation led some, like former {{spokesman for}} Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign Phil Singer, to criticize Matthews for openly weighing <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>campaign</b> bid {{while working as}} a news broadcaster. Singer believed Matthews should resign or be suspended from the network until a decision was made. Speculation grew as Matthews spent much of 2008 attending meetings with Pennsylvania representatives and major Democratic fundraisers. Matthews discussed a possible campaign with Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, and poll numbers for a theoretical race showed him only three percentage points behind Specter. However, the speculation came to an end on January 7, 2009, when Matthews told his Hardball staff {{he was not going to}} run for Senate. Such media outlets as The New York Times and The Washington Post suggested Matthews' alleged consideration was a tactic to ensure a higher salary during negotiations with MSNBC to renew his contract, which was set to expire in June 2009.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} year, the Referendum Party had little {{established}} organisation and largely remained a concept with limited concrete presence. Goldsmith's finances had allowed its appearance {{to be accompanied}} with mass publicity but it lacked the standard machinery of a political party, such as a mass membership or politically experienced personnel. To counter this problem, Goldsmith sought to create a sophisticated administrative centre and to secure the expertise to carry out <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>campaign,</b> establishing his headquarters in London. By October 1995, the party had established a hierarchical structure consisting of three tiers: the centre, region and constituency. Operating the centre was Goldsmith and a cabinet whose membership included Lord McAlpine, who was a former treasurer of the Conservative Party, and two {{former members of the}} Conservative Central Office staff. The centre had around 50 staff, who relayed Goldsmith's instructions through to the ten regional co-ordinators, who in turn transmitted them to the prospective candidates in the constituencies. This top-down and undemocratic structure concentrated decision making with Goldsmith and the centre and provided little autonomy for the regions and constituencies, although this was deemed necessary to ensure efficiency in its campaign.|$|E

25|$|As a Liberal nationalist, Mommsen favored {{assimilation}} of ethnic minorities into German society, not exclusion. In 1879, his colleague Heinrich von Treitschke began <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>campaign</b> against Jews (the so-called Berliner Antisemitismusstreit). Mommsen strongly opposed antisemitism {{and wrote a}} harsh pamphlet in which he denounced von Treitschke's views. Mommsen viewed a solution to antisemitism in voluntary cultural assimilation, suggesting that the Jews could {{follow the example of}} the people of Schleswig-Holstein, Hanover and other German states, which gave up some of the special customs when integrating in Prussia.|$|E

25|$|The {{battle at}} Ba Gia, which marked the {{beginning}} of the National Liberation Front’s Summer Offensive of 1965, had dealt a severe blow to South Vietnam's armed forces. For the first time in the NLF's history, their forces at Ba Gia successfully decimated a regimental-sized ARVN Task Force in battle. According to Vietnam’s official account of the battle, the Viet Cong killed or wounded 915 South Vietnamese soldiers, and 270 others were captured. In addition to the human casualties, the Viet Cong also captured 370 weapons of various kinds and destroyed 14 GMC trucks. South Vietnam, on the other hand, claimed to have killed 556 enemy soldiers, but only captured 20 weapons. Following their military victory, the NLF Quang Ngai Provincial Committee initiated <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>campaign</b> to exercise political influence over the province. By June 3, 1965, the National Liberation Front virtually controlled five districts in northern Quang Ngai Province (Binh Son, Son Tinh, Nghia Hanh, Tu Nghia and Mo Duc), home to 10,000 civilians.|$|E
25|$|Since her son’s {{death in}} the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Ding Zilin has been {{fighting}} for justice for the victims. Her activism has drawn international attention and association with recognizable human rights groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and HRIC (Human Rights in China). New York based human rights watchdog HRIC has been labelled by the Chinese government as a hostile organization. Because of Ding Zilins efforts Amnesty International has <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>campaign</b> {{to put pressure on}} the Chinese government to acknowledge and apologize for the deaths of so many citizens. Amnesty applauded the Chinese government in June 2007 for allowing Ding Zilin, her husband and two other dead citizens’ kin to light candles west of Tiananmen Square. Despite the minimal recognition from the government Amnesty urges Chinese authorities to allow open debate and more public memorials in order to help improve Chinas human rights record and the image of Beijing on the international stage. Ding Zilin and human rights groups demand the Chinese government to stop labelling the student protest with political jargon such as “counter-revolutionary rebellion”.|$|E
