40|$|The use of personal, {{sensitive}} information, such as {{privileges and}} attributes, {{to gain access}} to computer resources in distributed environments raises an interesting paradox. On one hand, {{in order to make the}} services and resources accessible to legitimate users, access control infrastructure requires valid and provable service clients' identities or attributes to make decisions. On the other hand, the service clients may not be prepared to disclose their identity information or attributes to a remote party without determining in advance whether the service provider can be trusted with such sensitive information. Moreover, when clients give out personal information, they still are unsure of the extent of propagation and use of the information. This thesis describes an investigation of privacy preserving options in access control infrastructures, and proposes a security model to support the management of those options, based on extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) and Security Access Markup Language (SAML), both of which are OASIS security standards. Existing access control systems are typically unilateral in that the enterprise service provider assigns the access rights and makes the access control decisions, and there is no negotiation between the client and the service provider. As access control management systems lean towards being user-centric or federated, unilateral approaches can no longer adequately preserve the client's privacy, particularly where communicating parties have no pre-existing trust relationship. As a result, a unified approach that significantly improves privacy and confidentiality protection in distributed environments was considered. This resulted in the development of XACML Trust Management Authorization Infrastructure (XTMAI) designed to handle privacy and confidentiality mutually and simultaneously using the concept of Obligation of Trust (OoT) protocol. The OoT enables two or more transaction parties to exchange Notice of Obligations (NoB) (obligating constraints) as well as Signed Acceptance of Obligation (SAO), a proof of <b>acceptance,</b> <b>as</b> <b>security</b> assurances before exchange of sensitive resources.

30|$|In summary, {{acceptance}} is not {{a viable}} strategy in all circumstances and for all security threats—and in fact it never has been. The question is whether <b>acceptance</b> <b>as</b> a <b>security</b> management strategy has lost ground in an increasingly number of contexts and in relation to such <b>security</b> threats <b>as</b> kidnapping. The concern is that in particular circumstances, such as in northern Nigeria, threats—especially the threat of kidnapping—come from transnational groups operating regionally, and therefore, the threat theatre has been delocalised. This delocalisation creates a potentially untenable situation for humanitarian agencies, <b>as</b> their <b>security</b> management options have become severely limited. And in the Syria for example, it is debatable whether {{there is even a}} ‘local’ to speak of, as the transnational aspects of the context are so dominant. <b>Acceptance</b> <b>as</b> a strategy was probably doomed from the start. And in both cases, there has been a disturbing trend for kidnapping victims to be killed.|$|R

40|$|Humanitarian aid {{agencies}} have relied primarily on <b>acceptance</b> <b>as</b> their primary risk, or security, management strategy {{for well over}} a decade.

Despite the urgency of the situation, {{aid agencies}} have struggled to effectively implement new strategies and still rely primarily on <b>acceptance</b> <b>as</b> a mitigating strategy. This article examines the limitations of <b>acceptance</b> <b>as</b> practiced by humanitarian aid agencies as a strategy against targeted attacks and the challenges in adopting new strategies. The article uses Cultural Theory to explain these limitations and challenges and concludes with recommendations based on that theory for a new approach to security strategies that takes into account the social milieu of both aid workers and their potential attackers...|$|R
