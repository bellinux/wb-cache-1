50|$|Whittington Castle is {{a castle}} in {{northern}} Shropshire, England, owned and {{managed by the}} Whittington Castle Preservation Fund. The castle was originally a motte-and-bailey castle, but this was replaced in the 13th century by one with buildings <b>around</b> <b>a</b> courtyard whose <b>exterior</b> wall was the curtain wall of the inner bailey. As a castle of the Welsh Marches, it {{was built on the}} border of Wales and England very close to the historic fort of Old Oswestry.|$|R
50|$|Bailliehill Mount's summit has {{evidence}} of earthworks that are sub-circular with an earthen bank {{on all sides}} except the NW, with an interior height of <b>around</b> 0.5m and <b>an</b> <b>exterior</b> height of <b>around</b> 2.3m. An entrance may have existed to the north where the bank seems to stop short of the steep slope although that section has been subject to landslips that may have removed {{evidence of}} this part of any bank. A short section of a second bank and ditch exists to the east however the degree of rig and furrow ploughing makes interpretation problematic.|$|R
5000|$|The character's {{name comes}} from the last names of the creators of the Mortal Kombat franchise, Ed Boon and John Tobias, spelled in reverse. During his first appearances, Noob Saibot's design was focused <b>around</b> <b>an</b> all-black <b>exterior,</b> with the staff stating [...] "that's what he's all about". They found {{difficulties}} in making some versions, without him appearing to look into bondage. For Mortal Kombat: Deception, Noob Saibot was the first character drawn and designed by Steve Beran. Beran attempted {{to make him a}} more-distinctive character, focusing less on his all-black exterior. One design was removed due to its similarities with a tuxedo. Another wore a hood, but the idea was later moved to the new character Havik. An early alternate outfit depicted Noob Saibot in a black, red and blue outfit with a Japanese translation of [...] "darkness" [...] on the front flap. He was also shown unmasked, but this design ended up being used as Havik's alternate outfit. The use of a two-on-two combat was meant to be introduced in this game as well, but was only used with Noob Saibot and Smoke. Both characters were models for the use of such a concept and were intended to work together in the player's Fatality.|$|R
