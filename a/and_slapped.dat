5|$|Crawford and Knight {{were taken}} to Wingenund's camp on June 7, where they found nine other prisoners. On June 11, Captain Pipe painted {{the faces of the}} prisoners black, the {{traditional}} sign they were to be executed. The prisoners were marched to the Delaware town on Tymochtee Creek, near the present-day village of Crawford, Ohio. Four prisoners were killed with tomahawks and scalped along the way. When the war party stopped, the seven remaining prisoners were made to sit, with Crawford and Knight a short distance away from the others. Delaware women and boys killed the other five with tomahawks, beheading one of them. The boys scalped the victims <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> the bloody scalps in the faces of Crawford and Knight.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} the protagonist's college life were filmed at Keyes High school, near Secunderabad Junction railway station. A school wall was {{demolished}} and a gate was repaired for the film's opening scene. Raghuvaran was carried away during the shoot of few action sequences <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> Brahmaji for nearly six times in a row. To avoid such issues {{in the case of}} murder scenes, Varma decided to complete few of them by using plain close-ups of the victims. Sudhakar's murder scene was filmed near Keesara in Ranga Reddy district. Gopala Reddy and Ellore placed a camera in a bag and ran behind him for a shaky effect. In the cycle-chain scene in which Siva uses a cycle chain to fight with J. D., the hand pulling the chain was Ellore's; in the next shot, Nagarjuna is shown holding the chain. The scene in which Naresh is killed near his home was filmed in the streets of Vengala Rao Nagar. The cycle chase scenes were filmed in Somajiguda and the slums behind Yashoda Hospitals. The bus chase scene was shot in Yusufguda. The film's climax was filmed at the Swapnalok complex in Secunderabad, and Bhavani's suicide was filmed on a set at Venus Studios in Chennai.|$|E

He allegedly seized a cell phone from its owner (Daniel Schuman), grabbed the owner's neck twice <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> him, after the owner took a picture of a group of Clippers players. The charges were dismissed in March 2015 for lack of evidence.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match was}} between Christian and Chris Jericho.

However, he has also developed a following amongst gay viewers and received a lot of fan mail from male viewers.|$|E
25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} SummerSlam on Raw was between WWE Champion Edge and John Cena. Edge won the title on the July 3 episode of Raw, {{defeating}} then-champion Rob Van Dam and Cena in a triple threat match. The following week on Raw, after defeating Shelton Benjamin, Cena attacked Edge, who was providing commentary for the match. Edge, however, fought off Cena and executed an Edgecution {{followed by a}} spear. Later that night, {{as part of the}} storyline, Cena attacked Edge and Lita, Edge's girlfriend, at their hotel. On the edition of July 15 of Saturday Night's Main Event, Cena faced off against Edge for the WWE Championship. Cena won the match by disqualification after Lita interfered <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> the referee. Since a championship cannot change hands via countout or disqualification, Edge retained the title. After the match, Cena attacked Edge and performed an FU through a broadcast table. Three weeks later, on the edition of July 31 of Raw, a match between Edge and Cena for the WWE Championship was booked for SummerSlam, with the stipulation that if Edge got himself counted out or intentionally disqualified, he would lose the WWE Championship. On August 14, Edge went to Cena's father's house in West Newbury, Massachusetts, <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> him.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half of the game, Chinese forward Li Yi {{deliberately}} kicked Lee's right shin after Lee completed a pass. Having recovered from a recent ankle injury, Lee was upset at Li's foul play <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> Li on the back of his head, thereafter which Li Yi started to roll on the ground grabbing his head. For a while the entire Chinese and Korean squad ran toward the scene resulting in brief ruckus and some degree of physical contact but further conflict did not occur, as the referee awarded a yellow card for Li (simulation) and a red card for Lee (violence).|$|E
25|$|While {{competing}} in the Royal Rumble match, Booker was eliminated by Kane. A frustrated Booker returned to the ring illegally and eliminated Kane. This started a short feud between the two resulting in a match at No Way Out, which Kane won. King Booker won a Money in the Bank qualifying match, defeating Kane (with assistance from The Great Khali) and earned himself {{a spot in the}} match at WrestleMania 23. At WrestleMania, Matt Hardy set up Sharmell for a Twist of Fate during the Money in the Bank match with the briefcase in King Booker's grasp – thus forcing him to choose between a guaranteed title shot and his wife. He chose to defend his Queen and lost the match. On the April 6 episode of SmackDown!, Booker attempted to take revenge. However, he lost the match against Matt Hardy, and Sharmell declared her disappointment in him <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> him. In an attempt to impress his Queen, King Booker attacked The Undertaker but was Tombstoned on an announce table. Booker was removed from television to deal with a knee injury.|$|E
25|$|Ali {{stood up}} and started towards Angelo Dundee who guided him into the corner. At first Dundee talked <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> Ali's legs, but after Ali {{misunderstood}} {{and tried to get}} off the stool, Dundee used smelling salts. Dundee has since claimed to have opened a small tear in one of Ali's gloves and told the referee that his fighter needed a new pair of gloves, thus delaying the start of the 5th round. Cooper insisted that this delay lasted anywhere from three to five seconds according to the footage and that this did not deny him the chance to try to knock Ali out while he was still dazed. Tapes of the fight show that Ali received only an extra six seconds, and the gloves were ultimately not replaced. Cooper started the 5th round aggressively, attempting to make good on his advantage, but a recovered Ali effectively countered and Cooper was hit high on the face with a hard right which opened a severe cut under his eye. Referee Tommy Little was forced to stop the fight, and thus Ali defeated Cooper by technical knockout.|$|E

25|$|The {{disastrous}} rule of {{the last}} Comnenian emperor Andronikos I (r. 1183–85) worsened {{the situation of the}} Bulgarian peasantry and nobility. The first act of his successor Isaac II Angelos was to impose an extra tax to finance his wedding. In 1185, two aristocrat brothers from Tarnovo, Theodore and Asen, asked the emperor to enlist them into the army and grant them land, but Isaac II declined <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> Asen across the face. Upon their return to Tarnovo, the brothers commissioned the construction of a church dedicated to Saint Demetrius of Salonica. They showed the populace a celebrated icon of the saint, whom they claimed had left Salonica to support the Bulgarian cause and called for a rebellion. That act had the desired effect on the religious population, who enthusiastically engaged in a rebellion against the Byzantines. Theodore, the elder brother, was crowned Emperor of Bulgaria under the name Peter IV, after the sainted Peter I (r.927–969). Almost all of Bulgaria {{to the north of the}} Balkan Mountains—the region known as Moesia—immediately joined the rebels, who also secured the assistance of the Cumans, a Turkic tribe inhabiting lands north of the Danube river. The Cumans soon became an important part of the Bulgarian army, playing a major role in the successes that followed. As soon as the rebellion broke out, Peter IV attempted to seize the old capital of Preslav but failed; he declared Tarnovo the capital of Bulgaria.|$|E
500|$|According to Nelson Branco of TV Guide, OLTL aired [...] "some of {{the most}} {{explosive}} and ugliest scenes ever broadcast on daytime" [...] television in March 2008 when Todd beat up teenager Cole Thornhart (his daughter's boyfriend and Marty's son), <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> Starr and Cole's friends Markko Rivera and Langston Wilde. [...] Todd barges in on Starr and Cole in bed {{together for the first}} time, jumping to the conclusion that Cole had raped her, [...] "and [...] the son of his rape victim relentlessly". [...] At least one soap opera blogger was outraged, and wanted Todd to be punished.|$|E
500|$|The Suez {{crisis and}} the choice of Eden's {{successor}} led in 1957 to the first major personal criticism of the Queen. In a magazine, which he owned and edited, Lord Altrincham accused her of being [...] "out of touch". Altrincham was denounced by public figures <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> {{by a member of}} the public appalled by his comments. Six years later, in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised the Queen to appoint the Earl of Home as prime minister, advice that she followed. The Queen again came under criticism for appointing the prime minister on the advice of a small number of ministers or a single minister. In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for electing a leader, thus relieving her of involvement.|$|E

500|$|Upon being {{medically}} {{cleared to}} return to the ring, Orton was reinjured in a motorcycle accident. [...] He returned to Raw on September 1, criticizing all the champions, including World Tag Team Champions Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, who he berated <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> for letting Cryme Tyme steal their belts. This inspired them to try to gain Orton's respect. They achieved this at Unforgiven when, with new stablemate Manu, they assaulted World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk, forcing him to vacate his title before his scheduled defense that night. Orton returned to the ring on the November 3 Raw, losing to Punk by disqualification when DiBiase interfered. In retaliation, Orton punted DiBiase in the head. On the December 1 Raw, Orton proposed that he, Rhodes and Manu form an alliance. The stable, called The Legacy, debuted the next week, defeating Batista and Triple H, Orton's former Evolution stablemates, in a three-on-two handicap match.|$|E
500|$|By 1948 Olivier was on {{the board}} of {{directors}} for the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for the theatre. Olivier played the lead in Richard III and also performed with Leigh in The School for Scandal and The Skin of Our Teeth. The tour was an outstanding success and, although Leigh was plagued with insomnia and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to [...] "charm the press". Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple as Olivier was increasingly resentful of the demands placed on him during the tour. The most dramatic altercation occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh refused to go onstage without them. An exhausted and exasperated Olivier screamed an obscenity at her <b>and</b> <b>slapped</b> her face, and a devastated Leigh slapped him in return, dismayed that he would hit her publicly. Subsequently, she made her way to the stage in borrowed pumps, and in seconds, had [...] "dried her tears and smiled brightly onstage". By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill. Olivier told a journalist, [...] "You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses." [...] Later, he would observe that he [...] "lost Vivien" [...] in Australia.|$|E
