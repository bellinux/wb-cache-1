5|$|A Parliamentary {{debate and}} motion to censure the Labour {{government}} on this {{was set for}} 8 October, but before this MacDonald called Hastings {{into his office and}} suggested a way to solve the problem. Hastings would accept <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> and resign as Attorney General, and in exchange MacDonald {{and the rest of the}} cabinet would speak for Hastings at the resulting by-election. Hastings refused the general suggestion, but planned to make a speech at the upcoming debate explaining his actions.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Tsar Alexander I laid <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> on M. I. Kutuzov, Commander-in-chief of the Allied Army. However, it {{is clear}} that Kutuzov's plan was to retreat farther to the rear where the Allied Army had a sharp {{advantage}} in logistics. Had the Allied Army retreated further, they might have been reinforced by Archduke Charles's troops from Italy, and the Prussians might have joined the coalition against Napoleon. A French army {{at the end of her}} supply lines, in a place which had no food supplies, might have faced a very different ending from the one they achieved at the real battle of Austerlitz. This essentially was Kutuzov's successful strategy in 1812, after the Battle of Borodino.|$|E

He had been however staunchly defended by Nicolas de Villegagnon, who exposed the duplicity of de Homedes.|$|E

25|$|In the 2006–2007 season, {{the team}} was relegated to the Segunda División B under the {{management}} of ex-Real Madrid legend Míchel after occupying 19th place {{in the league in}} a disappointing season. Míchel received a lot of criticism and accepted <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> for the team's bad performances, especially for those who had a wonderful season in the 2005–06 season, such as Rubén de la Red, Esteban Granero and Javi García. The reserves produced other quality players, including Juan Mata and Álvaro Negredo.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the wake}} of the {{newspaper}} stories regarding the murder, the Viscount was reminded of the theft and demanded a search for the jewels in Marie's room in Le Glandier. When the jewels turned up during the search, some newspapers believed her and put <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> on the Viscountess. However, when she was put on trial for theft, the court was not so persuaded. Marie was found guilty and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in the nearby town of Tulle.|$|E
25|$|His son Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, the poet, {{remained}} a favourite of the King. The duke knew {{his family had}} fallen from grace, wrote an apology on 14 December to the King, excusing himself and laying <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> on his niece and stepmother. All of the Howard prisoners were tried, found guilty of concealing treason, and sentenced to life imprisonment and forfeiture of goods. In time, they were released with their goods restored.

25|$|His debut {{century for}} England {{did not occur}} until Fletcher's twentieth Test appearance, however {{he went on to}} score six more tons at a rate of one every four Tests. His cricketing nous was used by both Tony Lewis and Tony Greig when they led the {{national}} team, but the appointment of Mike Brearley to the role in 1977 appeared to indicate that Fletcher's further involvement would be limited. Following Brearley's retirement and Ian Botham's short term tenure, Fletcher re-appeared after four years away from the national team to captain the side to India in 1981–82. The series did not go well, with negative tactics from both contestants, exasperated by poor umpiring decisions, which saw Fletcher flick off the bails with his bat after being given out in the Second Test. Worse was to follow for Fletcher, when Geoffrey Boycott was sent home, and Fletcher's belated awareness that half of his touring party, under his teammate Graham Gooch's captaincy, were preparing for a rebel tour to South Africa. His captaincy of England oversaw a 1–0 series defeat over six Tests against India, and then a one-off Test against Sri Lanka. Fletcher took <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame,</b> despite himself turning down the chance to join the rebels, because of his loyalty to the England cause. His was then ignominiously sacked by the chairman of selectors, Peter May.|$|E
25|$|Constantly {{serving the}} Crown, he {{quickly became the}} top {{privateer}} in Puerto Rico. In a letter sent on February 14, 1705, the work done by two ships owned by Enríquez {{in the waters of}} Puerto Rico and Santo Domingo is praised. King Phillip V expressed satisfaction and encouraged the continuation of this labor, not without claiming the weapons captured from his victims. During this timeframe, Enríquez generally operated with only two vessels at once, often replacing those lost. Among those, several were captured by foreign countries including seven sloops, a schooner and a brigantine. Authorities from Curaçao caught the sloops San Nicolás, Santa Bárbara and La María (with British help), along the unnamed schooner. The ship known as Popa Azul was captured off the coast of Puerto Rico by the Netherlands. An unnamed sloop was captured by England near Santa Cruz, following three days of conflict. Others, including a brigantine, were lost due to other causes. Enríquez usually kept his fleet well staffed, with these vessels being manned by 100–200 sailors. Due to the fact that privateers were not required to report the names of the ships captured to sell their loot, few of the fleet's victims are known. However, it is known that he captured an average of two victims for every vessel lost. One of his ships, named Santo Tomás, was involved in a controversy when its captain, José Rodríguez, ordered to board a Spanish sloop that was leaving a St. Thomas port. Rodríguez tried to justify his action by stating that the vessel was leaving a non-Spanish harbor and could be carrying contraband, but was still jailed in Santo Domingo for some time. Santo Tomás had actually left Puerto Rico ordered to attend the frequent contraband arriving from that island, only receiving a mild authorization from Enríquez, who was sick and decided not to oppose the will of the establishment. Not opposing the governor would prove to be a mistake, since the audience that discussed the case decided to place <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> on him and Rodríguez. From this moment forward, Enríquez changed his approach, portraying himself as a loyal subject and offering his resources without question, only to play the circumstances to his favor. On December 12, 1704, the Crown authorized the establishment of a route between Puerto Rico and the Canary Islands, which would carry 150 tons of fruit. However, this route remained stale for two years. The government did not possess such a ship and was forced to ask Enríquez to loan it one of his. He did not oppose the request and the vessel arrived to Gran Canaria, with the merchandise having survived a storm and a rough voyage. Enríquez continued to operate this route, repeating the action a year later. However, the Council of the Indies suspended it, claiming that no ship smaller than 50 or 60 tons should travel between Puerto Rico and the Canary Islands citing strategic affairs.|$|E

500|$|Instead of {{accepting}} the Emperor's decision, Honório Hermeto offered his resignation, {{along with those}} of his colleagues. Astonished by his behavior, the Emperor would say years later when recalling the incident: [...] "Paraná não se curvava!" [...] (" [...] Paraná did not bow down!") PedroII asked the Liberals to form a new cabinet. For most of the next five years, Honório Hermeto and his Party of Order stood in opposition to the Liberals and the Courtier Faction. For the saquaremas, it meant enduring [...] "new elections, fixed results, partisan reprisals and policy shifts". Only a few saquaremas managed to get themselves elected to the Chamber during this period. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> for this disaster fell upon Honório Hermeto.

500|$|Osgood's husband, Samuel Stillman Osgood, {{threatened}} to sue Ellet unless she formally apologized. She retracted her statements {{in a letter to}} Osgood saying, [...] "The letter shown me by Mrs Poe must have been a forgery created by Poe himself". She put <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> on Poe, suggesting the incident was because Poe was [...] "intemperate and subject to acts of lunacy." [...] The rumor that Poe was insane was spread by Ellet and by other enemies of Poe and eventually reported in newspapers. After Osgood reunited with her husband, the scandal died down. Poe's sick wife Virginia, however, was deeply affected by the scandal. As early as July 1845 she had been receiving anonymous letters, possibly from Ellet, which reported her husband's alleged indiscretions. On her deathbed, Virginia claimed [...] "Mrs. E. had been her murderer." [...] As Poe described years later, [...] "I scorned Mrs. E simply because she revolted me, and to this day she has never ceased her anonymous persecutions." [...] It is believed that Poe wrote the short story [...] "Hop-Frog" [...] as a literary revenge on Ellet and others.|$|E

[...] The scandal eventually died down only when Osgood reunited with her husband. Virginia, however, had been very affected by the whole affair. She had received anonymous letters about her husband's alleged indiscretions as early as July 1845.

She presents the heads to Sita, who decides to commit suicide, but Trijata asks her to wait until she can verify the truth. Carrying Sita's dagger, she meets Rama and in return receives a girdle woven by Sita from Rama. She is carried back to Lanka by Hanuman.

500|$|In {{a review}} of Volume 16 of the manga, Deb Aoki from About.com listed Itachi's {{introduction}} in the series {{as one of the}} cons from the volume. She praised his first fight in the series as very entertaining, meant to [...] "whet readers' appetites for future fights between Konoha ninja and the Akatsuki". James Musgrove commented that Itachi and his partner Kisame [...] "make a dramatic and well-timed entrance into the story". However, Jason Van Horn criticised the first battle between Itachi and Sasuke, as [...] "good" [...] but not [...] "as epic as it should've been". His last fight with Sasuke before dying was considered [...] "epic" [...] by Casey Brienza from ANN. [...] She found to be [...] "a battle of minds" [...] since, even after Itachi's death, Sasuke changes his mind about him when he learns about his past. [...] She also anticipated the impact of Itachi's past revelations on the future storyline of Naruto. Despite disliking how the anime Shippuden used Itachi's light novel as part of the series, Chris Beveridge from the Fandom Post enjoyed Itachi's impact on both Sasuke and Naruto. Writer Jason Thompson highly praised his visual tortures, due to the effect it has on the victims, reminding him of the antagonist from Kiyoshi Kurosawa's film Cure notable for its horror scenes. Nevertheless, he criticized Itachi's death scene {{as a result of his}} disease rather than being killed by Sasuke, taking <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> from his brother in the process. In 2014, IGN listed him as the fifth best Naruto character when the series ended.|$|E
500|$|Göring was the second-highest-ranking Nazi {{official}} tried at Nuremberg, behind Reich President (former Admiral) Karl Dönitz. The prosecution levelled {{an indictment}} of four charges, including a charge of conspiracy; waging a war of aggression; war crimes, including the plundering and removal to Germany {{of works of art}} and other property; and crimes against humanity, including the disappearance of political and other opponents under the Nacht und Nebel (Night and Fog) decree; the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war; and the murder and enslavement of civilians, including what was at the time estimated to be 5,700,000 Jews. Not permitted to present a lengthy statement, Göring declared himself to be [...] "in the sense of the indictment not guilty". The trial lasted 218 days; the prosecution presented their case from November through March, and Göring's defencethe first to be presentedlasted from 8 to 22 March. The sentences were read out on 30 September 1946. Göring, forced to remain silent while seated in the dock, communicated his opinions about the proceedings using gestures, shaking his head, or laughing. He constantly took notes and whispered with the other defendants, and tried to control the erratic behaviour of Hess, who was seated beside him. During breaks in the proceedings, Göring tried to dominate the other defendants, and he was eventually placed in solitary confinement when he attempted to influence their testimony. Göring told American psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn that the court was [...] "stupid" [...] to try [...] "little fellows" [...] like Funk and Kaltenbrunner instead of letting Göring take <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> on himself. He also claimed that he had never heard of most of the other defendants before the trial.|$|E
