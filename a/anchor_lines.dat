5|$|De Grasse had {{detached}} {{a few of}} his {{ships to}} blockade the York and James Rivers farther up the bay, and many of the ships at anchor were missing officers, men, and boats when the British fleet was sighted. He faced the difficult proposition of organizing a line of battle while sailing against an incoming tide, with winds and land features that would require him to do so on a tack opposite that of the British fleet. At 11:30 am, 24 ships of the French fleet cut their <b>anchor</b> <b>lines</b> and began sailing out of the bay with the noon tide, leaving behind the shore contingents and ships' boats. Some ships were so seriously undermanned, missing as many as 200 men, that not all of their guns could be manned. De Grasse had ordered the ships to form into a line as they exited the bay, in order of speed and without regard to its normal sailing order. Admiral Louis de Bougainville's Auguste {{was one of the first}} ships out. With a squadron of three other ships Bougainville ended up well ahead of the rest of the French line; by 3:45 pm the gap was large enough that the British could have cut his squadron off from the rest of the French fleet.|$|E

Earth anchors were driven into the land, near the foot of the trees, to secure the inland edge of the fabric, covering the surface of the beach and disappearing under the vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{the death}} of the Henderson brothers, {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, the company restructured, {{becoming}} <b>Anchor</b> <b>Line</b> (Henderson Brothers) Ltd. in 1899, building large new offices on St.Vincent Street, modernising much of its fleet and in 1910 moving its berth to the newly built Yorkhill Quay. Its success drew the attention of the Cunard Line and in 1911 the <b>Anchor</b> <b>Line</b> was effectively taken over and the chairman of Cunard became the chairman of the <b>Anchor</b> <b>Line.</b> With the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s however, the <b>Anchor</b> <b>Line</b> struggled and in 1935 Cunard withdrew from the company and it went into liquidation.|$|R

50|$|The {{anchorage}} is in {{the middle}} of the bay where there is firm ground of sand. However, rocky bed is also encountered, more so at the entrance to the harbour. <b>Anchor</b> <b>lines</b> are used in shoal areas when the tidal range in the spring season of up to 6.9 m permits such a use. Special permission is essential for anchoring near the Braye jetty or even tying to the jetty. The speed of boats or ships approaching the harbour is limited to 4 knots.|$|E
50|$|Historians {{say that}} the <b>Anchor</b> <b>Line</b> was {{ultimately}} doomed by the 1896 St. Louis-East St. Louis tornado that struck on May 27. The tornado touched down {{in the core of}} St. Louis and swept eastward across the river into East St. Louis, Illinois. The resulting death toll was a confirmed 255 people, though estimates put the number at close to 400. This is in part because the <b>Anchor</b> <b>Line's</b> floating palaces (as well as other steamboats) stationed at the St. Louis landing lay directly in the tornado's path. The <b>Anchor</b> <b>Line's</b> boats the Arkansas City and the City of Cairo were completely destroyed, and the City of Monroe was badly damaged.|$|R

50|$|Darwin's bark spider (scientific name Caerostris darwini) is an orb-weaver spider that {{produces}} {{one of the}} largest known orb webs, ranging from 900 to 28000 cm2, with <b>anchor</b> <b>lines</b> spanning up to 25 m. The spider was discovered in Madagascar in the Andasibe-Mantadia National Park in 2009. Its silk is the toughest biological material ever studied, over ten times tougher than a similarly-sized piece of Kevlar.

It featured more than 600,000 sq. feet of space in a modified Italian Renaissance style. Its great hall, which itself was more than sixty feet tall, was the home of Cunard Line and <b>Anchor</b> <b>Lines</b> {{with a number of}} other tenants throughout the building. While 25 Broadway is considered to be its primary address, it's also known as 13-27 Broadway, 13-39 Greenwich Street and 1-9 Morris Street. Within the borough of Manhattan it is designated Block 13, Lot 27.|$|E
50|$|Enterprise served {{throughout}} the American Revolutionary War as cruiser and convoy escort. On 7 June 1780, Enterprise, under command of Captain Patrick Leslie (not {{to be confused}} with Patrick Leslie), was at anchor in the Bay of Gibraltar with other ships of the Royal Navy. At about 1:30am, Enterprise saw some vessels drifting toward the harbour. When they came within hailing distance, the seaman on watch called a challenge. The six drifting vessels were set afire by their crews, who made their escape in small boats, leaving the flaming hulks drifting toward the British ships. Captain Leslie fired a three-gun salvo to warn the other ships, cut his <b>anchor</b> <b>lines</b> to let Enterprise drift away from the hulks, and then opened fire on the hulks in an attempt to sink them. With the Spanish fleet waiting just outside the harbour for any British ships trying to escape, the British seamen took to small boats and, at great peril to their lives, boarded the flaming hulks to attach lines to pull them away from their own ships and burn themselves out.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} boats survived the common {{disasters}} that {{were known to}} plague Mississippi River steamboats at the time, such as fire, snags (large sticks or branches in the river bed that would often tear holes in boats' hulls), ice, grounding on sandbars, and so forth to remain in service with the <b>Anchor</b> <b>Line</b> from the day they were built until the company {{went out of business}} in 1898. One of them, the City of Providence, built for the <b>Anchor</b> <b>Line</b> in 1880, was sold when the <b>Anchor</b> <b>Line</b> was liquidated and was then operated by various excursion companies until it was finally destroyed by ice in January 1910, some twenty-nine years after it was first put into service.|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{original}} plan was to use a pre-existing vessel, in the end Mäkipää opted to [...] "construct a floating structure that resembles a ship" [...] {{with the assistance of}} the local engineering company Silver Creek Engineering, Inc. A steel frame gives the ship the necessary strength to withstand waves, wind, snow and ice. A system of pontoons and weights keep it afloat and upright, and it is moored in place with weighted <b>anchor</b> <b>lines.</b> It was constructed both onsite and at the Herron School of Art & Design by Mäkipää, the Icelandic artist Halldúr Úlfarsson, Herron students, structural engineers from Silver Creek, and the IMA Design and Installation Crew. The museum's director at the time, Maxwell Anderson, has theorized that, in spite of the effort that went into constructing it, the ship will be slowly demolished by its aquatic environment, and he sees no reason to stop it: [...] "We can imagine leaving Tea’s piece to become a shipwreck. Why not just let it do what it needs to do?" ...|$|E

5000|$|On Sunday October 22, 1961, the Bianca C was {{ten days}} out of Naples and docked off Grenada when an {{explosion}} occurred in the engine room {{in the early hours}} of the morning. One crewman died immediately, and eight others were injured. As fires broke out, approximately 700 passengers and crew scrambled to abandon the ship while Grenadian fishermen and boat owners, awakened by the noise of the explosion, near the harbor of St. George's rushed to help. Survivors were taken to the capital, where makeshift hospitals were hastily established to provide shelter and food. Because Grenada did not have the equipment to quench such a large fire, a call for help was sent and was received by the British frigate [...] at Puerto Rico. It took two days for the Londonderry to arrive, and by that time the Bianca C had begun to sink. The burning ship was in the main anchorage and would block the harbor if it sank there, so a Londonderry boarding party boarded the flaming ship to attach a towline. The <b>anchor</b> <b>lines</b> of the Bianca C were burned, and today the anchors are still at the mouth of the St. George's harbor. Meanwhile, the Londonderry moved to tow the Bianca C, but the latter ship was listing to port. Thousands of Grenadians watched from the mountains as the tow progressed for six hours, but the Bianca C. had only moved three miles (5 km) when a squall started and the towline broke. The Bianca C sank quickly into 165 ft of water, about a mile from the popular tourist beach at Grand Anse.|$|E
