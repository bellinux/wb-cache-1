50|$|These are schools {{specializing in}} fine arts <b>and</b> <b>design</b> which have {{four-year}} undergraduate programs. Many are universities, meaning {{they also have}} the ability to grant postgraduate degrees; in Canada these include the Nova Scotia College of Art <b>and</b> <b>Design</b> University (NSCAD), Emily Carr University of Art <b>and</b> <b>Design,</b> <b>and</b> Ontario College of Art <b>and</b> <b>Design</b> University (OCAD). The Alberta College of Art <b>and</b> <b>Design</b> (ACAD) currently grants undergraduate degrees only, and thus does not have the status of university.|$|R

50|$|The academy {{was founded}} in 1798 in Groningen as a school for arts, architecture, {{construction}} engineering, and seamanship. Today it is a school for fine art <b>and</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> part of the Hanze University Groningen. It offers two main fields: Fine Art <b>and</b> <b>Design</b> <b>and</b> Teacher Training in Fine Art <b>and</b> <b>Design.</b> The Leeuwarden based Academy for Pop Culture {{is also part of}} the Academie Minerva.

The cantonment graveyard of the British Raj is now the location of Varanasi's Arts and Crafts.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} for the project were scrutinized and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions <b>and</b> <b>designs</b> for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E
5|$|Carved {{designs in}} lacquerware <b>and</b> <b>designs</b> glazed onto {{porcelain}} wares displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity {{to those in}} painting. These items {{could be found in}} the homes of the wealthy, alongside embroidered silks and wares in jade, ivory, and cloisonné. The houses of the rich were also furnished with rosewood furniture and feathery latticework. The writing materials in a scholar's private study, including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood, were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal.|$|E

5|$|Development of Sonic Advance {{began after}} Sega shifted their focus to {{third-party}} software development, {{due to the}} underperformance of the Dreamcast. The company recruited Dimps—a Japanese development studio consisting of former Neo Geo Pocket Color programmers—to lead development, {{with the assistance of}} longtime series developer Sonic Team. While the game follows a similar style of gameplay to the Sega Genesis Sonic games, certain concepts <b>and</b> <b>designs</b> were re-used from newer titles such as Sonic Adventure. The game has since been ported to Nokia's N-Gage and Android devices, and is available on the Wii U via the Virtual Console.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{strangler}} figs (Ficus aurea) {{are common}} in hammocks, and find particular ease in rooting at the heads of cabbage palms (Sabal palmetto). After taking root into the ground, they build complex frameworks around the host tree, eventually squeezing out light and nutrients, and essentially taking its place. A variety of invertebrates including beetles, ants, spiders, and tree snails support a food chain that includes frogs, owls and other birds of prey, snakes, rodents, bobcats, and raccoons. There are more than 50varieties of tree snails in the Everglades; the color patterns <b>and</b> <b>designs</b> unique to single islands may {{be a result of}} the isolation of certain hammocks.|$|E
5|$|For the poor, hemp was {{the common}} item {{used to make}} clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of more modest means could wear wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors <b>and</b> <b>designs.</b> The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|E

5|$|Matsuno, the game's {{producer}} and director, preferred {{to create a}} new game title from scratch and use design ideas from staff collaborations, rather than reusing popular characters <b>and</b> <b>designs</b> that are found in sequels. Vagrant Story is regarded as a mixture of genres, as it contains elements of role-playing in its battles and platform games when in the field map. Matsuno explained that the development team was not eager to place Vagrant Story into a specific genre, preferring to create the game with a genre of its own.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 1933, a {{crowd of}} 3,000 watched the driving of the first stake at the low dam site, and {{excavation}} soon began. Core drilling commenced that September while the Bureau of Reclamation accelerated its studies <b>and</b> <b>designs</b> for the dam. It would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and hydroelectricity, though at a reduced capacity. Most importantly, it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee. However, the dam's design provided for future raising and upgrading.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{modes of}} {{operation}} include voice communication using amplitude modulation (AM), and Morse code using continuous wave (CW) radiotelegraphy. Among enthusiasts, there is considerable interest in owning, restoring and operating vintage military and commercial radio equipment, much of it more than 40 years old. Some undertake to construct their own gear, known in ham slang as homebrewing, using vintage parts <b>and</b> <b>designs.</b> A number of amateur radio clubs and organizations sponsor contests, events, and swap meets that cater to this specialized aspect of the hobby.|$|E

5|$|Prior to release, Evolve {{received}} a largely positive reception {{and won the}} Best of Show Awards at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 and Gamescom 2014. The game was tested {{by the general public}} multiple times. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews from critics, with praise mostly directed to the game's atmosphere, asymmetrical structure, controls, <b>and</b> <b>designs.</b> However, it received criticism for its progression system and light narrative, gameplay, as well as a large amount of downloadable content prepared. Evolve was a commercial success, although the player base significantly dwindled shortly after release. In July 2016, it was announced that Evolve would be transitioning to become free-to-play, due to the mixed post-release reception, massive loss of playerbase, and the DLC controversy, but 2K decided to end the game's support approximately four months later.|$|E
5|$|St Margaret's Church has a chancel, wide nave with {{a narrow}} {{clerestory}} above and narrow three-bay aisles on {{the north and south}} sides, a tall tower (topped with a spire) at the west end and a porch on the north side. The nave, chancel and chancel-arch all date from the 13th century. The aisles and their arcades are largely unaltered from their 14th-century origins: between them they feature various mouldings <b>and</b> <b>designs</b> typical of that period, including chamfered arches, octagonal columns and squinch corners. Many of the windows also date from that century, while others are a century later; trefoil-headed designs predominate, but there are some larger square-headed Perpendicular Gothic windows as well. Several other windows contain stained glass. The roof of the nave is tall and steeply pitched, with substantial king posts and tie-beams. It is also of medieval origin.|$|E
5|$|Theophilos now {{undertook}} {{a serious effort}} to relieve Sicily: he assembled a large army and placed it {{under the command of}} his son-in-law, the Caesar Alexios Mousele. Mousele arrived in Sicily in spring 838, in time to relieve the fortress of Cefalù from a Muslim attack. Mousele scored a number of successes against Muslim raiding parties but, back in Constantinople, his enemies launched accusations of contacts with the Arabs <b>and</b> <b>designs</b> on the throne. Furthermore, the death of his infant wife, Maria, cut his link to Theophilos, and the Emperor sent the archbishop of Syracuse, Theodore Krithinos, to recall the Caesar to Constantinople in 839.|$|E
