40|$|The {{pancreas}} {{is composed}} of two compartments that deliver digestive enzymes and endocrine hormones to control the blood sugar level. The <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> consists of functional units organized into cell clusters called islets of Langerhans where insulin-producing cells {{are found in the}} core and surrounded by glucagon-, somatostatin-, pancreatic polypeptide-, and ghrelin-producing cells. Diabetes is a devastating disease provoked by the depletion or malfunction of insulin-producing beta-cells in the <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas.</b> The side effects of diabetes are multiple, including cardiovascular, neuropathological, and kidney diseases. The analyses of transgenic and knockout mice gave major insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> genesis. Moreover, the study of animal models of pancreas injury revealed that the pancreas has the propensity to undergo regeneration and opened new avenues to develop novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of diabetes. Thus, beside self-replication of preexisting insulin-producing cells, several potential cell sources in the adult pancreas were suggested to contribute to beta-cell regeneration, including acinar, intraislet, and duct epithelia. However, regeneration in the adult <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> is still under controversial debate...|$|R

In normal dogs, ten microgram/kg neurotensin administration {{brought about a}} mild hyperglycemic response and sharp and rapid increase of plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations in the superior pancreaticoduodenal vein. A biphasic insulin response was noted in the pancreatic vein.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{pancreatic}} islet transplantation to treat Type I diabetes mellitus {{has been limited}} by the availability of patient-matched islets for transplant, and by the need for lifelong recipient maintenance on immunosuppressive medications. Both of these difficulties could be overcome by the derivation of pancreatic islets from patient-derived pluripotent stem cells. Research pursued in this proposal investigates strategies for the generation and analysis of pancreatic lineages derived from stem cells. This study in regenerative biology serves {{to contribute to the}} directed differentiation of embryonic stem cell-derived <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> structures with the capacity to function and serve as substitute endocrine islets for use in future cellular therapeutics to treat Type I diabetic patients. This thesis reports on the development of a single-cell transcript analysis technique to identify individual cell types in complex embryonic stem cell cultures, the derivation of a definitive endoderm progenitor population from embryonic stem cells to assist with directed protocols for generating <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas,</b> and investigation of properly timed expression of the master <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> regulator Ngn 3 to promote ES cell differentiation toward a pancreatic fate and enhance <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> hormone-expressing cell type maturation. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{purpose was}} to compare the <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> of hydropic infants of immune and nonimmune origin. STUDY DESIGN: A {{quantitative}} morphologic study {{was performed on the}} pancreas in 10 infants with immune and nonimmune hydrops. The volume density of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> in the gland was calculated, as was the numerical density of the endocrine cells in the islets. The percentage of the different cell types was measured on immunohistochemical stained slides. Ten normal infants were used as controls. RESULTS: An increased amount of endocrine tissue and an increased total number of islet cells of immune and nonimmune origin is present in hydropic infants. However, an increased proportion of the insulin-producing B cells is not present. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> in hydrops fetalis of immune and nonimmune origin is equal, excluding hemolysis as the stimulating factor for equilibrated islet overgrowth. Metabolic stimuli, as seen in infants of diabetic mothers, are probably not involved, because they preferentially stimulate the insulin-producing B cells. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{artificial}} <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> is a {{feedback control}} instrument that regulates insulin delivery on a minute-by-minute basis according to measured blood glucose levels.

The bedside-type artificial <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> has been proven to be useful not only as a therapeutic tool for diabetes mellitus, but also as an elegant research tool for investigating the pathophysiology of the disease, by using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp technique. The wearable type of closed-loop system has been developed recently. The breakthrough is the establishment of a needle-type glucose sensor.

40|$|Maintenance of glucose {{homeostasis}} depends on adequate amount and precise pattern of insulin secretion, which {{is determined by}} both β-cell secretory processes and well-developed microvascular network within <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas.</b> The development of highly organized microvasculature and high degrees of capillary fenestrations in <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> is greatly dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) from islet cells. However, {{it is unclear how}} VEGF-A production is regulated in <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas.</b> To understand whether signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) - 3 is involved in VEGF-A regulation and subsequent islet and microvascular network development, we generated a mouse line carrying pancreas-specific deletion of STAT 3 (p-KO) and performed physiological analyses both in vivo and using isolated islets, including glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and insulin secretion measurements. We also studied microvascular network and islet development by using immunohistochemical methods. The p-KO mice exhibited glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion in vivo but normal insulin secretion in isolated islets. Microvascular density in the pancreas was reduced in p-KO mice, along with decreased expression of VEGF-A, but not other vasotropic factors in islets in the absence of pancreatic STAT 3 signaling. Together, our study suggests that pancreatic STAT 3 signaling is required for the normal development and maintenance of <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> and islet microvascular network, possibly through its regulation of VEGF-A...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the stepwise development {{and testing of}} the components of a novel artificial <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas,</b> consisting of a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin infusion device and a control algorithm. The starting point was the belief that current approaches to the challenges posed by creating an artificial <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> do not work, and we identified some of the biological mechanisms that can explain this lack of success. We further established a set of research questions with the overall goal of constructing a working artificial <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas.</b> The first paper {{describes the}} in vivo (pig model) testing of a prototype of a new intravascular continuous glucose monitor, the IvS- 1. The study determined that the monitor was able to produce readings with a reasonably fast response time that highly agreed with simultaneously drawn blood samples. The second study examined the pharmacological properties of intravenous insulin boluses, and estimated the time delays from insulin administration until changes in the blood glucose level. The third study demonstrated that blood glucose levels were the same in the arterial and venous systems, even at times of great circulatory stress. The fourth study relied on our accumulated knowledge to enable us to construct an artificial <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> using the IvS- 1 and a novel insulin regulatory algorithm based on insulin boluses. We then regulated the blood glucose level in diabetic pigs in a proof-of-concept study. The thesis concludes by answering the research questions, and asserts that the construction of an artificial <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> is possible from a biological standpoint However, there are several serious technological challenges that have to be overcome {{in order to make a}} stable system for in-hospital – and later outpatient – use.

40|$|The <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> {{comprises}} the islets of Langerhans, tiny clusters of cells that contribute only about 2 % {{to the total}} pancreas mass. However, this little endocrine organ plays {{a critical role in}} maintaining glucose homeostasis by the regulated secretion of insulin (by β-cells) and glucagon (by α-cells). The rapid increase in the incidence of diabetes worldwide has spurred renewed interest in islet cell biology. Some of the most widely prescribed oral drugs for treating type 2 diabetes include agents that bind and activate the nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. As a first step in addressing potential roles of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and other nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) in the biology of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas,</b> we have used quantitative real-time PCR to profile the expression of all 49 members of the mouse NHR superfamily in primary islets, and cell lines that represent α-cells (αTC 1) and β-cells (βTC 6 and MIN 6). In summary, 19 NHR members were highly expressed in both α- and β-cell lines, 13 receptors showed predominant expression (at least an 8 -fold difference) in α- vs. β-cell lines, and 10 NHRs were not expressed in the <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas.</b> In addition we evaluated the relative expression of these transcription factors during hyperglycemia and found that 16 NHRs showed significantly altered mRNA levels in mouse islets. A similar survey was conducted in primary human islets to reveal several significant differences in NHR expression between mouse and man. These data identify potential therapeutic targets in the <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> for the treatment of diabetes mellitus...|$|R

40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} and altered <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> function are central pathophysiological features of {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM). The Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat {{is a model of}} spontaneous T 2 DM characterised by reduced beta cell mass and genetically determined glucose intolerance and altered insulin secretion. To identify genetic determinants of <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> histopathology, we carried out quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of histological phenotypes (beta cell mass -BCM and insulin-positive cell area -IPCA) and plasma concentration of hormones and growth factors in a F 2 cohort derived from GK and normoglycemic Brown Norway rats. Although IPCA and BCM in the duodenal region of the pancreas were highly positively correlated (P    4) to growth hormome (GH) on chromosome 6 and prolactin on chromosome 17. These data suggest independent genetic control of the structure and function of ontologically different regions of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas.</b> Novel QTLs for corticosterone, prolactin and GH may contribute to diabetes in the GK.

The present study demonstrates that adult human pancreatic duct cells can be converted into insulin-expressing cells after ectopic, adenovirus-mediated expression of the class B basic helix-loop-helix factor neurogenin 3 (ngn 3), which is a critical factor in embryogenesis of the mouse <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas.</b> Infection with adenovirus ngn 3 (Adngn 3) induced gene and/or protein expression of NeuroD/β 2, Pax 4, Nkx 2. 2, Pax 6, and Nkx 6. 1, all known to be essential for β-cell differentiation in mouse embryos. Expression of ngn 3 in adult human duct cells induced Notch ligands Dll 1 and Dll 4 and neuroendocrine- and β-cell–specific markers: it increased the percentage of synaptophysin- and insulin-positive cells 15 -fold in ngn 3 -infected versus control cells. Infection with NeuroD/β 2 (a downstream target of ngn 3) induced similar effects.

Since GOS {{are known to}} stimulate colonic fermentation and GLP- 1 production by L-cells, while GLP- 1 stimulates proliferation and neogenesis of beta-cells, we hypothesized that early GOS consumption could modulate <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> maturation and possibly adult metabolism. Suckling rat pups were supplemented with GOS/inulin (3. 2 g. kg- 1), or control solution from days 5 to 15, half of the CTL animals being injected with Exendin- 4 (3 μg. kg- 1) as a reference. Half of the total pups were sacrificed at PND 8, while the others were weaned at PND 21 to standard chow and followed-up until PND 146. Caecocolonic concentration of fermentation products, portal concentration of total GLP- 1, density of colonic GLP- 1 producing L-cells, <b>endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> anatomy and response to oral glucose load were analyzed. At PND 8, GOS supplementation increased caecocolonic concentration of fermentation products (medians±interquartiles: 683 ± 611 μmoles. g- 1 vs 494 ± 721 for CTL) but did not significantly affect the portal concentration of GLP- 1 (267 ± 75 vs 328 ± 246 pM for CTL) nor the number of GLP- 1 - positive L-cells (75 ± 35 vs 90 ± 35 cells per cm 2). <b>Endocrine</b> <b>pancreas</b> proliferation was stimulated by Ex 4 but not by GOS/In.
