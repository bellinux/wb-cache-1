5000|$|Private airport fire {{services}} in the UK protect all <b>categories</b> of <b>airports</b> and aerodromes. They are usually referred to as Rescue and Firefighting Services. One of the biggest aviation fire services is operated by BAA. [...] Non-BAA airports operate their own fire services to comply with legislation which states that airports must be provided with RFFS. One such example is London City Airport; its website describes the principal objective of an airport fire and rescue service: [...] "as to save lives {{in the event of}} an aircraft accident or incident". The number and type of firefighting appliances based at an airport will be determined by the <b>airport's</b> <b>category.</b> <b>Airports</b> in the UK are categorised from 1 to 10. A <b>category</b> 10 <b>airport</b> caters for the biggest aircraft; the standards are determined by the Civil Aviation Authority.|$|R
