5|$|During the {{communist}} era, {{the legacy of}} Kafka's work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from {{the notion that he}} satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling Austria-Hungarian Empire, to the belief that he embodied the rise of socialism. A further key point was Marx's theory of <b>alienation.</b> While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of <b>alienation</b> were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated <b>alienation,</b> a 1963 conference held in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy. Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of <b>Alienation</b> was hinted at in early January 2014 and {{announced at the}} 2014 Sony Gamescom convention. In 2015, the developers released details of the gameplay and classes and its first trailer. According to Sony, the game would be released sometime in 2015; it was delayed until March 2, 2016. After another three-week delay, it was released {{as part of a}} Sony promotion releasing six games in seven weeks. Since the release of <b>Alienation,</b> Housemarque has updated the game with free and paid expansions. It received positive reviews, with praise for the twin-stick elements and cooperative multiplayer feature. Reviewers criticized the lack of a local co-op mode, which was later added, and the game's lack of variety in regard to weapons and ammunition.|$|E

5|$|<b>Alienation</b> is {{a shooter}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by Housemarque {{and published by}} Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released in April 2016 for PlayStation 4.

5|$|Grunge fuses {{elements}} of punk rock and heavy metal, {{such as the}} distorted electric guitar used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Like these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, a drummer and a singer. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as social <b>alienation,</b> apathy, concerns about confinement, and a desire for freedom.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the fortune}} {{as well as}} the {{constitution}} of Mr. Smart required the utmost care, he was equally negligent in the management of both, and his various and repeated embarrassments acting upon an imagination uncommonly fervid, produced temporary <b>alienations</b> of mind; which at last were attended with paroxysms so violent and continued as to render confinement necessary.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 9th century, Leo V reintroduced {{the policy of}} iconoclasm, but in 843 empress Theodora {{restored}} the veneration of icons {{with the help of}} Patriarch Methodios.

5|$|Manning's {{books have}} {{received}} limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues of gender, {{and are not}} easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war, racism, colonialism and imperialism, and examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional <b>alienation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about {{this in terms of}} the problem of <b>alienation.</b> As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of <b>alienation</b> but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E
50|$|On 10 May 1608, Crawford {{appeared}} before the Council and took the oath of allegiance, but was subsequently, on many occasions, proceeded against for his lawless proceedings. Ultimately his relatives, to prevent further <b>alienations</b> of the estates, placed him under surveillance in Edinburgh Castle, where he died in February 1621. The earldom passed to his uncle, Sir Henry Lindsay of Kinfauns.|$|R

50|$|Trade {{alone was}} unable to account for such large amounts of capital, mecessary to support not only {{numerous}} nobles, but also Populari grassi, men who had grown rich very fast, acquired estates on the Terraferma.

5|$|Moreno {{promoted}} stronger {{measures against}} the royalists. In July, he gave {{orders to the}} neighboring mayors to prevent the creation of secret groups, or activities that could promote <b>alienation.</b> He promoted a new decree of the Junta that called for trial and confiscation of goods for anyone that left the city without authorization, kept military weapons in secret, promoted popular <b>alienation</b> or discontent against the government, or wrote letters to people in other cities for such a purpose. Serious cases were usually punished with execution or exile. Some rich people exiled by this decree were Francisco Beláustegui, Olaguer Reynals, Norberto de Quirno y Echeandía, and Pablo Villariño. Manuel Andrés Arroyo y Pinedo, another rich man, blamed Moreno for these actions, accusing him of equaling disagreement with antipatriotism, and felt that the ideas of egalitarianism would only cause great evils. Those measures were also criticized by moderate supporters of the revolution, such as Gregorio Funes from Córdoba, who rejected the lack of proper trials, or Dámaso Uriburu, from Salta, who compared Moreno, Castelli, and Vieytes with the French Jacobins.|$|E
5|$|Several of Schubert's last songs (the Schwanengesang collection), {{composed}} {{during the}} period of the sketching of the last sonatas, also portray a deep sense of <b>alienation,</b> and bear important similarities with specific moments in the sonatas.

5|$|The Pied-Noir {{relationship}} with France and Algeria {{was marked by}} <b>alienation.</b> The settlers considered themselves French, {{but many of the}} Pieds-Noirs had a tenuous connection to mainland France, which 28 percent of them had never visited.

And inasmuch as the Tuscarora Indian Nation withholds such consent and refuses to convey to the licensee any of its lands, it follows that the mere consent of Congress, however express and specific, would avail nothing. Therefore, if s 177 is applicable to <b>alienations</b> effected by condemnation under s 21 of the Federal Power Act, the result would be that the Tuscarora lands, however imperative for the project, could not be taken at all.But s 177 is not applicable to the sovereign United States [...] [...] [...] [...]|$|R
