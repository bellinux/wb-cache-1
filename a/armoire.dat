25|$|The château is {{furnished}} by {{objects of}} times, styles and origins {{that are very}} different, from between the 15th and 19th centuries, and from Holland to Portugal. The most remarkable pieces of furniture are perhaps a large <b>armoire</b> from Strasbourg dating from 1700, or a Louis XIII cabinet with marquetry of jasmine flowers. But the most remarkable part is without any doubt {{the door of the}} vault in solid oak, which comes from the Château de Bury and dates from the French Renaissance.

The high choir is covered in gilded wood that {{permeates}} the structure, while the walls of the oratory (similarly covered in religious iconography) is covered in silver, likely retrieved from the old Convent of Jesus in Praia da Vitória, when the religious orders were extinguished. In the high choir are the choir stalls (or stacidia) of the congregation, with carved armrests consisting of mythical figures (including gryphons and chimeras). Within choir oculus are also a chinoiserie, a 17th-century organ and an exotic wood <b>armoire.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the insurrection of 10 August, Roland was {{reinstated}} as Interior Minister, but {{was dismayed}} {{by what he}} saw as the lack of progress made by the Revolution. As a provincial, he opposed the Montagnards who aimed at supremacy not only in Paris but in the government as well. His hostility to the Paris Commune prompted him to propose transferring the government to Blois; and his attacks on Robespierre and his associates made him very unpopular. After failing to seal the <b>armoire</b> de fer (iron chest) found in the Tuileries Palace, containing documents that indicated Louis XVI's relations with corrupt politicians, he was accused of destroying some of the evidence within. Finally, during the trial of the king, he and the Girondists demanded that the sentence should be decided by a poll of the French people rather than the National Convention. Two days after the king's execution, he resigned his office.|$|E

25|$|Toole {{took the}} {{rejection}} of the book in his intended form as a tremendous personal blow. He eventually ceased work on Dunces and for a time left it atop an <b>armoire</b> in his bedroom. He continued to teach at Dominican where he remained a favorite among the student body with his classes regularly filling up well before official registration. His comedic performances during lectures remained especially popular among students. He attempted to work on another novel which he titled The Conqueror Worm, a reference to death as portrayed in Edgar Allan Poe's poem of the same name, but he found little peace at home. Toole's mother persuaded him to take Dunces to Hodding Carter Jr., who was well known as a reporter and publisher for the Delta Democrat Times in Greenville, Mississippi, and was spending a semester teaching at Tulane. Carter showed little interest in the book, but complimented him on it. The face-to-face rejection Carter dealt Toole drove him further into despair and he became angry with his mother for causing him further embarrassment.|$|E

Over a five-year period, she sent it out to seven publishers and they each rejected it. [...] "Each time it came back I died a little," [...] she said. However, in 1976 she became aware that author Walker Percy was becoming a faculty member at Loyola University New Orleans. Thelma began a campaign of phone calls and letters to Percy to get him to read the manuscript. He even began complaining to his wife about a peculiar old woman's attempts to contact him. With time running out on his term as professor, Thelma pushed her way into his office and demanded he read the manuscript. Initially hesitant, Percy agreed to read the book to stop her badgering. He admitted to hoping it would be so bad that he could discard it after reading a few pages. Ultimately, he loved the book, commenting in disbelief: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Rembrandt Room Now {{called the}} Chandos Delta Dormitory. Immediately {{to the east}} of the Breakfast Parlour, {{originally}} dated 1748, the room was extended and redecorated in 1775. In a relatively plain room, the painting that {{used to be in the}} centre of the ceiling, Venus at her toilet by Vincenzo Valdrè was sold in 1922 along with the marble chimneypiece with its central relief of Hebe and Jupiter's Eagle. The room once contained eleven paintings attributed to Rembrandt although only three are considered so now, the rest being School of Rembrandt. All the paintings were sold in 1848.

50|$|Bedroom furniture, {{sometimes}} called a bedroom set or bedroom suite {{consists of a}} group of furniture in a bedroom or sleeping quarters. Pieces of furniture referred to as bedroom furniture usually include: beds, wardrobes, dressers, chests, nightstands, <b>armoires,</b> vanities, trunks, and mirrors. There are also many variations of these pieces as furniture styles have changed through time and as individual manufacturers have put their own spin on them.|$|R
50|$|Furniture {{and other}} items in {{bedrooms}} vary greatly, depending on taste, local traditions and the socioeconomic status of an individual. For instance, a master bedroom may include a bed of a specific size (double, king or queen-sized); one or more dressers (or perhaps, a wardrobe armoire); a nightstand; one or more closets; and carpeting. Built-in closets are less common in Europe than in North America; thus there is greater use of freestanding wardrobes or <b>armoires</b> in Europe.|$|R

60|$|Then began a {{great and}} arduous search; one that was {{infinitely}} difficult and exasperating; and full of pathos to the sympathetic man who watched him in silence. Mr. Hilton could not understand his movements as he felt his way about the room, opening drawers and <b>armoires,</b> now and again stooping down and feeling along the floor. He did not betray his presence, however, but moved noiselessly away as the other approached. It was a hideously real game of blindman's-buff, with perhaps a life as the forfeit.|$|R

The beds were ready for sleeping in, with their great bags of soft feathers, their thick blankets and silken coverlets. These {{more than anything else}} excited the dame's admiration.

In addition, the cloister often contained a fountain or well, where the monks could wash and draw water to drink. The single, double, and even triple and quadruple capitals of 12th-century cloisters' columns were carved with foliate forms derived from the Classical period, such as vine scrolls and acanthus leaves, real and imaginary animals in combat or in heraldic positions, secular images such as musicians, entertainers, hunters, saints' lives and biblical events. Piers bore narrative scenes or relief figures of apostles or saints.|$|R
