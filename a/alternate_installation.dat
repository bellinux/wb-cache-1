5000|$|Gobuntu {{was officially}} {{announced}} by Mark Shuttleworth on 10 July 2007 and daily builds of Gobuntu 7.10 {{began to be}} publicly released. The initial version, Gobuntu 7.10, was released on 18 October 2007, as an in text-only installer. The next release was the Long-Term Release codenamed [...] "Hardy Heron", which was also only made available as an <b>alternate</b> <b>installation</b> image.|$|E
50|$|This {{version of}} Xubuntu {{required}} 192 MB of RAM {{to run the}} standard live CD or to install it. The <b>alternate</b> <b>installation</b> CD required 64 MB of RAM to install Xubuntu. Either CD required 2.0 GB of free hard disk space. Once installed, Xubuntu 10.10 could run with as little as 128 MB of RAM, but the developers strongly recommended a minimum of 256 MB of RAM.|$|E
50|$|Ancient water {{features}} were powered using gravitational forces, man power or animals to pump in the water. Since the 18th century, {{the majority of}} water features have been powered by pumps. In the past, the power source was sometimes a steam engine, but in modern features it is almost always powered by electricity. There is an increasing range of innovative designs as the market becomes more established and people {{become more aware of}} <b>alternate</b> <b>installation</b> methods, such as solar power. The advantages of using solar power include environmental benefits, no electrical lines in the garden, and free energy.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the Bearing Deflectometer Investigation was to gain {{experience}} {{in the use of}} fiber optic displacement probe technology for bearing health monitoring in a liquid hydrogen turbo pump. The work specified in this Task Order was conducted in conjunction with Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory Contract F 04611 - 86 -C- 0010. APD conducted the analysis and design coordination to provide a displacement probe design compatible with the XLR- 134 liquid hydrogen turbo pump assembly (TPA). Specifications and requirements of the bearing deflectometer were established working with Mechanical Technology Instruments, Inc. (MTI). The TPA design accommodated positioning of the probe to measure outer race cyclic deflections of the pump inlet bearing. The fiber optic sensor was installed as required in the TPA and sensor output was recorded during the TPA testing. Data review indicated that no bearing deflection signature could be differentiated from the inherent system noise. <b>Alternate</b> sensor <b>installations</b> were not investigated, but might yield different results...|$|R
40|$|The Preliminary Phase {{of the new}} CLIC Test Facility CTF 3 {{consists}} of a low-charge demonstration of the elec-tron bunch train combination process on which the CLIC drive beam generation scheme is based. The principle of the combination relies on the injection of short electron bunches into an isochronous ring using RF deflecting cavi-ties. The commissioning of this facility started in Septem-ber 2001, with <b>alternating</b> periods of <b>installation</b> work and beam studies. In this paper, we present {{the status of the}} facility, the first beam measurements and the next steps to-wards the completion of the experiment. ...|$|R
40|$|Tem-se por objetivo avaliar radiograficamente, durante seis a 12 meses após a cirurgia e a instalação das próteses, o comportamento do osso {{cervical}} ao redor de implantes com plataforma expandida (XP 5, 0 mm) e com plataforma regular (ST 4, 1 mm) reabilitados com componentes protéticos de 4, 1 mm de diâmetro para ambos tipos de implantes, caracterizando o conceito do câmbio de plataforma (CP) ou platform switching (PS). Para isso, foram selecionados nove pacientes adultos, edêntulos da maxila e com seu reborde alveolar com pelo menos três meses de cicatrização pós exodontias, os quais receberam seis implantes de hexágono externo, instalados de forma intercalada e aleatória, ou seja, um implante de plataforma expandida (XP) e o siguinte de plataforma regular (ST) até completar os seis implantes. Todos os casos foram reabilitados em um período máximo de 24 horas após a instalação dos implantes, por meio de próteses provisórias fixas parafusadas de acrílico sem reforço metálico fundido. Os controles radiográficos ocorreram imediatamente depois da instalação das próteses denominado Tempo 0 = T 0; seis meses (Tempo 6 = T 6) e 12 meses (Tempo 12 = T 12). Também foi avaliada durante esses mesmos períodos a estabilidade dos implantes através da Análise de Frequência de Resssonância (Osstell Mentor) e denominados período 0, 6 e 12 = P 0, P 6, P 12, respectivamente. Dos 54 implantes instalados, um implante não osseointegrou e foi removido no controle de seis meses. Os resultados radiográficos mostraram perda óssea cervical presente em ambos os tipos de implantes. Os implantes ST com seis e 12 meses mostraram 1, 61 e 1, 99 mm de perda no sentido vertical respectivamente e no sentido {{horizontal a}} perda foi de 1, 07 e 1, 35 mm. Entretanto os implantes XP mostraram redução estatisticamente significante, apresentando no sentido vertical perda ossea de 1, 21 e 1, 76 mm em seis e 12 meses, e no sentido horizontal perda de 0, 89 e 0, 96 mm, respectivamente. Dentro dos limites deste estudo, pode-se considerar que a utilização do conceito platform switching nos implantes constitui uma opção viável para a redução da perda óssea peri-implantar durante o primeiro ano de observação deste trabalho. In the present study, {{the main purpose}} was to evaluate radiographically during six and twelve months after implants installation the cervical bone around external hexed implants with expanded platform (XP 5. 0 mm) and regular platform (ST 4. 1 mm) using 4. 1 mm diameter abutments for both implants system and supporting a full fixed temporary acrylic bridge submitted to immediate loading. Nine maxillary edentulous patients were treated {{in this study and}} each one received six external hexed implants, three of these implants were 5 mm diameter expanded cervical platform (XP, Biomet 3 i, USA) and the other three implants were regular diameter cervical platform (ST 4. 1 mm, Biomet 3 i, Brazil). All installed implants received standard diameter components (4. 1 mm Biomet 3 i), characterizing the platformswitching concept on the XP implants. The implants installation was performed in an <b>alternating</b> fashion. The <b>installation</b> process always was initiated from {{the right side of the}} mouth with one type of implant; the next implant had a different diameter at the cervical part. It all finalized with the installation of six implants on the left side of the maxilla. All cases were treated in a single surgical procedure to reduce trauma, using less drilling sequence to increasing the initial implant stability and the prosthetic components were installed during surgery to perform the ISQ analisys with the Osstell Mentor system. Final impression was taken for the fabrication of the fixed screw retained acrylic bridges, using the provisional metal sleeves for micro-unit abutments and delivered to the patients within 24 hours after surgery. At the placement of the restorations, 6 and 12 months later (named Time 0 = T 0, Time 6 = T 6 and Time 12 = T 12) radiographs were performed using the conventional parallel cone technique to observe the cervical bone behavior during these three periods. These x-rays were digitalized and measured with the Radio Cef/Radio Imp software. Also the ISQ of all implants was messure at abutment connection during surgery or Period 0 = P 0, six and 12 months later (P 6 and P 12, respectively). From the 54 implants placed, only one failed during the first control time, six months later. Peri implant cervical bone loss was found for both types of implants. The ST implants showed an average bone loss of 1. 61 and 1. 99 mm in the vertical direction and 1. 07 and 1. 35 mm in the horizontal direction, during 6 and 12 months of control. For the XP type of implants, we found 1. 21 and 1. 76 mm for the vertical direction messurements and 0. 89 and 0. 96 mm for the horizontal direction of bone loss during the same periods of observation. Within the limits of this study, both implants had good clinical result, but the XP implants rehabilitated under the platform switching protocol, showing less bone loss in vertical and horizontal components...|$|R
