5|$|NASA {{began to}} plan to resume staffed {{missions}} following the call by U.S. President George W. Bush on 14 January 2004 for a staffed {{mission to the}} Moon by 2019 {{and the construction of}} <b>a</b> <b>lunar</b> base by 2024. The Constellation program was funded and construction and testing begun on a staffed spacecraft and launch vehicle, and design studies for <b>a</b> <b>lunar</b> base. However, that program has been cancelled in favor of a staffed asteroid landing by 2025 and a staffed Mars orbit by 2035. India has also expressed its hope to send a staffed mission to the Moon by 2020.|$|E

50|$|The Lunar Landing Research Facility was an area at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia {{that was}} used to {{simulate}} Apollo Moon landings with <b>a</b> mock <b>Lunar</b> Module powered by a small rocket motor suspended from a crane over <b>a</b> simulated <b>lunar</b> landscape.|$|R
5|$|Although {{not officially}} announced, the {{original}} backup crew consisted of Fred W. Haise (CDR), William R. Pogue (CMP) and Gerald P. Carr (LMP), who were targeted for the prime crew assignment on Apollo 19. However, after the cancellations of Apollos 18 and 19 were finalized in September 1970 this crew would not rotate to <b>a</b> <b>lunar</b> mission as planned. Subsequently, Roosa and Mitchell were recycled {{to serve as}} members of the backup crew after returning from Apollo 14, while Pogue and Carr were reassigned to the Skylab program where they flew on Skylab 4.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 13's Fra Mauro {{mission was}} reassigned to Apollo 14, {{commanded}} in February 1971 by Mercury veteran Alan Shepard, with Stuart Roosa and Edgar Mitchell. This time {{the mission was}} successful. Shepard and Mitchell spent 33 hours and 31 minutes on the surface, and completed two EVAs totalling 9 hours 24 minutes, which was a record for the longest EVA by <b>a</b> <b>lunar</b> crew at the time.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Odine is a {{scientist}} and magic researcher from Esthar. He discovered the GFs and junctioning and engineered {{a machine that}} mimics Ellone's power. Seventeen years before the game, he developed the necessary technology to allow Laguna to entomb Adel. As a researcher of the Lunatic Pandora, he also helps {{to prevent it from}} reaching Tears' Point and initiating <b>a</b> <b>Lunar</b> Cry. Odine also plays a role in the plot to destroy Ultimecia, explaining how to survive time compression.|$|E
50|$|Pons is <b>an</b> <b>lunar</b> crater that {{is located}} {{to the west}} of the {{prominent}} Rupes Altai scarp. It lies to the southeast of the crater Sacrobosco, and southwest of Polybius. To the northwest along the same flank of the formation is the crater Fermat.|$|R

5|$|In either 549 or 550, the Gepids and Lombards again marched {{against each}} other but, {{according}} to Procopius, both armies panicked and no battle took place. As a result, a new war was avoided and Thurisind accepted Audoin's request for a two-year truce. According to István Boná, the panic {{may be linked to}} a natural phenomenon: <b>a</b> <b>lunar</b> eclipse took place on June 25/26, 549.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} lunar {{missions}} (Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 11) used a free return trajectory, keeping a flight path coplanar with the lunar orbit, {{which would allow}} a return to Earth in case the SM engine failed to make lunar orbit insertion. Landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated <b>a</b> <b>lunar</b> orbital plane change, which required a course change maneuver soon after TLI, and eliminated the free-return option.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} undeciphered scripts, {{there are many}} fanciful interpretations and claimed {{translations}} of rongorongo. However, apart from a portion of one tablet which {{has been shown to}} have to do with <b>a</b> <b>lunar</b> Rapa Nui calendar, none of the texts are understood. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment, assuming rongorongo is truly writing: the small number of remaining texts, the lack of context such as illustrations in which to interpret them, and the poor attestation of the Old Rapanui language, since modern Rapanui is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is therefore unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the project's conception, {{newspapers}} were reporting a rumor that the Soviet Union was planning to detonate a hydrogen bomb on the Moon. According to press reports in late 1957, an anonymous source had divulged to a United States Secret Service agent that the Soviets planned to commemorate the anniversary of the October Revolution by causing a nuclear explosion on the Moon to coincide with <b>a</b> <b>lunar</b> eclipse on 7 November. News reports of the rumored launch included mention of targeting {{the dark side of the}} terminator—Project A119 would also consider this boundary as the target for an explosion. It was also reported that a failure to hit the Moon would likely result in the missile returning to Earth.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes {{on the far side}} would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. <b>A</b> <b>lunar</b> zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E
5|$|German ethnologist Thomas Barthel, {{who first}} {{published}} the rongorongo corpus, identified three {{lines on the}} recto (side a) of tablet C, also known as Mamari, as <b>a</b> <b>lunar</b> calendar. Guy proposed {{that it was more}} precisely an astronomical rule for whether one or two intercalary nights should be inserted into the 28-night Rapanui month to keep it in sync with the phases of the moon, and if one night, whether this should come before or after the full moon. Berthin and Berthin propose that it is the text which follows the identified calendar which shows where the intercalary nights should appear. The Mamari calendar is the only example of rongorongo whose function is currently accepted as being understood, though it cannot actually be read.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Nobel Prize. Franck was awarded the Max Planck Medal of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft in 1951 and the Rumford Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences {{for his work on}} photosynthesis in 1955. He became an honorary citizen of Göttingen in 1953, and was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1964. He died suddenly from a heart attack while visiting Göttingen on 21 May 1964, and was buried in Chicago with his first wife. In 1967, the University of Chicago named the James Franck Institute after him. <b>A</b> <b>lunar</b> crater has also been named in his honour. His papers are in the University of Chicago Library.|$|E
5|$|Medieval Islamic astronomers gave Arabic {{names to}} many stars {{that are still}} used today and they invented {{numerous}} astronomical instruments that could compute {{the positions of the}} stars. They built the first large observatory research institutes, mainly for the purpose of producing Zij star catalogues. Among these, the Book of Fixed Stars (964) was written by the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, who observed a number of stars, star clusters (including the Omicron Velorum and Brocchi's Clusters) and galaxies (including the Andromeda Galaxy). According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, the Persian polymath scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni described the Milky Way galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of nebulous stars, and also gave the latitudes of various stars during <b>a</b> <b>lunar</b> eclipse in 1019.|$|E
5|$|Project A119, {{also known}} as A Study of Lunar Research Flights, was a top-secret plan {{developed}} in 1958 by the United States Air Force. The aim {{of the project was}} to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon which would help in answering some of the mysteries in planetary astronomy and astrogeology. If the explosive device detonated on the surface, not in <b>a</b> <b>lunar</b> crater, the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on earth with their naked eye, a show of force resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race and was also working on a similar project.|$|E
