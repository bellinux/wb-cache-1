5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed {{for the first few}} days after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they <b>are</b> <b>older,</b> the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E
5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who <b>are</b> <b>older</b> and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E

5|$|About 175,000 black {{residents}} departed New Orleans {{over the year}} following the storm, while only 100,000 returned, pushing the African American population to 59 percent, from 66 percent previously. The biggest impact {{has been on the}} middle-class blacks, given that most black professionals <b>are</b> <b>older</b> and more advanced in their careers, and the majority of the affluent and middle class are white.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some of the}} seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain {{appear to}} follow the {{expected}} age progression for a mantle plume trail, others, such as Denson Seamount, <b>are</b> <b>older</b> than that hypothesis would suggest. As a result, the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain has also been proposed by geoscientists to be a mix of ridge and mantle plume volcanism.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include an upset stomach. More {{significant}} side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater {{among those who}} <b>are</b> <b>older,</b> drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in {{the last part of}} pregnancy. It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears.|$|E

5|$|Salta {{today is}} still a very small settlement, home to {{approximately}} 35 people. Most of the houses are fairly modern bungalows, such as those named Barnfield, Heather Moor, Moss View and Tamberry, although there <b>are</b> <b>older</b> two-floor cottages {{on either side of the}} hamlet. Another bungalow is named Anchorage, which features a ship anchor scheme on its gates.|$|E
5|$|Several {{institutions}} in the city <b>are</b> <b>older</b> than 100 years—such as Bukit Bintang Girls' School (1893–2000, relocated to Taman Shamelin Perkasa in Cheras and renamed GIS Garden International school Seri Bintang Utara), the Victoria Institution (1893); Methodist Girls' School (1896); Methodist Boys' School (1897); Convent Bukit Nanas (1899), St. John's Institution (1904), Confucian Private Secondary School(1906), Kuen Cheng High School (1908) and Tsun Jin High School (1913).|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} facade, built {{during the}} 16thcentury in the Renaissance Herrera style, is oldest {{part of the}} cathedral and was named after Juan de Herrera, architect of the El Escorial monastery in Spain.

50|$|Moreover, the chronicles do {{not agree}} whether or not Saw Lu <b>was</b> <b>older</b> than Kyansittha, Anawrahta's other son. According to early chronicles, Kyansittha <b>was</b> <b>older</b> (20 years per Zata) and (two years per Maha Yazawin). However, later chronicles Yazawin Thit and Hmannan say Saw Lu <b>was</b> <b>older</b> by about one and two years, respectively.|$|R

5|$|Workers who <b>are</b> <b>older</b> {{typically}} start satellite nests {{and have}} more developed ovaries. Younger and lesser-developed workers join the satellite after its establishment. The distribution of workers between the main nest and satellite is very important because they are needed {{for the establishment of}} the satellite and for the continued running of the main nest. Although, after several months the main nest can become abandoned. If not enough workers follow the initial worker to the new nest, then it will most likely fail as a satellite.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they <b>are</b> <b>older</b> than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E
5|$|Cheetah fossils {{found in}} the lower beds of the Olduvai Gorge site in {{northern}} Tanzania {{date back to the}} Pleistocene. The extinct species of Acinonyx <b>are</b> <b>older</b> than the cheetah, with the oldest known from the late Pliocene; these fossils are about three million years old. These species include Acinonyx pardinensis (Pliocene epoch), notably larger than the modern cheetah, and A.intermedius (mid-Pleistocene period). While the range of A.intermedius stretched from Europe to China, Apardinensis spanned over Eurasia as well as eastern and southern Africa. A variety of larger cheetah believed to have existed in Europe fell to extinction around half a million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Major venues for concerts include BIC, Pavilion Theatre and O2 Academy. Built in 1984, the BIC is also {{a popular}} place for party {{political}} conferences and {{has been used by}} all three major political parties. Its four auditoria make it the largest venue on the south coast. The O2 and Pavilion <b>are</b> <b>older</b> and are both Grade II listed buildings. The O2, which opened in 1895 as the Grand Pavilion Theatre, was initially used as a circus and later for music hall theatre. The Pavilion opened in 1929 as concert hall and tea room while also providing a venue for the municipal orchestra. It continues to provide traditional entertainment today, presenting West End stage shows, ballet and operas. Bournemouth has more than 200 listed buildings, mainly from the Victorian and Edwardian eras, including three grade I churches; St Peter's, St Clement's and St Stephen's.|$|E
5|$|Other species {{names such}} as Cicuta bolanderi, Cicuta californica, and Cicuta curtissii <b>are</b> <b>older</b> names now {{recognized}} to be varieties of the widespread, morphologically variable Cicuta maculata. Cicuta maculata is now recognized to have four varieties: var. maculata, var. augustifolia, var. victorinii, and var. bolanderi. Phylogenetic analysis using the sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) loci was not conclusive but seems to show that C.bulbifera and C.virosa are monophyletic, while C.douglasii may not be. It was also suggested a specimen from California may warrant recognition as a distinct species. Other common names for the genus in general include poison parsnip, beaver poison, wild carrot, wild parsnip, and false parsley.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the sixteen}} {{counties}} in the U.S. state of Maine. Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District of Maine. Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise. Nine of the sixteen counties had their borders defined while Maine was still part of Massachusetts, and hence <b>are</b> <b>older</b> than the state itself. Even after 1820, the exact location of the northern border of Maine was disputed with Britain, until the question was settled and the northern counties signed their final official form, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. Almost all of Aroostook County was disputed land until the treaty was signed.|$|E

5|$|Tyler Walker, the ADR {{director}} of the English dub of the series, held auditions for six days, during which about 140 people came for the eighteen main roles. Walker states that {{this is probably the}} longest casting process Funimation has held. He comments that {{because there are a lot}} of characters and most of them <b>are</b> <b>older</b> men, a character type he does not work with often, choosing voice actors and familiarizing them with their characters was difficult. He asked many directors and actors for recommendations and mainly aimed to cast newcomers, as he felt Baccano! provided him a chance to discover newer talent. Walker wished to find actors who could provide the dialect and accents of the various time periods and locations, especially when casting for the characters with heavy European accents.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} cub {{emerges in}} most litters, usually a male. This cub is more active than its siblings {{and takes the}} lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier. The cubs open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, the cubs make short ventures outside the den with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they <b>are</b> <b>older.</b> The cubs are nursed for three to six months. Around {{the time they are}} weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt. The cubs often become capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not until they are around two to {{two and a half years}} old that they fully separate from their mother. Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males do so at four to five years.|$|E
5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they <b>are</b> <b>older,</b> orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E
