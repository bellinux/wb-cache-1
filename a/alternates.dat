5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To {{determine if a}} point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts {{the number of times}} the ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number is even if and only if the point is outside the polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and the point is outside. Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number <b>alternates</b> between even and odd, and the point at its tip <b>alternates</b> between outside and inside.|$|E

We show that all but five of the nonalternating knots up through eleven crossings and links up through ten crossing are almost <b>alternating.</b> We also prove that a prime almost <b>alternating</b> knot is either a hyperbolic knot or a torus knot. We then obtain a bound on the span of the bracket polynomial for m-almost <b>alternating</b> links and discuss applications...|$|R
