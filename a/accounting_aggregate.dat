40|$|The {{debate on}} whether natural {{disasters}} cause significant macroeconomic impacts and indeed hinder development is ongoing. Most analyses {{along these lines}} have focused on impacts on gross domestic product. This paper looks beyond this standard national <b>accounting</b> <b>aggregate,</b> and examines whether traditional and alternative national savings measures combined with adjustments {{for the destruction of}} capital stocks may contribute to better explaining post-disaster changes in welfare as measured by changes in consumption expenditure. The author concludes that including disaster asset losses may help to better explain variations in post-disaster consumption, albeit almost exclusively for the group of low-income countries. The observed effect is rather small and in the range of a few percent of the explained variation. For low-income countries, capital stock and changes therein, such as forced by disaster shocks, seem to play a more important role than for higher-income economies, where human capital and technological progress become crucial. There are important data constraints and uncertainties, particularly regarding the quality of disaster loss data and the shares of capital stock losses therein. Another important challenge potentially biasing the results is the lack of data on alternative savings measures for many disaster-exposed lower-income countries and small island states.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{evaluate}} the contribution of computers {{to the growth of}} value-added during the last 15 years in France. Following North American studies, we use traditional growth accounting methods to assess the relative size of two types of contribution : on the one hand the effect of computer diffusion on growth due to the accumulation of productive capital taking place within all industries; on the other hand the contribution to growth of the MFP growth achieved in the information technologies (IT) producing industries. We use individual firm data aggegated by industry, which provide us with a measure of the firm's computer stock. Diffusion effects turn out to be significant around 0, 3 point for an average annual value-added growth of 2, 6 % during the period 1987 - 1998. They are concentrated in a small number of industries that make an intensive use of computers. Multifactor productivity gains in IT industries also contribute significantly to growth (0, 4 point over the same period). All in all, we evaluate the contribution of computerization in France at 0, 7 point of annual growth during the period 1987 - 1998. Besides we show that computer use and multifactor productivity growth in the IT industries have significantly reduced the value-added price inflation by 0, 3 and 0, 4 point respectively for an average annual price growth of 1, 4 % between 1987 and 1998.

40|$|This paper enquires {{into the}} {{relationship}} of income as it is being measured in household surveys and the systems of national <b>accounting.</b> <b>Aggregate</b> figures on disposable incomes in Ireland and Austria are compared to the incomes measured in the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) for those countries. On the examples of Dublin and Vienna it is tentatively proposed how low income thresholds may be established with reference to regional accounts {{rather than on the}} basis of the median value measured in household surveys. The exercise reveals that a level of 40 % of disposable income per equivalent is roughly corresponding to the conventional at-risk-of-poverty line. The regional accounts based approach results in different poverty trends than conventionally assumed. Against the national 60 % median threshold poverty risks are decreasing in both cities. In view of aggregate wealth this holds only for Dublin whereas a significant increase of poverty would be suggested in Vienna between 1995 and 2000. A case is made hence that relationships of aggregate figures of wealth and the micro level income distribution would deserve more attention to finally arrive at more coherent income definitions. Since SNA aggregates are easily accessible even on regional levels and given that particularly high incomes from self employment or capital may not be sufficiently captured in household surveys, a poverty line on the base of aggregate wealth might do even better justice to a relative poverty concept. Ultimately it is argued that such cross referencing of established indicators and data sources would be mutually beneficial for European regional cohesion and social inclusion policies...|$|E

40|$|Russell Cooper and Andrew John {{have written}} an {{economics}} text aimed directly at students from its very inception. You’re thinking, ”Yeah, sure. I’ve heard that before. “ This textbook, Economics: Theory Through Applications, centers around student needs and expectations through two premises: …	Students {{are motivated to}} study economics if they see that it relates to their own lives. …	Students learn best from an inductive approach, {{in which they are}} first confronted with a problem, and then led through the process of solving that problem. Many books claim to present economics {{in a way that is}} digestible for students; Russell and Andrew have truly created one from scratch. This textbook will assist you in increasing students’ economic literacy both by developing their aptitude for economic thinking and by presenting key insights about economics that every educated individual should know. How? Russell and Andrew have done three things in this text to accomplish that goal: 1. Applications Ahead of Theory: They present all the theory that is standard in Principles books. But by beginning with applications, students get to learn why this theory is needed. The authors take the kind of material that other authors put in ”applications boxes“ and place it at the heart of their book. Each chapter is built around a particular business or policy application, such as (for microeconomics) minimum wages, the stock exchange, and auctions, and (for macroeconomics), social security, globalization, and the wealth and poverty of nations. Why take this approach? Traditional courses focus too much on abstract theory relative to the interests and capabilities of the average undergraduate. Students are rarely engaged and the formal theory is never integrated into the way students think about economic issues. And traditional books are organized around theoretical constructs that mean nothing to students. The authors’ applications-first approach ensures that students will not see chapters with titles like ”Cost Functions“ or ”Short-Run Fluctuations“. They introduce tools and ideas as and when they are needed. Each chapter is designed with two goals. First, the application upon which the chapter is built provides a ”hook“ that gets students’ attention. Second, the application is a suitable vehicle a vehicle for teaching the principles of economics. 2. Learning through Repetition: Important tools appear over and over again, allowing students to learn from repetition and to see how one framework can be useful in many different contexts. Each piece of economic theory in this text is first introduced and explained in the context of a specific application. Most are re-used in other chapters, so students see them in action on multiple occasions. As students progress through the book, they accumulate a set of techniques and ideas. These are collected separately in a ”toolkit“ that provides students with an easy reference and also gives them a condensed summary of economic principles for examination preparation. 3. A Student’s Table of Contents vs. An Instructor’s Table of Contents: There is no further proof that Russell and Andrew have created a book aimed specifically at educating students about economics than their two tables of contents. The Student’s Table of Contents speaks to students, piquing their interest to involve them in the economics, and a Instructor’s Table of Contents with the economics to better help you organize your teaching—and frankly, you don’t need to get excited by economics, you already are.

We also show that stock market returns have predictive content for future real GDP growth, while their predictive power varies with {{the length of the}} measurement window with annual stock market returns being the most powerful. Importantly, we find that the predictive content of our indices of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers is incremental to that of annual stock market returns. An in-depth investigation of consensus survey forecasts shows that professional macro forecasters revise their expectations of real economic activity {{in the direction of the}} predictive content of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers and stock market returns. Although macro forecasters are fully attuned to stock market return data, their forecasts of real GDP growth can be improved in a statistically and economically significant way using our indices of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers.

In additional analysis, we examine the association between stock market returns and the portion of subsequent real GDP growth that is predictable based on our indices of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers but that is not anticipated by stock market investors. We find that this portion is positively related to stock market returns, suggesting that the macro predictive content of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers is relevant for stock valuation.

The 2008 revision of the UNSNA standard national accounts tries to realign the system more with the modern realities of capital finance, but in the process, the original intention of the accounts to measure [...] "physical" [...] changes in wealth is, in some respects, superseded. According to OECD data for the year 2000, cited by the World Bank, physical capital represents only one-quarter of the capital stock of rich countries, and all the rest is [...] "intangible capital". But UNSNA national accounts were originally never designed to measure the [...] "intangible capital." [...] The contemporary concept of [...] "wealth creation" [...] is substantially different from the concept that was entertained in the mid-20th century, among other things because who exactly and legally owns the wealth, often becomes a secondary issue in business. An asset may be held which generates profit income, but it could be a borrowed asset via-via, or an asset the value of which can be difficult to define. This can create new problems for statisticians seeking to estimate additions to wealth.|$|R

Our empirical findings suggest that while India's forest wealth is substantial, net changes in this wealth are arguably not so large at least in relation to GNP. However, when viewed {{in the context of the}} wealth-diluting effects of population growth this implies a far larger additional savings effort is required to cover the (net) loss in forest values than otherwise appears to be the case. Finally, we examine ways in which the accounting approach that we adopt can be reconciled with approaches which stress conserving forest wealth...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{alternative}} role of large-scale money finance as a fiscal instrument for financing indirectly from black markets when an economy is heavily controlled. It demonstrates that (1) in the Japanese national <b>accounts,</b> <b>aggregate</b> expenditure exceeded aggregate income by income leakages to black markets under the strict price {{control of the}} wartime and postwar years 1937 - 1949, and (2) in order to cover a financial shortage resulting from such income leakages, private agents bartered directly with illegal dealers, but the government let the Bank of Japan (BoJ) underwrite public bonds instead of dealing directly with formal/poor agents or illegitimate/rich agents. The BoJ notes issued to the government were eventually held {{as a means to}} conceal income by illegal dealers. Some policy implications for currency reforms are also explored with consideration {{for the fact that the}} emergence of black markets necessitated the BoJ's direct underwriting...|$|R
40|$|Quarterly {{national}} accounts data are amongst {{the most important}} and eagerly awaited economic information available, with estimates of recent growth regarded as a key summary indicator of the current health of the Australian economy. Official estimates of quarterly output are, however, subject to uncertainty and subsequent revision. Hence, the official estimates of quarterly national <b>accounts</b> <b>aggregates,</b> with which policy-makers must work, may in practice be an inaccurate guide to their ‘true’ values, not just initially but even for some time after the event. In this paper we examine over 120 vintages of Australian GDP data to provide an historical assessment of the scale and persistence of real-time errors in the measurement of actual output. The issue of whether it is possible to obtain reliable real-time estimates of the output gap is addressed in detail in a companion paper (Gruen, Robinson and Stone 2002). Australia, monetary policy, real-time data...|$|R
40|$|Summaries The author {{examines}} aggregate and categorical fungibility for {{the recipient}} of untied foreign exchange. Aggregate fungibility considers {{the impact of the}} funds received on either external <b>account</b> <b>aggregates</b> such as imports or exports, or the overall level of revenue, expenditure and government borrowing. Analysis of categorical fungibility looks inside the item of most interest to the donor (import composition in the case of import support and sectoral expenditure for counterpart funds and budget aid). These questions are best answered by macroeconomic modelling, but the data are rarely available. Hence a more ad hoc approach must be used. Aggregate fungibility may be analysed through the construction of a counterfactual balance of payments and government budget, where behavioural reactions are judged by the evaluator on the basis of own analysis, existing studies and guestimates. Categorical fungibility may be analysed using the budget constraint approach in conjunction with a counterfactual government budget...|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of inclusive wealth indicators {{is also a}} recognized priority of the EU. The proposed 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) of the EC explicitly identifies this issue, by calling for further development and integration of economic and environmental indicators. The Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) proposes to streamline the collection of data required for designing environmental indicators. The EU also committed to the Aichi Accord at the CBD COP-10, in which Parties agree to integrate biodiversity into their national accounts. This {{is on top of}} the experimental ecosystem accounting framework that was launched in 2009. The European Environment Agency (EEA) proposed that given the compatibility of the design with the SNA, {{it would be possible to}} use one particular indicator, Consumption of Ecosystem Capital (CEC) to adjust National <b>Accounts</b> <b>aggregates</b> to create, in particular, CEC Adjusted Net Domestic Product and CEC Adjusted Net National Income.|$|R
