500|$|In May 2012, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Party" [...] {{during her}} [...] revue in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States' entertainment resort, hotel, casino and spa, Revel. Rebecca Thomas of MTV News described the performance, [...] "For {{one of our}} favorite numbers, 'Party,' the 4 singer donned full-on showgirl regalia in <b>a</b> <b>heady</b> rendition that saw confetti coming from the roof and dice-shaped beach balls being tossed through the crowd as dancers in large feathered headdresses magically turned up in the aisles." [...] Both, Maura Johnston of The Village Voice and Tris McCall of New Jersey On-Line noted that the confetti should have been dropped during the first or the last song. Dan DeLuca of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that [...] "Party" [...] was one of the [...] "beat-savvy booty-shaking workouts" [...] performed during the show.|$|E
500|$|Erin Martin of PopMatters {{said that}} [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] had euphoric properties. Martin said {{the song was}} [...] "a classic, triumphant dance number, and Rowland's {{powerhouse}} vocals ensure that this song has anthemic potential for years to come. This song just feels good to listen to". She {{also noted that the}} song was central to the concept and [...] "love-spreading message [...] Guetta delivers on the album as a whole." [...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed with the song's anthem credentials. [...] " [...] is further evidence that Rowland may no longer be resigned to living in Beyoncé [...] shadow. Fusing classic dance beats with <b>a</b> <b>heady,</b> emotionally charged vocal, it's a world away from the mid-tempo R numbers with which she started her solo career. In fact, this packs a punch from the very first listen, meaning it could well become one of the summer anthems of 2009." [...] However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was less impressed than the other critics, simply noting the song as [...] "a cheesy synthpop makeover of Coldplay's 'Clocks'." [...] Wood did however state that it was among Guetta's best work and was an example of when the DJ is [...] "most commercial".|$|E

[...] Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal commented that [...] "There are distinct elements of Drake's melancholic paranoia and The-Dream's high melodrama, too. But there's also <b>a</b> <b>heady</b> surreality surrounding Nostalgia, Ultra that makes it unique." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called it [...] "slick and intuitive ... full of astral soul that owes debts to Terence Trent D'Arby, Pharrell Williams, even Drake", adding that [...] " [...] sings casually but precisely, stretching out syllables as if he's forgetting to let them go." [...] NPR's Andrew Noz commented that [...] "It's his songwriting, smart and subtle, that sets Ocean far apart from that pack", adding that [...] "The finest moments of Nostalgia, Ultra orbit the same soul-baring and minutiae-obsessed space as Marvin Gaye's breakup opus Here, My Dear or any number of Prince's more idiosyncratic ballads". No Ripcord's Charlie Jebb wrote that [...] "Nostalgia, Ultra has more than enough good stuff to establish Ocean as an artist to watch," [...] calling it [...] " [...] R record with crossover potential without sacrificing soul that creates a complete picture of its author, warts and all." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, saying [...] "The film may be animated, and largely taken up with rats, but its pulse is gratifyingly human. And you {{have never seen a}} computer-animated feature with this sort of visual panache and detail." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "So many computer-animated movies are brash, loud and popping with pop-culture comedy, but Ratatouille has the warm glow of a {{favorite}} book. The characters are {{more than the sum of}} their gigabyte-consuming parts – they feel handcrafted." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Has Pixar lost its magic recipe? Ratatouille is filled with fairly generic animated imagery, a few modest chases, a couple of good gags, not a lot of laughs." [...] Scott Foundas of LA Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Bird has taken the raw ingredients of an anthropomorphic-animal kiddie matinee and whipped them into <b>a</b> <b>heady</b> brew about nothing less than the principles of artistic creation." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "It's not just the computer animation that is vibrantly three-dimensional. It's also the well-rounded characters... I defy you to name another animated film so overflowing with superfluous beauty." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "With Ratatouille, Bird once again delivers not just a great, witty story, but dazzling visuals as well." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "Like the burbling soup that plays a key part in Ratatouille, the movie is a delectable blend of ingredients that tickles the palette and leaves you hungry for more." ...|$|E

He joined an Orioles team that was managed by Ned Hanlon, featured Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler, and won the National League pennant with a 90-39 record. [...] In May 1896, The Sporting Life wrote that [...] "a prettier or <b>a</b> <b>headier</b> fielder than Jim Donnelly {{it would be difficult}} to find", but found it to be a pity that he was not more capable with the bat. [...] In the end, Donnelly's bat perked up considerably in his only season with the Orioles, as he compiled a [...]328 batting average with 14 doubles, 10 triples, 71 RBIs, and 38 stolen bases.|$|R

5000|$|Evan Rytlewski of The A.V.

[...] Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine said, [...] "A depiction of disorder and chaos, ... the album's approach integrates neatly into an overall sense of claustrophobic dread." [...] Reed Jackson of XXL said, [...] "The Roots have not only proven once again that {{they are one of}} hip-hop’s most consistent acts, but also one of the genre’s most important." [...] Hilary Saunders of Paste said, [...] "The Roots prove their mastery of mixing high and low culture for diverse audiences.

2500|$|In late February 2015, {{just after}} the band had {{finished}} the new album's drum tracks, Moreno told Rolling Stone that Deftones had written 16 songs during the album's sessions. He described the album as [...] "a little more of <b>a</b> <b>heady</b> record" [...] than the previous album. On May 15, 2015, Moreno was interviewed by Kerrang! about the new album, which he described as having [...] "a lot of different moods". He further explained {{that it was not}} a [...] "happy record", but also [...] "not a completely angry record". Despite reports of Carpenter's initial difficulty getting into the feel of the album, band members have noted the album's distinct collaborative nature. Vega utilized a six-string bass when recording the new material, helping to push the band into new sonic territory.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on Below Sea Level Recordings. opus.fm wrote: [...] "On Via Subterranea, their first full-length since 2001’s Atrocious Virgin, Portland’s Trance to the Sun conjures up <b>a</b> <b>heady</b> blend of goth, shoegaze, and psychedelia that brings to mind even such a landmark album as The Cure’s Disintegration. Like Robert Smith’s magnum opus, there’s a commitment {{on the part of}} Trance to the Sun to go big or go home. Ingrid Luna Blue’s voice is coy, ethereal, and sultry, delivering abstract lyrics like “I could disrupt the orbit of your distant molten eye” and even garden gnome-inspired streams-of-consciousness. Meanwhile, Ashkelon Sain’s guitar evokes middle-eastern textures, tears through soaring solos, and delivers haunting ambience — sometimes all in the same song. (To continue with the Disintegration comparison, think “Prayers for Rain” or “Homesick” rather than, say, “Lovesong.”)" ...|$|E
2500|$|By this time, Mussorgsky had freed {{himself from}} the {{influence}} of Balakirev and was largely teaching himself. In 1863 he began an opera – Salammbô – on which he worked between 1863 and 1866 before losing interest in the project. During this period he had returned to Saint Petersburg and was supporting himself as a low-grade civil-servant while living in a six-man [...] "commune". In <b>a</b> <b>heady</b> artistic and intellectual atmosphere, he read and discussed {{a wide range of}} modern artistic and scientific ideas – including those of the provocative writer Chernyshevsky, known for the bold assertion that, in art, [...] "form and content are opposites". Under such influences he came more and more to embrace the ideal of artistic realism and all that it entailed, whether this concerned the responsibility to depict life [...] "as it is truly lived"; the preoccupation with the lower strata of society; or the rejection of repeating, symmetrical musical forms as insufficiently true to the unrepeating, unpredictable course of [...] "real life".|$|E

2500|$|Michael Cragg of musicOMH argued, [...] "For {{the most}} part, the {{strength}} of the songwriting should keep the doubters at bay, Goulding and producer Starsmith concocting <b>a</b> <b>heady</b> mix of skyscraping choruses, twinkling beats and Goulding's elastic vocals." [...] In a mixed review, Claire Allfree of Metro viewed the album as [...] "undeniably pretty aerated synthpop" [...] and praised songs like [...] "Starry Eyed" [...] ("pulsingly pert") and [...] "The Writer" [...] ("a lilting melodic hook"), but felt that [...] "Goulding's girly, heartfelt voice is oddly depthless, while the electronic vapour and four-to-the-floor house beats swoop in a wash of perfectly calibrated bland sound." [...] In a review for the NME, Mark Beaumont critiqued that [...] "there's nothing here groundbreaking enough to justify the critical frothing. It's largely straight-ahead folk-pop dappled with a mild ground-frost of sequenced beats, Auto-Tune, and synth sizzles." [...] Drowned in Sound's David Renshaw opined that [...] "Lights sounds like a naïve folk album given a blog house remix" [...] and concluded, [...] "Devoid of a true soul or sense of honesty Lights can be a pretty hollow listen." [...] The Guardians Alexis Petridis was unimpressed, dismissing the album as [...] "general acoustic singer-songwriter material".|$|E
2500|$|Kirby {{spent nearly}} two years {{negotiating}} a deal to move to DC Comics, where in late 1970 he signed a three-year contract with an option for two additional years. He produced a series of interlinked titles under the blanket sobriquet [...] "The Fourth World", which included a trilogy of new titles— New Gods, Mister Miracle, and The Forever People— {{as well as the}} extant Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen. Kirby picked the latter book because the series was without a stable creative team and {{he did not want to}} cost anyone a job. The central villain of the Fourth World series, Darkseid, and some of the Fourth World concepts, appeared in Jimmy Olsen before the launch of the other Fourth World books, giving the new titles greater exposure to potential buyers. The Superman figures and Jimmy Olsen faces drawn by Kirby were redrawn by Al Plastino, and later by Murphy Anderson. Les Daniels observed in 1995 that [...] "Kirby's mix of slang and myth, science fiction and the Bible, made for <b>a</b> <b>heady</b> brew, but the scope of his vision has endured." [...] In 2007, comics writer Grant Morrison commented that [...] "Kirby's dramas were staged across Jungian vistas of raw symbol and storm...The Fourth World saga crackles with the voltage of Jack Kirby's boundless imagination let loose onto paper." ...|$|E
2500|$|The A.V. Club {{reviewer}} Michaelangelo Matos {{opined that}} [...] "while One Life Stands mindset is Hot Chip's most overtly serious, {{the album is}} also its most musically accomplished. The melodies are Alexis Taylor and Joe Goddard's longest-lined, and the melodies often unfurl beautifully." [...] Ian Mathers of PopMatters viewed it as [...] "Hot Chip's most kinetic album" [...] and stated that [...] "One Life Stand may be less pleasingly idiosyncratic than Hot Chip's previous work, but it pays off in their most consistently winning set of songs to date. It's still not quite as raucous as their incredible live show, [...] but those who felt that Made in the Dark never built up enough momentum ought to find this one's straightforward drive more satisfying." [...] Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork named One Life Stand the band's [...] "most consistent and most complete record", but remarked that [...] "it's missing an A-list single on par with 'Boy From School', 'Over and Over', or 'Ready for the Floor'. It's also missing dance songs {{in the mode of}} the latter two, focusing instead on Hot Chip at their most lush and romantic." [...] Drowned in Sound's Hayden Woolley wrote that the album [...] "sees their familiar pick'n'mix genre-shopping combined with unprecedented levels of Mills & Boon sentimentality. It's <b>a</b> <b>heady</b> cocktail, but when mixed in the right proportions the results are stunning." [...] Jamie Fullerton of NME concluded that the album [...] "does have some of the best songs of the year on it. But, again, waiting for Hot Chip to make that classic album is a bit like waiting for an alcoholic parent to arrive at your birthday party. There's a kind of unconditional love that'll keep you hoping every time one comes around, but there may be a point where you have to accept that it's just never going to happen." [...] Chris Beanland of BBC Music felt that [...] "his is an imbalanced record, and one that leaves you frustrated rather than elated. But despite the blips, they have dished up at least two cerebral bangers here." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent characterised it as [...] "an album full of earnest endeavour, but lacking verve and creative zest." ...|$|E

2500|$|Few {{critics of}} Beves of Hampton have shared Eugen Kölbing's opinion that, [...] "The strain {{in which this}} work is written, is serious, even severe". More {{recently}} Derek Pearsall {{was one of those}} who took the diametrically opposite view: [...] "Beves of Hamtoun makes every possible concession to popular taste. The story is <b>a</b> <b>heady</b> brew of outrageous incident... the whole fantastic pot-pourri is carried off with irresistible panache and a marked sense of the comic. It is vivid, gross and ridiculous by turns, but never dull." [...] Again, it has been said that [...] "Bevis of Hampton is not a remarkable example of medieval romance. It is made up of stock motifs and episodes... the articulation of the episodes is loose and inexpert. What gives the romance its chief distinction is its exuberance, its racy, buoyant style, and the spirit of broad humor in which it is written." [...] Dieter Mehl called it [...] "extremely lively and entertaining, though on the whole rather artless". [...] In other words, the poem is often treated as an example of what G. K. Chesterton and George Orwell called the [...] "good bad book", having the characteristics that make for readability and popular success rather than high literary quality. W. R. J. Barron was not enthusiastic about works of this kind: [...] "The English versions of Bevis and Guy are competent but somewhat vulgarized, given to the reduplication of striking effects, paying lip-service to the heroes' values while almost wholly preoccupied by their adventures". Other critics have found themselves enjoying Beves almost in spite of themselves. George Kane wrote that it [...] "has a better effect than its component material would seem to warrant, for this almost formless story, with its miracles and marvels, ranting Saracens and dragons, is told without any polish or skill in a style generously padded and tagged, with little sense of poetic or narrative art, and still the romance is more than merely readable. As with Horn and Havelok we tolerate its artistic crudity for the sake of the company of the hero and heroine, Beues and Iosiane, who reflect the warm humanity of the imagination that created them." [...] The romance's most recent editors considered that [...] "If the values of the hero are not particularly deep, they are nonetheless heartfelt, and expressed with admirable verve. And we should be reluctant to underestimate the value of a good adventure story or the difficulty of producing one. Its energy and its variety, perhaps more than anything, are what enable modern readers to understand its earlier popularity and also to respond to it in the present." ...|$|E

But since the Cephalaspis and the Coccostëus many a fine animal has increased and multiplied upon the earth, lorded it over land or sea without a rival, and passed at last into the night.
