5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of lettuce}} {{over the centuries}} has resulted in several changes through selective breeding: delayed bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf shapes <b>and</b> <b>colors.</b> Work in these areas continues through the present day. Scientific research into the genetic modification of lettuce is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and United States to test modifications allowing greater herbicide tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower bolting patterns. However, genetically modified lettuce is not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E

5|$|At Kaufmann's request, Denver artist Allen Tupper True {{was hired}} to handle the design and {{decoration}} of the walls and floors of the new dam. True's design scheme incorporated motifs of the Navajo and Pueblo tribes of the region. Although some initially were opposed to these designs, True was given the go-ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist. With {{the assistance of the}} National Laboratory of Anthropology, True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings, textiles, baskets and ceramics. The images <b>and</b> <b>colors</b> are based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, water, clouds, and local animals— lizards, serpents, birds— and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas. In these works, which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam, True also reflected on the machinery of the operation, making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern.|$|E
5|$|Players will {{be granted}} {{experience}} points upon each match. After they have collected sufficient experience points, players can level up, by which new armor, skins, weapons, and power-ups would be unlocked for players to use. Both the player character and weapon can be customized extensively by applying new skins <b>and</b> <b>colors</b> onto them. In addition, players can receive hack modules while playing the game, which are special abilities {{that can only}} be used once after they are collected. There are six types of modules. Scout reveals the locations of all enemies to the player for a limited time after respawning, while Vital Signs shows all enemies' health. Retribution allows players to track their last killer by showing their health and location, while Power Seeker guides players to the power weapon pickup in the game. The Resupply Timer, meanwhile, shows the respawn time of the power-up items. Players can also perform taunts in the game's multiplayer.|$|E

Super Mario RPG was released on Virtual Console for Wii U in Japan on August 5, 2015, in Europe and Australia on December 24, 2015, and in North America on June 30, 2016.

5|$|Pool of Radiance {{is based}} on the same game {{mechanics}} as the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rule set. As in many role-playing games (RPGs), each player character in Pool of Radiance has a character race and a character class, determined {{at the beginning of the}} game. Six races are offered, including elves and halflings, as well as four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief). Non-human characters have the option to become multi-classed, which means they gain the capabilities of more than one class, but advance in levels more slowly. During character creation, the computer randomly generates statistics for each character, although the player can alter these attributes. The player also chooses each character's alignment, or moral philosophy; while the player controls each character's actions, alignment can affect how NPCs view their actions. The player can then customize the appearance <b>and</b> <b>colors</b> of each character's combat icon. Alternatively, the player can load a pre-generated party to be used for introductory play. These characters are combined into a party of six or less, with two slots open for NPCs. Players create their own save-game files, assuring character continuation regardless of events in the game. On an MS-DOS computer, the game can be copied to the hard-disk drive. Other computer systems, such as the Commodore 64, require a separate save-game disk.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: When {{examining}} the shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> {{for a new}} product in an initial process of industrial design, they should be suitable for the product’s functionality, targeted image and concept. Additionally, it is also important that the shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> differ from those of existing products so that the new design is distinctive to attract consumer attention. To support designers in their endeavor to come up with new designs, we propose a computerized method of analyzing existing designs and searching for a possible usage of shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> different from the existing designs. First, we mathematically define feature indices to represent and quantify shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> characteristics of designs. Then, we analyze the usage of shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> in existing designs, which are obtained as 3 D CAD data or 3 D shape data scanned from real products, by calculating the feature indices of the designs. By plotting the calculated results as a vector in shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> feature indices space, we obtain the distribution of shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> usages of the existing designs. Here, we assume that the distance between the two vectors in the space represents the difference in shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> usages of the two designs. Based on the assumption, we search for a possible new shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> usage by searching for a new vector in the space which is as far from any of the existing vectors as possible. Once such a new vector is obtained, we visualize the suggested usage of shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> by generating 3 D polygon model examples with the feature indices quantified by the vector. We examine the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed idea by implementing it as a computer program and applying it to designs of &quot;card stands &quot; as simple actual product examples...|$|R

The idea {{in this study is}} to empirically evaluate the effect of texture <b>and</b> <b>color</b> features to the query. Retrieval capability of those features is first evaluated separately and finally the combined effect is studied. Finally, the goal is to find out what kind of features, or combination of features, yield the most successful results for certain types of query images. 1...|$|R
