40|$|The {{application}} of transfer functions to map data values to visual properties as, e. g., color and opacity, {{is a crucial}} step in direct volume rendering.

40|$|Researchers {{have succeeded}} in partly {{restoring}} damaged vestibular functionality in several animal models. Recently, acute interventions have also been demonstrated in human patients. Our previous work on a vestibular implant for humans used predefined stimulation patterns; here we present a research tool that facilitates motion-modulated stimulation. This requires a system that can process gyroscope measurements and send stimulation parameters to a hybrid vestibular-cochlear implant in real-time. To match natural vestibular latencies, the time from sensor input to stimulation output should not exceed 6. 5 ms. We describe a system based on National Instrument's CompactRIO platform that can meet this requirement and also offers floating point precision for <b>advanced</b> <b>transfer</b> functions. It is designed for acute clinical interventions, and is sufficiently powerful and flexible {{to serve as a}} development platform for evaluating prosthetic control strategies. Amplitude and pulse frequency modulation to predetermined functions or sensor inputs have been validated.
