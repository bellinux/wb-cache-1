Based on a fictional town in Indiana, Riley presented many stories and poems about its citizens <b>and</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> It received mixed reviews among literary critics who wrote of it that Riley's stories were not of the same quality as his poetry.

5|$|The renewed {{interest}} in residential schools in the early 1800s {{has been linked to}} the decline in military hostility faced by British settlers, particularly after the War of 1812. With the threat of invasion by American forces minimized, Indigenous communities were no longer viewed as allies but as barriers to permanent settlement. This perspective was further underscored by the transfer of affairs with Indigenous communities from military officials, familiar with and sympathetic to their customs <b>and</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> to civilian representatives concerned only with permanent colonial settlement.|$|E
5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream <b>and</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E

5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom <b>and</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership.
