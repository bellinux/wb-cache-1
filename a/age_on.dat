5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million years ago to present). Initial volcanism began on {{the summit of the}} volcano, depositing lava in and adjacent to the Level Mountain Range. This activity is indirectly dated as Pleistocene <b>age</b> , <b>on</b> the bases of the presence of subglacial and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and the Level Mountain Range, was volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E
5|$|From the Second <b>Age</b> <b>on,</b> Quenya {{was also}} used ceremonially by the Men of Númenór and their {{descendants}} in Gondor and Arnor for the official names of kings and queens; this practice was resumed by Aragorn {{when he took the}} crown as Elessar Telcontar. Quenya in the Third Age had almost the same status as the Latin language had in medieval Europe, and was called Elven-latin by Tolkien.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} year of his {{contract}} extension with the Sabres in the 2014–15 season, Hodgson suffered the worst season in his professional career, contributing with just 6 goals and 13 points in 78 outings for the cellar-dwelling Sabres. With the option to buy-out his contract at a lower rate due to his <b>age,</b> <b>on</b> June 29, 2015, the Sabres, {{in the midst of a}} rebuild, placed Hodgson on unconditional waivers in order for a release to free agency.|$|E
5|$|Robert's father, William Tatton, {{drowned in}} the River Mersey when Robert was 10 years old. As the only male heir Robert {{inherited}} his father's estate in Wythenshawe, but as a minor he was made a ward of the king, Charles I, until he came of <b>age.</b> <b>On</b> 9January 1628, Robert married Anne Brereton, the third daughter of William Brereton of Ashley. The couple went on to have four sons and two daughters.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} yielded no finds, {{and thus}} it produced no means of reliably dating {{the construction of the}} site.

5|$|Brazilian {{independence}} did {{not meet}} with unanimous approval in the south. Part of the army, led by Dom Álvaro de Macedo (later Count of Ilha da Madeira), entrenched itself in Montevideo and remained loyal to Portugal. The town was besieged by forces under Laguna. Following his return from the imperial capital, Marques de Sousa served under his father's command, {{taking part in the}} siege and later fighting in the successful Battle of Las Piedras on 18 May 1823. In early 1824, Macedo and his men surrendered. The end of the Brazilian War of Independence came at a cost for Marques de Sousa. His father was mysteriously murdered with poison in Montevideo on 21 November 1824, leaving him the head of his family at age 20, as his paternal grandfather had died (of old <b>age)</b> <b>on</b> 22 April 1822. He was promoted to lieutenant (modern-day first lieutenant) on 1 December 1824 for his acts of bravery during the war.|$|E
5|$|Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, George Strait, and Willie Nelson are Black's biggest musical influences. His {{style is}} {{traditional}} country. His voice {{is described as}} a smooth baritone and was initially compared to Merle Haggard. Black was self-taught on harmonica, guitar and bass at an early <b>age.</b> <b>On</b> his studio albums he plays acoustic and electric guitars as well as harmonica. In concert he plays primarily guitar, but does play drums and harmonica. Today, Clint Black is still an inspiration to new, up and coming country artists, as expressed by performers such as Jon Pardi and Aaron Watson.|$|E

5|$|Robinson did {{not long}} outlive his son. Complications {{from heart disease}} and {{diabetes}} weakened Robinson and made him almost blind by middle <b>age.</b> <b>On</b> October 24, 1972, nine days after his appearance at the World Series, Robinson {{died of a heart}} attack at his home on 95 Cascade Road in North Stamford, Connecticut; he was 53 years old. Robinson's funeral service on October 27, 1972, at Upper Manhattan's Riverside Church adjacent to Grant's Tomb in Morningside Heights, attracted 2,500 mourners. Many of his former teammates and other famous baseball players served as pallbearers, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave the eulogy. Tens of thousands of people lined the subsequent procession route to Robinson's interment site at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, where he was buried next to his son Jackie and mother-in-law Zellee Isum. Twenty-five years after Robinson's death, the Interboro Parkway was renamed the Jackie Robinson Parkway in his memory. This parkway bisects the cemetery in close proximity to Robinson's gravesite.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{documentation}} {{that allows}} us to reconstruct a genealogy of artists after Gasparo, from his son Simone onwards. Though little information is available about Simone, it appears that no works are attributed directly to him; rather, he appears to have worked as a builder when outside his father's workshop. In a bill dated 1534, Simone declares his age as 38, born in 1496, and around twenty years of <b>age</b> <b>on</b> his father's death. He also cites his firstborn son Gasparo, twelve years old, in turn a sculptor, his wife Catlina, sister of the engraver Andrea Testi of Manerbio. A daughter of Gasparo, Giulia, became the wife of an artisan potter, while a third child, Giovanni Antonio, was a qualified goldsmith, as indicated in a deed relating Stefano Lamberti and Bernardino delle Croci.|$|E

5|$|When Richard {{was five}} years old, his mother {{gave birth to a}} younger brother, Henry Philips, who died at four weeks of <b>age</b> <b>on</b> February 25, 1924. Four years later, Richard's sister Joan was born, and the family moved to Far Rockaway, Queens. Though {{separated}} by nine years, Joan and Richard were close, as they both shared a natural curiosity about the world. Their mother thought that women did not have the cranial capacity to comprehend such things. Despite their mother's disapproval of Joan's desire to study astronomy, Richard encouraged his sister to explore the universe. Joan eventually became an astrophysicist specializing in interactions between the Earth and the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|When Wackett {{left the}} Air Force on 31December 1959, he was its longest-serving officer. The {{next year he}} joined the Australian National Airlines Commission (ANAC), the {{controlling}} body of the federal government's domestic carrier, Trans Australia Airlines (TAA). He rose to the Vice Chairmanship of ANAC before retiring in 1968. During his term on the commission, Wackett witnessed {{the arrival of the}} Jet <b>Age</b> <b>on</b> domestic air routes; TAA took delivery of its first Boeing 727 in 1964, and its first Douglas DC-9 in 1967. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Like his brother Lawrence, who wrote two books on the subject, Ellis Wackett's chief hobby was angling. He died in Warracknabeal, Victoria, on 3August 1984; his wife predeceased him in 1975.|$|E
5|$|As the Messi {{family had}} {{relatives}} in Catalonia, {{they sought to}} arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but {{the board of directors}} hesitated; {{at the time it was}} highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young <b>age.</b> <b>On</b> 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.|$|E

5|$|Most bovids are polygynous. In a few species, {{individuals}} are monogamous, resulting in minimal male-male aggression and reduced selection for large body size in males. Thus, sexual dimorphism is almost absent. Females may be {{slightly larger than}} males, possibly due to competition among females for the acquisition of territories. This {{is the case in}} duikers and other small bovids. The time taken for the attainment of sexual maturity by either sex varies broadly among bovids. Sexual maturity may even precede or follow mating. For instance the impala males, though sexually mature by a year, can mate only after four years of <b>age.</b> <b>On</b> the contrary barbary sheep females may give birth to offspring even before they have gained sexual maturity. The delay in male sexual maturation is more visible in sexually dimorphic species, particularly the reduncines, probably due to competition among males. For instance, the blue wildebeest females become capable of reproduction within a year or two of birth, while the males become mature only when four years old.|$|E
5|$|The 2/14th Battalion {{was raised}} on 26 April 1940 at Puckapunyal, Victoria, {{shortly after the}} start of World War II as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), which was {{established}} at the time from personnel that had volunteered to serve in combat overseas. The battalion was assigned to the 21st Brigade, 7th Division, and would remain part of this formation throughout its existence. It had an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, and most of those were drawn from the state of Victoria, although some were allocated from other states later as reinforcements. Many of the battalion's initial recruits had previous military experience, having served in the Militia prior to volunteering for the 2nd AIF, with the majority having to relinquish rank to transfer. Officially the battalion's average <b>age</b> <b>on</b> formation was 29, although the battalion historian, William Russell, asserts that this is not necessarily accurate as men were found to have altered their ages both up (from as young as 15) and down (from as old as 55) upon recruitment. In keeping with 2nd AIF recruitment practices, there were many pairs of brothers who were early recruits; there was even one case of a father and son who served in the same platoon.|$|E
