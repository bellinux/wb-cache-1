It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

Paul Simon suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: [...] " [...] early songs were very rich... with strong melodies.

[...] Slant Magazine listed the album at number 60 on their list of [...] "The 100 Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] and stated that [...] "True Blue was the album on which it became readily apparent that Madonna {{was more than just}} a flash-in-the-pan pop star."

Cusick stated that most of his scenes were filmed with Haig and John Noble (Walter Bishop), and that the story leaves a possibility for the return of their characters in the future. Noble found it unusual to film an episode that did not involve the lead actors. He explained, [...] "That was Walter with two really big, important guest stars, Henry Ian Cusick and Georgina Haig. It felt, to me, like it was <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> episode. The two guest actors did a fantastic job, which is not easy to do, to step into an established company. It is out of the box and is somewhere else completely. I think that the fans will love it. Some fans of this type of material will like it anyway because Henry Ian Cusick was such a big star in Lost, but also, this new girl is just full of wonderful energy, too." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Vandernoot {{wanted to}} leave the show because {{shooting}} Highlander was too demanding and required her to spend several months each year in Canada. Vandernoot also wanted {{to spend more time}} with her family. According to Abramowitz, a further, artistic, reason was that [...] "...a small part of [...] being <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> actress wanted to play a more aggressive part in the show and sadly, the nature of the beast was that it couldn't happen and she made a decision." [...] Panzer said that creating interesting female characters in the Highlander franchise was often a challenge because the producers found it difficult to [...] "...have the women be something other than a victim, a hostage, other things when [...] dealing with an immortal hero." [...] Consequently, the creative staff needed to write Tessa out of the show but [...] were restricted because of the character's strong relationship with MacLeod. Associate Creative Consultant Gillian Horvath said that, [...] "There was no way... to have a scene where she said, 'Okay, I'm going to go to Paris without you. Nice knowing you, MacLeod.'" [...] The writers decided that the only solution was for Tessa to die, despite Abramowitz's feeling that her death was [...] "...sad" [...] and [...] "...heartbreaking".|$|E

[...] He further stated: [...] "We did it and I am very happy for the team because we had <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> weekend and it feels great to win in this fashion." [...] Lotterer said of the result: [...] "It's no holds barred {{all the time and}} is very fun, especially at Spa-Francorchamps. It's for this type of race that we hit track." [...] Dumas, who finished in second alongside Lieb and Jani, stated he found driving in dry weather conditions difficult because he was not experienced participating in such conditions. Lieb said his battle with Tréluyer was [...] "great" [...] and said the contact between the two drivers was part of motor racing. Jani stated while he did not win the race he praised his car. Third-place co-finisher Webber said that his team had [...] "too many own goals" [...] and that they did not wanted to be [...] "gifted results" [...] if they were not performing at the highest level. Bernhard said that despite taking the stop-and-go penalty his team did not give up and gave it their best effort to stand on the podium.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed, {{triggering a}} media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said, [...] "A lot of nights {{it felt like}} quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed {{by a lot of}} people in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> dose of reality and it was quite hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, [...] "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something." [...] During a transmission for the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite, [...] "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of [...] "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, eventually fulfilling this commitment on their 1997 PopMart Tour.|$|E

Plus we have a political anthem at the end as well. So, while there are some elements that people have heard in previous albums of mine, I also think there are some things people HAVEN'T heard from me before. And I think that's what makes the album interesting. In particular I feel I've made different arrangement and production choices this time. While I don't think my writing style itself has changed significantly, sonically the main difference is that we chose to use more electronic instruments on this record." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{is indeed}} the only real vitalization of character, {{and of all the}} supersensual, even heroic and artistic {{portions}} of man or nationality. It is to run through and knit the superior parts, and keep man or State vital and upright, as health keeps the body straight and blooming. Of course <b>a</b> <b>really</b> grand and <b>strong</b> and beautiful character is probably to be slowly grown, and adjusted strictly with reference to itself, its own personal and social sphere--with (paradox though it may be) the clear understanding that the conventional theories of life, worldly ambition, wealth, office, fame, &c., are essentially but glittering mayas, delusions.|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to {{stepping out of}} the Jackson family shadow, Control established Jackson as one of the preeminent female artists of popular music, rivaling fellow pop star Madonna, as critics began to acknowledge their influence on the record industry and younger artists. Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8: Genres: North America (2012) documents that both women redefined house music, repackaging it [...] "as part of a global metropolitan pop aesthetic." [...] With regard to marketing singles, Paul Grein of Billboard reported: [...] "10 or 20 years ago you would have had two singles from an album at the most. Now we're in an era where Madonna is on her fifth single from the album True Blue and Janet Jackson is on her sixth from the LP Control." [...] Jackson subsequently became the first female artist to produce six top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 from a single album. Los Angeles Times writer Paul Grein wrote a segment titled [...] "The influence of Madonna and Janet Jackson", reporting Debbie Gibson's manager Doug Breitbart claimed [...] "Madonna has brought back <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>strong,</b> melodic component to pop music", while Teen Beat editor Maggie Murphy remarked [...] "Janet Jackson may have started this more than anyone else." [...] Anthony DeCurtis, author of Present Tense: Rock & Roll and Culture (1992) wrote that [...] "Madonna and Janet Jackson have produced videos that explore the female gaze," [...] and described Jackson's music video for [...] "Nasty" [...] as feminist theory on film that deconstructs the objectification of women. The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) documented that within two years of the release of Control, [...] "a new crop of female singers (such as Paula Abdul and Karyn White) were charged with imitating Janet." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone remarked: [...] "Control—with its quintuple-platinum sales and string of hit singles—established" [...] a then-twenty-year-old Jackson [...] "as {{one of the most popular}} recording artists in the world."

Bert Gangl of The Phantom Tollbooth gave it a three and a half out of five stars, writing that the album [...] "taken as a whole, the new record, in spite of its intermittent musical tangents – or perhaps because of them – winds up being one of the Crown collective's most cohesive, and impressive, releases to date." [...] Ed Cardinal of Crosswalk.com said the album was [...] "as strong and yet relatively safe as anything it has done before" [...] and praised it as [...] "sure to be among 2011’s most popular and enduring Christian albums". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel praised the album's songwriting and said the album [...] "is a solid effort in the Crowns discography".

A brilliant way to open the second album campaign and a proper world class piece of pop tuneage which doesn't have quite all the indecipherable mysterious magic of [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] but still boasts more than 97% of other pop tunes". Nick Levine of Digital Spy favoured the song, saying, [...] "Leona delivers it beautifully. In fact, her vocal run from 2:39 to 2:44 could be the most incredible five seconds of singing we've heard all year.

Preparing for the role, where she did most of her action stunts herself, Munn has trained gymnastics, taekwondo (in addition to her own black belt), and sword-fighting six hours every day for three months, and also underwent a special diet to get in shape, losing 12 pounds in process. Some stunts were performed by her double Julia Rekaikyna. Psylockes provocative latex costume was made by a sex shop in Los Angeles; Munn changed its color from standard film X-Men black to purple and experienced various problems with wearing it.
