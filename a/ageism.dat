25|$|Old {{people often}} have limited {{regenerative}} abilities {{and are more}} susceptible to disease, syndromes, and sickness than younger adults. The organic process of ageing is called senescence, the medical study of the aging process is called gerontology, and the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is called geriatrics. The elderly also face other social issues around retirement, loneliness, and <b>ageism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Emanuel co-wrote, The {{complete}} lives system discriminates against older people. Age-based allocation is <b>ageism.</b> Unlike allocation by sex or race, allocation by age is not invidious discrimination; {{every person}} lives through different life stages {{rather than being}} a single age. Even if 25-year-olds receive priority over 65-year-olds, everyone who is 65 years now was previously 25 years. Treating 65-year-olds differently because of stereotypes or falsehoods would be ageist; treating them differently because they have already had more life-years is not.|$|E

25|$|Riot grrrl bands often {{address issues}} such as rape, {{domestic}} abuse, sexuality, racism, patriarchy, and female empowerment. Primary bands associated with the movement include Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Excuse 17, Huggy Bear, Skinned Teen, Emily's Sassy Lime and Sleater-Kinney, as well as queercore groups like Team Dresch and The Third Sex. In addition to a music scene and genre, riot grrrl is a subculture involving a DIY ethic, zines, art, political action, and activism. The riot grrrl movement quickly spread well beyond its musical roots to create vibrant “zine” and World Wide Web-based movement, complete with local meetings and grassroots organizing to end <b>ageism,</b> homophobia, racism, sexism and, especially, physical and emotional violence against women and girls. Riot grrrls are known to hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music.|$|E
25|$|Elderspeak is a {{specialized}} speech style used by younger adults when addressing older adults. The speaker makes accommodations that include producing shorter, less complex sentences, using simpler vocabulary, filler words, fragmented sentences, lexical filters, and repetition. Elderspeak also includes using {{terms that are}} overly endearing, asking closed questions that prompt an answer, and using the collective “we”. Young people tend to speak at a slower rate and include more pauses when communicating with elders. This speech style is often patronizing in nature and resembles baby talk. Elderspeak stems from a reliance on stereotypes about cognitive abilities of older persons, and its use may {{be a result of}} or contribute to <b>ageism,</b> a form of discrimination based on age differences. Young people tend to believe that aging is associated with cognitive declines, including declines in language processing and production. However, this speech pattern is primarily based on stereotypes, as evidenced by its use in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. When conversing with older persons, younger people often accommodate their speech based on their personal evaluation of their conversation partner’s ability, rather than their actual ability. Working to overcome elderspeak through awareness and self-monitoring as well as through formal educational programs are strategies individuals and other care providers can use to promote successful aging for older clients. Therefore, although some aspects of elderspeak may be beneficial for some recipients, it is generally seen as inappropriate and can hinder intergenerational communication.|$|E

In an interview with Wootton in The Sun, the singer called the omission [...] "unfair" [...] and [...] "discriminatory", and felt [...] that <b>ageism</b> was a taboo that is still not being talked about. She also recalled discussing the incident with her manager Guy Oseary and admitted that it was perplexing for her to learn that artists in their fifties do not get played on radio, without exceptions. [...] "We've made so many advances in other areas— civil rights, gay rights— but <b>ageism</b> is still an area that's taboo and not talked about and dealt with," [...] she concluded.|$|E

500|$|The Radio 1 Madonna {{controversy}} was {{a series}} of events that occurred as a result of BBC Radio 1's decision not to playlist American singer Madonna's single [...] "Living for Love" [...] in February 2015. Despite receiving moderate airplay from commercial radio in the United Kingdom, the single was not added to Radio 1's playlist, leading to accusations of <b>ageism.</b> The controversy stemmed from an article that appeared in the Daily Mail, which quoted an unnamed Radio 1 insider describing Madonna as [...] "old" [...] and [...] "irrelevant". In response, the singer's fans posted numerous requests for the song on BBC's social media accounts, and several artists criticized Radio 1's music policy, prompting the station to release a statement defending their decision not to play the track.|$|E
500|$|The BBC {{was quick}} to refute {{allegations}} of <b>ageism,</b> and explained that songs were chosen {{on a case-by-case basis}} for inclusion on their weekly playlist. Their representative noted that Sir Paul McCartney had two songs on the playlist, although critics pointed out that both of these tracks were collaborations with younger artists (McCartney featured on [...] "Only One", with Kanye West, and [...] "FourFiveSeconds", with Rihanna). The station further listed David Guetta, the Foo Fighters, and Sia as examples of older artists making their playlist. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Radio 1's controller Ben Cooper explained that the station has not [...] "banned" [...] Madonna, and that a group of twelve 16–24 aged personnel would meet on a regular basis to review the network's musical output, determining the relevant musical choice for their demographic.|$|E
500|$|The American Youth Congress {{was formed}} in 1935 to {{advocate}} for youth rights in U.S. politics, and was responsible for introducing the American Youth Bill of Rights to the U.S. Congress. Roosevelt's relationship with the AYC {{eventually led to the}} formation of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. The NYA was headed by Aubrey Willis Williams, a prominent liberal from Alabama who was close to Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. Speaking of the NYA in the 1930s, Roosevelt expressed her concern about <b>ageism,</b> stating that [...] "I live in real terror when I think we may be losing this generation. We have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary." [...] In 1939 the Dies Committee subpoenaed leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the Young Communist League. Roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited the subpoenaed witnesses to board at the White House during their stay in Washington D.C. Joseph P. Lash was one of her boarders. On February 10, 1940, members of the AYC, as guests of Roosevelt in her capacity as First Lady, attended a picnic on the White House lawn where they were addressed by Franklin from the South Portico. The President admonished them to condemn not merely the Nazi regime but all dictatorships. The President was reportedly booed by the group. Afterwards, many of the same youth picketed the White House as representatives of the American Peace Mobilization. Among them was Joseph Cadden, one of Roosevelt's overnight boarders. Later in 1940, despite Roosevelt's publication of her reasons [...] "Why I still believe in the Youth Congress," [...] the American Youth Congress was disbanded. The NYA was shut down in 1943.|$|E
500|$|Harrison Ford reprises {{the role}} of Dr. Henry [...] "Indiana" [...] Jones, Jr. To prepare for the role, the 64-year-old Ford spent {{three hours a day}} at a gym, practiced with the bullwhip for two weeks, and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables. Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film. He {{performed}} many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance. It is also said that he still fit into his pants from Raiders of the Lost Ark. He argued, [...] "The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness. His physicality {{is a big part of}} it, especially the way he gets out of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places. My ambition in action is to have the audience look straight in the face of character and not at the back of a capable stuntman's head. I hope to continue that no matter how old I get." [...] Ford felt his return would reduce U.S. <b>ageism</b> (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: [...] "This is a movie which is geared not to [...] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment ... We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints." [...] He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script. Spielberg said Ford was not too old to play Indiana: [...] "When a guy gets to be that age and he still packs the same punch, and he still runs just as fast and climbs just as high, he's gonna be breathing a little heavier at the end of the set piece. And I felt, 'Let's have some fun with that. Let's not hide that. Spielberg recalled the line in Raiders that said, [...] "It's not the years, it's the mileage," [...] and felt he could not tell the difference between Ford during the shoots for Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E

2500|$|Intersectionality is the {{examination}} of various ways {{in which people are}} oppressed, based on the relational web of dominating factors of race, sex, class, nation and sexual orientation. Intersectionality [...] "describes the simultaneous, multiple, overlapping, and contradictory systems of power that shape our lives and political options". While this theory can be applied to all people, and more particularly all women, it is specifically mentioned and studied within the realms of black feminism. Patricia Hill Collins argues that black women in particular, have a unique perspective on the oppression of the world as unlike white women, they face both racial and gender oppression simultaneously, among other factors. This debate raises the issue of understanding the oppressive lives of women that are not only shaped by gender alone but by other elements such as racism, classism, <b>ageism,</b> heterosexism, ableism etc.|$|E

5000|$|Barbara Anne Macdonald (nee Charles, September 11, 1913 - June 15, 2000) was {{a social}} worker, lesbian feminist and <b>ageism</b> activist. Macdonald {{believed}} that <b>ageism</b> was a [...] "central feminist issue" [...] and made it the core of her activism. At the time, she was a [...] "lone voice" [...] fighting against and talking about <b>ageism.</b> Macdonald felt that <b>ageism</b> divided women and that the stigma of aging became a trap. In addition, Macdonald felt that defining women by their familial roles was the central contributor to <b>ageism.</b> She felt that older women tend {{to be seen as}} caretakers and mother-figures instead of as individuals. Macdonald used her anger to fuel her activism and through her anger, she identified many aspects of age-related issues that affect older women, such as poverty, physical challenges caused by age, violence against older women, and health issues: all of which she felt were not adequately addressed by younger feminists. Macdonald's activism inspired the formation of the group Old Lesbians Organizing for Change, which works in the United States to fight <b>ageism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Based on a {{conceptual}} analysis of <b>ageism,</b> a new definition of <b>ageism</b> {{was introduced by}} Iversen, Larsen, & Solem in 2009. This definition constitutes the foundation for higher reliability and validity in future research about <b>ageism</b> and its complexity offers {{a new way of}} systemizing theories on ageism: [...] "Ageism is defined as negative or positive stereotypes, prejudice and/or discrimination against (or to the advantage of) elderly people {{on the basis of their}} chronological age or on the basis of a perception of them as being 'old' or 'elderly'. <b>Ageism</b> can be implicit or explicit and can be expressed on a micro-, meso- or macro-level" [...] (Iversen, Larsen & Solem, 2009).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ageism</b> {{can be seen}} {{as another}} type of {{discrimination}} throughout Hollywood; which effects more women than men. <b>Ageism</b> can be defined as; [...] "A systematic stereotyping of and discrimination against people because they are old, just as racism and sexism accomplish this with skin color and gender. Old people are categorized as senile, rigid in thought and manner, old-fashioned in morality and skills .... <b>Ageism</b> allows the younger generation to see older people as different from themselves; thus they subtly cease to identify with their elders as human beings" [...] <b>Ageism</b> is not a new phenomenon to Hollywood. Women are always cast younger and younger beside an actor well above her senior. For example, “in the 1942 classic Casablanca, Ingrid Bergman, 27, played opposite Humphrey Bogart, 16 years older than her” ...|$|E
