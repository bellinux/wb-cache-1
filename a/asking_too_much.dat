5|$|Revie {{was offered}} a five-year £100,000 {{contract}} (plus £50,000 signing-on fee) by Everton in the summer, but remained with Leeds after the move broke down due to a new law introduced in Parliament that prevented wage rises to curb inflation. He chose to continue with largely the same line-up for the 1973–74 season. He told his squad that the aim for the season would be to go unbeaten throughout the campaign. Though Leeds failed to achieve this as they lost three successive games in February/March, they did secure the title with a five-point lead over Liverpool. Completely focused on the league, and finally accepting that he was <b>asking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of his players to try and win every competition he played weakened teams to allow an early exit from the UEFA Cup. He chose {{to take the job}} of England national football team manager ahead of leading a European Cup challenge at Leeds and breaking up the ageing team he had stuck with for many years, and though he was well loved at the club he was not popular with the Leeds boardroom members, who appointed Brian Clough, a fierce critic of Revie as his successor. Despite lasting just 44 days in the job, Clough spent more in transfer fees than Revie had in his 13 years at the club.|$|E
25|$|Changes in the {{schedule}} or environment, delusions, hallucinations, misperceptions, and sleep problems also may trigger behavior changes. It {{can help people}} with DLB to encourage exercise, simplify the visual environment, stick to a routine, and avoid <b>asking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> (or too little) of them. Speaking slowly and sticking to essential information improves communication. The potential for visual misperception and hallucinations, {{in addition to the}} risk of abrupt and dramatic swings in cognition and motor impairment, should put families on alert to the dangers of driving with DLB.|$|E
2500|$|Southam's school {{proved to}} be stiffer {{competition}} than its predecessors. In 1856, both schools heeded a suggestion made by James Kay, the doctor and educationist, to approach Owens College {{with a view to}} a merger. E. M. Brockbank, a medical historian, says that [...] " [...] propositions apparently rather amazed the College people as being too one-sided- the schools giving too little and <b>asking</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> ...There were in the proposals, [...] said, a request for space, for power of administration, and for {{a large portion of the}} income of the College." [...] Thus the idea was abandoned and, later in the same year, the two medical schools amalgamated. The teaching then took place at Chatham Street until 1861 while improvements were made to the Pine Street premises. Those improvements included construction of a more imposing frontage on the Faulkner Street elevation; when the Chatham Street premises were sold and teaching transferred back to Pine Street, the school address was advertised as [...] "Faulkner Street behind the Infirmary" [...] and it became colloquially known as the Faulkner Street school from then onwards.|$|E

6000|$|This was {{a terrible}} question. Bartley {{knew nothing about the}} prices that city papers paid; he feared to <b>ask</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> but he also feared to cheapen his wares by <b>asking</b> <b>too</b> little. [...] "Twenty-five dollars," [...] he said, huskily.|$|R
