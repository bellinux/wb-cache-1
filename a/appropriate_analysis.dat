50|$|James J. Gibson, too, {{stressed}} the importance of the environment, in particular, the (direct) perception of how the environment of an organism affords various actions to the organism. Thus, an <b>appropriate</b> <b>analysis</b> of the environment was crucial for an explanation of perceptually guided behaviour. He argued that animals and humans stand in a 'systems' or 'ecological' relation to the environment, such that to adequately explain some behaviour it was necessary to study the environment or niche in which the behaviour took place and, especially, the information that 'epistemically connects' the organism to the environment.|$|E

A 2011 European Commission systematic review based its efficacy on York's review conclusion. A 2015 Cochrane systematic review estimated a reduction in cavities when water fluoridation was used by children who had no access to other sources of fluoride to be 35% in baby teeth and 26% in permanent teeth. The evidence was of poor quality.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems in analyzing a clinical trial is the occurrence of the dropout. Under the Declaration of Helsinki, patients in clinical trials must participate entirely voluntarily and must have the right to leave the trial at any time. This ethical imperative makes missing data an inevitable problem of clinical trials, and requires <b>appropriate</b> <b>analysis</b> methods to account for it. Since patients often drop out because they find a treatment doesn't seem to be working for them or because it causes harmful side effects, missing data is often correlated with the treatment's efficacy or safety. This type of selection bias makes a reliable assessment of a clinical trial's results particularly difficult. Methods to address missing data make assumptions about the relationship between dropout and study results in order to produce results which account for the missing data. Because the assumptions underlying a particular method may be inappropriate to a given study, care and expertise is required to address the issue.|$|E
50|$|The company shares {{its name}} with its {{flagship}} product, Code Dx Enterprise. Enterprise is a vulnerability management system that combines and correlates the results {{generated by a}} wide variety of static and dynamic testing tools. For static analysis, the product installs and configures several bundled open source static analysis tools, and also connects automatically to a variety of commercial tools. The software selects the most <b>appropriate</b> <b>analysis</b> tool or tools for the language(s) in which the tested application is written, and maps the results of those tools (which vary according to the tool) to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). For dynamic testing, Enterprise gathers the results of dynamic tool tests and integrates them into its vulnerability reports. In situations during which several tools are run simultaneously, results are consolidated and redundancies are removed. Identified vulnerabilities are mapped to various industry standards (like OWASP Top 10 and Web Application Security Consortium). Additionally, it identifies sections of code that are not compliant with applicable regulatory standards, such as HIPAA software regulations. The product supplies a visual interface that makes it simpler to identify vulnerability trends within the source code of the tested application.|$|E

5000|$|The Supreme Court {{used the}} four-part Cort v. Ash test for several years, and in {{applying}} the test, [...] "for the most part, the Court refused to create causes of action." [...] An important {{application of the}} test, however, came in Cannon v. University of Chicago (1979), which recognized an implied private right of action. There, a plaintiff sued under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibited sex discrimination in any federally funded program. The Court, stating that the female plaintiff was within the class protected by the statute, that Congress had intended to create a private right of action to enforce the law, that such a right of action {{was consistent with the}} remedial purpose Congress had in mind, and that discrimination was a matter of traditionally federal and not state concern. Justice Powell, however, dissented and criticized the Court's approach to implied rights of action, which he said was incompatible with the doctrine of separation of powers. It was the job of Congress, not the federal courts, Justice Powell said, to create causes of action. Therefore, the only <b>appropriate</b> <b>analysis</b> was whether Congress intended to create a private right of action. [...] "Absent the most compelling evidence of affirmative congressional intent, a federal court should not infer a private cause of action." ...|$|E

Aitchison(1986) provides a framework appropriate for data that satisfies sub-compositional coherence, i. e., where conclusions about a sub-composition should be the same based on the full composition or the sub-composition alone. However, not all compositional data satisfies this principle and it is helpful to consider the complete cycle of processes that yield any specific dataset and hence the <b>appropriate</b> <b>analysis</b> for data generated in this manner. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
