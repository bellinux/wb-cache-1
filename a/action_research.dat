50|$|Motivation is the {{reasoning}} behind an individual's <b>actions.</b> <b>Research</b> has found that students with higher academic performance, motivation and persistence use intrinsic goals rather than extrinsic ones. Furthermore, students who are motivated to improve upon their previous or upcoming performance tend to perform better academically than peers with lower motivation. In other words, students with higher need for achievement have greater academic performance.|$|R
2500|$|Qualitative research, such as case studies, <b>action</b> <b>research,</b> {{discourse}} analysis, {{and clinical}} interviews, depend on small but focused samples {{in an attempt}} to understand student learning and to look at how and why a given method gives the results it does. Such studies cannot conclusively establish that one method is better than another, as randomized trials can, but unless it is understood why treatment X is better than treatment Y, application of results of quantitative studies will often lead to [...] "lethal mutations" [...] of the finding in actual classrooms. Exploratory qualitative research is also useful for suggesting new hypotheses, which can eventually be tested by randomized experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative studies therefore are considered essential in education—just as in the other social sciences. Many studies are “mixed”, simultaneously combining aspects of both quantitative and qualitative research, as appropriate.|$|E

[...] participation in <b>action</b> <b>research</b> practices are particular ways of living and understanding that require more of the researcher than the [...] "application" [...] of research methods. Rather, <b>action</b> <b>research</b> is a lived practice that requires that the researcher not only investigate the subject at hand but, as well, provide some account {{of the way in}} which the investigation both shapes and is shaped by the investigator [...] This requires what Martin Buber called an [...] "I-Thou" [...] approach toward other and this approach applied to <b>action</b> <b>research</b> as well. To make Buber's language more modern and accessible, LET translated Buber's [...] "I-Thou" [...] approach toward another human being to an [...] "I/you/we" [...] approach to <b>action</b> <b>research.</b> This differs greatly from an approach to living theory <b>action</b> <b>research</b> imagined by Jack Whitehead (2002) where he imagines living theory <b>action</b> <b>research</b> as forming an [...] "I-theory" [...] of knowledge. Director of the Philosophy for Children Project at Notre Dame de Namur University William Barry proposes LET focuses on the connections between the researcher and the other person or subject where the lives of action researchers are inextricable linked in a profound manner with the individuals and communities involved in the subject of study. LET from a Barryian perspective is a critical theory and emancipatory <b>action</b> <b>research</b> approach which seeks the dialectic, not debate and battles of discourse.|$|E
