5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E
5|$|Although fainter {{than its}} {{northern}} counterpart, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. Alpha and Beta Coronae Australis {{are the two}} brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1. Epsilon Coronae Australis is the brightest example of a W Ursae Majoris variable in the southern sky. Lying alongside the Milky Way, Corona Australis contains one of the closest star-forming regions to the Solar System—a dusty dark nebula known as the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, lying about 430 light years away. Within it are stars <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> stages of their lifespan. The variable stars R and TY Coronae Australis light up parts of the nebula, which varies in brightness accordingly.|$|E
5|$|As bronze working {{developed}} from about 2000 BCE, {{there was a}} decline in the building of large new structures, which, with a reduction of the total area under cultivation, suggests a fall in population. From the Early and Middle Bronze Age there is evidence of cellular round houses of stone, as at Jarlshof and Sumburgh on Shetland. At Jarlshof these are oval houses with thick stone walls, which may have been partly subterranean <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation. There is also evidence of the occupation of crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial islands, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters. They were often constructed of layers of brushwood and rubble. Sometimes they were revetted around the edges with vertical piles and sometimes surfaced with logs of oak.|$|E
30|$|Selfing in the {{maternal}} hermaphrodite were frequent among progeny derived from open pollination. This result suggests {{the absence of}} barriers to self-fertilization, such as dichogamy and self-incompatibility. These barriers do not function {{and are likely to}} be lost in dioecious willows. Unfortunately, we did not measure fitness components <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> stages of <b>the</b> life cyle, such as embryo development, seed germination and seedling performance, because we did not conduct controlled pollination. Inbreeding depression <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> life-cycle stages differed between outcrossing and selfing plants (Goodwillie and Knight, 2006; Ishida, 2008). Selfing plants tend to have lower magnitudes of inbreeding depression <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> stages than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> late stages of the life cyle because deleterious alleles expressed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> stages are effectively purged through inbreeding, while those <b>at</b> <b>the</b> late stages are difficult to purge even in inbred populations (Husband and Schemske, 1996). On the other hand, high magnitudes of inbreeding depression were expected <b>at</b> <b>the</b> both <b>early</b> and late life-cycle stages in predominantly outcrossing species because opportunities to purge deleterious alleles are rare (Husband and Schemske, 1996). Therefore, although abundant selfed progeny were found, the magnitude of inbreeding depression could have been as high <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> stages as <b>at</b> <b>the</b> late stages, when fitness components were measured as growth, survival and fertility of trees.|$|R

5|$|Because {{the maximum}} calibre of naval gun allowed under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was 40.6cm (16inch), Hitler soon had second {{thoughts}} about the guns {{to be used for}} the new ships and ordered that they be armed with 38cm (15inch) weapons. However, the 28.3cm turrets were readily available; 38cm turrets would take years to develop, and Hitler wanted capital ships as soon as possible to fulfill his political ideals. He was also reminded that, despite the allowances of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British had historically been sensitive about increases in main gun calibers aboard German capital ships. He therefore acquiesced to the ships' being armed with 28.3cm guns, with the provision that they be upgunned to 38cm <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> opportunity. The 38cm turret was eventually used in the s.|$|E
5|$|Faced with a {{shortage}} of both funds and men, the Senate decided to send an embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement. The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh: the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory, {{as well as all}} jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice, the Romagnan cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius, and reparations were to be paid to cover his expenses in capturing them. The Senate argued over the terms for two months, but finally accepted them on February 24, 1510. Even before the Venetian ambassadors had presented themselves to Julius for absolution, however, the Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> opportunity.|$|E

Stage is often advanced at the time of diagnosis. At presentation, 30–40% of cases of NSCLC are stage IV, and 60% of SCLC are stage IV. Survival for lung cancer falls as the stage at diagnosis becomes more advanced: the English data suggest that around 70% of patients survive at least a year when diagnosed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> stage, but this falls to just 14% for those diagnosed with the most advanced disease.|$|E

5|$|Understanding {{that they}} could not hold out against the might of the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped for a {{solution}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> opportunity. The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone's Colonial Secretary Lord Kimberley, then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the Battle of Majuba Hill the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit. This progressive humiliation of the Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, to paraphrase Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, stunned the Western world.|$|E
