25|$|The primary urge {{to breathe}} is {{triggered}} by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. Carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream when oxygen is metabolized <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be expelled as a waste product. The body detects carbon dioxide levels very accurately and relies on this as the primary trigger to control breathing. Hyperventilation artificially depletes the resting concentration of carbon dioxide causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called hypocapnia. Hypocapnia reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allows the delay of breathing and leaves the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from hypoxia. For most healthy people {{the first sign of}} low oxygen levels is a greyout or unconsciousness: there is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout.|$|E
25|$|The cell {{achieves}} {{its height}} {{in the water}} column by synthesising gas vesicles. As the cell rises up, it is able to increase its carbohydrate load through increased photosynthesis. Too high and the cell will suffer photobleaching and possible death, however, the carbohydrate produced during photosynthesis increases the cell's density, causing it to sink. The daily cycle of carbohydrate build-up from photosynthesis and carbohydrate catabolism during dark hours is enough to fine-tune the cell's position {{in the water column}}, bring it up toward the surface when its carbohydrate levels are low <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> photosynthesis, and allowing it to sink away from the harmful UV radiation when the cell's carbohydrate levels have been replenished. An extreme excess of carbohydrate causes a significant change in the internal pressure of the cell, which causes the gas vesicles to buckle and collapse and the cell to sink out.|$|E

500|$|As a young man, Kubrick {{was fascinated}} by the films of Soviet filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. Kubrick read Pudovkin's seminal {{theoretical}} work, Film Technique, which argues that editing makes film a unique art form, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be employed to manipulate the medium to its fullest. Kubrick recommended this work to others for many years. Thomas Nelson describes this book as [...] "the greatest influence of any single written work on the evolution of [...] private aesthetics".

2500|$|Khalīl further {{argues that}} the only reason the hamza in al- is ever dropped is not that it is {{volatile}} but that it is used too much. When asked why the lām in al- was not simply given a vowel if it is so heavily used <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be easier to pronounce, followers of Khalīl said that if the lām had been given a fatḥa, it would have been confused with the asseverative-cum-precative particle. Had it been given a kasra, it would have been confused with the genitival particle. It could not have been given a ḍamma for fear of the following vowel being a kasra or ḍamma (which would result in awkward pronunciations as in [...] *lu-ibil or [...] *lu-‘unuq).|$|E

Ryan refused to meet with religious leaders and others regarding [...] "a stay of execution" [...] in light of the impending 'moratorium' and other facts relative to the 'flawed' capital punishment system in Illinois; in fact, under Ryan's governorship, 13 people were released from jail after appealing their convictions based on new evidence. Ryan called for a commission to study the issue, while noting, [...] "I still believe the death penalty is a proper response to heinous crimes ...

2500|$|The Office of Management and Budget {{reported}} that $54 billion in [...] "improper payments" [...] {{were made to}} Medicare ($24B), Medicaid ($18B) and Medicaid Advantage ($12B) during FY 2009. This was 9.4% of the $573 billion spent in these categories. The Government Accountability Office lists Medicare as a [...] "high-risk" [...] government program due to its vulnerability to improper payments. [...] Fewer than 5% of Medicare claims are audited. [...] Medicare fraud accounts for an estimated $60 billion in Medicare payments each year, and [...] "has become one of, if not the most profitable, crimes in America." [...] Criminals set up phony companies, then invoice Medicare for fraudulent services provided to valid Medicare patients who never receive the services. These costs appear on the Medicare statements provided to Medicare card holders. The program pays out over $430 billion per year via over 1 billion claims, making enforcement challenging. Its enforcement budget is [...] "extremely limited" [...] according to one Medicare official. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in an interview: [...] "Clearly more auditing {{needs to be done}} <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be done in real time."
