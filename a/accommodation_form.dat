40|$|This study {{examined}} facilitating factors and barriers {{in the process}} of accommodating college students with learning disabilities in the classroom. Surveys were mailed to 485 faculty members at the University of Massachusetts who had received an <b>accommodation</b> <b>form</b> from the university's Learning Disabilities Support Services Office. The survey focused on faculty members ' degree of ease or difficulty in implementing accommodations, the perceived adequacy of support, and their own beliefs and understandings concerning the need for and benefit of providing accommodations. Analysis of the 162 returned surveys suggest that beliefs about the helpfulness and need of accommodations has an effect on provision. In addition, perception of support from elements of the University, especially the Learning Disabilities Support Services Office, influenced the ease of providing accommodations. A significant difference was found between the behavior of professors and instructors/teaching assistants, with the latter reporting it was easier t...|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{recognition}} that social isolation {{and a lack}} of connectedness with social groups {{is one of the reasons}} why the subjective well-being of homeless individuals is generally worse than the rest of the population. Past research amongst a range of populations suggests that the ability of an individual to take on new group memberships and/or their ability to maintain their memberships in meaningful groups is an important predictor of well-being. In a mixed method study (N = 119), we examined the extent to which experiences at homeless <b>accommodation</b> <b>form</b> building blocks for the formation of multiple group memberships and to what extent this predicts positive well-being. Qualitative analysis reveals the importance of feeling connected to the homeless service and supported by homeless accommodation staff. Linking these data to quantitative data from a second wave, we found that these experiences predicted well-being. These findings provide further support for a strength-based approach to homelessness, by providing insights into the ways that experiences at homeless accommodation can contribute to the development of multiple group memberships (i. e. social capital), and enhance the well-being of those experiencing, and exiting, homelessness. 18 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Condominium as an <b>accommodation</b> <b>form</b> is {{very common}} in Sweden and the housing market in Stockholm has shown a {{development}} with rising prices since the 1990 s. In most cases, a residential property sale is communicated by {{a real estate agent}} who, in connection with his intermediary assignment, receives a fee from the seller. A real estate agent must carry out his mediation assignments with care and, as an impartial intermediary, fulfill the interests of both the buyer and the seller. In connection with the intermediation of  condominiums, real estate agents perform a valuation of the apartment to be at market value. An erroneous market value can cause harm to the parties between themselves and deteriorate relationships with the customers, which makes it central to the real estate agent to judge a fair market value. It is therefore interesting to study whether real estate agents' values of condominiums are consistent with previous research within the subject area. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify what factors real estate agents consider to affect the market value of condominiums. The survey is limited to condominiums in the area Södermalm in Stockholm, Sweden. By aiming, we want to contribute to an increased understanding of the consumer of the factors that affect the value of the accommodation and what factors are considered to be the most affected. In order to achieve the goal, a qualitative method has been used in the form of interviews. Respondents consisted of eight real estate agents, all active at Södermalm. The results of the interviews have then been compiled and analyzed against existing theories and previous research that form the basis for the survey. Completed analysis shows that the empirical results of the study largely correspond to existing theories and previous research. The factors that have the greatest impact on the value have been shown to be non-changeable and factors that the buyer is not able to influence or change after purchase. Another conclusion drawn in the study is that our study does not match the theory and research found that the condition of the apartment affects the market value to a large extent.   This survey can be seen as a preliminary study and further studies in the field should be conducted to increase the credibility of the results. Research in the current area and with the same starting point is currently inadequate and this study forms the basis for further studies. To increase the reliability of the outcome, the number of respondents should be increased...|$|E

It is a two-storey building constructed in gothic style, with Flemish bond brickwork, built on a sandstone plinth in 1842. It is also likely to be the work of Richard Lane. The structure consists of three wings, containing a central hall range, with two domestic wings on each side, initially used as tutor <b>accommodation,</b> <b>forming</b> a symmetrical appearance with the gable end of the upper hall.

On 1 January 1955 the Japanese Communist Party engaged in self-criticism, labeling the insurgency “adventurism of the extreme left”, and at the 6th National Conference of 29 July 1955 the policy of armed struggle was renounced. After the 6th National Conference the JCP adopted a policy of not excluding any party members who, though they had made mistakes, recognized the errors of the armed struggle and party split and intended sincerely to make effort in supporting the new party line.

50|$|In the {{northern}} North Sea, despite the {{substantial amount of}} data available, {{our understanding of the}} lithospheric processes governing extension are strongly model-based. The architecture and signature of the sediment infill in {{the northern}} North Sea can be discussed in the context of three distinct evolutionary stages of rift basin development separated by key geologic unconformities. The proto-rift stage describes the rift onset with either doming or flexural subsidence. Tabular architectures thickening across relatively steep faults, characterize the proto-rift stage. Active stretching and rotation of fault blocks then occurs during the main rift stage is then terminated by the development of the syn-rift unconformity. Syn-rift architectures can be highly variable depending on the ability of the available sediment supply to fill <b>accommodation</b> <b>formed</b> by rotation and subsidence during this stage. Where crustal separation is accomplished, a break-up unconformity commonly marks the boundary to the overlying thermal relaxation of post-rift stage. During the post-rift stage, an early phase with coarse clastic infilling of remnant rift topography often precedes late stage widening of the basin and filling with fine-grained sediments. These processes have been attributed to pure shear (crustal extension and faulting in the upper crust) and simple shear (ductile stretching in the lower crust) and coupled simple shear/pure shear flexural deformation. The combined thermal and elastic/isostatic response of the lithosphere to extension controls the crustal architecture and thereby the geometry of sedimentary basins, including those of the northern North Sea.|$|R
