Many European powers had ties to the slaving trade by at least the eighteenth century; countries like Portugal, Sweden, Netherlands, France, and England all had outposts on the African coast. Slavers would conduct their business with the larger African tribes who would buy weapons from the Europeans and in turn use them to collect members of other tribes to sell to slave captains. Once {{in the hands of}} a slaver, the slave represented a substantial investment as Ian Baucom suggests, by the insuring of slaves purchased. Some European cities such as Liverpool would become successful from operating in this trade system, and would drive the free markets of slavery to handle as much business as was possible.|$|E

That summer, the Yankee Stadium scoreboard production staff began playing the song [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] by heavy metal band Metallica as Rivera's entrance music. Staff members selected the song after witnessing in the previous year's World Series how enthusiastically San Diego fans reacted to closer Trevor Hoffman entering games accompanied by AC/DC's [...] "Hells Bells".

After recording three blown saves and a 7.84ERA in July, he allowed just one earned run over his last 30appearances. He ended the season with a 1.83ERA and 45saves in 49opportunities, his first time leading the major leagues in saves. He received his first AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, an annual award for the league's best closer based on their statistics. In the 1999 World Series against the Braves, Rivera recorded a win and two saves, the second of which clinched the Yankees' championship title, his third overall. For his performance against Atlanta, he received the World Series MVP Award. Rivera finished 1999 by pitching 43consecutive scoreless innings in the regular season and postseason combined, and he placed third in voting for the AL Cy Young Award. After the season, he revealed tentative plans to retire and become a minister after playing four more seasons, though he backed off these plans the following year.|$|E

In 1989, the Los Angeles Daily News stated that: [...] "Darlene has become <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Ice-T's image as gangs, guns and boom boxes." [...] Ortiz originally met Ice-T when she was 17, stating she was [...] "totally smitten and ready to settle down" [...] and that she [...] "would've done whatever he asked". Of her appearance on the album cover she explained that it was [...] "like nothing" [...] for her. To prepare for the cover, Ortiz bought five different bathing suits and went to the photo studio with Glen E. Friedman. Ortiz felt comfortable with the sawed-off shotgun, stating that she got her first gun when she was 11 years old and that she thought [...] "it would be a powerful statement to see a woman holding a gun". Ice-T chose the bathing suit and the red high heel pumps and earrings for the cover. Clothing on the cover was shared between shots. Ortiz and DJ Evil E both shared the gold bracelet for the photo shoot and Ice-T and DJ Evil E wore the same Rolex. Ortiz also appeared in music videos for the singles from Power – [...] "I'm Your Pusher" [...] and [...] "High Rollers".|$|E

The decoy birds, held captive in darkened cellars over summer, are brought outside for the hunting season. For the bird, sudden exposure to light signals spring and a desire to sing; the trap is set for the unsuspecting migrating birds. ...|$|R
