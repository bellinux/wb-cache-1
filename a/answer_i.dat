Castañeda reported to Ugartechea that the Texians were stalling, likely to give reinforcements time to gather.|$|E

2500|$|Occasionally, by the way, I get {{a letter}} from someone who is in [...] "contact" [...] with an {{extraterrestrial}} who invites me to [...] "ask anything". And so I {{have a list of}} questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, [...] "Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem." [...] Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like [...] "Should we humans be good?" [...] I always get an <b>answer.</b> <b>I</b> think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, where there is a chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2014, {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Reubens explained why the film {{took so long}} to be made, saying: [...] "I think part of what happened with this project is it got leaked probably {{a year and a half}} or two years before we really wanted anyone to know about it. I was doing a Q somewhere, and I said I was writing a movie with a guy named Paul Rust, and the next day a journalist called my manager and said, [...] "Paul Rust is someone very associated with Judd Apatow, can you confirm Judd Apatow is involved in the project?" [...] The whole thing got leaked and we had just started. We didn’t have a script yet or anything, so the script took a year and—I don’t really know the <b>answer.</b> <b>I</b> think two years of it was like premature information out there, and then the last two years it's just been very, very slow to get the right people involved, and we now have such an amazing company involved, and that's the really big announcement that hasn’t been made yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his villa in Rapallo, Sibelius wrote: [...] "Don Juan. I {{was sitting}} in the dark in my castle when a {{stranger}} entered. I asked who he could be again and again — but there was no <b>answer.</b> <b>I</b> tried to make him laugh but he remained silent. At last the stranger began to sing — then Don Juan knew who it was. It was death." [...] On the same piece of paper, he wrote the bassoon theme for the [...] first part of the second movement, out of which a pizzicatoed string [...] "walking bass" [...] stems. Two months later in Florence, he drafted the second theme, with a note reading [...] "Christus," [...] perhaps symbolizing the death and resurrection of the movement, or even of Finland. Scholars also suggest that Sibelius modeled the second movement after Dante's Divine Comedy. Nonetheless, Robert Kajanus said that the movement [...] "strikes one as the most broken-hearted protest against all the injustice that threatens at the present time to deprive the sun of its light and our flowers of their scent." [...] The movement culminates with a towering, brassy theme, following by an ethereal, mist-like motif in the divided strings.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2010, Popović, {{acting as}} the legal {{representative}} of Mila Đinđić and Gordana Đinđić-Filipović, assassinated Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić's mother and sister, respectively, filed a criminal complaint against former Special Operations Unit (JSO) members Milorad Ulemek, Dušan [...] "Gumar" [...] Maričić, Zvezdan Jovanović, Veselin Lečić, Mića Petraković, Dragoslav [...] "Dragan" [...] Krsmanović, and Dragoš Radić, as well as former Yugoslav president Vojislav Koštunica and former Security Administration head Aco Tomić. Popović's criminal complaint accuses the four JSO members of [...] "organizing the November 2001 JSO rebellion against the Serbian government {{in cooperation with the}} late Dušan Spasojević, head of the Zemun Clan". Popović's criminal complaint further accuses then president of FR Yugoslavia, Vojislav Koštunica, of [...] "failing to use the constitutional powers in order to quell the rebellion" [...] while then Military Security Admin head Aco Tomić is accused of [...] "providing the JSO commander with guarantees that the Yugoslav Army (VJ) won't do anything about the rebellion". Asked why Đinđić's widow Ružica isn't a party to or signatory of the criminal complaint, Popović said Đinđić's mother and sister contacted him for legal action, while his wife didn't: [...] "I asked my two clients, Đinđić's mother and sister, if I should make the text of the criminal complaint available to his wife to sign, but from their <b>answer</b> <b>I</b> understood there are issues between them that I don't want to go into".|$|E
