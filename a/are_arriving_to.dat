5000|$|As a queue {{begins to}} fill up due to traffic {{arriving}} faster than it can be processed, the amount of delay a packet experiences going through the queue increases. The speed at which {{the contents of a}} queue can be processed {{is a function of the}} transmission rate of the facility. This leads to the classic delay curve. The average delay any given packet is likely to experience is given by the formula 1/(μ-λ) where μ is the number of packets per second the facility can sustain and λ is the average rate at which packets <b>are</b> <b>arriving</b> <b>to</b> be serviced. [...] This formula can be used when no packets are dropped from the queue.|$|E

50|$|The {{initial impact}} of outsourcing, and the {{relatively}} lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to a massive migration of software development activities from corporations in North America and Europe to India and later: China, Russia, and other developing countries. This approach had some flaws, mainly the distance / timezone difference that prevented human interaction between clients and developers and the massive job transfer. This had {{a negative impact on}} many aspects of the software engineering profession. For example, some students in the developed world avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of offshore outsourcing (importing software products or services from other countries) and of being displaced by foreign visa workers. Although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, computer programming does appear to have been affected. Nevertheless, the ability to smartly leverage offshore and near-shore resources via the follow-the-sun workflow has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations. When North Americans are leaving work, Asians are just arriving to work. When Asians are leaving work, Europeans <b>are</b> <b>arriving</b> <b>to</b> work. This provides a continuous ability to have human oversight on business-critical processes 24 hours per day, without paying overtime compensation or disrupting a key human resource, sleep patterns.|$|E

They stay in Palm Beach {{to see if they can}} find a millionaire for Tip-Toes to marry (they are socially ambitious). Tip-Toes runs into Steve at the station, as he helps her avoid the porter who was trying to get her to pay her fare. She thinks he's swell.|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{students}} from Bangladesh <b>are</b> <b>arriving</b> <b>to</b> Britain since at least 2002. Prior to 2001, the United States was the primary destination for those students who sought undergraduate or postgraduate degrees abroad. Since the September 11 attacks, however, the difficulty of obtaining a US student visa, has forced many Bangladeshi students to seek alternative locations, in particular Australia, Canada and the UK. The total number of incoming students is currently estimated to be around 2,000-3,000 per annum. Most of these students come from urban locations such as Dhaka and Chittagong. The vast majority chooses London as their primary base, not least because of the ease of finding paid work to finance their education and living costs. A network of colleges - known as visa colleges - has taken root in East London, in order to cater to these students, often established and run by Bangladeshi proprietors. These students are heavily concentrated in east London boroughs where majority of Bangladeshi Sylhetis have settled. Besides their studies, they can be found working a variety of low-skilled, low-paid jobs. The UK government's decision to encourage foreign students to stay and work in Britain after their studies, has resulted {{in many of these}} students settling in Britain, particularly graduates working in 'shortage sectors' such as science and technology. This is likely to increase the diversity of the British Bangladeshi population in coming years.|$|E

50|$|Fighter kites {{are known}} as volantín. They are square shaped, and made with light paper and bamboo sticks. Unlike other square fighter kites of the world, the Chilean volantín uses 3 support threads (two {{at the top and}} one at the bottom) for easier, more stable manoeuvre. Whilst used widely for {{decorative}} purposes, the tail of the Chilean volantín is not used during competitive matches. The Chilean volantín can also vary in size, ranging from ñecla as the smallest size available, to pavo as the largest. However, in the context of kite fighting medio pavo or medium sized kites are the most popular choice due to their more balanced performance in terms of speed, strength, and accuracy.Practitioners of this activity usually begin fighting in September, when the spring winds <b>are</b> <b>arriving</b> <b>to</b> the Chilean coast. Clubs and professional associations, however, prefer to host tournaments throughout the drier summer months when the commercial kite season is over.Other particularities of the Chilean kite fighting practice include the use of carrete for the manipulation and storage of the abrasive thread, and the use of wooden sticks for the manipulation of the carrete in turn. Therefore, it is possible for a skilled kite fighter to complete a match without ever touching the thread with their hands if their mastery of carrete usage is advanced enough.Since the mid 2000s, the use of carrete has become widespread in Latin America and Europe. Its convenience, durability and safety make {{it one of the most}} popular exports of the Chilean kite fighting culture.|$|E
5000|$|At NSSSA events, {{there is}} much {{emphasis}} placed on tradition. One NSSSA tradition is that of cheering. There {{is at least one}} cheer at most events, often led by the W.E.N.D.Y. people, and usually while people <b>are</b> <b>arriving</b> <b>to</b> keep up as much energy and enthusiasm as possible. There are a variety of cheers for every occasion, ranging from complete nonsense ("Fire engine, fire engine, stinky stinky tall") to cheers with the purpose of quieting the crowd when an event is about to start ("If you can hear me give me a one-two"). Another tradition is the [...] "I Lost" [...] game. It began when NSSSA was first formed and has continued to this day. The [...] "I Lost" [...] game is never-ending, and the objective is not to think of the game. If one remembers or is reminded of the game in any way, they immediately lose. Upon losing, the person must shout [...] "I lost", to inform the other players that they have lost the game and are now out. This serves to remind all the other players {{in the vicinity of the}} game as well, which means that they all lose too, and all must shout that they lost as well. The only possible way to win the game is to forget that you even heard of it, and to stay away from anyone else playing, which is essentially an impossibility at conference. The game is not taken seriously, and players who have lost almost always continue playing. There is some confusion over the position of W.E.N.D.Y., and in particular the meaning of the acronym. It is tradition that extremely few people know for sure what the acronym truly means, and it is now said that the only people who know are the Provincial Advisor and the persons who invented the acronym. Not even the persons who fill the positions are privy to this information.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, some {{advocates for}} social equity {{have sought to}} develop new {{solutions}} to urban poverty and build new forms of political power at a metro-politan or regional scale.

In trying to assess how the potential emergence of megaregions affects opportunities for addressing equity, the authors examine the Northern and Southern California megaregions and argue that “thinking megaregionally” may help to identify some new issues for equity organizing, but there are important challenges: (1) the issues most likely to gain traction at a megare-gional scale seem to be primarily related to infrastructure and the environ-ment and may not have the immediacy usually associated with successful mobilization of constituencies and (2) even if the issues are megaregional, th...|$|E

It takes into account not only complete context of oeuvre of both authors but also wider cultural and historical context of their time. Basic point of departure of this thesis is expectation of crucial position of man in the oeuvre of Nietzsche and Dostoevsky as well, both understanding man as essentially defined as free to choice. Analysis of characteristics defining essence of man leads after to elaboration of idea of superman - conclusion of final judgement of human beings' essential characteristics and visions of future principle of man.
