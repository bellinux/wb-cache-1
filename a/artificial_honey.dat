40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of manuka honey, <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> and an antibacterial component (methylglyoxal) on cell division in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methods: Viability of epidemic MRSA- 15 NCTC 13142 incubated with manuka honey, <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> and methylglyoxal was determined, and structural effects monitored by electron microscopy. Activity of murein hydrolase (a peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme implicated in cell separation, encoded by atl) was estimated by cell wall hydrolysis and zymography; expression of atl was quantified by real-time PCR. Results: Growth of MRSA was inhibited by 5 %, 10 % and 20 % (w/v) manuka honey and 10 % (w/v) <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> containing methylglyoxal, but not 10 % (w/v) <b>artificial</b> <b>honey.</b> Statistically significantly increased numbers of cells containing septa and increased cell diameter (P, 0. 001 and P, 0. 001, respectively) were found in MRSA exposed to 5 %, 10 % or 20 % (w/v) manuka honey, but not 10 % (w/v) <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> with and without methylglyoxal. Intracellular activity of murein hydrolase was elevated in MRSA grown in 10 % (w/v) <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> and at undetectable levels in MRSA treated with 10 % (w/v) manuka honey. Increased atl expression was found in MRSA treated with 10 % (w/v) manuka honey and 10 % <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> containing methylglyoxal. Conclusions: Enlarged cells containing septa were observed in MRSA exposed to inhibitory concentrations of manuka honey, suggesting that cell division was interrupted. These changes were not caused by either the sugars or methylglyoxal in honey and indicate the presence of additional antibacterial components in manuka honey...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to {{evaluate}} the authenticity of honey present in Lithuanian market using GC-FID analysis of trimethylsilylated carbohydrates.

Temperature affected hatch success, time to hatching, and larval growth. Eggs hatched in 61 h at 21 C but in 22 h at 35 C. Larvae achieved peak weight in 8 d at 35 C but needed 17 d at 21 C. Diet had comparatively {{little effect on}} larval survivorship or maximum weight, although larvae fed only bee pupae had lower survivorship. Access to soil influenced pupation success. Duration of the life stage spent in the soil, during which pupation occurs, was also affected by temperature: adults emerged after 32. 7 d at 21 C but after only 14. 8 d at 35 C, albeit with high mortality. Minimum temperature for development was estimated at 13. 5 C for eggs, and 10. 0 C for larvae and pupae. Temperature influenced adult longevity and oviposition: on a honey and pollen diet average adult lifespan was 92. 8 d at 24 C but only 11. 6 d at 35 C. Beetles lived longer at 28 C or lower but produced the most eggs per female, regardless of diet, at 32 C.

40|$|In {{holometabolous}} insects, larval nutrition affects adult body size, a {{life history}} trait with a profound influence on performance and fitness. Individual nutritional components of larval diets are often complex and may interact with one another, necessitating {{the use of}} a geometric framework for elucidating nutritional effects. In the honey bee, Apis mellifera, nurse bees provision food to developing larvae, directly moderating growth rates and caste development. However, the eusocial nature of honey bees makes nutritional studies challenging, because diet components cannot be systematically manipulated in the hive. Using in vitro rearing, we investigated the roles and interactions between carbohydrate and protein content on larval survival, growth, and development in A. mellifera. We applied a geometric framework to determine how these two nutritional components interact across nine <b>artificial</b> diets. <b>Honey</b> bees successfully completed larval development under a wide range of protein and carbohydrate contents, with the medium protein (∼ 5 %) diet having the highest survival. Protein and carbohydrate both had significant and non-linear effects on growth rate, with the highest growth rates observed on a medium-protein, low-carbohydrate diet. Diet composition did not have a statistically significant effect on development time. These results confirm previous findings that protein and carbohydrate content affect the growth of A. mellifera larvae. However, this study identified an interaction between carbohydrate and protein content that indicates a low-protein, high-carb diet has a negative effect on larval growth and survival. These results imply that worker recruitment in the hive would decline under low protein conditions, even when nectar abundance or honey stores are sufficient...|$|R
40|$|Background <b>Artificial</b> rearing of <b>honey</b> bee larvae is an {{established}} method which enables to fully standardize the rearing environment and {{to manipulate the}} supplied diet to the brood. However, there are no studies which compare learning performance or neuroanatomic differences of artificially-reared (in-lab) bees in comparison with their in-hive reared counterparts. Methods Here we tested how different quantities of food during larval development affect body size, brain morphology and learning ability of adult honey bees. We used in-lab rearing {{to be able to}} manipulate the total quantity of food consumed during larval development. After hatching, a subset of the bees was taken for which we made 3 D reconstructions of the brains using confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Learning ability and memory formation of the remaining bees was tested in a differential olfactory conditioning experiment. Finally, we evaluated how bees reared with different quantities of artificial diet compared to in-hive reared bees. Results Thorax and head size of in-lab reared honey bees, when fed the standard diet of 160 µl or less, were slightly smaller than hive bees. The brain structure analyses showed that artificially reared bees had smaller mushroom body (MB) lateral calyces than their in-hive counterparts, independently of the quantity of food they received. However, they showed the same total brain size and the same associative learning ability as in-hive reared bees. In terms of mid-term memory, but not early long-term memory, they performed even better than the in-hive control. Discussion We have demonstrated that bees that are reared artificially (according to the Aupinel protocol) and kept in lab-conditions perform the same or even better than their in-hive sisters in an olfactory conditioning experiment even though their lateral calyces were consistently smaller at emergence. The applied combination of experimental manipulation during the larval phase plus subsequent behavioral and neuro-anatomic analyses is a powerful tool for basic and applied honey bee research...|$|R

40|$|Backgroud: {{the healing}} {{properties}} of honey {{have been demonstrated}} in both animals and humans, although not all studies report positive findings. The lack of positive effects on healing could be due {{factors such as the}} type and/or the concentration of honey. The observed effects of honey include angiogenesis. Honey appears to influence the wound environment and modulate immune responses during the healing process. Angiogenesis occurs during the proliferative phase of wound healing and requires the development of an extracellular matrix (ECM) to support new capillaries. It is possible that either honey influences angiogenesis by the release of cytokines or that glucose in honey is converted to hyaluronic acid, a component of the ECM that has been shown to affect angiogenesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential angiogenic effects of honey. Materials and methods: using an established aortic ring assay, the angiogenic properties of three types of honey and a control at various dilutions were investigated: <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> (fructose, glucose and water equal to a 70 % sugar solution), Rowse (commercial honey), Mesitran™ and Activon™ ointment. Preliminary results: total tubule lengths were as follows: <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> 0. 008 % - 11 cm 2; Rowse 0. 04 % - 12. 5 cm 2; Mesitran™ 0. 20 % - 13. 0 cm 2; and Activon™ 0. 20 % - 15. 0 cm 2. The most pro-angiogenic honey was Activon™ which showed the highest number of junctions and tubule formations. However, at a dilution of 0. 04 % all honeys were pro-angiogenic compared with the control. All honeys were anti-angiogenic at a concentration of 5 % and above. Conclusions: the concentration and/or type of honey may be a factor in wound healing in response to honey. There may be an unidentified factor in some honeys stimulating angiogenesis and/or the glucose in honey contributes to the hyaluronic acid content of the ECM, which stimulates angiogenesis. Anti-angiogenesis may be due to the cytotoxic effects of honey...|$|E

AH contained the sugars at the concentrations reported for NH. NH and AH concentrations were obtained by serial dilution with tryptic soy broth (TSB). Several concentrations of NH and AH were tested for inhibition of bacterial growth, viability, and biofilm formation after inoculation with S. mutans UA 159 in 96 -well microtiter plates to obtain absorbance and CFU values. Overall, NH supported significantly less (P < 0. 05) bacterial growth than AH at 25 and 12. 5 % concentrations. At 50 and 25 % concentrations, both honey groups provided significantly less bacterial growth and biofilm formation than the TSB control. For bacterial viability, the results for all honey concentrations except 50 % NH were not significantly different from those for the TSB control. NH was able to decrease the maximum velocity of S. mutans growth compared to AH. In summary, NH demonstrated more inhibition of bacterial growth, viability, and biofilm formation than AH.

Two SPE methods were compared: one using Amberlite XAD- 2 resin and another one using a C 18 cartridge. A gradient high performance liquid chromatography system with an RP 18 column and photodiode array detector was utilized to analyze the extracted polyphenols. The mean percent of recovery from the C 18 cartridges was 74. 2 %, while that from the Amberlite XAD- 2 resin was 43. 7 %. The recoveries of vanillic acid, naringin, and rutin were excellent (> 90 %); however, gallic acid was not obtained when C 18 cartridges were used. Additionally, the reusability of Amberlite XAD- 2 resin was investigated, revealing that the mean recovery of polyphenols decreased from 43. 7 % (1 st extraction) to 29. 3 % (3 rd extraction). It was concluded that although Amberlite XAD- 2 resin yielded a higher number of compounds, C 18 cartridges gave a better extraction recovery.

Pseudotubules were analysed using TCS Cellworks AngioSys software. The Angiokit sytem was used to validate the results. Using the MTT [3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -Diphenyltetrazolium. Bromide] assay, toxicity was also assessed on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) directly adherent to plastic. Results: All honey preparations stimulated pseudotubule formation, maximal at around 0. 2 % honey. Medicinal honeys were more active than Rowse. The effect was not attributable to the sugar content. Among the honeys tested, the Manuka-based Activon preparation reduced residual viable biomass compared with a sugar control at > 0. 32 % v/v concentration. Rowse had a similar effect only at 2. 5 %, the highest dose tested.

To discard the effect of H 2 O 2 in the antimicrobial activity, catalase was added. To evaluate the osmotic pressure’s effect, <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> was also used. Phenolic compounds and flavonoids were determined and Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed to assess whether these correlated with antimicrobial activity. The amount of phenolic compounds ranged from 630. 89 ± 5. 21 GAE kg− 1 to 718. 92 ± 4. 41 GAE kg− 1, while the flavonoids varied between 450. 72 ± 5. 67 CAE kg− 1 and 673. 98 ± 4. 33 CAE kg− 1. For the bacteria, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the honey without catalase ranged from 1. 01 ± 0. 50 % to 10. 00 ± 4. 72 % and was between 2. 00 ± 0. 94 % and 13. 27 ± 5. 23 % for honey with catalase. Concerning the yeasts, the MICs was between 13. 16 ± 4. 08 % and 20. 00 ± 5. 09 % for honey without catalase and between 14. 95 ± 4. 16 % and 25. 67 ± 5. 50 % for honey with catalase.

40|$|Background: Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous follicle. The Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) {{play a key role}} in inflammation and the formation of comedones. P. acnes has been reported to develop antibiotic resistance, which has generated some interest in developing natural antimicrobial compounds which forms the subject matter of this study. Recently, Manuka honey (leptospermum scoparium) has demonstrated strong antibacterial activities against a wide range of pathogens with distinct non-peroxide activity. Kanuka honey has also shown to be effective against many bacterial species. Many natural bioactives were reported to possess strong antibacterial activities, a few of which were studied against P. acnes. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the antibacterial activity of Manuka honeys and Kanuka honey with and without catalase against the growth of P. acnes alone and to screen the antibacterial activities of five selected nature bioactives alone and in combination with honey against P. acnes in vitro. Methods: The growth of P. acnes was evaluated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. P. acnes was cultivated in nutrient broth and fastidious anaerobic agar containing horse blood. Manuka honeys 20 +, 15 + and 10 + UMF and Kanuka honeys were tested against the growth of P. acnes, ranging from 0. 5 % to 12. 5 % (w/v) with and without catalase under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> was used as the control. Manuka tree essential oil (MTO), lavender essential oil (LO), green tea extract (GTE), olive leaves extract (OLE), propolis were screened using disc diffusion method, spectrophotometric assay, viable cell counts to determine the survival of P. acnes in the bioactives testing solutions. The combination creams of Manuka honey 10 + UMF (10 %, w/v) with bioactives were studied using viable cell count method to determine the viable cells of P. acnes. Results: P. acnes is capable of growing under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Manuka and Kanuka honeys exhibited antibacterial activity against the growth of P. acnes. Kanuka honey had similar antibacterial activity as Manuka honey 15 + UMF and Manuka honey 20 + UMF without catalase. MIC 100 of Manuka honey 20 + UMF was 148. 90 mg/mL; MIC 100 of Manuka honey 15 + UMF was 125. 81 mg/mL; MIC 100 of Manuka honey 10 + UMF was 144. 43 mg/mL; MIC 100 of Kanuka honey was 123. 28 mg/mL. Manuka honeys possessed non-peroxide activity, but the antibacterial activity of Kanuka honey decreased significantly after the removal of hydrogen peroxide with MIC 100 of 549. 21 mg/mL. <b>Artificial</b> <b>honey</b> did not markedly inhibit the growth of P. acnes. Among the five bioactives, only GTE and MTO had bactericidal ability. Honey creams with bioactives showed that cream containing 10 % honey and 1 % GTE caused about five log reductions in the bacterial cell numbers; in contrast, cream of honey (10 %) and MTO (0. 125 %) resulted in about two log reductions. No bacterial cells (< 100 CFU/mL) were found in the creams containing honey (10 %), MTO (0. 125 %) and GTE (1 %). Conclusion: Manuka honey exhibited antibacterial activity against the growth of the P. acnes. The antibacterial potency of the honey was significantly enhanced by the presence of bioactives in the emulsion cream...|$|E

Thus {{a number of different}} time zone machines are able to find the services of resources and the computation. Thus each and every time these machines are working in order to resolve the end client request. But sometime these machines are loaded more then their capacity and does not perform as desired and some of the available processing units are considered to be free. This results in the performance loss in the computational servers. In order to find the optimum performance there is need to implement some technique for load balancing. Thus in this presented work the key focus is placed on the investigation of load balancing approaches and the algorithm. In order to find the optimum technique of load balancing, various different algorithms are studied. Among them four most promising techniques are selected which are promising for load balancing in previous studies. These techniques are genetic algorithm which provides the optimization technique for finding most appropriate solution among available solutions, ABC (<b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> bee colony) algorithm which is also an optimization technique in the similar ways, the round robin which is frequently used for process allocation during CPU scheduling and finally the self-organizing map which is an unsupervised class of machine learning.

40|$|Learning an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an {{optimization}} task {{since it}} is desirable to find optimal weight sets of an ANN in the training process. Different equations are used to guide the network for providing an accurate result with less training and testing error. Most of the training algorithms focus on weight values, activation functions, and network structures for providing optimal outputs. Backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm is the well-known learning technique that trained ANN. However, some difficulties arise where the BP cannot get achievements without trapping in local minima and converge very slow in the solution space. Therefore, to overcome the trapping difficulties, slow convergence and difficulties in finding optimal weight values, three improved Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithms built on the social insect behavior are proposed in this research for training ANN, namely the widely used Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Here, three improved learning approaches inspired by <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> bee's behavior are used to train MLP. They are: Global Guided Artificial Bee Colony (GGABC), Improved Gbest Guided Artificial Bee Colony (IGGABC) and Artificial Smart Bee Colony (ASBC) algorithm. These improved algorithms were used to increase the exploration, exploitation and keep them balance for getting optimal results for a given task. Furthermore, here these algorithms used to train the MLP on two tasks; the seismic event's prediction and Boolean function classification. The simulation results of the MLP trained with improved algorithms were compared with that when trained with the standard BP, ABC, Global ABC and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. From the experimental analysis, the proposed improved algorithms get better the classification efficacy for time series prediction and Boolean function classification.

40|$|Raw Millefiori honey {{is packed}} full of {{antioxidants}} Abstract Honey {{is the natural}} substance produced by honeybees, Apis mellifera, in almost every country of the world. Raw honeys are usually produced by small farms and left in their natural state without undergoing processing (e. g., filtration and heat treatment). Honey is essentially a concentrated aqueous solution of inverted sugar, but it also contains a very complex mixture of other saccharides, enzymes, amino and organic acids, polyphenols, carotenoid-like substances, Maillard reaction products, vitamins, and minerals. Among minor honey constituents, polyphenols such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, may function as natural antioxidants in our diet. In recent years, considerable interest has been focussed on dietary antioxidants in reference to their protective effect against oxidative damage. There are many studies about the polyphenol content and antioxidative effects of fruits, vegetables and beverages; in contrast, hardly any work has been reported with honey. Available literature indicates that no previous antioxidant power {{studies have been done}} on Italian honeys; thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate antioxidant activity of two representative Italian raw honeys,, i. e., Millefiori and Acacia, obtained from beekeepers belonging to the same geographical region (central Italy) as a function of their sensorial characteristics and content of total polyphenols and flavonoids. Total polyphenols, flavonoids and antioxidant power of samples from Millefiori and Acacia raw honey varieties were evaluated. Phenolic content, expressed as caffeic acid equivalents, ranged from 12. 5 to 17. 5 mg/ 100 g and from 3 to 11 mg/ 100 g in Millefiori and Acacia honeys, respectively. All Millefiori samples exhibited the highest flavonoid concentration being between 1. 23 and 2. 93 mg catechin equivalents (CE) / 100 g honey. Total flavonoids in 100 g Acacia honeys were in the range of 0. 45 – 1. 01 mg CE. Acacia honeys had lower total antioxidant power, as assessed by ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay, than Millefiori. The relationship between phenolic content and antioxidant power was discussed. These results demonstrated a strong correlation between honey colour and antioxidant power, with darker and more crystallized honeys having stronger antioxidant activity than lighter and transparent honeys [...] Comparative experimental analysis was performed with an <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> and processed honeys. Raw Millefiori honey is rich in both amount and variety of antioxidant substances, and its inclusion in the diet may be recommended to complement other polyphenol sources...|$|E
40|$|Flavonoids are a {{class of}} natural {{products}} derived from plants which are incorporated into honeys through propolis, nectar and pollen. Research has shown that many honeys possess characteristic flavonoid profiles {{which can be used}} as markers for the geographical and floral origin of honey. The objective of this study has been to determine the flavonoid profile of New Zealand manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey, a honey which is internationally recognised for its unique medicinal properties. While all honeys are antibacterial due to the production of peroxides, manuka is unique because it exhibits an additional non-peroxide antibacterial activity due to high levels of methylglyoxal. The established extraction method, which utilises Amberlite XAD- 2 resin to extract phenolics from honey, has been modified to permit extraction of phenolics from samples as small as five grams, with no measurable loss of extraction reproducibility. This development opens up a much larger collection of honey samples to flavonoid profiling. Measurement of the recovery rates for this extraction method has been further developed in this study in an attempt to account for the matrix effects of the high carbohydrate and phenolic acid content, relative to the flavonoids, of honey. This was achieved by extraction of flavonoid standards from an <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> matrix. The recovery rates of 10 6 %, 16 7 % and 19 9 % for quercetin, chrysin and kaempferol respectively, were significantly lower than rates (28 - 60 %) measured using the accepted procedure of extracting flavonoids from a simple solution. However, {{it should be noted that}} the recovery rates measured for extraction from solution were lower than those reported by other research groups. This has been partly attributed to an additional filtration step using a sacrificial HPLC column which was implemented to protect the analytical HPLC system from an unknown contaminant in the phenolic extracts. Having evaluated the reproducibility and reliability of the modified extraction method, it was then applied to the analysis of 31 manuka honeys and 8 other non-manuka honeys from New Zealand. The results have shown that the honeys studied have a common flavonoid profile consisting mainly of the flavanone pinocembrin and the dihydroflavonol pinobanksin. These flavonoids are derived from propolis and are a common feature of honeys from temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The manuka honeys analysed had total flavonoid content ranging between 0. 59 - 2. 24 mg/ 100 g of honey, with an average level of 1. 16 0. 16 mg per 100 g of honey. The flavonoid profile of these samples consisted mainly of pinobanksin (0. 27 0. 04 mg/ 100 g honey), pinocembrin (0. 17 0. 02 mg/ 100 g honey), luteolin (0. 14 0. 02 mg/ 100 g honey) and chrysin (0. 13 0. 02 mg/ 100 g honey), together accounting for 61 % of the total flavonoid content. Manuka honey was distinguishable from the other honeys studied by its high total flavonoid content, high luteolin content (greater than 0. 05 mg/ 100 g honey) and high levels of an unidentified (unknown compound 01) which was found to elute with the flavonoids on HPLC but did not appear to be a flavonoid from its UV spectrum. Statistical analysis showed that a positive correlation existed between the levels of unknown compound 01 in manuka honeys and their non-peroxide antibacterial activity. A similar correlation was also observed for luteolin. The progress of this research has been hampered by the limited range of flavonoid standards available for comparison with HPLC chromatogram peaks. A total of eight flavonoids were found in manuka honey, and a further seven in the non-manuka honeys, which did not coincide with any of the flavonoid standards available. Two of unknown flavonoids were subsequently extracted from fifteen kilograms of manuka honey using Amberlite XAD- 2 resin and liquid-liquid extraction, and isolated by a combination of Sephadex-LH 20 column chromatography and HPLC. Characterisation of these flavonoids was achieved using a combination of UV absorption spectroscopy, 1 H, 13 C and HMBC NMR spectroscopy, and LDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The isolated flavonoids were identified as pinobanksin and 8 -methoxykaempferol, both flavonoids which have been previously found in honeys...|$|E
40|$|Honey has various bioactivities with health-benefiting properties. It {{has been}} {{registered}} {{for use in}} wound dressings but {{before it can be}} registered with regulatory authorities for sale with claims for therapeutic actions the components responsible for these bioactivities must be identified to allow standardisation. This thesis focuses on the anti-inflammatory activity of honey. Emphasis was put on identifying the mode of action of the anti-inflammatory component, creating an in vitro assay to measure the anti-inflammatory activity of individual honeys and attempting to identify and characterise the component(s) responsible for the activity. A cell line (THP- 1) was selected for this study based on its macrophage phenotype upon activation and its role as an inflammatory regulator. Initially this cell line was characterised to better understand the treatments that activate its phagocytosis ability, mobility, phenotype and gene expression profile. The cell line was then monitored for the change in expression of its pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in response to common cell-activating treatments (LPS, PMA and Vit-D 3) and Manuka honey. It was found that Manuka honey increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL- 10, IL- 1 ra and the growth factors PDGF and TGF-β. This indicated that Manuka honey may allow inflammation to proceed at a modulated level, allowing healing to occur. The cell line THP- 1 was further investigated as a model of a phagocyte when activated. A phagocytosis assay using latex particles was utilised to study the effect of honey on the ability of cells to phagocytose. It was found that honey reduced phagocytosis, and that Manuka honey had a superior ability to other honey types to do this. The activity was isolated to the high molecular weight compounds in honey. As phagocytosis produces large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS are pro-inflammatory, the ROS produced by phagocytising THP- 1 cells was investigated using a dichlorofluorescein assay. It was found that ROS produced by phagocytising THP- 1 cells decrease in the presence of Manuka honey but not <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> or Rewarewa honey which has high anti-oxidant activity. This indicated that the effect of Manuka in decreasing ROS was not solely due to its osmotic effects or anti-oxidant capabilities. As phagocytosis starts the inflammatory cascade, it was hypothesised that the phagocytosis-inhibiting component resulted in honey having anti-inflammatory activity. Next, attempts were made to identify the anti-inflammatory component. Manuka honey was separated using chromatography and the fractions obtained assayed for their inhibitory activity in the phagocytosis assay. The active fractions were found to contain MRJP- 1 and to a small extent MRJP- 3, which were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. It was confirmed that these were glycoproteins with a high mannose content by using a ConA lectin column. Next a mode of action for the glycoproteins was investigated. It was demonstrated by using mannan that honey was acting on a mannose-binding phagocytic receptor on the cell surface of macrophages, most likely the mannose receptor. It was hypothesised that with the glycoproteins bound to the receptor, the cell was unable to have phagocytosis triggered thus ROS production and expression of inflammatory cytokines in response to ROS produced were prevented. A wide range of honey varieties was assayed and the anti-inflammatory activity was found in high levels only in Manuka honey {{and to a lesser extent}} in Kanuka and Rewarewa. To identify why this activity was much greater in Manuka honey, as all honey contains the glycoproteins MRJP- 1 and MRJP- 3, the effect of the recently discovered high levels of MGO in Manuka honey was investigated. It was found that Manuka honey had a high fluorescence that was not seen in other honey types to the same extent and that this fluorescence was due to MGO modifying the proteins in honey. It was found that this fluorescence could be used as an indicator of anti-inflammatory activity for Manuka honey and that this fluorescence, and anti-inflammatory activity increased over time upon incubation of honey with high MGO levels. The anti-inflammatory activity seen in the phagocytosis assay was compared with that seen in a commonly used in vivo assay of anti-inflammatory activity, the HET-CAM assay. The HET-CAM assay depends on the experimental production of inflammation and the reduction of this inflammation with an anti-inflammatory agent on the chorionic membrane of a fertilised hen’s egg. It was concluded that highly fluorescent Manuka honey at a concentration of 5 % had and anti-inflammatory effect equivalent to that of 5 mg/ml hydrocortisone, a commonly prescribed anti-inflammatory drug. The anti-inflammatory activity seen in the honeys assayed in the in vivo HET-CAM assay concurred with the results for the same honeys assayed in the phagocytosis assay which indicated that the phagocytosis assay was a reliable indicator for assaying the anti-inflammatory activity of honey in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Manuka honey (Leptospermum scoparium) {{produced}} in New Zealand {{has been shown}} to exhibit substantial antibacterial activity against a broad range of pathogens causing wound infection, and is being used in wound management with excellent results. This activity is due to both hydrogen peroxide and non-peroxide components. Manuka honey, however, may not be useful for treating bacterial gastroenteritis because the gastrointestinal environment may be unfavourable to the antibacterial action, and because a sufficiently high concentration for effectiveness may not be achieved. The research in this thesis is set out to evaluate in vitro the efficacy of manuka honey as an antibacterial agent against enterobacteria, taking into consideration some factors that may be involved in the gastrointestinal environment. 	 Because some gastrointestinal bacteria (Campylobacter spp., Helicobacter pylori, Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) are not aerophilic, a cheap yet acceptable gas generating system alternative to the commercial gaspack counterpart was sought for use in this study. Various alternatives were compared for their performance. The spirits burn method was chosen for cultivating microaerobes and some anaerobes because of its comparable performance to that of commercial systems in terms of the growth of bacterial species, and because of the ease of use and the low cost. 	 In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the susceptibility of gastrointestinal bacteria against manuka honey was investigated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) using a standardised manuka honey. Throughout the research, a manuka honey with median level non-peroxide antibacterial activity (equivalent to that of 16. 5 % phenol) was used, except that Campylobacter spp. were assayed with a more potent manuka honey equivalent to 29. 4 % phenol. The measured sensitivity of bacteria showed that manuka honey is significantly more effective than <b>artificial</b> <b>honey</b> (a mixture sugars as in honey), indicating that osmolarity is not the only factor that is responsible for the antibacterial activity of the honey. It was found that some species of bacteria e. g. Campylobacter spp. are exceptionally sensitive to manuka honey (both MIC and MBC are about 1 % honey solution), whereas most other gastrointestinal pathogens have MIC and MBC values in the range 5 - 10 % honey other than Enterobacter and Pseudomonas which were in the range 10 - 17 %. Bifidobacterium, lactobacilli and enterococci appear to be more tolerant to the honey (MIC: 9. 36 - 14. 29 %; MBC: greater than or equal to 13. 3 %) than most other species are. The difference in efficacy between the honey with and without hydrogen peroxide removed was also studied, and it was found that both hydrogen peroxide and the non-peroxide components contribute to the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of the honey. Because oxygen is required for hydrogen peroxide to be {{produced in}} honey, the role that oxygen plays in the antibacterial activity of manuka honey was investigated by analysing the susceptibility data obtained under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions using facultative anaerobes. Manuka honey appeared to be a more potent bacteriostatic agent against most species of bacteria in the absence of oxygen, whereas a relatively higher concentration of manuka honey solution was required to kill some bacteria under anaerobic conditions. This may partially be due to the atmosphere having also affected the metabolism, and hence the growth, of bacteria. Therefore, the activity of manuka honey would not necessary decline in the intestinal environmental atmosphere. 	 To investigate how long it takes for manuka honey to kill bacteria, time-to-kill studies were conducted by monitoring the survival of bacteria in manuka honey. It is found that it takes a 20 % solution of manuka honey with a medium-level activity more than 6 h to kill 90 % of the cells of most of the species tested if the bacterial cells are kept in contact with the honey. This suggests that manuka honey is not rapidly bactericidal, and that it is unlikely to be possible to fully eradicate a bacterial gut infection by ingesting a small amount of manuka honey for a short period. It was found that probiotics can survive in the 20 % honey solution for more than 12 h. The pharmacodynamics of the antibacterial activity of manuka honey were studied to investigate the survival and the re-growth of bacteria after they had been treated with honey. It was revealed that after being exposed to manuka honey for a short term (1 h), the growth of most enteropathogens is slowed for approximately 2 - 4 h before it gets back to a full rate. The assays of this postantibiotic effect also showed that the latency in the re-growth after being exposed to honey is not proportional to the MIC, MBC or time-to-kill profiles. Finally, the efficacy of manuka honey on bacteria was studied under conditions simulating the environment in the stomach and intestines. The tested bacteria were unable to grow under the acidic conditions as in the stomach, so whether or not the honey had any antibacterial activity under these conditions could not be determined. Under the conditions simulating the intestinal environment, the results demonstrated that the antibacterial activity of manuka honey is slightly decreased in the mildly alkaline conditions of the intestine (pH 7. 5). In the presence of pancreatin and bile at the same pH, the activity of manuka honey was found to decrease by more than 50 %. This suggests that pancreatin and bile in the gut may negatively affect the efficacy of the antibacterial activity of manuka honey in vivo. This indicates that although ingested manuka honey may still have some antibacterial action when in the gut, the antibacterial activity would be different from that which is usually examined with sensitivity studies in vitro. 	 Gastroenteritis has generally been treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS) that consists of carbohydrates and electrolytes. Manuka honey could be used instead of the usual carbohydrate component of ORS and would provide additional bioactivities such as antibacterial activity and stimulation of growth of probiotics, which would make the honey rehydration solution more beneficial to patients with gastroenteritis than is the traditional ORS. After some initial investigation to find the most appropriate dosage and frequency of doses, a clinical trial may be warranted...|$|E
