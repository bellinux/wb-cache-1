40|$|The {{anaerobic}} metabolism of phthalate and other <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> by the denitrifying bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain P 136 was studied. Benzoate, cyclohex- 1 -ene-carboxylate, 2 -hydroxycyclohexanecarboxylate, and pimelate were detected as predominant metabolic intermediates during the metabolism of three isomers of phthalate, m-hydroxybenzoate, p-hydroxybenzoate, and cyclohex- 3 -ene-carboxylate.

25|$|Pyridine is {{miscible}} {{with water}} and virtually all organic solvents. It is weakly basic, and with hydrochloric acid it forms a crystalline hydrochloride salt that melts at 145–147°C. Most chemical properties of pyridine are typical of a heteroaromatic compound.

40|$|A soil bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain P 136, was {{isolated}} by selective enrichment for anaerobic utilization of o-phthalate through nitrate respiration. o-Phthalate, m-phthalate, p-phthalate, benzoate, cyclohex- 1 -ene-carboxylate, and cyclohex- 3 -ene-carboxylate were utilized by this strain under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. m-Hydroxybenzoate and p-hydroxybenzoate were utilized only under anaerobic conditions. Protocatechuate and catechol were neither utilized nor detected as metabolic intermediates during the metabolism of these <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Cells grown anaerobically {{on one of}} these <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> also utilized all other <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> as substrates for denitrification without a lag period. On the other hand, cells grown on succinate utilized <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> after a lag period. Anaerobic growth on these substrates was dependent on the presence of nitrate and accompanied by the production of molecular nitrogen. The reduction of nitrite to nitrous oxide and the reduction of nitrous oxide to molecular nitrogen were also supported by anaerobic utilization of these <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> in this strain. Aerobically grown cells showed a lag period in denitrification with all substrates tested. Cells grown anaerobically on <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> also consumed oxygen. No lag period was observed for oxygen consumption during the transition period from anaerobic to aerobic conditions. Cells grown aerobically {{on one of these}} <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> were also adapted to utilize other <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> as substrates for respiration.

25|$|In organic chemistry, when a {{molecule}} with a planar ring obeys Hückel's rule, where {{the number of}} π electrons fit the formula 4n+2 (where n is an integer), it attains extra stability and symmetry. In benzene, the prototypical <b>aromatic</b> <b>compound,</b> there are 6 π bonding electrons (n=1, 4n+2=6). These occupy three delocalized π molecular orbitals (molecular orbital theory) or form conjugate π bonds in two resonance structures that linearly combine (valence bond theory), creating a regular hexagon exhibiting a greater stabilization than the hypothetical 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene.|$|E
25|$|Naphthalene is {{the most}} {{abundant}} single component of coal tar. Although the composition of coal tar varies with the coal from which it is produced, typical coal tar is about 10% naphthalene by weight. In industrial practice, distillation of coal tar yields an oil containing about 50% naphthalene, along with twelve other aromatic compounds. This oil, after being washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide to remove acidic components (chiefly various phenols), and with sulfuric acid to remove basic components, undergoes fractional distillation to isolate naphthalene. The crude naphthalene resulting from this process is about 95% naphthalene by weight. The chief impurities are the sulfur-containing <b>aromatic</b> <b>compound</b> benzothiophene (<nbsp&2%), indane (0.2%), indene (<nbsp&2%), and methylnaphthalene (<nbsp&2%). Petroleum-derived naphthalene is usually purer than that derived from coal tar. Where required, crude naphthalene can be further purified by recrystallization from any {{of a variety of}} solvents, resulting in 99% naphthalene by weight, referred to as 80nbsp&°C (melting point). Approximately 1.3M tons are produced annually.|$|E

2500|$|Historic {{interest}} in benzene {{arose from the}} uncertainty over its structure and reactivity. [...] It was well established {{that it had a}} carbon to hydrogen ratio of 1:1 which suggested the presence of double or triple bond carbon-to-carbon bonds, yet such unsaturated compounds typically undergo addition reactions, which benzene does not. [...] Numerous potential structures were proposed, including by Claus, Dewar, Ladenburg, Armstrong, and Thiele. [...] The most influential proposal was that of Kekulé who in 1865 suggested a cyclic structure of six carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds [...] Kekulé based his argument on the now well-known observations of arene substitution patterns, namely that there are always only one isomer of any monoderivative of benzene and three isomers of every disubstituted derivative. [...] Critics noted that Kekulé's proposal implied that there should be two distinguishable isomers for an ortho-substitution (a 1,2-disubstituion) depending on whether a single or double bond joined these two carbons. [...] Kekulé suggested in reply that benzene had two complementary structures and that these forms rapidly interconverted, which would also explain the lack of addition reactions (as the valency of each carbon atom is not that expected of a double bond). [...] Though this interconversion is incorrect —in fact, they are both resonance contributors to the actual structure (which is closest to Thiele's structure)— the geometry and structure proposed by Kekulé are correct. [...] Benzene is the prototypical example of an <b>aromatic</b> <b>compound,</b> a hitherto unknown class of compounds, and its synthesis was the first example of aromatization, the process and chemical reactions whereby an aromatic system is formed. [...] The new understanding of benzene and all aromatic compounds was so important for both pure and applied chemistry that in 1890 the German Chemical Society organized an elaborate appreciation in Kekulé's honor, celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first benzene paper; its 150th anniversary was also marked.
