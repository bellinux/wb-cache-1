In February 2008, the New York Times reported that the U.S. refusal to provide access to those documents was a source of friction between the Bush Administration and then Director General ElBaradei. ElBaradei later noted that these documents could not be shared because of the need to protect sources and methods, but noted that this allowed Iran to question their authenticity. [...] According to Iran's envoy to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, [...] "The government of the United States has not handed over original documents to the agency since it does not in fact have any <b>authenticated</b> <b>document</b> and all it has are forged documents." ...|$|E

40|$|Public administrations show {{a strong}} {{interest}} in digital signature technology as a mean for secure and <b>authenticated</b> <b>document</b> exchange, hoping it will help reducing paper-based transactions with citizens. The main problem posed by this technology is with the necessary public-key infrastructure, and in particular with certificate status handling. This paper describes the definition and deployment of a web-based environment suitable for offering administrative services to citizens and for accepting authenticated documents from citizens. The best features of two different certificate status handling schemes, namely CRL and OCSP, have been exploited within this environment to obtain a good balance between security, timeliness and efficiency. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Document {{attestation}} is {{an important}} prerequisite in many transactions and processes. A good example is the attestation of university diplomas and school certificates, which {{is an important}} requirement for admission and employment processes. Despite the progress made in process and service automation, document attestation remains a completely manual operation, or partially automated at best. This paper proposes a simple framework for the full automation of the document authentication (attestation) process. The proposed approach is based on digital watermarking and aims to maintain {{the look and feel}} of stamps and signatures used in the process, while ensuring the authenticity of the stamped document.

50|$|One of {{the initial}} doubts bloggers raised about the memos {{was the use of}} {{proportional}} fonts (as opposed to a monospaced typeface, where all glyphs have a single, standard width).

German foreign ministry operative and Turkologist Ernst Jäckh claimed that 200,000 Armenians were killed and 50,000 were expelled and a million pillaged and plundered.

50|$|Florida (1997) and Alabama (1999) {{have enacted}} {{statutes}} and regulations, {{based on the}} Model Civil Law Notary Act, allowing for the appointment of Florida or Alabama attorneys as civil-law notaries {{with the power to}} <b>authenticate</b> <b>documents,</b> facts and transactions. This {{is not the same as}} a notary public appointment. Attorneys with a minimum of 5 years of Bar membership are appointed after specialized training and state examination. Acts of Florida and Alabama civil-law notaries are given both domestic and international effect under their enabling statutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{electronic}} identity cards of Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Portugal and Spain {{all have a}} digital signature application which, upon activation, enables the bearer to authenticate the card using their confidential PIN. Consequently they can, at least theoretically, <b>authenticate</b> <b>documents</b> to satisfy any third party that the document's not been altered after being digitally signed. This application uses a registered certificate in conjunction with public/private key pairs so these enhanced cards do not necessarily have to participate in online transactions.|$|R

These cities typically bear a large open crown over the shield, a privilege granted under German town law. While the origins of these arms vary, including inherited noble arms, arms depicting local landmarks, and canting arms (a visual pun on the city's name), most of these coats of arms are based on an earlier sigil or city seal used to <b>authenticate</b> <b>documents</b> in the Middle Ages.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Signatures and {{handwriting}} {{have long}} {{played a role}} in dayto-day business transactions and in forensics, e. g., to <b>authenticate</b> <b>documents,</b> as evidence to establish crime or innocence, etc. The individuality of handwriting and signatures is the basis for their relevance to authentication and forensics. This very individuality makes them also potentially useful as a biometric modality. This chapter is concerned with automatic methods for verifying the writership of handwritten documents and signatures. The discussion consists of the individuality of handwriting, image pre-processing and interactive tools for forensic document examination, discriminating characteristics of handwriting, a statistical model of writer verification, and application of the model to signature verification. ...|$|R
