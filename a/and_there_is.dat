English Study Program, Dian Nuswantoro University. Advisor: Dr. Jumanto, Drs.,M. Pd. This thesis entitled A Contrastive Analysis between English Noun Formations with suffix and Their Indonesian Equivalents in the English Merriam Webster on-line dictionary, Bilingual printed dictionary by Enchols and shadily (2014), and Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (KBBI) on-line. This study directs {{to find the}} similarities and the differences.

Based on the analysis that has been done, the researcher has found out that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 19 types the English Nouns Formations with suffix. About the similarities and the differences, the researcher concluded that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> Noun Formations with suffix -age with 4 similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 6 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ery <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –dom <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –hood <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ism <b>there</b> <b>is</b> 1 similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 9 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ship <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –eer <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –er words with no similarities and 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ess <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ette <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –let words <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ling words <b>there</b> <b>is</b> 1 similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 9 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –al words <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ant words <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ation <b>there</b> <b>is</b> 1 similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 9 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ee <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 10 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –or <b>there</b> <b>is</b> 1 similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 9 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ment <b>there</b> <b>is</b> 1 similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 9 differences; Noun Formations with suffix –ure words <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no similarities <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 10 differences. Examples of learning problems based on the differences are as follow (1) Noun formations with suffix –age = The word sewerage consist of base sewer + suffix –age, but their Indonesian equivalents translating sewerage into *saluran, instead of penyaluran kotoran, (2) Noun formations with suffix –dom = The word stardom consist of base star + suffix –dom, but their Indonesian equivalents translating stardom into *gugusan bintang, instead of bintang film, (3) Noun formations with suffix –eer = The word mountaineer consist of base mountain + suffix –eer, but their Indonesian equivalents translating mountaineer into *orang gunung, instead of pendaki gunung...|$|R
