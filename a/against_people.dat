5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge <b>against</b> <b>people</b> he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language <b>against</b> <b>people</b> like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E

5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were {{as likely to be}} victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes <b>against</b> <b>people</b> who may have been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E
5|$|The Poles {{had little}} {{interest}} or desire {{to support the}} French cause in the distant colonies, once again fighting <b>against</b> <b>people</b> who only desired their own independence. In Haiti there still is a popular myth that many Polish soldiers became sympathetic to the former slaves' cause and deserted the French, supporting Jean-Jacques Dessalines in significant numbers, with entire units changing sides. In fact, the actual desertion rate was much lower; nonetheless about 150 Polish soldiers joined the Haitian rebels. The loss of that many patriotic military personnel in the Caribbean was a serious blow to the Polish aspirations for regaining independence. The Haitian experience cast further doubts among Poles about France's and Napoleon's good intentions toward Poland.|$|E

Undergoing further nasal surgery, it was here in 1932 that {{he was invited to}} be guest of honour at Foyles' Literary Luncheon, also being invited by Harry Price to speak at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research. In need of money, he launched a series of court cases <b>against</b> <b>people</b> whom he believed had libelled him, some of which proved successful. He gained much publicity for his lawsuit against Constable and Co for publishing Nina Hamnett's Laughing Torso (1932) – a book he thought libelled him – but lost the case. The court case added to Crowley's financial problems, and in February 1935 he was declared bankrupt. During the hearing, it was revealed that Crowley had been spending three times his income for several years.|$|E
5|$|Evidence against Croitoru and Gravelle was {{presented}} {{over the course}} of eight weeks in 2006, but the judge stated that the case against the two accused was not strong.

Following this action by the attorney general, both Croitoru and Andre Gravelle announced plans to file lawsuits <b>against</b> <b>people</b> involved with the prosecution.

That same year, she spearheaded a bone marrow drive, and joined fellow singers Alesha Dixon and Pixie Lott to create T-shirts for River Island in aid of the Prince's Trust, profits from which help change young lives.|$|E
