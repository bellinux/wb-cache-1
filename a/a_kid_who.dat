25|$|At the 1960 U.S. Open, Nicklaus shot a two-under par 282, {{finishing}} {{in second}} place two strokes behind Arnold Palmer, who won the tournament for the only time with a final round charge of six-under-par 65. This score remains the lowest ever by an amateur in the U.S. Open. Nicklaus played the final 36 holes with Ben Hogan, who later remarked {{that he had just}} played 36 holes with <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> should have won by 10 shots. During the final 36 holes, Nicklaus was two-under-par; he had shot every round of the tournament at or below par, the only entrant to do so. Nicklaus had led by two shots with six holes to play. In 1960, Nicklaus also tied for 13th in the Masters Tournament. He tied for fourth in the 1961 U.S. Open, three shots behind champion Gene Littler, having played the final 54 holes one under par. Each of these three major championship finishes designated Nicklaus as low amateur. However, Nicklaus' one-under-par 287 tied for seventh in the 1961 Masters Tournament, and was second that year only to Charles Coe's low amateur placing, when he tied for second with Arnold Palmer at seven-under par 281, one shot behind champion Gary Player.|$|E
500|$|Some {{elements}} of the plot are borrowed from the Allan Sherman song [...] "Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh", a song about <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> went to camp and hated it. The song was later used in [...] "Marge Be Not Proud", and inspired {{the title of a}} later episode. The idea for the song sung by the children was from a 1960s TV show called Camp Runamuck, which has a theme song that is similar to the Kamp Krusty song.|$|E
500|$|Blitz {{described}} Hal as [...] "lost in {{the mystery}} of love" [...] and he [...] "loved the idea that <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> is lost when he's confronted by love and sex would be saddled with the name Hal Hefner", an homage to Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. Throughout the film, Hal is seen {{to be surrounded by}} sex and relationships—titlecards for the seasons of the year are placed over images of kissing students; Hal listens to his mother having intercourse with her new boyfriend; his friend Lewis shows Hal images from the Kama Sutra; while Lewis's parents attempt to mend their relationship through music therapy—but the adults in the film were written to be similarly confused and frustrated with love. [...] "In a world where all the children are trying so hard to be like adults", according to Stylus Yannick LeJacq, [...] "the adults are all sullenly try to reenact their childhood, taking every chance to ignore their children and savor the meaningless void of leisure time." ...|$|E

500|$|Kafka {{worked out}} for the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, and Oakland Raiders prior to the draft. Mike Mayock called Kafka the [...] "sleeper" [...] of the quarterback class, {{projecting}} him to be drafted in the sixth round. Mayock also said, [...] "He's a really smart kid. Has a better arm than people think. I don't even think he's sleeping anymore. He was a month-and-a-half ago, but he's on the rise. He's <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> could surprise people {{at the end of}} the day." [...] Former NFL quarterback Ron Jaworski concurred, saying that Kafka [...] "knows how to play the quarterback position. There's a real feel for hitting the open receiver, good anticipation. I can see him being one of those sleeper type guys." [...] A scout before the draft said that Kafka [...] "throws a lot of picks, but at least he's willing to pull the trigger. You don't see that from a lot of young kids." ...|$|E
500|$|Belgian {{director}} Jaco Van Dormael began {{seeking to}} film Mr. Nobody in 2001, an attempt that lasted {{six years before}} the director {{was able to make}} his English-language feature debut in 2007. Van Dormael's project differed from other Belgian productions in being filmed in English instead of in one of Belgium's main languages. The director explained, [...] "The story came to me in English. It's a story set over very long distances and time frames. One of the strands of the plot is about <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> must choose between living with his mother in Canada or his father in England. There are also some incredible English-speaking actors I wanted to work with." [...] Mr. Nobody is Van Dormael's first feature film since the Belgian film Le huitième jour (The Eighth Day) in 1996. Van Dormael began preparing production of Mr. Nobody in February 2007 with actress Sarah Polley the first to be cast in the film. Actor Jared Leto was later cast into the primary role of Nemo Nobody.|$|E

The budget was approved before casting was done, based on the prominence of the director's name and the strength of his script. The film utilizes nonlinear narrative and the many-worlds interpretation to tell the life story of the last mortal on Earth, Nemo Nobody, portrayed by Jared Leto.|$|E

500|$|The Satanic Bible {{has also}} {{received}} {{a large amount of}} criticism from people and organizations who find its content to be dangerous. Much of this criticism came during the period of [...] "Satanic panic," [...] when Satanic ritual abuse was feared to be epidemic. Much of this media coverage, however, has been denounced as [...] "uncritical and sensationalized." [...] Tom Harpur condemns the book as [...] "blasphemous" [...] and [...] "socially seditious," [...] and blames it for causing an increase in gruesome violence, ritual abuse, and other obscene acts. Critics have also accused The Satanic Bible of encouraging violence and murder, particularly in young people considered to be impressionable. Dawn Perlmutter criticizes it for providing adolescents with bad messages and messages that can be easily misinterpreted. Possession of The Satanic Bible has been used by some studies to identify adolescents who are antisocial, and some warn that possession of the book is a warning sign of emotional issues. The Council on Mind Abuse took a very negative view of The Satanic Bible. Former Executive Director Rob Tucker warned parents to look for The Satanic Bible in their children's bedrooms, saying, [...] "You have to help the child fight this obsession like any other addiction" [...] and [...] "It's like giving drugs to <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> is already on the edge." [...] Attempts to ban the book from schools and public libraries have been made in various places around the world, and bans or limitations on the book in prisons have been repeatedly challenged in court. However, opposition to The Satanic Bible has rarely led to its removal; these bans are rare. The book was banned in South Africa from 1973 to 1993.|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, {{only hours}} after the Virginia Tech {{shooting}} (and before Seung-Hui Cho was actually identified), Thompson predicted that the shooter had trained on the game Counter-Strike. According to Thompson, the game [...] "drills you and gives you scenarios on how to kill them [...] gets you to kill them with your heart rate lower." [...] He says that Seung-Hui [...] "was in a hyper-reality situation in virtual reality." [...] Though Seung-Hui had last been known to have played Counter-Strike in high school, four {{years prior to the}} shooting, Thompson asserts that [...] "you don't drop it when you go to college, typically." [...] Thompson disputed Seung-Hui's roommate's claim that Seung-Hui only used his computer to write fiction, on the grounds that [...] "Cho was able to go room to room calmly, efficiently, coolly killing people." [...] Prior to being identified, Thompson attributed the [...] "flat effect on [...] face" [...] and the efficiency of his attack to video game rehearsals of the shooting. However, a search warrant released, listing the items found in Cho's dorm room, did not contain any video games, and a Washington Post story cited by Thompson later removed a paragraph stating that Seung-Hui enjoyed violent video games in high school. Despite all evidence indicating that Seung-Hui had not played Counter-Strike in years, Thompson continued to insist that [...] "this is not rocket science. When <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> has never killed anyone in his life goes on a rampage and looks like the Terminator, he's a video gamer." [...] Thompson also sent a letter to Bill Gates, saying, [...] "Mr. Gates, your company is potentially legally liable (for) the harm done at Virginia Tech. Your game, a killing simulator, according to the news that {{used to be in the}} Post, trained him to enjoy killing and how to kill." [...] However, Microsoft did not create Counter-Strike - they only published the Xbox version of the game. The official Virginia state panel commissioned to investigate the shooting determined that Seung-Hui [...] "played video games like Sonic the Hedgehog," [...] and that [...] "none of the video games [...] were war games or had violent themes." ...|$|E
500|$|Krusty's {{appearance}} and design is essentially that of Homer Simpson with clown makeup. Groening said that [...] "The satirical conceit that I {{was going for}} {{at the time was}} that The Simpsons was about <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> had no respect for his father, but worshipped a clown who looked exactly like his father", a theme which became less important as the show developed. One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series. There are two instances of the one assuming the identity of the other. In a (non-canonical) Butterfinger commercial, pertaining to a contest for $50,000 to find out who stole Bart's Butterfinger, a captured Homer appears to be the culprit until Maggie pulls off a mask, revealing Krusty. [...] In the episode [...] "Homie the Clown", Homer goes to Clown College and dresses up as and is confused with Krusty. Krusty was originally just a normal man wearing clown makeup, but David Silverman noted that [...] "at some point, we decided he looked [...] all the time." [...] The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown makeup but eventually decided that it did not matter. The writers had tried showing Krusty's real face a few times in early episodes, but decided that it did not look right, although his real face was seen in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] and [...] "Like Father, Like Clown". Later episodes made jokes about Krusty's face. In [...] "Homer's Triple Bypass", Krusty reveals that his [...] "grotesque appearance" [...] is the result of multiple heart attacks. Homer remarks that he seems fine, and Krusty replies, [...] "This ain't makeup." [...] In [...] "Bart the Fink", [...] he abandons an idea to sail away with a new identity and swims towards shore, leaving a trail of yellow makeup in his wake and his natural white face underneath. On shore, he shakes off his black hair, revealing his natural green clown hair, and removes his normal-looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath.|$|E

500|$|Webb {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a story about <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> grows up looking for his father and finds himself." [...] Both Webb and star Garfield described Parker as an outsider by choice, someone hard to get close to. As in the early comic books, the character [...] "is a science whiz. If you look {{back to the early}} Stan Lee and Steve Ditko comics, he's a nerd with big glasses," [...] said Webb. He explained [...] "the idea of what a nerd is has changed in 40 or 50 years. Nerds are running the world. Andrew Garfield made a movie [...] about it. ... What was important in those early comics was this notion that Peter Parker is an outsider and how we define that in a contemporary context." [...] Garfield compared his Spider-Man façade as a metaphor for internet anonymity, saying, [...] "You feel the power of it, the power of not being seen, the power of the mask. Peter becomes witty when he's got that protective layer. It's like he's on a message board. He's got the anonymity of the Internet within that suit, and he can say whatever the [...] @#!*% [...] he likes, and he can get away with anything." [...] Garfield tried to explore Parker as an orphan, whom he feels [...] "are the strongest human beings on the planet." [...] He said Parker is [...] "a human hero [...] goes through all of the same struggles that we all have gone through, especially the skinny ones [...] want more power than they feel they have." [...] He believes Parker represents [...] "a very inspiring, aspirational character that symbolizes goodness—and {{how difficult it is to}} be good—but how worth it it is." [...] Rhys Ifans compared this film to William Shakespeare's Hamlet on the grounds that Spider-Man can be redone over and over in different ways. He felt that they are similar in that they both represent meaningful archetypal young men grappling with the loss of their father. Critics like Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that Garfield's character as the superhero [...] "embodies the nerdy Parker, the anguished fatherless teen and the cocky super-hero in equal doses". Boyd Hoij of Variety noted that Garfield's character as Spider-Man makes an interesting hero in the film because of how it establishes early on that Peter's growing pains along with his search for an identity are common to any teenager and that [...] "his struggles involve real people—and real lives." ...|$|E

[...] Not all reviews were as positive, however; Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- rating, signaling mixed reviews.

2500|$|Erica is a headstrong {{and selfish}} 15-year-old when All My Children begins in 1970. Although Nixon {{designed}} her {{as one of}} the bad characters, she was not intended to come off as evil or menacing. Since Nixon created All My Children as a [...] "light hearted" [...] soap opera, the series' villains, Erica included, came across as more fun and funny, than wicked. Over time, Erica evolved into a [...] "heroine-vixen" [...] who still did bad things, but was also a character the audience rooted for. Former associate producer Felicia Minei Behr said, [...] "The Erica that [...] started with, was <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> was one-dimensional, who was the rotten seed, and she turned her into a very fascinating character- the character that everybody loves to hate." [...] Characterized as the [...] "naughty girl in town" [...] from the start, her motivations stem from her relationship with her father.
