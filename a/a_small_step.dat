5|$|In late August, at the 2006 U.S. National Championships, Liukin {{successfully}} defended her all-around, {{beam and}} bars titles, becoming a two-time senior national champion. She {{was named to}} the U.S. team for the 2006 World Gymnastics Championships in Aarhus, Denmark, and was expected by many to be a strong contender for the all-around title. However, because of an ankle injury sustained in training before the competition began, she was only able to compete on one event, the uneven bars. In spite of her injury, in the qualification round, Liukin's bars set earned a 16.2, the highest score of any competitor on any apparatus in the meet. Her bars routine in team finals scored a 15.7 and helped the U.S. team win the silver medal. Liukin also qualified for the event finals on bars, where she took <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>step</b> on her dismount and finished with a 16.05, earning a silver medal behind Britain's Beth Tweddle.|$|E

25|$|There are two chainrings whose {{relative}} difference (say 10%) {{is about}} half the relative step on the cogset (say 20%). This {{was used in the}} mid-20th century when front derailleurs could only handle <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>step</b> between chainrings and when rear cogsets only had a small number of sprockets, e.g. chainrings 44-48 and cogset 14-17-20-24-28. The effect is to provide two interlaced gear ranges without any duplication. However to step sequentially through the gear ratios requires a simultaneous front and rear shift on every other gear change. This style is not available off the shelf.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade guide rollers and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the guide flange. The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the guide rollers due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>step</b> on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth. Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper {{tracking of}} bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.|$|E
25|$|Several {{small step}} pyramids along the Nile river are also {{credited}} to Huni. Those small pyramids had a cultic function and marked important royal estates. They contained no internal chambers {{and were not}} used for burial purposes. One of them {{is located at the}} eastern end of Elephantine island and a granite cone with Huni's name was discovered nearby in 1909. Therefore, this little pyramid {{is the only one that}} may be credited to Huni with some certainty. Some scholars such as Andrzej Ćwiek contest this attribution however, pointing out that it might be at least possible that the granite cone of Huni was re-used in later times, when ramesside priests restored cultic places of the Old Kingdom period. The only cultic step pyramid that can be definitively connected to an Old Kingdom ruler is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>step</b> pyramid known as the Seila Pyramid, located at the Faiyum Oasis. Two large stela with the name of Snefru were found in front of the pyramid, thus indicating the king responsible for its construction. Since Snefru was Huni's likely immediate successor, this might indicate however that cultic pyramids were indeed constructed at the transition between the 3rd and 4th dynasties.|$|E

500|$|Catherine de' Medici {{has been}} {{labelled}} a [...] "sinister Queen… noted for {{her interest in}} the occult arts". To some, Catherine and Henry's inability to produce an heir for the first ten years of their marriage gave rise to suspicion of witchcraft. Labouvie suggested that women's power {{was believed to be}} the ability to create and sustain life, whilst witches were believed to have the opposite power; that of attacking health, life and fertility. An infertile woman, and in particular an infertile queen, was therefore regarded as 'unnatural' and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>step</b> from supernatural. Elizabeth I was treated with similar suspicion—she too entertained questionable characters (such as her advisor, John Dee), and produced no official heir. Essentially, however, there exists no concrete proof that either woman took part in the occult, and it is now believed that Catherine's trouble in providing an heir was in fact due to Henry II's penile deformity.|$|E

Some of the south-facing rooms have twin, symmetrically placed doorways, a style of architecture that is very unusual for a range structure in the Petén region. Examples are known from minor structures at Tikal but the closest corresponding architecture comes from the Puuc region of the northern Yucatán Peninsula, at cities such as Cacabxnuc, Chelemi, Xcorralche and Xkalachetzimin, although they differ in other particulars, such as the vaulting.|$|E

Matt Fowler, who reviewed the episode for IGN, gave it a score of 8/10, and maintained that it was still a solid effort that focused on shifting all the main characters out of their comfort zones.

500|$|After a {{particularly}} bad round of delays in May 2017, the MTA devised a [...] "six-point plan" [...] to reduce subway delays. It planned to hasten {{the delivery of}} new R211 cars; perform testing on boarding and alighting patterns at stations; post emergency medical technicians at key stations to treat sick passengers; double {{the frequency of the}} monthly track-defect detection tests; reduce bottlenecks at junctions; and reorganize the leadership hierarchy. The plan would cost $20 million and be implemented at 21 stations as a trial: nineteen stations on the heavily used IND Eighth Avenue Line between 125th Street and Fulton Street, as well as the 149th Street–Grand Concourse and Third Avenue–138th Street stations in the Bronx. These locations were chosen since they were the source of frequent bottlenecks. On the Eighth Avenue Line especially, there are an average of 25 subway-car breakdowns per month, with the average such delay lasting 19 minutes. The EMTs would be posted in five Eighth Avenue Line stations: 125th Street, 59th Street, 14th Street, West Fourth Street, and Fulton Street. There would also be an increased police presence. The improved boarding and alighting patterns might include color-coded platforms and subway cars, as well as additional signage. Finally, there would be a new chairman position to be split off of the existing CEO position. Transit commentators viewed the plan positively, regarding the plan as <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>step</b> toward increasing the subway's reliability.|$|E

Kate Brandli of Blogcritics said [...] "Bossy" [...] "is not nearly as good or as catchy as Miss Lohan's previous musical attempts", while commenting that its lyrical content [...] "is an obvious reflection on Miss Lohan's relationship with the paparazzi.
