5|$|Hamm {{represented}} the United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. During the group stage, she scored a goal against Norway {{to lift the}} United States to a 2–0 win. The team tied China 1–1 in their next group stage match before defeating Nigeria 3–1 to finish first in their group. After advancing to the semi-finals where the U.S. faced Brazil, Hamm scored the game-winning goal in the 60th minute. The goal marked the 127th of her international career and set a new record for most goals scored in international play by <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>or</b> man. The U.S. faced Norway in the final and were defeated 3–2 in overtime to earn the silver medal at the Games.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, men {{believed}} to possess properties of an ala were called aloviti (ala-like) men, {{and they were}} given several explanations. An ala may have sneaked into them; these were recognized by their voracity, because the ala, {{in order to satisfy}} her excessive hunger, drove them to eat incessantly. They may also have survived an ala blowing on them– an ala’s breath is usually lethal to humans. These people would then become exceptionally strong. Alternatively, they could be the offspring of an ala and <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>or</b> could have been born covered with the caul. It was believed that aloviti men could not be killed with a gun or arrow, unless gold or silver was used.|$|E

5|$|Over its 950 {{years of}} history Warwick Castle has been owned by 36 {{different}} individuals, plus four periods as crown property under seven different monarchs. It was the family seat of three separate creations of the Earls of Warwick, {{and has been a}} family home for members of the Beaumont, Beauchamp, Neville, Plantagenet, Dudley and Greville families. The first creation of the Earldom specifically included the right of inheritance through the female line, so the castle three times had <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> (<b>or</b> girl) as the owner. Eleven of the owners were under 20 when they inherited, including a girl aged two and a boy aged three. At least three owners died in battle, two were executed and one murdered. Every century except the 21st has seen major building work or adaptations at the castle.|$|E
5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>or</b> as an attractive person).|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{interest}} in Tang poetry {{in the field of}} gender studies. Although most of the poets were men, there were several significant women. Also, many of the men wrote from the viewpoint of <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>or</b> lovingly of other men. Historically and geographically localized in Tang dynasty China, this is an area which has not escaped interest from the perspective of historical gender roles.|$|E
25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agree that}} the mound was either raised for <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>or</b> {{for a young man}} and a woman as the remains of a woman and boy were found.

25|$|Modernist sculptors largely {{missed out}} on the huge boom in public art {{resulting}} from the demand for war memorials for the two World Wars, but from the 1950s the public and commissioning bodies became more comfortable with Modernist sculpture and large public commissions both abstract and figurative became common. Picasso was commissioned to make a maquette for a huge -high public sculpture, the so-called Chicago Picasso (1967). His design was ambiguous and somewhat controversial, and what the figure represents is not clear; {{it could be a}} bird, a horse, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>or</b> a totally abstract shape.|$|E

25|$|The {{group also}} agreed to {{nominate}} Trumka as secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO. The group also proposed {{to create a new}} office, that of executive vice-president, charged with mobilizing state federations and central labor councils and reaching out to minorities and women. The new position was also a way of ensuring that there would be an executive position which could be filled with <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>or</b> a minority, thus gaining additional political support for the dissidents. The Committee for Change recruited Linda Chavez-Thompson, a member of the AFL-CIO executive council, a vice-president of AFSCME and an activist on the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Rome, fellatio was {{considered}} profoundly taboo. Sexual acts were generally {{seen through the}} prism of submission and control. This is apparent in the two Latin words for the act: irrumare (to penetrate orally), and fellare (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it {{was considered}} to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since that would mean that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>or</b> another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have foul breath and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.|$|E
25|$|The Indian law {{prior to}} the Nirbhaya Incident took into account only acts of penile-vaginal {{intercourse}} within the definition of rape and forcible acts of penetration of vagina, mouth, urethra or anus through penis or an inanimate object did not fall within the definition of rape. A large number of rapists would be let-off {{because there was no}} law to punish such acts. The definition was expanded in 2013 to consider rape as any acts like penetration by penis, or any object or any part of body to any extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra or anus of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>or</b> making her to do so with another person or applying of mouth to sexual organs without the consent or will of the woman constitutes the offence of rape.|$|E

Dirndl is a diminutive form of the dated word Dirn(e) for [...] "girl"; in the 20th century, Dirne (originally an euphemism) has also developed towards meaning [...] "prostitute".
