6000|$|Less {{than six}} months after the President-Dictator's visit, Sulaco learned with stupefaction of the {{military}} revolt in the name of national honour. The Minister of War, in a barrack-square allocution to the officers of the artillery regiment he had been inspecting, had declared the national honour sold to foreigners. The Dictator, by his weak compliance with the demands of the European powers--for the settlement of long outstanding money claims--had showed himself unfit to rule. A letter from Moraga explained afterwards that the initiative, and even the very text, of the incendiary allocution came, in reality, from the other Montero, the ex-guerillero, the Commandante de Plaza. The energetic treatment of Dr. Monygham, sent for in haste [...] "to the mountain," [...] who came galloping three leagues in the dark, saved Don Jose from a dangerous <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jaundice.</b>|$|E
60|$|Presently Philip was {{fortunate}} enough to make a friend. One morning the house-physician gave him a new case, a man; and, seating himself at the bedside, Philip proceeded to write down particulars on the 'letter.' He noticed on looking at this that the patient was described as a journalist: his name was Thorpe Athelny, an unusual one for a hospital patient, and his age was forty-eight. He was suffering from a sharp <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jaundice,</b> and had been taken into the ward on account of obscure symptoms which it seemed necessary to watch. He answered the various questions which it was Philip's duty to ask him in a pleasant, educated voice. Since he was lying in bed it was difficult to tell if he was short or tall, but his small head and small hands suggested that {{he was a man of}} less than average height. Philip had the habit of looking at people's hands, and Athelny's astonished him: they were very small, with long, tapering fingers and beautiful, rosy finger-nails; they were very smooth and except for the jaundice would have been of a surprising whiteness. The patient kept them outside the bed-clothes, one of them slightly spread out, the second and third fingers together, and, while he spoke to Philip, seemed to contemplate them with satisfaction. With a twinkle in his eyes Philip glanced at the man's face. Notwithstanding the yellowness it was distinguished; he had blue eyes, a nose of an imposing boldness, hooked, aggressive but not clumsy, and a small beard, pointed and gray: he was rather bald, but his hair had evidently been quite fine, curling prettily, and he still wore it long.|$|E

6000|$|If Mr. Blyth {{had done}} nothing else in {{producing}} the picture which now confronted him, he had at least achieved one great end of all Classic Art, by reminding nobody of anything simple, familiar, or pleasing to them in nature.

[...] Down {{the middle of the}} scene ran that wonderful river, which is always rippling with the same regular waves; and always bearing onward the same capsizable galleys, with the same vermilion and blue revelers striking lyres on the deck. On the bank where there was most room for it, appeared our old, old friend, the architectural City, which nobody could possibly live in; and which is composed of nothing but temples, towers, monuments, flights of steps, and bewildering rows of pillars. In the distance, our favorite blue mountains were as blue and as peaky as ever, on Valentine's canvas; and our generally-approved pale yellow sun was still disfigured by the same <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> aerial <b>jaundice,</b> from which he has suffered ever since classical compositions first forbade him to take refuge from the sight behind a friendly cloud.|$|R

A study, using self administered questionnaire, was conducted from March 2009 to early May 2009.

40|$|Background: Jaundice is {{the most}} common cause of {{neonatal}} admission within the first month after birth. Therefore, by identifying the causes <b>of</b> <b>jaundice</b> based on the infant’s age at disease onset and age at hospital admission and providing the required training, jaundice can be managed and its associated complications can be prevented. This study was performed to evaluate the causes <b>of</b> neonatal <b>jaundice,</b> based on the infant’s age at disease onset and age at hospital admission. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, out of 3, 130 infants with jaundice, referring to Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, from 2003 to 2015, 2, 658 newborns were selected. Causes <b>of</b> <b>jaundice</b> are determined based on hematocrit, direct and indirect bilirubin, Coombs test, reticulocyte count, blood group and Rh of mother and neonate, thyroid tests, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) enzyme testing, urinalysis, urine culture, and If necessary, Na, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and other tests depending on the doctor's supervision. After confirming jaundice in infants, based on the physician’s diagnosis and laboratory results, a researcher-made questionnaire including the infant’s characteristics, was completed. Results: Based on our study, 27. 9 % of infants had identified as causes <b>of</b> <b>jaundice.</b> Known causes <b>of</b> <b>jaundice</b> were blood group incompatibility (40 %), infection (19 %), G 6 PD enzyme deficiency (12 %), endocrine disorders (8 %), neonatal hypernatremic dehydration (7 %), polycythemia (6 %), congenital heart disease (CHD) (4 %), occult bleeding (3 %) and Crigler-Najjar syndrome (2 %). The most common time of hospital admission <b>of</b> <b>jaundice</b> was 4 - 6 days after birth due to blood incompatibilities, occult bleeding, endocrine disorders, hypernatremic dehydration, CHD, polycythemia and G 6 PD enzyme deficiency. Moreover, the most common time of admission due to infection was after the first week of birth. Conclusion: The most common age <b>of</b> onset <b>of</b> <b>jaundice</b> was first three days of birth for blood incompatibility, although they were admitted two days later. Therefore, neonatal admission at appropriate time at onset <b>of</b> <b>jaundice</b> and receiving prompt treatments can reduce the probable complications (e. g., kernicterus) ...|$|R

Lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis (LPSP) is a benign form of chronic pancreatitis characterized clinically by infrequent <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> abdominal pain, <b>jaundice,</b> and weight loss, and pathologically by focal or diffuse chronic or lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrates centered around pancreatic ducts and ductules, accompanied by obliterative phlebitis, acinar atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis.

It has been described as "primary sclerosing pancreatitis," "sclerosing cholangitis," "non-alcoholic duct destructive chronic pancreatitis," and "autoimmune pancreatitis. " We report a case of LPSP that mimicked pancreatic adenocarcinoma and was subsequently treated with a pylorus-preserving Whipple procedure. This may point towards a primary biliary autoimmune process involving the pancreatic duct, causing a benign form of chronic pancreatitis that may be difficult to characterize pre-operatively to avoid surgery. This case typifies the growing awareness of this relatively recently characterized clinical entity, its similar presentation to pancreatic carcinoma, and the importance for LPSP to be included in the differential diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary disease.
