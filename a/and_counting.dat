Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis; and specific antibodies such as Aquaporin 4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions. A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{detecting}} errors concerning article usage and singular/plural usage based on the mass count distinction. Although the mass count distinction is particularly important in detecting these errors, it has been pointed {{out that it is}} hard to make heuristic rules for distinguishing mass <b>and</b> <b>count</b> nouns. To solve the problem, first, instances of mass <b>and</b> <b>count</b> nouns are automatically collected from a corpus exploiting surface information in the proposed method. Then, words surrounding the mass (count) instances are weighted based on their frequencies. Finally, the weighted words are used for distinguishing mass <b>and</b> <b>count</b> nouns. After distinguishing mass <b>and</b> <b>count</b> nouns, the above errors can be detected by some heuristic rules. Experiments show that the proposed method distinguishes mass <b>and</b> <b>count</b> nouns in the writing of Japanese learners of English with an accuracy of 93 % and that 65 % of article errors are detected with a precision of 70 %. ...|$|R

Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions <b>and</b> <b>counting,</b> going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.|$|E

He {{was also the first}} Dodger to record three {{consecutive}} multi-hit games to start the season since Adrián Beltré did it in the 2000 season. This was the third time he had won the award, and second consecutive as he had won it the final week of 2011 as well. On April 10, Kemp became the first LA Dodger to have an RBI in the first five games of the season since J. D. Drew in the 2006 season <b>and,</b> <b>counting</b> the end of the previous season, he had nine straight games with an RBI, tying Roy Campanella (1955 season) and Augie Galan (1944 season) for the Dodgers franchise record. Kemp also won the Player of the Week award for the second week of the season, which, combined with winning the award in the last week of 2011, made him the only player to ever win three consecutive awards. He was also only the second player to win the award twice to begin the season, the other being Tony Armas for the 1981 Athletics. Kemp hit 12–22 with 4 HRs and a 1.182 slugging percentage, leading the club to its best 10-game start since 1981.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is the widespread phenomenon of learning to read, write <b>and</b> <b>count</b> in early childhood around the District of Wiradesa, Pekalongan.

And how it impacts their ability to read, write <b>and</b> <b>count</b> <b>and</b> their psychological. To answer these questions, observation, in-depth interview and documentation were used in this study. To analysis data, review and reflection, exploration, and reduction were used. The results showed that the phenomenon of learning to read, write <b>and</b> <b>count</b> in early childhood in Pekalongan appeared on concerns of parents with a basic level of selection into the elementary school. Many early childhood activities were included in the part-time formal learning. Most of them also followed that lesson in educational institutions. Consequently, those who were following the course outside their formal school mastered faster, although their psychological impact tended to quickly become bored with learning. Meanwhile, the introduction of learning to read, write <b>and</b> <b>count</b> in early childhood in kindergarten was slower because it did not focus solely on that learning, but dominantly in play activities. On the one hand, the kids did not get bored and did not realize they were learning to read, write <b>and</b> <b>count,</b> because learning is integrated in play activities...|$|R
