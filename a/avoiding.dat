40|$|Abstract. This paper {{contains}} {{four main}} results {{associated with an}} attractor of a projective iterated function system (IFS). The first theorem characterizes when a projective IFS has an attractor which <b>avoids</b> a hyperplane. The second theorem establishes that a projective IFS has at most one attractor. In the third theorem the classical duality between points and hyperplanes in projec-tive space leads to connections between attractors that <b>avoid</b> hyperplanes and repellers that <b>avoid</b> points, as well as hyperplane attractors that <b>avoid</b> points and repellers that <b>avoid</b> hyperplanes. Finally, an index is defined for attractors which <b>avoid</b> a hyperplane. This index is {{shown to be a}} nontrivial projective invariant. 1...|$|R
