Hellraiser Films also provides <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>look</b> at the fan short film No More Souls.|$|E

Eric Goldman of IGN, giving the episode an 8.2. rating ("Impressive"), wrote favorably, {{noting that the}} depiction Dr. Octopus [...] "was very clever – on one hand, he was a pitiful, cowering pushover. But when Norman was berating him we got <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>look</b> at the anger within, as he imagined attacking Norman with his robotic tentacles." [...] Goldman applauded both Dr. Octopus' line, [...] "I've been good" [...] and when Spider-Man crashes into several stuffed animals, only to be pulled out by Dr. Octopus {{in a manner similar}} to a carnival game; he concluded that, [...] "This show continues to leave several prime time live-action shows to shame when it comes to building serialized stories and has been one of the most pleasant surprises of the TV season." ...|$|E

Alex Macpherson of Fact said that, {{apart from its}} interesting music, Rated R is important for how Rihanna has [...] "seized back control of her public story" [...] during [...] "our current [...] age". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe praised it as <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>look</b> at both Rihanna's development {{as an artist and}} [...] "the confluence of tabloid culture and pop art". MSN Music's Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention, indicating a [...] "likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy." [...] He cited [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy" [...] as highlights and credited Rihanna for [...] "concocting a persona of interest out of one dynamite musical trick and a bad patch I wouldn't wish on Lindsay Lohan".|$|E

The image went viral after it was Photoshopped into various [...] "impressive" [...] places and situations, e.g. {{on top of the}} Great Wall of China and standing next to Usain Bolt. Maroney stated that she found the Internet meme [...] "kinda funny". Maroney later poked fun at the meme on various occasions including appearances on The Late Show with David Letterman, The Colbert Report, , Extra, and most notably when she {{and the rest of the}} U.S. Gymnastics team met United States President Barack Obama at the White House in November 2012. She and President Obama posed for a photo together, both making the same pursed-lips expression. The podium picture made the top spot on Yahoo's list of [...] "Most Viral Photos" [...] of 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The tarsier, {{especially}} if it's a male, {{is also a}} territorial creature. A male would attack any young tarsier venturing into its territory and kill it with a fierce bite. [...] "That's why when there's a newborn, we try {{to check on the}} position [...] three times a day," [...] he said, adding that the male tarsier's murderous disposition precluded keeping it in a small, enclosed space. The creatures seem to have a good memory, too. [...] "Because whenever there are guests, that's when their eyes stay wide open. If it's just me around, they give me <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>look</b> and go back to sleep," [...] he said. The tarsier mainly dines on insects, usually crickets, and frogs. Its chief predator, on the other hand, is the common house cat. The estimated 100 tarsiers in the PTFI sanctuary can climb over the surrounding seven-foot-high net fence to hunt elsewhere at night. But they almost always return before daybreak. The fence is actually more for keeping the cats out and the insects in, Pizarras explained. Thus, he and two other staff members have made it their daily morning routine to inspect the net for breaches. At night, with the help of strong fog lights, flying insects from neighboring hills are drawn to the sanctuary, providing the tarsiers a steady menu.|$|E
