50|$|Therefore, a B-double would weigh 62.5 t (6 t + 16.5 t + 20 t + 20 t). A double {{road train}} would have an <b>operational</b> <b>weight</b> (without concessions) of 79 t (6 t + 16.5 t + 20 t + 16.5 t + 20 t). A triple is 79 t + 36.5 t (16.5 t + 20 t), giving an all up weight of 115.5 t. Quads weigh in at 135.5 t. Concessional weight {{additions}} (0.5 - 2.5 t per group) can see a quad end up weighing 149 t. If a tri-drive prime mover is utilised, along with tri-axle dollies, weights can reach nearly 170 t.|$|R
50|$|Cost recovery. Financial {{viability}} in {{the urban}} areas has improved with six of the nine licensed commercial utilities operating in Zambia reaching operational cost coverage {{by the end of}} 2006. In 2010 the <b>average</b> <b>operational</b> cost recovery was 105%, varying from 46% to 130% in Mulonga. According to one study, higher levels of cost recovery are impeded by a high level of non-revenue water (44% in 2010) and low collection efficiency due to a large extent to the non-payment of water bills by public institutions. Cost recovery is almost nonexistent in rural areas where most communities do not pay anything.|$|R
25|$|In many {{real world}} {{situations}} {{the act of}} weighing may produce a result that differs from the ideal value provided by the definition used. This is usually {{referred to as the}} apparent weight of the object. A common example of this is the effect of buoyancy, when an object is immersed in a fluid the displacement of the fluid will cause an upward force on the object, making it appear lighter when weighed on a scale. The apparent weight may be similarly affected by levitation and mechanical suspension. When the gravitational definition of weight is used, the <b>operational</b> <b>weight</b> measured by an accelerating scale is often also referred to as the apparent weight.|$|R

30|$|The large {{reduction}} of mileage and fuel consumption after 2009 is, unfortunately, not {{a result of}} environmental or public transport policies but {{is directly related to}} the recent economic crisis in Greece.

Other improvements are to include a lighter 120 mm gun, added road wheels with improved suspension, a more durable track, lighter armor, long-range precision armaments, and infrared camera and laser detectors. A new internal computer system is also planned, with current cabling replaced by fiber-optic cables that can reduce weight by two tons.

25|$|Domestic water {{charges in}} Ireland were thus {{prohibited}} under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997, passed in May 1997 {{shortly before the}} June 1997 general elections in which Fine Gael lost to Fianna Fáil under Bertie Ahern. However, because of popular discontent, the new government chose not to pursue domestic water charges. Instead, it embarked on consultations {{which resulted in the}} 1998 Water Services Pricing Policy. This policy banned cross-subsidy of domestic services from non-domestic charges. For non-domestic users, the policy required the recovery of <b>average</b> <b>operational</b> and marginal capital costs of water services from these users.

Domestic operational costs were to be paid for through a local government fund, and capital costs were to be financed through the capital programme of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.|$|R
40|$|In this project, seven <b>operational</b> <b>weighting</b> sets {{have been}} {{selected}} and have been applied to the intervention profiles of the EU 28, the World and the Netherlands, not on time series. Three sets are available for the weighting applied on midpoint level. Three sets are available for the weighting applied on endpoint level. One set is available for the integrated modelling and weighting, applied on intervention level. All weighting sets applied on midpoint level refer to interactive panel weighting, i. e. EPA, BEES, and NOGEPA. Two weighting sets applied on endpoint level refer to panel weighting, i. e. Ecoindicator 99 and LIME. One weighting set, ReCiPe damage, refers to weighting on endpoint level using damage cost based on willingness-to-pay (WtP) valuation, which is itself based on panels but usually not interactive panels. All methods have specific advantages and disadvantages, on which diverging views exist. Midpoint approaches have a clear modelling basis with mutually inconsistent elements and they rely on extensive subjective estimates in the combined further-modelling-and weighting step. Endpoint models can have a weak modelling step after the midpoint and then are conceptually similar to the valuation step in the economics oriented integrated modelling and weighting. The integrated modelling approach has some strong points in modelling (e. g. in climate modelling), but is weak in its further modelling. The valuation step {{of this approach is}} best specified, based on thoroughly tested but not unquestionable methods. The seven selected and expanded <b>operational</b> <b>weighting</b> methods have been combined into a single meta-weighting set. This combined weighting set can be varied as to the strength of the individual methods in determining the outcome. The application to a time series of European data suggests {{that there is not a}} wide divergence between the different weighting methods, at least as developed and applied in this report. This means that the choice of specific weighting methods may not have an overarching influence on outcomes and the combined set of meta-weights may reasonably reflect different positions in weighting. Nevertheless, this may also be linked to some of the adaptations and extrapolations across methods made in this project. JRC. H. 8 -Sustainability Assessmen...|$|R
