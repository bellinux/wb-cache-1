5|$|Atypical {{antipsychotics}} are modestly {{useful in}} reducing aggression and psychosis {{in people with}} Alzheimer's disease, but their <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> offset by serious adverse effects, such as stroke, movement difficulties or cognitive decline. When used in the long-term, they {{have been shown to}} associate with increased mortality. Stopping antipsychotic use in this group of people appears to be safe.|$|E
5|$|It {{is largely}} an {{empirical}} procedure, {{and has a}} reasonable safety record {{within the scope of}} its intended application. <b>Advantages</b> <b>are</b> reduced overall decompression time and for some versions, easy estimation of decompression by the use of a simple rule-based procedure which can be done underwater by the diver. It requires the use of specific gas mixtures for given depth ranges. The advantages claimed are flexibility in that if the depth is not known accurately, the schedule can be adjusted during the dive to allow for the actual depth, and that it allows deep dives without the use of an expensive trimix dive computer.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower {{the costs of}} mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent {{and need to be}} widely shared.|$|E

5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid vigour. These <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E

50|$|How {{successful}} {{an adversary}} is at breaking {{a system is}} measured by its advantage. An adversary's <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> {{the difference between the}} adversary's probability of breaking the system and the probability that the system can be broken by simply guessing. The <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> specified {{as a function of the}} security parameter.|$|R

25|$|CT {{pulmonary}} angiography (CTPA) is a pulmonary angiogram obtained using computed tomography (CT) with radiocontrast rather than right heart catheterization. Its <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> clinical equivalence, its non-invasive nature, its greater availability to people, {{and the possibility}} of identifying other lung disorders from the differential diagnosis in case there is no pulmonary embolism.|$|E
25|$|Multiple anchor mooring systems use {{two or more}} (often three) {{light weight}} temporary-style anchors set in an {{equilateral}} arrangement and all chained to a common center from which a conventional rode extends to a mooring buoy. The <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> minimized mass, ease of deployment, high holding-power-to-weight ratio, and availability of temporary-style anchors.|$|E
25|$|Nintendo's {{controversial}} {{selection of}} the cartridge medium for the Nintendo 64 has been cited as {{a key factor in}} Nintendo losing its dominant position in the gaming market. Some of the cartridge's <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> difficult for developers to manifest prominently, requiring innovative solutions which only came late in the console's life cycle.|$|E

25|$|Several {{authors in}} the last 300 years have noted a {{facility}} of positional notation that amounts to a modified decimal representation. Some <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> cited for use of numerical digits that represent negative values. In 1840 Augustin-Louis Cauchy advocated use of signed-digit representation of numbers, and in 1928 Florian Cajori presented his collection of references for negative numerals. The concept of signed-digit representation has also been taken up in computer design.|$|E
25|$|Despite all the {{favorable}} factors, and utilization in commercial reactors in the past, interest in thorium diminished {{in the late}} 1980s due to various reasons. Critics of thorium claim that the <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> overstated and {{it is unlikely to}} be a useful source of energy. Experts point the adverse economics and the availability of plentiful sources of energy that will deter full commercialization of thorium based energy. These and other issues regarding the use of thorium have been debated.|$|E
25|$|With exports {{equivalent}} to over two-thirds of GNP, Belgium depends heavily on world trade. Belgium's trade <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> derived from its central geographic location {{and a highly}} skilled, multilingual, and productive work force. One of the founding members of the European Community, Belgium strongly supports deepening {{the powers of the}} present-day European Union to integrate European economies further. About three-quarters of its trade is with other EU countries. Together with the Netherlands and Luxembourg, Belgium is also one of Benelux member states.|$|E

25|$|Assuming {{complete}} tritium burn-up, {{the reduction}} in the fraction of fusion energy carried by neutrons would be only about 18%, so that the primary advantage of the D-D fuel cycle is that tritium breeding would not be required. Other <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> independence from scarce lithium resources and a somewhat softer neutron spectrum. The disadvantage of D-D compared to D-T is that the energy confinement time (at a given pressure) must be 30 times longer and the power produced (at a given pressure and volume) would be 68 times less.|$|E
25|$|Nitrox {{is used to}} {{a lesser}} extent in surface-supplied diving, as these <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> reduced by the more complex {{logistical}} requirements for nitrox compared to the use of simple low-pressure compressors for breathing gas supply. Nitrox can also be used in hyperbaric treatment of decompression illness, usually at pressures where pure oxygen would be hazardous. Nitrox is not a safer gas than compressed air in all respects; although its use can reduce the risk of decompression sickness, it increases the risk of oxygen toxicity and fire.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} <b>advantages</b> <b>were</b> {{evaluated}} and established during the 1920s by Roy Fedden and Harry Ricardo, possibly the sleeve valve engine's greatest advocate. He conceded {{that some of}} these <b>advantages</b> <b>were</b> significantly eroded as fuels improved up to and during World War II and as sodium-cooled exhaust valves were introduced in high-output aircraft engines.|$|R
5000|$|For Whose <b>Advantage?</b> <b>is</b> {{a second}} studio album by British thrash metal band Xentrix. It was {{released}} on August 21, 1990 through Roadrunner Records.

25|$|Lights can be powered through {{electromagnetic}} induction. Reelight, a Danish company, is {{well known}} for this and claims as much as one third of all bikes in Denmark feature it. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels and powered every time a magnet on the wheel spoke passes, eliminating the need for batteries. The <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> pretty much the same as with dynamo lighting while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos and eliminating the noise and wear of the tire.|$|E
25|$|Brazil's main {{competitive}} <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> {{its natural}} resources, which ranked 1st on this criteria {{out of all}} countries considered, and ranked 23rd for its cultural resources, due to its many World Heritage sites. The TTCI report notes Brazil's main weaknesses: its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped (ranked 116th), {{with the quality of}} roads ranking in 105th place; and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness (ranked 114th), due in part to high ticket taxes and airport charges, as well as high prices and high taxation. Safety and security have improved significantly: 75th in 2011, up from 128th in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Dead weights are the {{simplest}} type of anchor. They are generally {{made as a}} large concrete block with a rode attached which resists movement with sheer weight; and, to a small degree, by settling into the substrate. In New Zealand old railway wheels are sometimes used. The <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> that they are simple and cheap. A dead weight mooring that drags in a storm still holds well in its new position. Such moorings are better suited to rocky bottoms where other mooring systems do not hold well. The disadvantages are that they are heavy, bulky, and awkward.|$|E

5|$|The Irish and British {{authorities}} co-operated in the chartering of ships. They made combined {{purchases of}} wheat, maize, sugar, animal feeds and petrol. At {{the start of}} the war, Irish ships joined convoys protected by the Royal Navy. The <b>advantages</b> <b>were</b> protection and cheaper insurance. These <b>advantages</b> <b>were</b> not borne out by experience. So they chose to sail alone.|$|R
