5|$|Activision {{provided}} {{a budget of}} US$1.8 million; the amount was intentionally kept low to make the project manageable for Nihilistic and reduce the risk to Activision, which was relatively inexperienced with RPGs at the time. Nihilistic's management was committed to the entire team working in a one-room environment with no walls, doors, or offices, believing this would force the individual groups to communicate and allow each department to respond to queries immediately, saving hours or days of development time. Redemptions story was developed with input from Wolf; it was co-written by Daniel Greenberg, <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> source pen-and-paper RPG.|$|E

It was especially popular among Hispanics, who made up 32% of the audience on the opening weekend, and <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Hollywood Reporter attributed the film's popularity to strong word of mouth.

5|$|Kane's {{style of}} play has been {{compared}} to that of former Tottenham forward Jürgen Klinsmann, a comparison Kane called flattering in February 2015. In March 2015, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke named Kane as the benchmark for clubs producing young English players. Shearer said that month that the three best strikers playing in the league were Kane, Diego Costa and Sergio Agüero. In November 2015, <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Daily Mail theorised that Kane could be the striker in a spine of Tottenham players in the England team, alongside Eric Dier and Dele Alli.|$|E
5|$|Weiner {{conceived}} {{of the script}} in 2000 while working as <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> television sitcom Becker. Before writing the pilot episode, he studied American literature and cinema of the 1950s and 1960s to get a perspective on American culture during that period. Weiner sent the script to The Sopranos creator David Chase, who recruited Weiner {{to work with him}} on The Sopranos. Weiner shelved the project for seven years to focus on Chase's program; interest for Mad Men did not surface until the conclusion of The Sopranos final season.|$|E

5|$|Adaptation {{had been}} in {{development}} {{as far back as}} 1994. Jonathan Demme brought the project to Columbia Pictures with Kaufman writing the script. Kaufman experienced writer's block and {{did not know what to}} think of The Orchid Thief. Finally he wrote a script based on his experience of adapting the book into a screenplay. Jonze signed to direct, and filming was finished in June 2001. Though the film is billed as an adaptation of The Orchid Thief, its primary narrative focus is Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt The Orchid Thief into a film, while dramatizing the events of the book in parallel. Adaptation also adds a number of fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche, and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events related in The Orchid Thief.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to England, Spurr {{worked as a}} journalist. In 1952 The London Daily Express sent him to Japan as its China and Far East correspondent, but he found that he had little time to resume his pursuit {{of information on the}} fate of Yamato. In the mid-1970s Spurr returned to the Far East again, this time as <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Far Eastern Economic Review. He began conducting interviews about Yamato with former Japanese naval commanders and survivors of the battleship's last mission. He also gained access to Japanese naval documents and records seized by the United States, plus US interrogation transcripts. For the American side of the story, he interviewed US naval commanders and personnel involved in the sinking of Yamato. Satisfied with what he had, Spurr began writing the book in the late 1970s, over 30 years after he first found out about the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Andjar became <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{theatrical}} troupe Dardanella in November 1930, {{working under}} the group's founder Willy A. Piedro. Andjar believed the troupe to be dedicated to the betterment of the toneel {{as an art form}} and not only motivated by financial interests, as were the earlier stambul troupes. He wrote and published many plays with the group's backing, including Dr Samsi and Singa Minangkabau (The Lion of Minangkabau). Andjar also worked as a theatre critic, writing several pieces on the history of local theatre, sometimes using his birth name and sometimes his pseudonym. In 1936 Andjar went with Dardanella to India to record a film adaptation of his drama Dr Samsi, which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous Indo discovered he had an illegitimate child. The deal fell through, however, and Andjar left India with his wife Ratna.|$|E

5|$|Larry Wilmore, {{who plays}} the {{sensitivity}} trainer Mr. Brown, is <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore read for the role to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels thought he was perfect for the role. However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors for the role. Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, {{is far from the}} bubbly, chatty character that Kelly later becomes.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{continued}} to write articles for the New York Daily Tribune {{as long as}} he was sure that the Tribune's editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy. No longer was the Tribune to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Tribune.|$|E
5|$|Showtime began {{developing}} the series {{at the start}} of 2005, planning for it {{to be based on the}} novel by Jeff Lindsay. By February, Emmy-winning writer James Manos, Jr. (<b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Sopranos) was on board to write the pilot script with John Goldwyn, with Sara Colleton as executive producer. By June 13, 2005, Showtime had given the show a green-light to be aired for the next year. The premise of the episode follows the same storyline as Jeff Lindsay's novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the first in the series of novels on which the television show is based, albeit with many additional elements and altered characters. Dexter was released on Showtime as part of a batch of new programs for the network, along with Brotherhood, This American Life and a reality TV series called Sexual Healing.|$|E

5|$|Stacey Snider, {{the chief}} {{executive}} of DreamWorks, suggested that the film would earn around $30 million in its opening weekend and go on to be as successful as , which earned $129 million in the U.S. and Canada and $260 million worldwide. The Dark Knight had been the number one film at the box office for the fourweeks prior to the release of Tropic Thunder. Bob Thompson, <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> National Post, speculated that Tropic Thunders opening weekend would outperform The Dark Knight for the weekend. In a list compiled prior to the summer's film releases, Entertainment Weekly predicted that the film would be the tenthhighest-grossing film of the summer at the American box office with $142.6million.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden, and {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. This was the first episode Scott directed for the show. Crittenden also made her debut as <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons in this episode. Crittenden was taking a beginners' writing program at 20th Century Fox when former The Simpsons showrunner David Mirkin hired her on the show. Crittenden's only writing experience before that had been as an intern on the Late Show with David Letterman. 20th Century Fox introduced Crittenden to Mirkin, and Mirkin read a script of hers that he liked. When Mirkin first talked to Crittenden, {{he thought she was}} a really nice woman who was very mature. Crittenden was only 23 years old at the time, but Mirkin liked her and he hired her.|$|E
5|$|The now {{recurring}} character Professor Frink {{makes his}} first appearance on the show in this episode. Frink was originally written as a mad scientist, but when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's The Nutty Professor character, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after The Simpsons writer John Frink; however, that was before he became <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> show. The episode features a guest appearance from American actress Audrey Meadows as Bea. Al Jean, a writer on the show, said Meadows was perfect for the role because she was very sweet, and the staff {{had a lot of}} fun during the recording sessions with her. This is the only episode to date where the closing credits actually states which characters each actor voices. This was done because the staff often received questions from fans regarding what characters each voice actor provided the voice for.|$|E
