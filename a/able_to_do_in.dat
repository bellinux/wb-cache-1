5|$|The global {{nature of}} the war meant that many {{functions}} that were previously vested in the individual Australian state governments had to be placed {{under the control of}} the Commonwealth government. Additionally, the exigencies of the war meant that the government required the power to enact certain laws that under the Constitution it would not normally be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> order to enable this to occur, the War Precautions Act 1914 was introduced in October 1914, providing the Commonwealth government with wide-ranging powers for a period of up to six months after the duration of the war.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, the mob, {{action and}} {{adventure}} stories {{fell out of}} favor with producers, due to generally declining ratings for daytime soap operas at the time, and the resultant budget cuts. In addition, soap operas were {{no longer able to}} go on expensive location shoots overseas as they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s. During that decade, soap operas increasingly focused on younger characters and social issues, such as Erica Kane's drug addiction on All My Children, the re-emergence of Viki Lord's multiple personality disorder on One Life to Live, and Stuart Chandler dealing with his wife Cindy dying of AIDS on All My Children. Other social issues included cancer, rape, abortion, homophobia, and racism.|$|E

500|$|In the {{elections}} of 1825, the Old Court supporters won control of the Kentucky House of Representatives. When the General Assembly's session opened in November 1825, Old Court partisans immediately formed a committee to make recommendations related {{to the court of}} appeals. On November 23, Old Court supporters introduced a bill to repeal the reorganization act. The measure passed the House, but failed in the Senate, where Old Court and New Court supporters were equal in number; the deciding vote was cast by Lieutenant Governor Robert B. McAfee, aligned with New Court advocates. In December, the Assembly's committee concluded that the Old Court justices were [...] "constitutional judges" [...] and consequently, the legislature did not have power to abolish their positions. The best the Old Court supporters were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> 1825 was to pass a non-binding resolution condemning the reorganization act.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{returned}} for the 1993 season enticed by {{the chance to}} play with a new coach (Dan Reeves), and determined not to end his career due to an injury. The Giants had a resurgent season in 1993. They finished 11–5, and competed for the top NFC playoff seed. Taylor finished with 6 sacks, and the Giants defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed. They defeated the Vikings 17–10 in the opening round of the playoffs. The next week on January 15, 1994 in what would be Taylor's final game, the Giants were beaten 44–3 by the 49ers. As the game came to a conclusion, television cameras drew in close on Taylor who was crying. He announced his retirement at the post-game press conference saying, [...] "I think it's time for me to retire. I've done everything I can do. I've been to Super Bowls. I've been to playoffs. I've done things that other people haven't been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> this game before. After 13 years, it's time for me to go." ...|$|E
500|$|URBs Dan Vidal {{called the}} album [...] "a {{spectrum}} of sound — packed and arranged perfectly into a masterfully composed (debut) full-length body of work... genre-defying masterpiece". Comparing it to singer Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989), Brentin Mock of The Atlantic called The ArchAndroid [...] "a smothered funk, though perhaps at times too thick, too inaccessible, {{but not so}} much I didn't want to shake my ass" [...] and viewed it as musically progressive, stating [...] "Monáe has given pop music its first Toni Morrison moment, where fantasy, funk, and the ancestors come together for an experience that evolves one's soul... You really don't know whether you want to diagram it, dance to it, or just be dumbstruck. It owes as much to Parliament-Funkadelic as it does to Samuel R. Delany and Octavia E. Butler. She is finally doing what a number of artists—particularly black artists—have not been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> years, and that's move pop music forward". Robert Christgau was less impressed in The Barnes & Noble Review, deeming it [...] "the most overrated album of the year" [...] while writing that Monáe's [...] "songwriting is 60th percentile, her singing technical, her sci-fi plot the usual rot".|$|E

500|$|Lindstrom {{explained}} that they integrated the elements of climbing, shooting and puzzle solving. This instalment also features a new melee combat system, requiring Lara in some instances to use [...] "direct combat and evasive manoeuvres to distance herself from her attacker". Notably, Lara's bike, among other things, is a key component in solving the puzzles she will encounter in her adventure. Pick-ups have multiple uses as weapons and tools in interaction with the environment, and Lindstrom stated that Lara [...] "can also split up her guns and fire at two different targets simultaneously," [...] or hold an item {{with one hand and}} fire a gun with the other. The grappling hook can be stretched taut and used to pull objects off ledges, illustrating what project lead Rob Pavey said, that [...] "Lara {{will be able to do}} anything that you'd expect her to be able to do," [...] which he called [...] "the big theme this year." [...] Lindstrom describes this as [...] "a philosophy called 'What Could Lara Do?'—WCLD. It's short-hand for having the player be able to use their own intuition about what someone with her abilities should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> an environment such as this, and consistency across the different mechanics and abilities. If she can throw a grenade, then if she can pick up this pole, why can't she throw it?" [...] Crystal Dynamics also made the game non-linear, offering elaborate multi-stage puzzles.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the console}} used 32-bit {{processing}} and {{was capable of}} better graphics and sound than the Genesis alone, most games for the 32X did {{not take advantage of}} its hardware. Doom for the 32X received near perfect reviews from gaming magazines upon launch, but was later noted for being an inferior version of the game compared to releases for the PC and the Atari Jaguar, with the 32X version criticized for missing levels, poor graphic and audio quality, chuggy movement, and running within a window on the screen. Though the system had enhanced audio capabilities, 32X games did not use this, which Franz believes was due to developers being unwilling to invest in designing games to work with the new audio enhancements. [...] One source of these issues was the rush to release games on time for the 32X's launch; former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham explained, in reference to 32X launch title Cosmic Carnage, [...] "We were rushed. [...] We had to get games out for the 32X and {{it was going to be}} such a close cycle. [...] When Cosmic Carnage showed up, we didn't even want to ship it. [...] It took a lot of convincing, you know, to ship that title." [...] Likewise with Doom, id Software's John Carmack rushed to have the port ready for release at the 32X's launch and had to trim out a third of the game's levels in order to meet the deadline for the port to be published on time. [...] Because of time limitations, game designs were intentionally conservative and did not show what the 32X hardware was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> an interview at the end of 1995, Sega vice president of marketing Mike Ribero, while insisting that Sega was not abandoning the 32X, acknowledged that first party software support for the system had been lackluster: [...] "I won't lie to you, we screwed up with 32X. We overpromised and underdelivered." ...|$|E

2500|$|O'Connell's {{campaign}} was {{hampered by the}} limited scope of the franchise in Ireland. The wider the franchise was expanded, the better anti-Union parties were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> Ireland. Running on a platform that advocated something like the self-rule successfully enacted in Canada under the British North America Act, 1867, Home Rulers won a majority of both county and borough seats in Ireland in 1874. [...] By 1882, leadership of the Home Rule movement had passed to Charles Stewart Parnell of the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP). A wider franchise also changed the ideological mix among non-Irish MPs, making them more receptive to Irish demands. The 1885 election resulted in a hung parliament in which the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) held the balance of power. They initially supported the Conservatives in a minority government, but when news leaked that Liberal Party leader William Ewart Gladstone was considering Home Rule, the IPP ousted the Conservatives and brought the Liberals into office.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2000 {{article in}} The New Yorker Alex Ross {{described}} him as a bully. Boulez did not disagree: “Certainly I was a bully. I’m not ashamed of it at all. The hostility of the establishment to what you were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the Forties and Fifties was very strong. Sometimes {{you have to fight}} against your society.” Boulez's hostility was not only directed against the establishment. When, in 1951, Henri Dutilleux, who was only {{a few years older than}} Boulez, presented his First Symphony, Boulez greeted him by turning his back. As Dutilleux said many years later: [...] "the problem was he had a lot more power than me. Indeed, he has often seemed to enjoy expressing his contempt for other musicians who do not share his musical views." [...] The most notorious instance of this is Boulez's declaration in 1952 that [...] "any musician who has not experienced‍—‌I do not say understood, but truly experienced‍—‌the necessity of dodecaphonic music is USELESS. For his whole work is irrelevant to the needs of his epoch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon after {{entering}} service, pilots began {{to report that}} “during flights of the P-39 in certain maneuvers, it tumbled end over end.” Most of these events happened after the aircraft was stalled in a nose high attitude with considerable power applied. Concerned, Bell initiated a test program. Bell pilots made 86 separate efforts to reproduce the reported tumbling characteristics. In no case were they able to tumble the aircraft. In his autobiography veteran test and airshow pilot R.A. “Bob” Hoover provides an account of tumbling a P-39. He {{goes on to say}} that in hindsight, he was actually performing a Lomcovak, a now-common airshow maneuver, which he was also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> a Curtiss P-40. [...] An informal study of the P-39’s spinning characteristics was conducted in the NASA Langley Research Center 20-foot Free-Spinning Tunnel during the 1970s. A study of old reports showed that during earlier spin testing in the facility, the aircraft had never tumbled. However, it was noted that all testing had been done with a simulated full ammunition load, which drew the aircraft’s center of gravity forward. After finding the original spin test model of the P-39 in storage, the new study first replicated the earlier testing, with consistent results. Then, the model was re-ballasted to simulate a condition of no ammunition load, which moved the aircraft’s center of gravity aft. Under these conditions, the model was found to often tumble when thrown into the tunnel.|$|E

2500|$|That night, Louis Martin and his daughters, Léonie, Céline and Thérèse, {{attended}} the midnight mass at the cathedral in Lisieux— [...] "but {{there was very}} little heart left in them. On 1 December, Léonie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to Les Buissonnets after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alençon", and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at Les Buissonnets as every year, Thérèse [...] "as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the air bearing toys and cakes." [...] While she and Celine were going up the stairs she heard her father, [...] "perhaps exhausted by the hour, or this reminder of the relentless emotional demands of his weepy youngest daughter", say with some irritation [...] "Therese is far too old for this now. Fortunately this will be the last year!" [...] Thérèse had begun to cry and Céline advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Thérèse pulled herself together and wiped her tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt by the fireplace and unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895 : [...] "In an instant Jesus, content with my good will, accomplished the work I had not been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> ten years." [...] After nine sad years she had [...] "recovered the strength of soul she had lost" [...] when her mother died and, she said, [...] "she was to retain it forever".
