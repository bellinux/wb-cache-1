5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>being</b> out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E
5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Iraq Football Association, which was headed by Uday Hussein, in the 1990s, there were many controversies <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>being</b> a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by gathering information on their targets. The documents included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show the approval of the Personal Secretary of Former President Saddam Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000. One of the documents showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
25|$|Ramaswami {{left his}} home in Adyar {{on the morning of}} 15 October 1985 and never returned. There have been {{occasional}} rumours <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>being</b> sighted. Wisden listed him as 'presumed dead' from 1988 to 1991. When doubts were raised about his fate, this was removed in 1992 but brought back in 1996. In the more recent editions, he has the status 'd. unknown'.|$|E

25|$|Following the event, Dave {{decides to}} quit being Kick-Ass. He reveals his {{identity}} to Katie, and clears up the misunderstanding <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>being</b> gay.

25|$|Of all the Irish annals, the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland {{contain the}} most {{information}} <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> <b>being</b> composed in Osraige likely at {{the commission of}} his descendant Donnchad mac Gilla Pátraic, and therefore caution must be exercised over it as a source. Cerball is portrayed as an archetype of a Christian king who consistently vanquishes his enemies, especially pagan Vikings; yet is recorded allying with rival bands of Vikings to defeat them during his early career. Those Vikings allied with Cerball are portrayed in a more favorable light than those he defeats, thus mitigating the stigma of a Christian king allying with pagan marauders.|$|E
25|$|There are early {{hints that}} Seishirō {{may not be}} all that he appears. Hokuto jokes <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>being</b> {{a member of the}} family of Sakurazukamori, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill, and are {{pronounced}} to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Also, Subaru has dreams about having met someone under a cherry tree blooming out of season when he was but a small child, but he cannot quite recall what was being said. This person was actually Seishirō, upon whom Subaru stumbled when he had just performed a kill. According to the rules of the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō should have killed him, but impressed with the child's purity, he made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would then spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing he could easily destroy, as he could not with any other person, then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey. These marks are for most of the story hidden beneath the gloves Subaru continually wears on the direction of his grandmother, the previous family head, who recognized the marks and so hopes to conceal them with her magic.|$|E

25|$|Wanting {{to go back}} to his {{interesting}} life, Kyon activates {{the program}} and goes back in time to the Tanabata of three years ago. After meeting up with the future Mikuru, he obtains an uninstall program from the past's Yuki, which needs to be shot at the culprit right after the change in the early hours of December 18. Returning to the present, they find the culprit, Yuki, who had borrowed Haruhi's power to change everyone's memories except Kyon's, giving him the choice of which world he would rather live in. Kyon questions himself about his choice and thinks to himself that a normal world without the SOS Brigade and Haruhi Suzumiya would be calm and peaceful and thinks Yuki was tired of everything she had to do like monitoring Haruhi's behavior and protecting Kyon, but finally decides that his original world was more interesting and fun. Kyon tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who had retained her psychotic behavior. Before Ryoko can finish him off, he is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself. He wakes up a few days later in a hospital, where the world is back to normal, but almost everyone believes Kyon had been in a coma since December 18 after falling down the stairs. When Yuki mentions to Kyon how the Data Integration Thought Entity would punish her for her actions, Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>being</b> John Smith and have her alter reality so the organization would cease to exist. As December 24 comes and his everyday life returns, Kyon decides there is still time before he has to go back in time to save himself and decides to join in on the Christmas party.|$|E
500|$|President Ronald Reagan, {{a fan of}} the film, {{referred}} to the film in his 1986 State of the Union Address when he said, [...] "Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement. As they said in the film Back to the Future, 'Where we're going, we don't need roads'."

Later Diana Fowley and his doctor arrive, and with his mind-reading abilities, Mulder is able to tell Skinner that he knows <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>being</b> indebted to Krycek, and Diana Fowley's connections with the Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E

[...] "Gossip" [...] received generally positive reviews, with several commentators particularly praising the subplot in which Andy questions whether the rumor <b>about</b> <b>him</b> <b>being</b> gay might actually be true. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was watched by 8.21 million viewers.
