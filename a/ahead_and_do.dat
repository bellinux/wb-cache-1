In mid-1990, Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama hired Tom Kalinske as CEO of Sega of America. Kalinske developed a four-point plan for sales of the Genesis: cut the console's price, develop games for the American market with a new American team, continue aggressive advertising campaigns, and ship Sonic the Hedgehog with the Genesis as a pack-in game. The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan, but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, [...] "I hired you {{to make the decisions}} for Europe and the Americas, so go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it."

[...] Magazines praised Sonic {{as one of the greatest}} games yet made, and Sega's console finally took off as customers who had been waiting for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) decided to purchase a Genesis instead. However, the release of a CD-based add-on for the Genesis, the Sega CD (known as Mega-CD outside of North America), had been commercially disappointing.|$|E
500|$|Many rappers {{have taken}} note of Illmatics {{influence}} on their lyricism. Ghostface Killah recounted, “When I used to listen to Nas back in the days, it was like, ‘Oh shit! He murdered that.’ That forced me to get my pen game up... The whole Illmatic album forced you to go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> shit... It was inspiration." [...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's {{one of the reasons}} I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Luckily, {{his girlfriend}} said, [...] "He's {{absolutely}} right. There aren't enough interesting videos on MTV, and {{that sounds like}} a brilliant idea." [...] Mark didn't say anything but he didn't make the call {{to get me out of}} Budapest. We just went <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> it.|$|R
500|$|After {{completing}} the album, Sony hired Bojan Bazelli {{to direct the}} song's music video. After filming the video's first version, record label executives felt the result was sub-par {{in comparison to the}} quality of the music. They scrapped the first video and re-filmed it with director Andy Morahan, changing the plot, scenery and imagery. After word got out of the two videos, a Sony employee spoke to the press about Carey, saying how [...] "the special treatment really upset" [...] him. He felt they treated Carey differently from how they would another artist signed to the label, and that they viewed her as a higher priority. He also claimed that Carey was the reason they re-filmed, [...] "they spend $200,000 on a video and Mariah doesn't like it. No big deal." [...] Another employee estimated the figure of both videos at over $450,000. After the reports were made, Don Ienner, the president of Sony, refuted the claims, calling them [...] "total bullshit" [...] although admitting, [...] "If we're going to take the time and effort that we did with Mariah, on every level, then we're going to image her the right way. If it costs a few extra dollars to make a splash in terms of the right imaging, you go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-1990, Nakayama hired Tom Kalinske {{to replace}} Katz as CEO of Sega of America. [...] Although Kalinske {{initially}} {{knew little about}} the video game market, he surrounded himself with industry-savvy advisors. A believer in the razor and blades business model, he developed a four-point plan: cut {{the price of the}} console, create a U.S.-based team to develop games targeted at the American market, continue and expand the aggressive advertising campaigns, and replace the bundled game Altered Beast with a new title, Sonic the Hedgehog. The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan, but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, [...] "I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Magazines praised Sonic {{as one of the greatest}} games yet made, and Sega's console finally took off as customers who had been waiting for the release of the international version of Nintendo's Super Famicom— the Super Nintendo Entertainment System or SNES—decided to purchase a Genesis instead. [...] Nintendo's console debuted against an established competitor, while NEC's TurboGrafx-16 failed to gain traction, and NEC soon pulled out of the market. [...] In large part due to the popularity of Sonic the Hedgehog, the Sega Genesis outsold the SNES in the United States nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season. This success led to Sega having control of 65% of the 16-bit console market in January 1992, making it the first time Nintendo was not the console leader since December 1985.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Dees (and {{his record}} company) made a request of Marvin Fisher, {{the owner of}} the {{copyright}} in the music of the song [...] "When Sunny Gets Blue", for permission to use the song in a parody of the performance by Johnny Mathis. Fisher refused to grant permission for the use. Dees decided to go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> a parody even without the permission of the copyright holder, using about 29 seconds of the song in a parody album titled Put It Where the Moon Don't Shine.|$|E
50|$|Following the 2013 {{attack on}} the Yemeni Defense Ministry, which {{resulted}} in the killing of numerous doctors and patients at a hospital present in the compound, al-Rimi released a video message apologizing, claiming that the team of attackers were directed not to assault the hospital in the attack, but that one had gone <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>done</b> so.|$|R
50|$|The Navvie and Thug are {{the strongest}} and most {{expensive}} of the group. They have the highest health and most destructive specials but are slower than the other characters. The Navvie uses a bazooka, which fires straight <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>does</b> heavy damage; the Thug uses a shotgun, which is less powerful than the bazooka but fires many shots in a wide angle.|$|R
50|$|On being reunited in West Africa in 2003, du Toit {{informed}} Brabazon of {{his part}} in a plot to overthrow President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea.

However, Brabazon did not receive word from du Toit confirming that the coup attempt was going <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not board the plane.|$|R
2500|$|There was {{speculation}} that Gable's physically demanding role in The Misfits {{contributed to his}} sudden death soon after filming was completed. In an interview with Louella Parsons, published soon after Gable's death, Kay Gable said, [...] "It wasn't the physical exertion that killed him. It was the horrible tension, the eternal waiting, waiting, waiting. He waited around forever, for everybody. He'd get so angry that he'd just go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> anything to keep occupied." [...] Monroe said that she and Kay had become close during the filming and would refer to Clark as [...] "Our Man", while Arthur Miller, observing Gable on location, noted, [...] "no hint of affront ever showed on his face".|$|E

50|$|During a {{televised}} debate on March 5, 1998, MacLellan stumbled badly when Progressive Conservative Leader John Hamm {{asked if he}} would resign if he failed to bring in a balanced budget. Instead of responding, MacLellan stared straight <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not speak for seven seconds. MacLellan blamed the pause on rigid debate rules. This moment marked a turning point in a race that saw the Liberals barely retain power.|$|R
50|$|After {{footage of}} the attack was aired on Yemeni television, showing {{an attack on a}} {{hospital}} within the ministry compound and the killing of medical personal and patients, the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released a video message apologizing.

50|$|Joe Dante {{says the}} {{financing}} of the movie was difficult.Matinee got made through a fluke. The company that was paying for us {{went out of business}} and didn't have any money. Universal, which was the distributor, had put in a little money, and we went to them and begged them to buy into the whole movie, and to their everlasting sorrow they went <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> it.

2500|$|In the {{documentary}} Last of the Gladiators, Knievel discussed {{the crash of}} a 1970 Pepsi-Cola sponsored jump in Yakima, Washington. Knievel knew the jump was very questionable, but stated, [...] "I went <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> it anyway. When you give your word to somebody that you're going to do something, you've gotta do it." [...] In the 1971 biopic, George Hamilton (as Evel) emphasizes in the opening monologue that a man does not go back on his word.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the video, Curiel stated, [...] "The {{funny thing}} is, people take us really seriously. We are a serious band, {{but we know}} that, at times, we don't have to take {{ourselves}} so seriously. We have fun. That's why we went <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> a video like 'Boom.' We wanted to show people {{that we could have}} fun. They have a movie out now called Balls of Fury, but we did that same topic back in the day." ...|$|R
