30|$|This work aims at {{improving}} {{our understanding of}} the effect of triaxial stress on <b>absolute</b> <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> homogeneous and heterogeneous rocks. Measurements <b>of</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>permeabilities</b> <b>of</b> homogenous and heterogeneous laminated rock samples under hydrostatic and different laboratory-simulated triaxial in situ stress loadings were prepared. Experiments were conducted using homogenous, standard Berea and heterogeneous laminated sandstone cores (with lamination parallel to the flow direction). The effect of in situ stress variation on <b>absolute</b> <b>permeability</b> was investigated. <b>Absolute</b> <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> homogenous sandstones sample decreased in a uniform manner as the axial load increased below the ultimate shear strength. As axial stress exceeds the radial confining stress, slight increase attributed to microcracks opening was noticed. For laminated sandstones, the scenario is quite different. Permeability shows exactly a similar trend <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> drop as axial load increases due to inferred matrix compaction. At certain axial load, the permeability starts to increase due to inferred dilatancy of microcracks at the lamina faces and then drops again as axial load increases due to lamina compaction. If the axial load is further increased, pore collapses and grain-to-grain cementing breaks down into pore space followed by microcracks development predominantly parallel to the axial load leading to permeability enhancement. It has been concluded that <b>absolute</b> <b>permeability</b> changes due to lamination opening and closure as a result of loading magnitude and orientation. It is also concluded that <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> the formation rock is affected by heterogeneity depending on the direction of lamination as well as the state of the stresses applied and loading type.|$|R

The porosities and <b>absolute</b> <b>permeabilities</b> <b>of</b> the core plugs from depths of (2900 – 3100) meters were {{in the range of}} 17.62 – 18.62 % and 2 – 3 md, respectively, whereas for the shallower depth (2500 – 2700  m) core plugs, the respective values <b>of</b> porosities and <b>absolute</b> <b>permeabilities</b> were in the range of 24.64 – 25.15 % and 25 – 30 md respectively. An inverse correlation was observed between porosity–permeability and depth for the porous media under study.

30|$|Many {{studies to}} {{investigate}} the effect of in situ stresses on <b>absolute</b> <b>permeability</b> at hydrostatic as well as triaxial stress state have been discussed in the literature (Fatt and davis 1952; Mc Latchie et al. 1958; Knutson and Bohor 1962; Al-Quraishi and Colin 2003; Belhaj et al. 2004; Dobrynin 1962; Gray et al. 1963; Holt 1990; Jones et al. 2001; Keaney et al. 1998; Lockner et al. 1995; Morita et al. 1984; Putra et al. 2003; Teufel et al. 1993; Wilhelmi and Somerton 1967).

These reservoirs could potentially serve as media for the storage of commercial accumulation of hydrocarbon. However, production and ultimate recovery are usually uneconomical due to a number of factors which include: poor reservoir quality, unfavourable initial saturation condition, formation damage caused by drilling and completion operations, hydraulic or acid fracturing, kill or work-over treatments and other production-related problems (Bahrami et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|To {{study and}} compare the effect of {{triaxial}} stress conditions on <b>absolute</b> <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> homogenous and heterogeneous laminated samples, two laminated samples (B and D) and one homogenous sample (Berea) were used. The saturated samples were stressed hydrostatically at 580 psi, and permeability was measured at that stress state. Confining stress was increased to 4000 psi and axial stress was kept at 580 psi and permeability was measured at that triaxial stress state. Axial stress was ramped up in increments up to 5740 psi, and permeability was measured at each triaxial stress condition.|$|R

In order to use the MD simulation results on interaction forces between H 2 O and Si consistently, we assumed that the rock grain is made of Si (in our on-going research, we use the more realistic assumption that the rock grains are composed of quartz (SiO 2) and other minerals).|$|R

These studies determined the effect of gel on the <b>absolute</b> <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> the sand pack, and the water shutoff efficiency was determined using the same procedure as followed by several researchers working in this area (Jia et al. 2011; Salehi et al. 2014; You et al. 2015).|$|R

30|$|Therefore, the {{influence}} of temperature increase on the permeability causes a partial change in the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the fluid.

Moreover, by increasing the temperature the amount of optimum rate would increase. According to the Wang et al. investigations, at 50  °C the optimum acid rate is 60  ml/h. And at the 75  °C the optimum rate is 210  ml/h. Thereby, soaring temperature leads to the small volume of acid injection to achieve breakthrough (Wang et al. 1993).|$|R

40|$|Sand {{production}} {{problems are}} encountered {{throughout the world}} and recently detected in Saudi Arabian oil fields. Maximum reliability and productivity are particularly essential offshore and in remote locations. These objectives are difficult to attain where formation sands are unconsolidated or subjected to failure. Sand production mechanism is exceedingly complex, and it is influenced by every completion operation from first bit penetration to start of production or injection. Sand control by consolidation involves the process of injecting chemicals into the naturally unconsolidated formation to provide an in-situ grain-to-grain cementation. Techniques for accomplishing this successfully {{are perhaps the most}} sophisticated undertaken in completion work. Many methods have been suggested to consolidate the wall of the wellbore for few inches or feet deep around the borehole. These methods are either expensive or temporarily. The aim of this work is to find out a byproduct from the Saudi industry able to consolidate friable sand formations. Byproducts used in this work are Steel Making Slag (SMS) and Blast Furnace Slag (BFS) obtained from Hadid steel plant in Jubail. This slag is mixed with chemicals as activators and with sand and cured at 95 ° C for 24 hours. The compressive strength and the <b>absolute</b> <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> the consolidated sand have been evaluated. Also, the effect of aging in kerosene as a representative to crude oil and water to show the effect of produced fluids on the consolidated sand has been investigated.
