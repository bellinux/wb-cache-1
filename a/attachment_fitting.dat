30|$|Comparing {{the steel}} {{guardrail}} and the steel guard pipe, the GHG emissions {{of the steel}} guard pipe were 127  % of the GHG emissions of the steel guardrail, which was significantly higher. There are two likely reasons for this. First, the guard pipe has a narrower support post spacing (3  m), and therefore uses {{a larger number of}} support posts with an attendant increase in the emissions associated with the raw material procurement and production of support posts, as well as their construction. Second, the guard pipe is installed in three tiers of beams, which increases the number of <b>attachment</b> <b>fittings.</b> While the GHG emissions from raw material procurement and production of <b>attachment</b> <b>fittings</b> for the steel guardrail were 1.36  kg-CO 2 -eq/m, the equivalent emissions for the steel guard pipe were 6.00  kg-CO 2 -eq/m.|$|R

The <b>attachment</b> <b>fittings</b> connecting the flap to the aircraft wing rear spar were instrumented with strain gages and calibrated using known loads for measuring hinge moment and normal force loads in flight.

The 2 -sigma residual errors for the hinge moment was calculated to be 2. 4 percent, and for normal force was calculated to be 7. 3 percent. The hinge moment and normal force generated by the ACTE flap with a hinge point located at 26 -percent wing chord were measured during steady state and symmetric pitch maneuvers. The loads predicted from analysis were compared to the loads observed in flight. The hinge moment loads showed good agreement with the flight loads while the normal force loads calculated from analysis were over-predicted by approximately 20 percent.

50|$|The Boeing 707 320/420 series had an {{enlarged}} horizontal stabiliser (tailplane) assembly compared to earlier 707 aircraft, {{and in the}} redesign the increased loads on the tailplane structure had been taken by replacing some of the aluminium skinning with stainless steel. In addition, the spar <b>attachment</b> <b>fittings</b> had been redesigned, making them both stronger and stiffer. This had the unforeseen effect of changing the way the tailplane structure handled gust loads, the stiffer fittings being {{no longer able to}} help in absorbing and transferring the stresses caused by gusts and other normal aerodynamic loads, the flexure (i.e., the bending loads) of the left and right horizontal stabilizers instead having to be carried by the stabiliser spars entirely by themselves. This led over time to fatigue cracking in the right horizontal stabiliser's rear spar, which, due to the concealed (internal) nature of the tailplane construction, was not noticed by maintenance engineers.|$|R

40|$|Payloads are secured in {{the orbiter}} payload bay by the payload {{retention}} system or {{are equipped with}} their own unique retention systems. The orbiter payload retention mechanisms provide structural attachments for each payload by using four or five attachment points to secure the payload within the orbiter payload bay during all phases of the orbiter mission.

40|$|FAST is {{a project}} {{management}} tool designed to optimize the assembly sequence of Space Station Freedom. An appropriate assembly sequence coordinates engineering, design, utilization, transportation availability, and operations requirements. Since complex designs tend to change frequently, FAST assesses the system level effects of detailed changes and produces output metrics that identify preferred assembly sequences. FAST incorporates Space Shuttle integration, Space Station hardware, on-orbit operations, and programmatic drivers as either precedence relations or numerical data. Hardware sequencing information can either be input directly and evaluated via the "specified" mode of operation or evaluated from the input precedence relations in the "flexible" mode. In the specified mode, FAST takes as its input {{a list of the}} cargo elements assigned to each flight. The program determines positions for the cargo elements that maximize the center of gravity (c. g.) margin. These positions are restricted by the geometry of the cargo elements and the location of <b>attachment</b> <b>fittings</b> both in the orbiter and on the cargo elements. FAST calculates every permutation of cargo element location according to its height, trunnion fitting locations, and required intercargo element spacing. Each cargo element is tested in both its normal and reversed orientation (rotated 180 degrees). The best solution is that which maximizes the c. g. margin for each flight. In the flexible mode, FAST begins with the first flight and determines all feasible combinations of cargo elements according to mass, volume, EVA, and precedence relation constraints. The program generates an assembly sequence that meets mass, volume, position, EVA, and precedence constraints while minimizing the total number of Shuttle flights required. Issues associated with ground operations, spacecraft performance, logistics requirements and user requirements will be addressed in future versions of the model. FAST is written in C-Language and has been implemented on DEC VAX series computers running VMS. The program is distributed in executable form. The source code is also provided, but it cannot be compiled without the Tree Manipulation Based Routines (TMBR) package from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is not currently available from COSMIC. The main memory requirement is based on the data used to drive the FAST program. All applications should easily run on an installation with 10 Mb of main memory.

Analysis results from the LaRC team indicated that the most-likely failure scenario was failure initiation at the right rear main <b>attachment</b> <b>fitting</b> (lug), followed by an unstable progression of failure of all fin-to-fuselage attachments and separation of the VTP from the aircraft. Additionally, analysis results indicated that failure initiates at the final observed maximum fin loading condition in the accident, when the VTP was subjected to loads that were at minimum 1. 92 times the design limit load condition for certification. For certification, the VTP is only required to support loads of 1. 5 times design limit load without catastrophic failure.
