5|$|S.S.C. Napoli was {{expelled}} from the professional league in 2004. Thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., the sports title was transferred to Napoli Soccer (later the new Napoli) in the same year, while the old Napoli was liquidated. On the eve of bankruptcy, the club was in deep financial trouble to achieve positive operating income (excluding windfall profit from players trading). At that time the club was using cash plus player swap to boost short term profit (€28,329,090 in 2000–01; €17,721,534 in 2001–02 season), but also increased the long term cost (as <b>amortization)</b> by purchasing players. In the second last season before bankruptcy, the club was partially saved by the non-standard accounting practice of <b>amortization.</b> {{it was due to}} Silvio Berlusconi, owner of Milan and prime minister of Italy, introducing Italian Law 91/1981, Article 18B. Napoli dramatically reduced the <b>amortization</b> from €33,437,075 to €1,659,088 + €4,660,123, due to €46,601,225 of the intangible asset (player contracts), which was deferred to amortize in 10-year installments, instead of varying from 1 to 5 years by the length of player contract. However, the practice was unable to save the club from the financial aid from a sugar daddy, when the owner withdrew.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the Glazers were to pay off the remaining £220million contained within the PIK loans by 22 November 2010. The loans were by then accruing interest at a rate of 16.25%, as the club's overall debt had exceeded its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and <b>amortization</b> (EBITDA) by more than five times. However, the club claimed that none of its own money had been put towards the repayment, raising questions as to how the Glazer family had raised the funds; suggested methods include the sale of a minority stake in the club to a third party, the sale of {{some or all of the}} family's other businesses, and – the most likely option – the refinancing of the PIKs with another loan at a lower interest rate.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in its five-year operation, the Company {{reported}} a net income of NT$5.78 billion, with earnings per share of NT$0.59. Between 2010 and 2011, revenues increased by 16.65% from NT$27.64 billion to NT$32.24 billion, with operating costs and expenses (excluding depreciation and <b>amortization)</b> rising by only 4.98%. Over the same period of time, gross profit totaled NT$12.98 billion (an increase of 30.32%), income from operations totaled NT$12.06 billion (an increase of 32.93%) and EBITDA totaled NT$22.73 billion (an increase of 22.34%). 2011 gross profit, income from operation and EBITDA were all record highs. Since commencing operations in 2007, THSRC has had a significant influence on Taiwan’s economy and on the lives of its people. In 2011, the Company continued to pursue sustainable growth aligned with the interests of shareholders and society, achieving record profits even amid a challenging economic environment.|$|E

50|$|On October 21, 1972, Presidential Decree No. 27, {{signed by}} President Ferdinand Marcos, emancipated all tenant farmers working on private {{agricultural}} lands devoted to rice and corn, whether {{working on a}} landed estate or not. The system was implemented through a system of sharecropping or lease-tenancy. LANDBANK was tasked to collect 15-year land <b>amortizations</b> from beneficiaries {{at the cost of}} the value of the land plus six percent interest per annum.|$|R
50|$|In 1974 the company's {{management}} {{issued an}} anticipated {{warning about the}} serious state of the company, and the Managing Director Bengt Eneroth resigned after being with the company for 33 years. He had consciously held back new investments in buildings and equipment but the company was still hit. The unfavorable refinancing in foreign currencies created huge losses, as for the other wharfs, by the major problem were the customers, the shipping companies, canceling contracts and <b>amortizations.</b>|$|R
25|$|Prepayment/reinvestment/early amortization: The {{majority}} of revolving ABS {{are subject to}} some degree of early <b>amortization</b> risk. The risk stems from specific early <b>amortization</b> events or payout events that cause the security to be paid off prematurely. Typically, payout events include insufficient payments from the underlying borrowers, insufficient excess spread, {{a rise in the}} default rate on the underlying loans above a specified level, a decrease in credit enhancements below a specific level, and bankruptcy {{on the part of the}} sponsor or servicer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a loan with no fees, the <b>amortization</b> {{schedule}} would be worked out by taking the principal left {{at the end of each}} month, multiplying by the monthly rate and then subtracting the monthly payment.|$|E
25|$|ARMs {{that allow}} {{negative}} <b>amortization</b> will typically have payment adjustments that occur less frequently than {{the interest rate}} adjustment. For example, the interest rate may be adjusted every month, but the payment amount only once every 12 months.|$|E
50|$|April 28, 1767. Bishop Miguel Lino de Espeleta (1759-1771) sends {{a letter}} to the King of Spain informing him of the need for 90,000 pesos to build the cathedral. The bishop also reminds the king of a promise made by his predecessors, {{apparently}} referring to the stalled <b>amortizations</b> on payments accrued from the income of the encomienda.

25|$|Any loan that {{is allowed}} to {{generate}} negative <b>amortization</b> means that the borrower is reducing his equity in his home, which increases the chance that he won't {{be able to sell}} it for enough to repay the loan. Declining property values would exacerbate this risk.|$|E
25|$|Option ARMs {{are best}} suited to {{sophisticated}} borrowers with growing incomes, particularly if their incomes fluctuate seasonally and they need the payment flexibility that such an ARM may provide.

40|$|What {{level of}} {{indebtedness}} jeopardizes economic stability? We show that the ratio of financial obligations (interest payments and <b>amortizations)</b> to income is crucial for capturing debt sustainability. Estimating a regime-switching model on aggregate US data, we find that credit losses become highly sensitive to ad-verse shocks when household or business sector financial obligations ratios exceed threshold values of 10 %. This occurs 1 - 2 years prior to each economic downturn in our sample, 1985 Q 1 - 2010 Q 2, indicating that excessive debt has {{a significant effect on}} the business cycle. Our results have implications for macroprudential policy and the design of countercyclical capital buffers for banks...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} payroll debit loans - a Brazilian new modality of credit - on interest rates. The main characteristic of the new credit operation is the enforcement of a direct deduction of <b>amortizations</b> from personal payroll checks. Adapting a matching strategy proposed by Heckman, LaLonde and Smith (1999), and using a data sample that considers individuals that take out bank loans both with and without payroll deductions, {{we find that the}} new modality reduces loan interest rates significantly. Nevertheless, this reduction is half of what was expected using aggregate data. The paper also presents a sensitivity analysis for the case of sequential banking. ...|$|R

Among the analyzed companies, the one with better results in the CSR accomplishment was also the company with a stronger financial sustainability, that is, that had greater reductions in its financial cost and higher improvements in its EBITDA. Therefore, is accepted the hypothesis that states that the companies engaged with the CSR keep or improve their financial sustainability...|$|R

25|$|Negative <b>amortization.</b> This {{means the}} {{mortgage}} balance is increasing. This occurs whenever the monthly mortgage payments are not {{large enough to}} pay all the interest due on the mortgage. This may be caused when the payment cap contained in the ARM is low enough such that the principal plus interest payment {{is greater than the}} payment cap.|$|E
25|$|The AMA Foundation {{provides}} approximately $1,000,000 {{annually in}} tuition assistance to financially needy students. This {{has to be}} seen on the background that in 2007, graduating medical students carried a mean debt load of $140,000 which rose to $220,000 after four years of negative <b>amortization</b> during residency medical student debt has increased by 7% each successive year. By the time debt is paid off, it is sometimes almost half a million dollars.|$|E
5000|$|Since land {{contracts}} {{can easily}} be written or modified by any seller or buyer; one may come across any variety of repayment plans. Interest only, negative <b>amortizations,</b> short balloons, extremely long <b>amortizations</b> {{just to name a}} few. It is not uncommon for land contracts to go unrecorded. For several reasons, the buyer or seller may decide that the contract is not to be recorded in the register of deeds. This does not make the contract invalid, but it does increase exposure to undesirable side effects. Some states, such as Minnesota, issue contracts without an acceleration clause, which {{in the case of a}} default leaves the seller in a position to either cancel the contract, discharging any principal deficiency, as in the case of deprecation, or to litigate for 18 months or more while letting the buyer, if not a corporation, retain their rights to the property while collection attempts are made, by which time the buyer will often qualify for bankruptcy, making the contract, when lacking said acceleration clause, effectively an installment option, when the buyer has no other lienable assets. In bankruptcy, some regions will interpret it as an executory contract that can be rejected, while others will treat it as a debt to be paid out of the bankruptcy trust. This and a wide variety of other legal ambiguities has led to a trend toward eliminating the use of Land Contracts to remove any incentives, and as a result, the disadvantages that these contracts have compared to the standard note and mortgage, which are more clearly defined in, and regulated by, law.|$|R
5000|$|The Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (Filipino: [...] "Farmworkers Movement of the Philippines"), {{a militant}} farmers' {{group led by}} Jaime Tadeo, demanded genuine agrarian reform from the Aquino government. On January 15, 1987, members of the Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas encamped at the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (now the Department of Agrarian Reform) in Diliman, Quezon City.The group {{presented}} their problems and demands: give land for free to farmers, end the retention of lands by landlords, and stop the <b>amortizations</b> of land payments. Dialogue between the farmers, represented by Jaime Tadeo, and the government, represented by Agrarian Reform Minister Heherson Alvarez, took place on January 20, 1987. Alvarez promised to bring the matter to the President's attention during the next day's cabinet meeting.|$|R
50|$|During this period, the {{government}} started negotiations to restructure interest payments and <b>amortizations</b> {{of the foreign}} debt, which in 1985 was 36 billion dollars (of which 28 billion was from the public sector), contracted with the international private banking and multilateral agencies. The first positive result of this effort was that Venezuela regained a credit-eligibility rating. In addition, Lusinchi took initiatives to increase oil prices via OPEC.However, Lusinchi was not successful at crucial goals {{for the development of}} the country. The oil market was too unstable due to price fluctuations and thus unpredictable, the oil prices were low, and the Venezuelan economy was too oil-dependent. This led to a dismal situation due to an excessively high government fiscal budget, depleting financial reserves for the payment of debt, an important pledge made during Lusinchi's presidential campaign.|$|R
25|$|The initial {{investment}} {{was to create}} approximately 100,000 jobs. The stated reason for the decision is a $21.3 billion deficit in the 2010 provincial operating budget. Standard economic metrics, however, show that as stimulus, Transit City adds significantly to provincial tax revenues, and given the province's 50-year <b>amortization,</b> the plan overall reduces Ontario's annual budget deficit. This caused widespread debate, protests and criticism of premier Dalton McGuinty by politicians and local groups. As {{a result of the}} postponement, the plan has since been scaled down and expected completion dates have been further pushed back.|$|E
25|$|A {{cash flow}} ARM is a minimum payment option {{mortgage}} loan. This {{type of loan}} allows a borrower to choose their monthly payment from several options. These payment options usually include the option to pay at the 30-year level, 15-year level, interest only level, and a minimum payment level. The minimum payment level is usually lower than the interest only payment. This type of loan can result in negative <b>amortization.</b> The option to make a minimum payment is usually available only for the first several years of the loan.|$|E

40|$|In 2005, {{a system}} of {{mortgage}} interest, insurance premiums and capital deduction (MICPD) was introduced in Belgium to replace and simplify the previous system of fiscal housing benefits. Mortgage interest, capital <b>amortizations</b> and insurance premiums were assembled into one single deduction package. We use household-level data from 2001 to 2010 to evaluate {{the impact of the}} MICPD on the homeownership rate in Belgium. A difference-in-differences approach is introduced to compare the proportion of new homeowners between two groups: a treatment group, which is affected by the MICPD and a control group which is not.

25|$|Economist Paul McCulley {{described}} how Minsky's hypothesis translates to the subprime mortgage crisis. McCulley illustrated {{the three types}} of borrowing categories using an analogy from the mortgage market: a hedge borrower would have a traditional mortgage loan and is paying back both the principal and interest; the speculative borrower would have an interest-only loan, meaning they are paying back only the interest and must refinance later to pay back the principal; and the ponzi borrower would have a negative <b>amortization</b> loan, meaning the payments do not cover the interest amount and the principal is actually increasing. Lenders only provided funds to ponzi borrowers due to a belief that housing values would continue to increase.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} common indices are the rates on 1-year constant-maturity Treasury (CMT) securities, the cost of funds index (COFI), and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). A few lenders use their own cost of funds as an index, rather than using other indices. This is done to ensure a steady margin for the lender, whose own cost of funding will usually {{be related to the}} index. Consequently, {{payments}} made by the borrower may change over time with the changing interest rate (alternatively, the term of the loan may change). This is distinct from the graduated payment mortgage, which offers changing payment amounts but a fixed interest rate. Other forms of mortgage loan include the interest-only mortgage, the fixed-rate mortgage, the negative <b>amortization</b> mortgage, and the balloon payment mortgage.|$|E
40|$|The 1974 {{passage of}} ERISA halted the {{evolution}} of the actuarial pension model. This frozen model was unable to incorporate the emerging science of financial economics, which in turn revealed fundamental flaws in the model. Contrary to the teachings of financial economics, the actuarial pension model anticipates expected outcomes without reflecting the price of risk. It then camouflages the risky distribution of outcomes by various smoothings and <b>amortizations.</b> The flawed pension model has caused widespread, though rarely recognized, damage to pension plan stakeholders. This paper illustrates the flaws and the injuries they cause. To protect the pension system and the vitality of our profession, we urge pension actuaries to reexamine and redesign the model. The new model must incorporate the market value paradigm and reporting transparency that is rapidly becoming a worldwide minimum standard in finance...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is {{estimation}} of significance of financial crisis on investment fund management companies' activity on Polish financial market during two years – from July 2007 to June 2009. The most important aspect of this impact was decline of investment funds' net asset value (from 139, 0 billion PLN to 77, 2 billion PLN). It was due to decreasing value of securities in funds' investment portfolios and negative balance of payments and <b>amortizations</b> (investors withdrew from funds 25, 4 billion PLN more than they paid in). Declining value of net assets value caused decrease of value of investment fund management companies' management fees and decreasing payments were a reason of falling distribution fees.
