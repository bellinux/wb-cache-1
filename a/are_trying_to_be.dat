60|$|It <b>is</b> {{necessary}} <b>to</b> {{make this}} first point clear: that in Great Expectations Dickens <b>was</b> really <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a quiet, a detached, {{and even a}} cynical observer of human life. Dickens <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Thackeray. And the final and startling triumph of Dickens is this: that even to this moderate and modern story, he gives an incomparable energy which is not moderate and which is not modern. He <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reasonable; {{but in spite of}} himself he <b>is</b> inspired. He <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detailed, but in spite of himself he <b>is</b> gigantic. Compared <b>to</b> the rest of Dickens this is Thackeray; but compared to the whole of Thackeray we can only say in supreme praise of it that it is Dickens.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{nurses in}} Japan <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> advocates. They are {{promoting}} better nursing {{education as well}} as promoting {{the care of the}} elderly. There are some organizations that unite Japanese nurses like the Japanese Nursing Association (JNA). The JNA is {{not to be confused with}} a union, it is simply a professional organization for the nurses. Members of the JNA lobby politicians and produces publications about nursing. According to the American Nurses Association's article on Japan the JNA, [...] "works toward the improvement in nursing practice through many activities including the development of a policy research group to influence policy development, a code of ethics for nurses, and standards of nursing practice". The JNA also provides certification for specialists in mental health, oncology and community health. The [...] JNA is not the only nursing organization in Japan. There are other subgroups that are typically categorized by the nurses' specialty, like emergency nursing or disaster nursing. One of the older unions that relates to nursing is the Japanese Federation of Medical Workers Union, which was created in 1957. It is a union that includes physicians as well as nurses. This organization was involved with the Nursing Human Resource Law.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015 Elliott, {{along with}} two [...] collaborators, Don Sebesky and Christofer Austin, won a Tony Award for his {{orchestration}} in the Broadway musical, An American in Paris. The production attracted attention because its direction and choreography were done by a ballet choreographer with no previous experience directing musicals. The production had already been performed in Paris for four months when Elliott was hired to adapt the music to better suit Broadway. [...] "I {{was brought in to}} re-do some of the songs in a more theatrical way," [...] Elliott said. In this process, the directors carefully study the audience responses during preview shows, then fine-tune the show based on what the director feels the audience responds to. Changes in a dance routine require the music for that dance to be re-written. Elliott used his same routine here that he used with film — [...] studying videos of the action. He worked on nearly half of the [...] music in the final show. He said, [...] "It is more than just taking notes and assigning them to a instrument, but rather bringing emotions to life that <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there. He said, [...] "I felt like I was hired to put the 'American' in An American in Paris." ...|$|E

She found it more convenient to talk at first as though the strands of decision were still all in her hands; afterwards she could {{go on to the}} peculiar complication of the situation through the unexpected weakening of her position in relation to Mrs. Pembrose. She described the particular of the new trouble, the perplexing issue between the [...] "lady-like," [...] for which as a feminine ideal there was so much to be said {{on the one hand and}} the [...] "genial," [...] which was also an admirable quality, on the other. [...] "You see," [...] she said, [...] "it's very rude to cough at people and make noises, but then it's so difficult to explain to the others that it's equally rude to go past people and pretend not to see or hear them. Girls of that sort always seem so much more underbred when they <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> superior than when they are not; they get so stiff and--exasperating. And this keeping out of the Union because it isn't genteel, it's the very essence of the trouble with all these employees. We've discussed that so often. Those drapers' girls seem full of such cold, selfish, base, pretentious notions; much more full even than our refreshment girls. And then as if it wasn't all difficult enough comes Mrs. Pembrose and her wardresses doing all sorts of hard, clumsy things, and one can't tell them just how little they are qualified to judge good behaviour. Their one idea of discipline is to speak to people as if they were servants and to be distant and crushing. And long before one can do anything come trouble and tart replies and reports of [...] "gross impertinence" [...] and expulsion. We keep on expelling girls. This is the fourth time girls have had to go. What is to become of them? I know this Burnet girl quite well as you know. She's just a human, kindly little woman.... She'll feel disgraced.... How can I let a thing like that occur?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'But I do sin,' you say, 'again and again, {{and that}} is what makes me fearful. I try to do better, but I fall and I fail all day long. I try not to be covetous and worldly, but poverty tempts me, and I fall; I try to keep my temper, but people upset me, and I say things of which I am bitterly ashamed the next minute. Can God love such a one as me?' My answer is, If God loved the whole world when it was dead in trespasses and sins, and NOT trying to be better, much more will he love you who are not dead in trespasses and sins, and <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better. If he were not still helping you; if his Spirit were not with you, you would care no more to become better than a dog or an ox cares. And if you fall--why, arise again. Get up, and go on. You may be sorely bruised, and soiled with your fall, but is that any reason for lying still, and giving up the {{struggle}} cowardly? In the name of Jesus Christ, arise and walk. He will wash you, and you shall be clean. He will heal you, and you shall be strong again. What else can a traveller expect who is going over rough ground in the dark, but to fall and bruise himself, and to miss his way too many a time: but is that any reason for his sitting {{down in the middle of}} the moor, and saying, 'I shall never get to my journey's end?' What else can a soldier expect, but wounds, and defeat, too, often; but is that any reason for his running away, and crying, 'We shall never take the place?' If our brave men at Sebastopol had done so, and lost heart each time they were beaten back, not only would they have never taken the place, but the Russians would have driven them long ago into the sea, and perhaps not a man of them would have escaped. And, be sure of it, your battle is like theirs. Every one of us has to fight for the everlasting life of his soul against all the devils of hell, and there is no use in running away from them; they will come after us stronger than ever, unless we go to face them. As with our men at Sebastopol, unless we beat the enemy, the enemy will destroy us; and our only hope is to fight to-day's battle like men, in the strength which God gives us, and trust him to give us strength to fight to-morrow's battle too, when it comes. For here again, as it was at Sebastopol, so it is with our souls. Let our men be as prudent as they might, they never knew what to-morrow's battle would be like, or where the enemy might come upon them; and no more do we. They in general could not see the very enemy who was close on them; and no more can we see our enemy, near to us though he is. To- morrow's temptations may be quite different from to-day's. To-day we may be tempted to be dishonest, to-morrow to lose our tempers, the day afterwards to be vain and conceited, and a hundred other things. Let the morrow be anxious about the things of itself, then; and face to-day's enemy, and do the duty which lies nearest you. Our brave men did so. They kept themselves watchful, and took all the precautions they could in a general way, just as we ought to do each in his own habits and temper; but the great business was, to go steadily on at their work, and do each day what they could do, instead of giving way to vain fears and fancies about what they might have to do some day, which would have only put them out of heart, and confused and distracted them. And so it came to pass, that as their day so their strength was; that each day they got forward somewhat, and had strength and courage left besides to drive back each new assault as it came; and so at last, after many mistakes and many failures, through sickness and weakness, thirst and hunger, and every misery except fear which can fall on man, they conquered suddenly, and beyond their highest hopes:- as every one will conquer suddenly, and beyond his highest hope, who fights on manfully under Christ's banner against sin; against the sin in himself, and in his neighbours, and in his parish, and faces the devil and his works wheresoever he may meet them, sure that the devil and his works must be conquered at the last, because God's wrath is gone out against them, and Christ, who executes God's wrath, will never sheath his sword till he has put all enemies under his feet, and death be swallowed up in victory.|$|E
