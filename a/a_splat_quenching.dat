X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopic studies revealed the amorphous {{nature of the}} as-quenched samples. The glassy nature of these samples was confirmed by differential thermal analysis. Physical properties such as density, dielectric and ac conductivity have been studied. Glasses of L(i) 2 B(4) O(7) exhibit a dielectric anomaly close to the crystallization temperature which is attributed to the interfacial polarization caused by Li+ ion motion within the berate network...|$|E
25|$|To make {{glass from}} {{materials}} with poor glass forming tendencies, novel techniques {{are used to}} increase cooling rate, or reduce crystal nucleation triggers. Examples of these techniques include aerodynamic levitation (cooling the melt whilst it floats on <b>a</b> gas stream), <b>splat</b> <b>quenching</b> (pressing the melt between two metal anvils) and roller quenching (pouring the melt through rollers).|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> more {{efficient}} <b>splat</b> <b>quenching</b> technique is Duwez's and Willen's gun technique. Their technique produces {{higher rates of}} cooling of the droplet of metal because the sample is propelled at high velocities and hits a quencher plate causing its surface area to increase which immediately solidifies the metal.

40|$|Fabrication of a {{preliminary}} continuous Sigma 1140 + SiC fibre reinforced MoSi 2 composite monotape by plasma spraying onto a ring shaped substrate {{has been successfully}} demonstrated without any SiC breakage. The MoSi 2 matrix microstructure was typical of <b>a</b> <b>splat</b> <b>quenched</b> plasma spray processed material with porosity < 5 %. Matrix cracking occurred between fibres and was attributed primarily to differences in the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of MoSi 2, SiC and the steel substrate. Evidence for the formation of SiC by interfacial reaction between the fibre C coating and the MoSi 2 matrix has been observed, although this reaction was not uniform at all points on the interface. SIC formation has been suggested to affect the bonding between the fibre and the matrix and the subsequent mechanical properties of consolidated material. Pest oxidation bf the MoSi 2 matrix has been used to extract the SiC fibres after plasma spraying to assess the effect of process induced damage on the fiber properties in the matrix. However, the extraction process itself caused some changes to fibre properties which made analysis problematical. The similar to 3. 1 GPa as-supplied mean tensile fibre strength was retained during plasma spraying, but the Weibull modulus reduced from 25 to 11, i. e. the spread of fibre strengths increased. Mean bend strain and Weibull modulus were reduced from 1. 78 to 1. 57 and from 25 to 10 respectively. The fibre surface integrity was affected by both oxidation effects during extraction and by the impact of MoSi 2 droplets during spraying. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|A typical {{technique}} for <b>splat</b> <b>quenching</b> involves casting molten metal by pouring it between two massive, cooled copper rollers that are constantly chilled by {{the circulation of}} water.

The cast alloy decomposed into both dendrites and interdendrites. A detailed local compositional analysis carried out by atom probe within the dendrites revealed that the alloying elements in the Ni Al rich plates and Cr Fe rich interplates are not randomly distributed, but segregate and form areas with pronounced compositional fluctuations.

40|$|Abstract. The {{martensitic}} transformation was {{studied in}} CuAlMn and CuAlNi alloys transforming at elevated tenlperatures i. e. 70 - 250 "C. All alloys possessed mixed 18 R and 2 H structure of martensite. <b>Splat</b> <b>quenching</b> caused <b>a</b> direct {{formation of martensite}} and a considerable decrease of the grain size from about 100 pm in the bulk (in spite of TiB additions) down to about 2 pm. The lnartensite was less prone to stabilization as in bulk water quenched alloys. The DO, domains size was not altered in ribbons due to insufficient cooling in the solid state after casting. Their size was considerably lowered in ribbons cooled directly in water after casting. Martensitic transformation temperatures were shifted to lower temperatures by 20 - 50 "C, but the transformation hysteresis was 10 - 20 "C broader in all alloys investigated. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) in-situ heatinglcooling experiments allowed one to follow the nucleation of lnartensite in <b>splat</b> <b>quenched</b> ribbons due to their fine grain size. It appeared that martensite needles nucleated at the grain boundaries. Growing needles, approaching grain boundaries induce formation of other plates at adjacent grains. 1...|$|R

One claim against such a model is that if chemical bonds are important, the nearly free electron models should not be applicable. However, if the model includes the buildup of a charge distribution between all pairs of atoms just like a chemical bond (e.g., silicon, when a band is just filled with electrons) then it should apply to solids.|$|R
