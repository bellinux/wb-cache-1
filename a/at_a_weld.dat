40|$|Creep is {{the primary}} life {{limiting}} mechanism of static high temperature, high pressure power station components. Creep state evaluation is currently achieved by surface inspection of microstructure during infrequent outages; a methodology which is laborious, time consuming and considered inadequate. The objective of this work {{is to develop a}} monitoring technique that is capable of on-load creep damage monitoring. A continuous update of component integrity will enable better informed, targeted inspections and outage maintenance providing increased power generation availability. A low-frequency, permanently installed potential drop system has been previously developed and will be the focus of this thesis. The use of a quasi-DC inspection frequency suppresses the influence of the electromagnetic skin effect that would otherwise undermine the stability of the measurement in the ferromagnetic materials of interest; the use of even low frequency measurements allows phase sensitive detection and greatly enhanced noise performance. By permanently installing the electrodes {{to the surface of the}} component the resistance measurement is sensitive to strain. A resistance - strain inversion is derived and validated experimentally; the use of the potential drop sensor as a robust, high temperature strain gauge is therefore demonstrated. The strain rate of a component is known to be an expression of the creep state of the component. This concept was adopted to develop an interpretive framework for inferring the creep state of a component. It is possible to monitor the accumulation of creep damage through the symptomatic relative increase in strain rate. By taking the ratio of two orthogonal strain measurements, instability and drift common to both measurements can be effectively eliminated; an important attribute considering the necessity to monitor very low strain rates over decades in time in a harsh environment. A preliminary study of using the potential drop technique for monitoring creep damage <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> has been conducted. Welds provide a site for preferential creep damage accumulation and therefore will frequently be the life limiting feature of power station components. The potential drop technique will be sensitive to both the localised strain that is understood to act as precursor to creep damage <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> and also the initiation and growth of a crack. Through the course of this project, two site trials have been conducted in power stations. A measurement system and high temperature hardware that is suitable for the power station environment has been developed.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedDamping in structures {{has historically been}} of great importance in nearly all branches of engineering endeavors, and it {{also happens to be}} one of the most difficult parameters to predict. The purpose of this research is to study the effects that welding has on damping. Measurements and comparisons of the damping ratios of two welded stiffened plates, two flat plates and one machined stiffened plate are undertaken. The frequency response and natural frequencies of five steel structures are determined experimentally. A finite element model is created for three of the structures to determine the natural frequencies and associated mode shapes. The damping ratios are then determined using the half-power point method. The results show that at frequencies less than 500 Hz, welding tends to cause the damping ratio to increase. The experimental and numerical results show that the mode shapes that experience the highest degree of stress <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> are associated with the natural frequencies with the highest damping ratio. These results may lend to better understanding of the effects of welding on damping and assist in obtaining better empirical approximations of damping for use in ship shock computer simulations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The goal of {{this study}} is the {{modeling}} of a postulated break of the steam line at the containment penetration of the Trojan Nuclear Plant which is owned and operated by Portland General Electric. To perform this modeling, the RETRAN computer code package was utilized. RETRAN is designed to provide a best-estimate thermal hydraulic analysis of complex fluid flow systems such as those associated with light water reactors, solving both steady state and time dependent problems. A one loop RETRAN model of the Trojan Nuclear Plant including both a primary system and one steam generator had been developed previously at Oregon State University and was used as a starting point. The first step of this study was the refinement of the model into a two loop model. Since Trojan has four actual loops, one modeling loop represents three actual loops and the other modeling loop represents one actual loop. This allows the simulation of a transient introduced in one loop only, in contrast to the one loop model which requires introduction of the transient in all four loops simultaneously The second step in this study was to establish a steady state solution at four percent power consistent with the 100 percent power solution. Since the steam generator outlet pressure increases as power decreases, steam line break flow rates will be higher at low power, yielding a more conservative result (higher mass and energy release rates). Although hot standby (zero power) implies the highest outlet pressure, four percent power was used for modeling convenience: fewer alterations to the existing model were required with no loss of accuracy. The final step of the study consisted of including the steam lines in the RETRAN model and the simulation of a steam line break <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld</b> at the penetration of the primary containment. This weld was of particular interest because its location makes inspection and maintenance difficult.

40|$|Short-wave {{irregularities}} in the wheel-rail interface {{are at the}} basis of track and vehicle damage and deterioration. On the short term, they result into high dynamic train-track interaction forces and a high energy input into the system that must be dissipated in the different system components or "levels", leading on its turn to progressive deterioration on the long term. Furthermore, the short-wave defects grow into longer defects in the track geometry, {{due to the fact}} that the train is a travelling multi-body mass-spring system. The lifetime of the track and its components can be extended by adjusting the "path" of the dissipated power spectrum through the system and adjusting component and system properties with respect to their hysteretic behaviour. Instead of life-time extension, such measures may also aim at an extension of maintenance intervals, which is important to optimise the availability of e. g. high-speed lines. The present study investigates two particular types of short defects in detail: rail welds and wheel flats. In longitudinal direction and on a global scale, the contact between a rolling wheel and a rail can be distinguished into continuous single-point contact and transient double-point contact. The contact type that occurs depends on the actual geometry of the wheel-rail interface in the running direction. The first contact type leads to a dynamic amplification of the static axle load, whereas the second leads to wheel-rail impact. Especially the latter contact type is detrimental to the rail system and should be prevented as much as possible or detected at an early stage. The introduction of rail welds instead of the traditionally bolted connections reduced the dynamic forces at rail joints globally with a factor three. However, welds remain potential damage initiators due to the local geometrical and metallurgical discontinuity. Investigations show an approximately linear relationship between the extreme value of the dynamic wheel-rail contact force <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>weld,</b> the maximum absolute rail inclination and the train speed. The geometry of rail welds is traditionally assessed with the principle of vertical tolerances. A new assessment method for rail welds is proposed, with norm values for the allowable inclination depending on the line section train speed. This method is based on a relatively strong correlation between discretised maximum rail geometry inclinations (first derivatives) and extreme dynamic wheel-rail contact forces, relative to the poor correlation between tolerances and extreme forces. The method aims at a reduction and uniformisation of dynamic contact forces at rail welds, in order to avoid deterioration. Wheel flats are commonly assessed on the basis of their length and/or depth, or automatically detected by wheel impact load detectors in the track. This study has shown that the minimum circumferential wheel tread curvature is the critical parameter that governs the dynamic wheel-rail interaction in the presence of wheel flats. It determines which contact type occurs for a given flat geometry: continuous single-point contact, in the subcritical speed regime, or transient double-point contact, in the transcritical speed regime. It furthermore determines the magnitude of the contact force in the subcritical regime. Both speed regimes are shown to exhibit essentially different features with respect to the dynamic wheel-rail interaction: the track stiffness governs the interaction for low train speeds and long flats, whereas for high speeds and/or short flats the inertial properties of the wheel and the rail govern the interaction. The force-speed relationship is non-linear in the first regime, whereas linearity is a good approximation in the second regime. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

The alloys were based on the Ni- 8 Al- 7. 7 Cr- 1. 5 Mo- 0. 003 B wt% composition and contained Zr concentrations of 3, 4. 5, and 6 wt%. Vacuum induction melted ingots with a diameter of 2. 7 in and weight about 18 lb were made of each alloy, and were used to make 2 x 2 x 0. 030 in specimens for the Sigmajig test. The gas tungsten arc welds were made at travel speeds of 10, 20, and 30 ipm with heat inputs of 2 [...] 2. 5 kJ/in. When an arc was established before traveling onto the test specimen centerline cracking was always observed. This problem was overcome by initiating the arc directly on the specimens. Using this approach, the 3 wt% Zr alloy withstood an applied stress of 24 ksi without cracking <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> speed of 10 ipm. This alloy cracked at 4 ksi applied at 20 ipm, and with no applied load at 30 ipm. Only limited testing was done on the remaining alloys, but the results indicate that resistance to solidification cracking increases with Zr concentration. Zirconium has limited solid solubility and segregates strongly to interdendritic regions during solidification where it forms a Ni solid solution-Ni{sub 5 }Zr eutectic. The volume fraction of the eutectic increases with Zr concentration. The solidification cracking behavior of these alloys is consistent with phenomenological theory, and is discussed in this context. The results from SigmaJig testing are analyzed using finite element modeling of the development of mechanical strains during solidification of welds. Experimental data from the test substantially agree with recent analysis results...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} select the optimal {{configuration}} of controlling magnetic fields and build rational construction of magnetic systems, {{we need to know}} the distribution of welding current in the molten metal of the weld pool. So the objective of the work is to establish the calculated methods for determining current density in the weld pool during arc welding. The distribution of welding current in the pool depends on the field of the electrical resistance, which is determined by the deformed temperature field while arc moves with the welding speed. The previous works have shown experimentally and by simulation on the conductive paper that deformation of temperature field defines deformation of electric field. On the basis thereof, under certain boundary conditions the problem has been solved to give a general solution of differential equation, which relates the potential distribution to the temperature in the product during arc welding. This solution is obtained under the following boundary conditions: 1) metal is homogeneous; 2) input and output surfaces of heat flux and electric current coincide; 3) input and output surfaces of heat flux and electric current are insulated and equipotential; 4) other (lateral) surfaces are adiabatic boundaries. Therefore, this paper pays basic attention to obtaining the analytical solution of a general differential equation, which relates distribution of potential to the temperature in the product. It considers the temperature field of the heat source, which moves <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> speed with normal-circular distribution of the heat flow <b>at</b> <b>a</b> certain concentration factor. The distribution of current density is calculated {{on the assumption that the}} welding current is introduced through the same surface as the heat flux and the distribution of current density corresponds to the normally circular <b>at</b> <b>a</b> certain concentration factor. As a result, we get an expression that allows us to calculate the current density from the known distribution of heat flux density in the product. Using the results we can define the desired configuration of magnetic fields to create the necessary electromagnetic forces in the weld pool...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} {{evaluation}} of the proper stress intensity factor ranges in the fracture mechanics-based fatigue analysis of the rib-to-deck welded joints of orthotropic steel decks. It is pointed out in the paper that the stress intensity factor ranges used in Paris law for the fatigue crack growth <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rib-to-deck <b>welded</b> joint can not be taken as a value proportional to the corresponding stress ranges since the compressive stresses are the dominant transverse stresses in the cyclic stresses under the action of truck traffics. The proper fatigue design loads to characterize the standard truck loading for the accurate calculation of the tensile transverse stresses at the rib-to-deck joints is also discussed in the paper. It is shown that the loads from two neighboring wheel-axles of heavy trucks have to be taken into account...|$|R
