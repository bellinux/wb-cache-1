Adjusted for inflation, {{median household income}} dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007, while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that [...] "Median real after-tax household income went up 2 percent". The poverty rate increased from 11.3percent in 2000 to 12.3percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7percent in 2004. By October 2008, due to increases in spending, the national debt had risen to $11.3trillion, an increase of over 100percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6trillion. Most debt was accumulated {{as a result of}} what became known as the [...] "Bush tax cuts" [...] and increased national security spending. In March 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: [...] "The fact that we <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>today</b> to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure." [...] By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2percent.|$|E

5000|$|Escondido, California - On April 27, 2013, Hawaiian Falls {{presented}} a public-private partnership {{proposal to the}} City of Escondido’s economic development subcommittee. Hawaiian Falls proposed an 80-20 split {{on the construction of}} the proposed $13 million waterpark, with Escondido contributing $10,400,000 and Hawaiian Falls contributing $2.6 million. Hawaiian Falls proposed that the park be built in the City’s existing Kit Carson Park. Hawaiian Falls would pay the City 5% of the park’s revenues. Escondido Mayor urged Hawaiian Falls to come back with a better deal because payment on revenue bonds used to fund the park would be at least double what Hawaiian Falls proposed paying in rent. He said Escondido would consider furnishing the land, but not the money for the construction. http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/mar/03/tp-city-eyes-hawaiian-falls-at-kit-carson/ On April 15, 2013 angry Escondido residents {{presented a}} petition to City Council opposing Hawaiian Falls’ proposal.

And so we became aware of the nuclear thing, and when we got back here we started to think about it, and get concerned about it. People in Australia are unaware that nuclear devices have been detonated here at Maralinga in the early fifties, and theyre unaware of the facilities that the Americans have put here, which are used in their defense network and their attack network.
