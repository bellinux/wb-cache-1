5|$|A low {{pressure}} area previously associated with <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> system developed into a tropical depression near Bermuda on September22. The depression had sustained winds of 30mph (45km/h) and failed to strengthen further. It became extratropical on September23.|$|E

5|$|Arlene made {{landfall}} {{just west}} of Pensacola, Florida with 60mph (95km/h) winds on June 11. After moving inland, Arlene persisted as a dissipating tropical depression for two days, passing into Indiana and Michigan before being absorbed by <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> system over southeastern Canada on June 14.|$|E
5|$|As an extratropical low {{combined}} with <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> system, Bonnie continued to produce moderate rainfall in Canada, peaking at 3.5inches (90mm) in Edmundston, New Brunswick. The rainfall caused basement flooding and road washouts; slick roads caused a traffic fatality in Edmundston.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00p.m. EDT on August 31, {{the center}} of the remnant low of what was Katrina had been {{completely}} absorbed by <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> boundary in southeastern Canada, with no discernible circulation.|$|E

5|$|Ever {{since the}} victory against an Egyptian army at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the {{standard}} British tactic against an entrenched position was an approach march {{at night in}} close order to maintain cohesion, followed by deployment into open order within {{a few hundred yards}} of the objective and <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> attack with the bayonet at first light. Methuen planned to bombard the Boer positions with artillery from 16:50 to 18:30 on 10 December. Following the barrage, the newly arrived Highland Brigade under Major General Wauchope was to make a night march that would position them to launch <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> attack on the Boers at dawn the following day. Wauchope had argued for a flanking attack along the Modder River, but had been unable to convince his superior.|$|E
5|$|Late on December8, Epsilon transitioned into {{a remnant}} low {{pressure}} area. The remnant circulation elongated {{in advance of}} <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> zone, and it dissipated late on December9. The front absorbed the remnants the next day.|$|E
5|$|Later in the day, Company I of 2/5 {{conducted}} <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> {{assault with}} fixed bayonets {{on the northern}} portion of the Japanese defenses, overrunning and killing the Japanese defenders. At the same time, two battalions from 2nd Marine Regiment, now committed to the offensive, advanced past the Point Cruz area.|$|E
50|$|The male {{hooded parrot}} can be {{distinguished}} from the similar looking male golden-shouldered parrot mainly {{by the absence of}} <b>a</b> pale <b>frontal</b> band, <b>a</b> larger yellow patch on the wings, and absence of the red on the abdomen. The female is very similar to the female Yellow-shouldered parrot being identified by the absence of <b>a</b> pale <b>frontal</b> band and <b>an</b> absence of red on the abdomen.|$|R

5|$|The extraocular {{muscles of}} the walrus are well-developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to {{protrude}} its eyes and see in both <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> and dorsal direction. However, vision in this species {{appears to be more}} suited for short-range.|$|E
5|$|Around 06:00 UTC on the {{following}} day, the cyclone reached maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Only six hours later, the system lost tropical characteristics while located about , after the vortex became elongated while <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> system approached the area. The remnants continued northwestward and moved ashore in North Carolina early on October 12, before dissipating early {{the following}} day.|$|E

5|$|At about 10:30, Rybka {{launched}} <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> attack {{across the}} Unac supported {{by at least}} one MG42 machine gun firing into the mouth of the cave. The Germans reached the base of the hill, fifty metres from the cave, but suffered severe casualties in the assault. They were also running low on water. Prior to this attack, Tito and around 20 staff had taken refuge in the cave.|$|E
5|$|Cindy's remnant low {{moving across}} western and {{northern}} North Carolina combined with <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> boundary to produce several supercell thunderstorms. These supercells spawned {{a number of}} tornadoes in western North Carolina, at {{the foothills of the}} Appalachian mountains, but their effects were minimal. Continuing north, Cindy brought over 5in (125mm) of rain to areas as distant as Salisbury, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not making}} landfall, Helene's close {{proximity}} to the United States resulted in impacts along the East Coast. Impacts were most severe in North Carolina, where the hurricane made its closest approach. Wind impacts were felt primarily from South Carolina to Virginia, though <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> zone aided in bringing precipitation as far north as Maine. In the United States, Helene caused $11.2million in damages and one indirect fatality.|$|E

40|$|A torrential rain episode (≥ 200 mm day- 1) was {{observed}} over coastal regions of southern Taiwan (south of 23. 0 °N) on 5 June 2008 {{under the influence}} of <b>a</b> meso-scale <b>frontal</b> cyclone (MFC) formed along the western flank of <b>a</b> Mei-yu <b>frontal</b> zone. Through the incorporation of additional observations over the ocean collected during Southwest Monsoon Experiment (SoWMEX) /Terrain-influenced Monsoon Rainfall Experiment (TiMREX), the location of <b>a</b> Mei-yu <b>frontal</b> boundary, defined by the wind shift, is better identified over the open ocean by the data assimilation of dropsonde observations. Meanwhile, the low-level cyclonic vorticity and horizontal convergence are increased along the Mei-yu <b>frontal</b> zone, and <b>an</b> increment maximum center of cyclonic vorticity locates over the north of South China Sea (SCS), where the MFC subsequently forms...|$|R
5|$|Having been forewarned {{about the}} attack, the Portuguese {{commander}} {{had been able}} to begin preparations for the assault; however, he had planned on receiving <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> assault and when the force came under attack from the rear he was completely surprised. The Portuguese attempted to entrench themselves in rifle pits, but they became disoriented after Pinto and several other officers were slain early in the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} take Caen through {{successive}} flanking manoeuvres, Montgomery decided the next attack would be <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> assault. Although Caen's strategic importance had vastly diminished since D-Day, he sought control of Bourguébus and the commanding high ground to the south. On 5 July the orders for Operation Charnwood were issued; {{it was to be}} launched at 04:20, {{an hour and a half}} before dawn on 8 July.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carla {{was a large}} {{hurricane}} {{that moved}} into Texas during September 1961. As it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone across the Great Plains and Midwest, heavy rain fell in a band on the poleward side of <b>a</b> <b>frontal</b> boundary extending northeast from Carla, leading to the wettest known event {{to be associated with}} a tropical cyclone or its remains across Iowa.|$|E
