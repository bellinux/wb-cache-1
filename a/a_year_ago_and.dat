25|$|Poirot {{is asked}} for help by a physician, Dr Charles Oldfield, who has a {{practice}} in Market Loughborough, a small village in Berkshire. His wife died just over <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> the malicious talk in the village is that he poisoned her. People are avoiding him and several poison pen letters {{have been sent to}} him but he can do nothing to stem this tide of ill-intentioned gossip – like the heads of the Lernaean Hydra, when one source of the gossip is cut off, another grows in its place. So, his ultimate aim was to cut the main source of the gossip, just like the hydra had been slain by cutting its vulnerable head. Mrs Oldfield was a difficult invalid whose death was put down to a gastric ulcer, whose symptoms are similar to that of arsenic poisoning. She left her husband a not-inconsiderable sum of money and, under pressure, Oldfield admits {{that a lot of the}} talk revolves around Jean Moncrieffe, his young dispenser, who he wants to marry but dare not because of the talk. Poirot travels to Market Loughborough and meets Jean. She is frank about her relationship with Oldfield and her dislike of his wife but opposes Poirot's idea of an exhumation and autopsy on the body. Poirot makes the rounds of the village, insinuating that he is connected with the Home Office and thereby generating much hypocritical murmurs of sympathy for the doctor and, more importantly, names of who said what and when. From this he learns of the present whereabouts of two servants of the Oldfields who left their employ after Mrs Oldfield died; Nurse Harrison, who tended to the patient, and Beatrice, the family maid. Nurse Harrison tells a story of overhearing Jean and the Doctor talking about the imminent death of his wife in which it was clear that this was an event that both of them were impatiently waiting for. The nurse is certain that Beatrice must have overheard the talk as well. Poirot tells her of the supposed plans of exhumation and the nurse considers this news and then tells him she agrees that such a thing should be done. While being interviewed, Beatrice slyly denies overhearing any conversation but tells him of several suspicious stories of Jean making medicines or pots of tea for Mrs Oldfield which the nurse poured away or changed before the patient could take them.|$|E

She had died a little over <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> Old Barnet was distraught; he had no wife to come home to. One day, Maurice showed up and volunteered to help him out around the house while he was out fishing. Poor and sickly, Maurice could not perform difficult tasks, but he was diligent. Old Barnet grew to love Maurice, as did the villagers.|$|E
500|$|The episode also reintroduced the storyline of Paul Young and Felicia Tilman's rivalry.

I don’t get super-excited about a 'maybe' in this town, because {{there are lots of}} maybes that don’t happen. But then this last year they called up my agent and said, 'We're really thinking seriously about [...]' And eventually, they made an offer, and I was very pleased." [...] Harriet Samson Harris also {{returned to}} reprise her role as Felicia, while Steven Culp and Christine Estabrook returned as Rex Van de Kamp and Martha Huber respectively in flashback sequences.

Teddy points out that since [...] "John G" [...] is common, he will cyclically forget and begin again and that even Teddy himself has a [...] "John G" [...] name. Further, Teddy claims that Sammy's story is Leonard's himself, repressing the memory to escape guilt.|$|E

2500|$|Steve Persall of the St. Petersburg Times {{rated the}} film B and added, [...] "Infamous {{might have been}} viewed as one of this year's better films if Capote hadn't told the same story about the same {{characters}} <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> done it so well [...] [...] [...] Infamous is inferior, although not drastically so, in almost every respect [...] [...] [...] The most obvious comparisons are to be made about performances. Jones {{is a much more}} accurate physical representation of Capote than Hoffman, his high-pitched voice sounding a little more affected than his Oscar-winning predecessor. However, the relative shallowness of McGrath's screenplay doesn't offer as many emotional land mines for Jones to play. [...] delivers an uncanny impersonation, while Hoffman's portrayal was a studiously researched impression, a likely more challenging task. Call this race nearly a draw, with Hoffman simply crossing the finish line first." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1943, {{during the}} Tripartite Dinner Meeting at the Tehran Conference, the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, {{proposed}} executing 50,000–100,000 German staff officers.

Churchill, believing {{them to be}} serious, denounced the idea of [...] "the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country" [...] {{and that he would}} rather be [...] "taken out in the courtyard and shot" [...] himself than partake in any such action. However, he also stated that war criminals must pay for their crimes and that, in accordance with the Moscow Document which he himself had written, they should be tried at the places where the crimes were committed. Churchill was vigorously opposed to executions [...] "for political purposes." [...] According to the minutes of a meeting between Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta, on 4 February 1945, at the Livadia Palace, President Roosevelt [...] "said that he had been very much struck by the extent of German destruction in the Crimea and therefore he was more bloodthirsty in regard to the Germans than he had been <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> he hoped that Marshal Stalin would again propose a toast to the execution of 50,000 officers of the German Army." ...|$|E
