5|$|In {{the early}} 1018 Ivan Vladislav besieged Dyrrhachium, but in February {{he was killed}} under {{the walls of the}} city. The {{accounts}} of his death are contradictory. According to some he became victim of a plot and was killed by his servants; according to others, he perished in battle. The Bulgarian additions to the Skylitzes Chronicle are more detailed, saying that Ivan Vladislav dueled with the strategos of Dyrrhachium, the patrikios Niketas Pegonites, on horseback, and while fighting, two Byzantine infantrymen from the audience rushed to the emperor and wounded him mortally in the belly. A later Byzantine historian claimed that the duel was fair and Pegonites stabbed Ivan Vladislav in the chest with his spear, killing him instantly. The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja reports an <b>altogether</b> <b>different</b> story: while having a meal in his camp, the emperor was attacked by an unknown soldier, in whom Ivan Vladislav seemed to have recognized the murdered Jovan Vladimir. Terrified, he cried for help but no one rushed to his rescue and the unknown soldier mortally wounded the Bulgarian ruler.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, {{the search}} for a {{synthetic}} substitute for atropine culminated serendipitously in the discovery of meperidine, the first opiate with a structure <b>altogether</b> <b>different</b> from that of morphine. This was followed in 1947 by the widespread introduction of methadone, another structurally unrelated compound with pharmacological properties similar to those of morphine.|$|E
25|$|The {{matter is}} <b>altogether</b> <b>different</b> with Scott the novelist. The poems were read {{because they were}} fashionable. But the {{popularity}} of the novels was such that fanatically devoted readers fiercely debated the respective merits of their favourite characters and scenes. Hazlitt, whose reviews had been highly favourable and appreciated these books as much as anyone, here elaborates on his own favourites, after first discussing a qualifying issue.|$|E

25|$|As a {{distinct}} movement, Pietism had its greatest strength {{by the middle}} of the 18th century; its very individualism in fact helped to prepare the way for the Enlightenment (Aufklärung), which took the church in an <b>altogether</b> <b>different</b> direction. Yet some claim that Pietism contributed largely to the revival of Biblical studies in Germany and to making religion once more an affair of the heart and of life and not merely of the intellect.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, his employer, Charles H. Kerr, {{who came into}} the socialist {{movement}} {{about the same time as}} Simons, was on an <b>altogether</b> <b>different</b> ideological trajectory. Kerr took less solace from the advances of the Socialist Party in the electoral realm, particularly among middle class intellectuals such as himself, and instead came to identify more and more with the revolutionary industrial unionism of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), established in 1905.|$|E

25|$|Daeva, the Iranian {{language}} term, {{should not}} be confused with the devas of Indian religions. While the word for the Vedic spirits and the word for the Zoroastrian entities are etymologically related, their function and thematic development is <b>altogether</b> <b>different.</b> The once-widespread notion that the radically different functions of Iranian daeva and Indic deva (and ahura versus asura) represented a prehistoric inversion of roles is no longer followed in 21st century academic discourse (see In comparison with Vedic usage for details).|$|E
25|$|An <b>altogether</b> <b>different</b> {{argument}} challenged {{that since}} the Nazis destroyed massive sets of sensitive documents pertaining to the Holocaust upon the arrival of Soviet and Western Ally troops, no truly comprehensive, verifiable historical reconstruction could be achieved. This, however, argues Hilberg, demonstrates an ignorance as to the structure {{and scope of the}} Nazi bureaucracy. While it is true that many sensitive documents were destroyed, the bureaucracy nonetheless was so immense and so dispersed, that most pertinent materials could be reconstructed either from copies or from a vast array of more peripheral ones.|$|E

25|$|The second first-person {{narration}} we {{have from}} Alhambra is <b>altogether</b> <b>different</b> from the first – here we are not offered her history, but rather a history of 20th century cinema – a past which she seems to adopt as her own, {{as if she were}} each of the characters in those films. “The Middle” deals, again, with each of the family members’ experiences of Amber: she throws Astrid’s camera off a bridge into the road, she seduces Magnus, and reveals flaws in Eve and Michael’s relationship. “The Middle” ends with Eve throwing Amber out of their holiday home.|$|E
25|$|Phages may be {{released}} via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, {{in a few}} cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called endolysin, which attacks and breaks down the cell wall peptidoglycan. An <b>altogether</b> <b>different</b> phage type, the filamentous phages, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain Mycoplasma phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a lysogenic cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as prophage.|$|E
25|$|The term {{aperiodic}} {{has been}} used {{in a wide variety of}} ways in the mathematical literature on tilings (and in other mathematical fields as well, such as dynamical systems or graph theory, with <b>altogether</b> <b>different</b> meanings). With respect to tilings the term aperiodic was sometimes used synonymously with the term non-periodic. A non-periodic tiling is simply one that is not fixed by any non-trivial translation. Sometimes the term described - implicitly or explicitly - a tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles. Frequently the term aperiodic was just used vaguely to describe the structures under consideration, referring to physical aperiodic solids, namely quasicrystals, or to something non-periodic with some kind of global order.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} major {{varieties}} of Magnus: Quest, Camp, Equipment, and Battle. Quest Magnus are {{items from the}} overworld stored into various blank cards. They are used to interact with other characters and complete puzzles and sidequests. Camp Magnus are items used outside of battle to heal the party members or grant them status bonuses. Equipment Magnus {{are made up of}} each character's unique weapon. They are equipped to the characters to provide increased statistics. Some of the Magnus change over time, gaining a stronger, weaker, or <b>altogether</b> <b>different</b> effect. Food items may rot and turn into items which cause poison or wine will turn from a healing item into vinegar, an attack card.|$|E
25|$|The Lanes {{were part}} of a {{prominent}} Oregon political family. Nathaniel Lane's father Joseph Lane had been the first territorial Governor of Oregon and was immortalized as the namesake of Lane County, Oregon. In the election of 1860 Joseph Lane had achieved national prominence as the Vice Presidential running mate of John C. Breckinridge on the pro-slavery Southern Democratic Party ticket — with the pair carrying 11 states in a losing effort to Abraham Lincoln. Nathaniel's brother, Lafayette Lane, was elected a member of the Oregon Legislature and United States Congress. Harry would eventually continue the family tradition, albeit as a Democrat of an <b>altogether</b> <b>different</b> stripe than had been his uncle and grandfather.|$|E
