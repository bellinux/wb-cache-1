5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is <b>always</b> <b>seen</b> sucking.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{such as in}} the UK, hares are not <b>always</b> <b>seen</b> as pests, {{and there}} are species action plans aiming to {{significantly}} increase their numbers. Some coursers say that coursing assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating a habitat suitable for hares. Opponents of coursing say that the converse is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes place. It is also the case that coursing kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|E

5|$|Daspletosaurus had {{a massive}} skull that could reach more than 1meter (3.3ft) in length. The bones were heavily {{constructed}} and some, including the nasal bones {{on top of}} the snout, were fused for strength. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. An adult Daspletosaurus was armed with about six dozen teeth that were very long but oval in cross section rather than blade-like. Unlike its other teeth, those in the premaxilla {{at the end of the}} upper jaw had a D-shaped cross section, an example of heterodonty <b>always</b> <b>seen</b> in tyrannosaurids. Unique skull features included the rough outer surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the pronounced crests around the eyes on the lacrimal, postorbital, and jugal bones. The orbit (eye socket) was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus. Split carinae have been found on Daspletosaurus teeth.|$|E

25|$|Mat Salleh, however, is not <b>always</b> <b>seen</b> as a hero. Many {{writers of}} this {{rebellion}} see Mat Salleh as a lone crusader and / or an opportunist solely interested in restoring his precolonial social position of power. To the British, {{he was a}} rebel and troublemaker, but to his supporters, he {{was and still is}} a warrior.|$|E

Lilith in legend was the first wife of Adam. She rebelled against Adam, the angels, and even God. She came {{to be seen as a}} demon and a witch.|$|E
25|$|The player only {{encounters}} Ryan once {{in person}} {{throughout the entire}} BioShock franchise, with most of his appearance being made via radio transmission and audio diaries. Ryan is <b>always</b> <b>seen</b> with his hair slicked back and sporting a smart suit and necktie. In an image the player encounters of Ryan during the Welcome to Rapture and Rapture Control Centre levels, he can be seen wearing a black fedora.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{recruitment}} {{of the armed forces}} depended on nai, or mun nai, literally meaning 'lord', officials who commanded their own phrai som, or subjects. These officials had to submit to the king's command when war broke out. Officials thus became the key figures to the kingdom's politics. At least two officials staged coups, taking the throne themselves while bloody struggles between the king and his officials, followed by purges of court officials, were <b>always</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E

25|$|With You Only Live Twice and Licence to Kill being notable exceptions, James Bond {{is almost}} <b>always</b> <b>seen</b> at the HQ of MI6 (referred to as MI7 in Dr. No) in central London. This {{has been the}} actual {{headquarters}} of MI6: the Vauxhall Cross building on the Thames from GoldenEye (1995) onwards. Prior to {{that it was a}} nondescript building near Whitehall, sometimes (e.g. Dr. No, OHMSS, The Living Daylights) ostensibly the HQ of Universal Exports, the Secret Service's front company.|$|E
25|$|Maggie Simpson, is the {{youngest}} of the five main family members and is almost <b>always</b> <b>seen</b> as a baby. She was quite prominent in the Tracey Ullman Show shorts, often being featured alongside Bart and Lisa but has since become the least seen and heard of the five main Simpsons. Maggie rarely speaks, but has been voiced by several actors including Elizabeth Taylor, James Earl Jones, Harry Shearer, who used his Kang voice, Jodie Foster, Yeardley Smith, and Nancy Cartwright.|$|E
25|$|William Porter {{relied on}} amateur correspondents to cover {{sporting}} events across the United States. By {{the end of}} the 1830s, these writers had begun to submit fiction as well, including horse-racing fiction, hunting fiction, and tall tales. The paper thus served as an early outlet for many American authors. Among the Spirits correspondents who would go on to literary careers were George Washington Harris (who used the pseudonyms 'Sugartail' and 'Mr. Free'), Johnson Jones Hooper, Henry Clay Lewis, Alexander McNutt, Thomas Bangs Thorpe, and Jonathan Falconbridge Kelly. Many contributed anonymously, as writing was not <b>always</b> <b>seen</b> as a respectable profession.|$|E
50|$|On July 16-17, 2015, DSCOVR took {{a series}} of images showing the Moon engaged in a transit of Earth. The images were taken between 19:50 and 00:45 UTC. The {{animation}} was composed of monochrome images taken in different color filters at 30 second intervals for each frame, resulting in a slight color fringing for the Moon in each finished frame. Due to its position at Sun-Earth , DSCOVR will <b>always</b> <b>see</b> the Moon illuminated, and will <b>always</b> <b>see</b> its far side when it passes in front of Earth.|$|R

25|$|Winston (Jeff Lumby) is {{the owner}} and sole {{employee}} of Rothschild's Sewage and Septic Sucking Services. Like Dalton and Mike, Winston is one of Red Green's friends and takes part in the day-to-day operations at Possum Lodge. He is <b>always</b> <b>seen</b> wearing a hard hat, a white button-down shirt, a bowtie and hip waders. He is generally upbeat and has a positive outlook on life, and is usually able to {{look on the bright}} side of things even in the face of certain disaster. He is also a fan of self help speakers Anthony Anthony (whom he likes to quote) and Walter Mollusk.|$|E
25|$|June is ladylike and {{slightly}} formal in personal appearance, <b>always</b> <b>seen</b> with perfectly coiffed hair and tasteful facial makeup. She is notorious among the show's fans for consistently being {{dressed as a}} party hostess, even when doing her housework or relaxing around the house. She wears stylish slacks about the house in a few early episodes, {{but for most of}} the series her wardrobe consists of simple but elegant dresses, suits, or skirts paired with blouses or sweaters and high-heeled pumps for shoes. Many of her most attractive housefrocks were worn throughout the series' run. She wears a pearl necklace in almost every scene, even when gardening.|$|E
25|$|Censorship was {{reinstated}} on March 12, 1916, {{after the}} declaration of war by Germany. Seizures were ordered of all documents whose publication might hinder national security or could be perceived as anti-war propaganda. Prior censorship, now a task of the Department of War, was <b>always</b> <b>seen</b> as a temporary exception, being unconstitutional. The military coup by Sidónio Pais would be in part justified with the unpopularity of prior censorship, which was now very obvious in the newspapers, as the space occupied by the censored text was intentionally left blank, so as to indicate to readers that the text had been censored. Sidónio Pais would, however, resort to prior censorship, adding it to all other repressive actions by his government {{until the end of}} the War.|$|E
