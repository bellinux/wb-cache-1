40|$|AbstractCompetition in {{the market}} is an {{essential}} prerequisite for ensuring the national economic growth; therefore, almost all market economies consider national competitiveness as a value and protect it. The national competition policy, directed towards the detection and punishment of cartels, is an important tool for ensuring fair and free competition and an important factor for maintaining the country's economic development. The success of an efficient competition supervision is determined by not only a formal coordination of the legal basis, {{but also by the}} peculiarities of practical application of competition law, economic and cultural aspects of society, the political will and many other factors. Despite the fact that formally, the regulation of competition restricting <b>agreements</b> concluded <b>between</b> <b>undertakings</b> in Lithuania is essentially the same as in the European Union, however, in Lithuania the level of competition culture and competition policy dissemination and public awareness is quite low, compared to the other European Union states.

40|$|This master’s thesis {{examines}} strategic alliances {{under the}} European Union competition law and answers {{the following research}} questions: i) how can the European Union competition law be systemized with regards to strategic alliances and ii) {{is it possible to}} establish a general framework for the use of strategic alliances under the European Union competition law. For the purpose of the thesis, a strategic alliance is operationalized as being inter-organizational cooperation <b>between</b> independent <b>undertakings</b> having a form of either horizontal cooperation or vertical cooperation. The concept of cooperation is understood as having a form of an explicit <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> <b>undertakings</b> resulting in either a contractual arrangement or an establishment of a full-function joint venture. The research material of the thesis is i) relevant primary and secondary legislation of the European Union law, ii) relevant soft law instruments given by the European Commission in the field of competition law and iii) general academic literature on the European Union competition law. The thesis applies a hermeneutic methodological approach. This thesis is structured as follows. First, an overview of the European Union law is presented together with the aims and legal basis of the European Union competition law. Then relevant competition law provisions of the European Union law in the context of strategic alliances are discussed in detail. After this a framework for strategic alliances under the European Union competition law is laid out. The thesis ends with a conclusion section in which the whole thesis is summarized and the research questions addressed in a condensed manner. The conclusion of the thesis is that the European Union competition law has a solid basis in the primary law of the European Union along with complementary secondary law provisions. From the strategic alliance point of view, the most important provisions have been identified as being Article 101 TFEU and EUMR together with Regulation 1 / 2003 stipulating the enforcement of Article 101 TFEU. Further, it has been presented that the applicable European Union competition law provisions relating to strategic alliances are dependent on the characteristics of the strategic alliance in question with the main factors determining the applicable European Union competition law provisions being the nature of cooperation (horizontal vs. vertical cooperation) and the form of cooperation (contractual arrangement vs. full-function joint venture). Lastly, it has been presented that the European Union competition law relating to strategic alliances in its all forms are directly linked to a concept of market power. Only cooperation <b>between</b> <b>undertakings</b> that have sufficient degree of market power – either before or after the commencement of cooperation – may fall under the prohibition of Article 101 TFEU and EUMR. From the European Union competition law point of view, market power is a question of a degree resulting in a fact that there is always a point after which market power of undertakings becomes substantial enough to be deemed to have potential anti-competitive effects. The point after which market power becomes substantial enough must be determined through a concept of independence taking into account the degree of competitive constraints exerted on the undertakings concerned in the relevant product and geographical markets...|$|R

40|$|In their {{economic}} activity, undertakings conclude many agreements between them. But <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>undertakings</b> which can distort the competition -anticompetitive agreements- are prohibited. The Romanian and EU law prohibit &# 39;all <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>undertakings,</b> decisions by {{associations of undertakings}} and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition&# 39;. However, the terms &# 39;agreements&# 39;, &# 39;decisions&# 39; or &# 39;concerted practices&# 39; are nowhere defined in the EU Treaties or in the Romanian law. These terms are key concepts {{in the analysis of}} anticompetitive agreements which can distort the competition. In the lack of a legal definition, these concepts have generated a complex body of jurisprudence, which has to be identified. The analysis of these key concepts necessarily entails the conceptual delimitation of the notions. On this purpose, the relevant legal provisions will be identified in the Romanian and EU law, as well as the decisions of the European Court of Justice in this matter. The present paper intends to present the conceptual evolution of the analysed notions, paying special attention to concerted practices and to parallel behaviour in price fixing on the market...|$|E
40|$|Competition policy starts by shaping a {{legislative}} framework. This is aimed to establish boundaries for conducting competition and also sets limits of licit and illicit demarcation, for competitive and anticompetitive practices. The Romanian Competition Law has a divalent approach and {{it aims to}} provide specific behavioral conditions in order to stimulate and protect free-market competition, with {{the ultimate goal of}} developing a balanced, efficient and competitive economy. Our country’s Competition policy is based on punishing the behavior. There are three such types of anti-competitive behavior, namely: <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>undertakings,</b> abuse of dominant position and mergers and other concentrations between undertakings. Recent Practice proved that this “enforcement-conduct-punishment” structure is not necessary the best way to address competition and it is high time for authorities to switch both regulation and enforcement of competition from the “classical perspective” towards concepts like “competition advocacy” and “soft power” and give competition policy a new, reshaped face...|$|E

40|$|This {{report has}} been drafted {{within the context}} of work package (WP) 8 of the bEUcitizen project. This WP focuses on {{political}} rights and thus aims to elaborate on the perceived tension between economic rights and political rights of European Union (EU) citizens. The present report contributes to this aim by providing an analysis of the tension between EU competition law and so-called Responsible Business Conduct (RBC) initiatives. The term RBC refers to initiatives of private businesses that do not solely aim at making profit, but also aim to achieve a wider social goal, such as environmental protection, protection of animal welfare or combatting low wages. In order to be effective, these RBC-initiatives are often carried out in cooperation between different private firms. This cooperative nature renders many RBC initiatives problematic from a competition law perspective, which prohibits anti-competitive <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The current report first provides an in-depth overview of what the authors refer to as the ‘competition law problem’ that often hinders these RBC-initiatives. The report then reflects at a more fundamental level on this competition law problem using three different lenses, which allow the reader to gain insights from different theoretical angles. Section 3 of the report places the competition law problem within the wider academic and political discussion on the ‘dis-embeddedness’ or ‘decoupling’ of the economic dimension side of EU integration (also called ‘Market Europe’) from the social dimension of EU integration (also called ‘Social Europe’). Section 4 focuses on the position of private firms as political actors when engaging in RBC-initiatives. This section thus analyses the central issue for this report from the perspective of various theoretical outlooks on the (political) role of private firms, including the ethics of the firm and the notion of corporate citizenship. Subsequently, section 5 focuses on the vertical relationship between the EU member states and the EU, reflecting on the possibility of a divergence between the approaches pushed for at the European and national level respectively. In the analysis, the report focuses mostly on the Netherlands as the developments here seem to be at the forefront of this discussion. While the report thus provides a case-study, the analysis will also provide insights relevant within a wider context since the highlighted tensions stem from European law,. The report concludes i. a. that the tension between EU competition law and RBC-initiatives correlates with more fundamental changes within society, most notably a shift in thinking about the place of ‘the firm’ in society. These changes have provided an impetus for the increased engagement with RBC. At the same time, non-economic public interests seem to remain foreign to EU competition law. Until now, institutions – such as the EU Commission and the Dutch national competition authority – remain largely unable to weigh these interests in their competition law analysis. On the basis of the analysis in the report, it is argued that this demonstrates the disembedded nature of EU competition law and provides an example of the rising asymmetry between so-called ‘Social Europe’ and ‘Market Europe’. It is stressed that this tension seems problematic and could in the long run greaten the tensions between the EU and its member states. The report finally concludes that the problem might be solved by merging legal and political solutions at both the European level and the national level of the EU member states. However, these possible solutions deserve further scholarly attention...|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} system {{was created in}} order to control player movement between football clubs and has existed since the late nineteenth century. During the negotiation of today’s transfer rules FIFA, UEFA and the Commission found that a breach of contract during the season could upset the balance of competition and therefore should be restricted. It was considered necessary to strengthen the contractual stability and to apply a special rule to preserve the regularity and proper functioning of competition. This was done by the means of a provision stipulating that a football player only can be registered to play with a national association during one of the two registration periods per year, generally known as the transfer windows. Sport has never been included in the formal structures of the European Union and the regulation of sport has instead materialized through verdicts from the European Court of Justice. One of the most influential statements emerging from the Court is that sport is subject to Community law in so far it constitutes an economic activity. Consequently, if the activity is economic there is a risk that it infringes EU law. The purpose of this master thesis is to examine the FIFA transfer window system and to determine whether it violates Article 39 and/or Article 81 EC. The transfer windows, a regulation strengthened by the ECJ in the case of Lehtonen, restrict the ability of players to seek alternative employment and could therefore be regarded as a violation of the free movement of workers. In order to trigger the Treaty provisions guarding the right of freedom of movement the person in question must be a national of a Member State of the European Union and the activity must have a territorial dimension beyond the borders of a single Member State of the European Union. The person in question must also be engaged in some kind of economic activity. It is, however, clear that football players who are members of the European Union and are applying for a job in another Member State, and are performing at a certain level, fulfil these requirements. Footballers should therefore be considered as workers within the meaning of Article 39 EC and the prohibition of discrimination contained in that article which catches non-discriminatory private collective measures, such as the {{transfer system}}, invented by regulatory bodies like FIFA and UEFA. When considering the FIFA “windows system” it is clear that it is liable of restricting the ability of players to seek alternative employment in another Member State and should therefore be regarded as a violation of Article 39 EC. Nevertheless, restricted transfer periods have been found by the ECJ to be objectively justified as having sporting benefits in the Belgian Basketball league. It is, however, likely that the “window system”, as it operates in European football, goes beyond what is necessary to achieve team and player contract stability since it is too restrictive and somewhat redundant. Consequently, the FIFA transfer windows do not comply with the requirements of the principle of proportionality and should therefore, if challenged, be regarded as a violation of Article 39 EC. The use of transfer windows in European football can also be considered to be an issue for competition law and in particular Article 81 EC. The article prohibits all <b>agreements</b> <b>between</b> <b>undertakings</b> that restrict competition and affect trade between Member States and has the objective to protect consumers, enhance their welfare and to facilitate the creation of a single European market. The ECJ has, however, acknowledged a certain type of sporting rule that, even though it restricts competition, will be granted immunity from Article 81 EC. The FIFA “windows system” should not be regarded as such a rule since it does not fulfil the required conditions. The transfer windows do little for the competitive balance within the European football. It may be argued that it preserves the appeal and the unpredictability of the finishing stages of a championship. However, they also prevent clubs from developing their economic activity and restrict the free play of the market forces of supply and demand. Furthermore, the “windows system” hinders certain clubs from raising the quality of their sporting performance since clubs in minor leagues with a closed window are losing their best players to clubs in a better league with an open window, without being able to replace them. All of this affects the small and economically weak clubs and strengthens the position of the financially strong clubs. As a result a few strong clubs will, contrary to the best interest of consumers, continue to dominate European football. The FIFA regulation of transfer windows is therefore likely to fall under Article 81 (1) EC. It is unlikely that the pro-competitive benefits of the FIFA transfer windows outweigh its restrictive effects since it is improbable that they would be considered the least restrictive means of creating these benefits. Subsequently, the FIFA “windows system” would not qualify for an exemption under Article 81 (3) EC and should, if challenged, be void under Article 81 (2) EC...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{evaluate}} the conceptual relationship between two central elements of the theory of antitrust: competition and consumer welfare. These two notions are analysed in their mutual dependency. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that both competition and consumer welfare are economic values of fundamental importance with no ex ante hierarchical dominance of consumer welfare over competition. In case of conflict, priority might be given to either of these values depending on the context of the assessment. As can be understood from the very etymology of the term, competition is a notion which encompasses a process, more than a result. The notion of consumer welfare, on the other hand, is result-oriented. If we are interested in the outcomes that can be generated by competition only, then the very process of rivalry <b>between</b> <b>undertakings</b> would be seen as unnecessary or, at least, not indispensable. If, however, we consider that competition (seen as a process) is important for the societal paradigm of economic development, then the outcomes generated by this process are not the only reason for the rivalry <b>between</b> <b>undertakings</b> to exist. Methodologically, the latter approach appears to be more consistent with the idea of liberal democracy...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) mammographic density {{categories}} {{are associated with}} considerable interobserver variability. Automated methods of measuring volumetric breast density may reduce variability and be valuable in risk and mammographic screening stratification. Our objective was to assess agreement of mammographic density by a volumetric method with the radiologists' classification. METHODS: Eight thousand seven hundred and eighty-two examinations from the Malmö Breast Tomosynthesis Screening Trial were classified according to BI-RADS, 4 th Edition. Volumetric breast density was assessed using automated software for 8433 examinations. <b>Agreement</b> <b>between</b> volumetric breast density and BI-RADS was descriptively analyzed. <b>Agreement</b> <b>between</b> radiologists and between categorical volumetric density and BI-RADS was calculated, rendering kappa values. RESULTS: The observed <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> BI-RADS scores of different radiologists was 80. 9 % [kappa 0. 77 (0. 76 - 0. 79) ]. A spread of volumetric breast density for each BI-RADS category was seen. The observed <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> categorical volumetric density and BI-RADS scores was 57. 1 % [kappa 0. 55 (0. 53 - 0. 56) ]. CONCLUSIONS: There was moderate <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> volumetric density and BI-RADS scores from European radiologists indicating that radiologists evaluate mammographic density differently than software. The automated method may be a robust and valuable tool; however, differences in interpretation between radiologists and software require further investigation. KEY POINTS: • <b>Agreement</b> <b>between</b> qualitative and software density measurements has not been frequently studied. • There was substantial <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> different radiologists´ qualitative density assessments. • There was moderate <b>agreement</b> <b>between</b> software and radiologists' density assessments. • Differences in interpretation between software and radiologists require further investigation...|$|R
