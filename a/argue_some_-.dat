40|$|The recent {{progress}} {{in our understanding}} of heavy-flavour decays allows us to define more reliably which future measurements on charm decays are needed to further advance our understanding of QCD and to get our theoretical tools ready for treating beauty decays. After sketching the theoretical landscape I list those required measurements. I <b>argue</b> that <b>some</b> <b>–</b> in particular those concerning inclusive semileptonic charm decays and their lepton spectra – can presumably be performed only at a tau-charm factory. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper defines what {{constitutes}} the Observed World in the Quantum Mechanical framework, based strictly on what is actually observed beyond doubt, instead of building observables on what is inferred from actual observations. Such principle narrows down considerably what {{can be considered as}} being part of the Observed World. On the other hand, we <b>argue</b> that <b>some</b> information <b>-</b> that is in general assumed as granted - should actually be considered as being part of the Observed World. We discuss the implications of such assertion, in the way we perceive time evolution, information growth and causality. Comment: 3 pages, no figur...|$|R
5000|$|The {{time value}} of money — {{the idea that}} there is greater benefit in {{receiving}} money now rather than later, so that savers/investors/lenders should be compensated for delayed gratification — has been called one of the [...] "most significant" [...] arguments in favor of charging interest on loans. [...] As such, some Islamic finance supporters have opposed the concept, <b>arguing</b> that <b>some</b> consumption <b>—</b> such as eating — can only be done over time, and discounting for time encourages negative outcomes such as unsustainable production like desertification, since the desertification comes in the discounted future. However, since Islamic banking also calls for rewarding delayed gratification in the form of [...] "return on investment" [...] on both profit-sharing and credit sales, Islamic scholars and economists have tended to insist that time value of money is a valid concept [...] "provided the rate of discount is the `rate of return` on capital rather than the rate of interest," [...] a position critics find specious.|$|R

In arguing our case, the paper draws on survey and other data derived from second-language immersion programmes in two Queensland secondary schools, where key learning areas such as mathematics and science are taught through the medium of another language. As a corollary, we also <b>argue</b> that <b>some</b> schools <b>-</b> in our case, government schools - are using their immersion programmes as markers of distinction in a period of post-comprehensive schooling and emerging school markets, which includes both government and non-government schools. There is also a global policy context to such programmes in respect of countries such as Spain, China and Germany supporting the teaching of their respective languages in nations around the world...|$|R
