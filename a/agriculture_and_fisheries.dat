From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, <b>agriculture</b> <b>and</b> <b>fisheries</b> have the most important impacts. Meanwhile, from a final consumption perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, food and energy-using products cause the majority of life-cycle impacts of consumption.|$|E

Roughly $14million {{was spent on}} housing and infrastructure reconstruction and repair; {{this portion of the}} project consisted of reconstruction of homes, schools, businesses, hospitals, irrigation and the water system. Another $1.1million was used to inform and protect residents against post-storm diseases. The largest part of the effort involved jump-starting <b>agriculture</b> <b>and</b> <b>fisheries.</b> Roughly $50.4million was provided to reconstruct fishing vessels, purchase new tools and gear. By mid-February 1999, the Governments of Italy, Germany, Canada and the European Union provided $1million, $714,000, $50,000, and $510,200 in funds respectively. The Government of Israel also supplied agricultural tools. The Government of Norway provided $29,100 in water-borne disease prevention funds.

5|$|On October5, a {{national}} disaster was declared for Jamaica {{due to the}} effects of Nicole. In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of <b>Agriculture</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fisheries</b> to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with prophylactic medication and vitamins to avert foot rot disease in small ruminants, including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, which at the time comprised J$50million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and plantain farmers.|$|E
5|$|Passing over Okinawa with {{a central}} {{pressure}} of 910mbar (hPa; 26.87inHg), Bolaven {{became one of the}} most intense typhoons to ever strike the region. Off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture, swells from the typhoon battered fishing vessels and knocked the captain of one ship overboard. Although a rescue helicopter was quick to reach him, he was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Just off the coast of Jogashima Misaki-cho in Miura, Kanagawa, two boys were swept away by large swells. A mother attempted to swim after them to save them but later drowned. The two boys were later rescued with minor injuries by the Coast Guard. Although the storm did not strike the Japanese mainland, its outer bands brought showers and thunderstorms to parts of Kyushu. Due to the rains, rail service in Saga Prefecture was temporarily suspended, affecting 4,200 passengers. In Isahaya, one person was injured after being struck by a billboard downed by high winds. Throughout Japan, losses to <b>agriculture</b> <b>and</b> <b>fisheries</b> amounted to ¥423.28million (US$5.39million).|$|E

The government aims to expand food production to reduce imports and generate foreign exchange.

25|$|The North Sea cod {{stock is}} {{primarily}} fished by European Union member states and Norway. In 1999 the catch was divided among Denmark (31%), Scotland (25%), {{the rest of}} the United Kingdom (12%), the Netherlands (10%), Belgium, Germany and Norway (17%). In the 1970s, the annual catch rose to between 200,000 - 300,000 tons. Due to concerns about overfishing, catch quotas were repeatedly reduced in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2003, ICES stated that there is a high risk of stock collapse if current exploitation levels continue, and recommended a moratorium on catching Atlantic cod in the North Sea during 2004.

Other major goals were to increase production in <b>agriculture</b> <b>and</b> <b>fisheries</b> to make the country self-sufficient in food, and to develop energy, industry, and tourism to enable Morocco to lessen its dependence on foreign loans. The plan called for significant expansion of irrigated land, for increased public works projects such as hospitals and schools, and for economic decentralization and regional development {{through the construction of}} 25 new industrial parks outside the crowded Casablanca-Kénitra coastal area. Large industrial projects included phosphoric acid plants, sugar refineries, mines to exploit cobalt, coal, silver, lead, and copper deposits, and oil-shale development.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, the Arms Crisis and {{subsequent}} trial engulfed {{the state in}} a political scandal in which Irish Army intelligence officer Captain James Kelly was implicated in an unauthorised covert operation {{with the knowledge of}} Minister for Finance Charles Haughey and Minister for <b>Agriculture</b> <b>and</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Neil Blaney whereby £50,000 of a secret Irish government humanitarian fund of £100,000 (which had been set-up to help refugees fleeing Northern Ireland) was diverted and used to illegally import and smuggle arms and ammunitions for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). The Garda Special Branch became aware of the unsanctioned operation and informed Minister for Justice Micheál Ó Móráin and Taoiseach Lynch, who were slow to take action. Sensing this inaction, the Special Branch leaked the information to the press and the leader of the opposition Fine Gael leader Liam Cosgrave, who put pressure on Lynch to act. This resulted in Ministers Haughey (who later became Taoiseach) and Blaney being sacked from their posts, Captain Kelly was forced to resign, and the subsequent trial of all three in which the case collapsed and they were cleared of charges.|$|E
