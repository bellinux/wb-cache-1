The committee ruled that a new mascot be named as the institution's <b>athletic</b> <b>identity.</b> Therefore, in the following year the college held open forums in which students, alumni, and faculty were asked to submit ideas for the new identity, vote on suggestions, and gauge popularity.

50|$|When {{assessing}} {{an athlete}} it is beneficial {{to understand how}} one describe {{his or her life}} since it can determine how mentally healthy he or she is. If there is a strong <b>athletic</b> <b>identity,</b> like the performance narrative, sometimes severe psychological problems can form when the athlete is in a slump or injured. Observing an athlete's narrative can help one shift his or her attention away from only the performance narrative but combine it with others. One can reach the elite level of athletes without only focusing on the performance script. Some actually attempt to follow the script but it does not help them succeed due to the clash of the cultural norm and what is desired by the athlete.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} transitioning, first-year student-athletes engage in educationally sound activities in college. The sample included 147 revenue and nonrevenue first-year student-athletes who were surveyed at four large Division 1 -A universities. Findings revealed that revenue and nonrevenue first-year student athletes differed regarding their academic and <b>athletic</b> <b>identities.</b> Transitioning revenue student-athletes rated themselves as having slightly higher <b>athletic</b> <b>identities,</b> yet lower academic identities compared to their nonrevenue counterparts. The findings from this study also indicated that the kinds of effective educational practices that first-year student-athletes engage in have a positive influence on their academic self-concept. These findings have implications for head coaches and student affairs leaders, particularly academic counselors and advisors who are working with this special population of students. Transitioning from high school to college can be refreshing for some students and a daunting task for others. Many students are able to adjust an...|$|R
40|$|The thesis uses an {{interdisciplinary}} and intersectional feminist cultural studies methodology {{to examine the}} disability sport movement {{and its relationship to}} the athletic ideal. Chapter One links queer and affect theories with crip theory to frame disability sport???s desire for legitimacy. Chapter Two analyzes the transnational politics of high performance athleticism and fair play sportsmanship among the Olympics, Paralympics, and Special Olympics in order to bring attention to sport as a site of biopower and regulation. Chapters Two and Three interrogate crip nationalism and its production of the supercrip figure. Chapter Three looks at the documentary film Murderball alongside Mark Zupan???s memoir Gimp to examine masculinity and wheelchair rugby.

In a survey consisting of previous student athletes, athletic performance and effort was attributed to helping the development of major life skills, especially in the work force.

50|$|Sport {{involvement}} can initiate {{both physical}} and mental demands on athletes. From youth little leagues to competing at a professional level, athletes are forced to learn ways to cope with stressors and frustrations that can arise from competition against others. Conducted research shows that levels of anxiety, stress, and depression are elevated following sports injuries. The pressure athletes experience is extensive; branching from coaches, parents, peers, and audiences. It is astonishing how one individual can endure so much pressure and remain so calm and collected. Positive mental motivation however is not experienced all the time. The pressure to win can cause significant emotional stress for an athlete. Many athletes experience the stressor involving winning as being {{the most important aspect}} of the match. If the match is not won, many athletes are punished and criticized for the loss, instead of being commended on their effort, sportsmanship, and hard work. After an occurrence of an injury many athletes display self-esteem issues, <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> crises, and high levels of post-traumatic distress, which are linked to avoidant coping skills.|$|E
40|$|Framed by the {{perspectives}} of symbolic interactionism and feminist theory, my dissertation examines kids 2 ̆ 7 constructions of gender and <b>athletic</b> <b>identities</b> in a youth recreational basketball league. This project involved participant observation of two boys 2 ̆ 7 and two girls 2 ̆ 7 teams, grades fourth through eighth, {{over the course of}} a basketball season, as well as semi-structured interviews with individual players. A fundamental premise in my research is that children are agentic actors, constructing identities and making sense of situations in what can be complex, if not contradictory, environments. I examine the micro-level interactions of kids within the macro-context of institutional structures and cultural imagery, capturing the essence of both agency and constraint that shape the process of gender. ^ Specific questions emerged as significant and were used to frame the chapters of this dissertation. What types of gender ideals did kids confront in their everyday lives, and how well did these ideals fit with their participation in basketball? What happened when peers challenged kids 2 ̆ 7 presentations of gendered and athletic selves? How did kids go about constructing gender differences, and what impact did these difference have on status and gender relations? What were the rewards and potential costs of kids 2 ̆ 7 continued preference to play on gender-segregated teams? Was the league moving towards the more inclusive, egalitarian environment, or were players simply engaged in a more complicated, round-about construction of the same types of gender asymmetries? ^ Within the league, gender was quite salient and intimately linked with the production of <b>athletic</b> <b>identities</b> and status. Ideals of gender equality, which reflected the dominate egalitarian discourse of the community, confronted kids 2 ̆ 7 lived experiences of inequality, leading to an ongoing and unresolved tension between the two. Despite evidence of ideals of gender equality, a growing presence of girls in the league, and behavioral challenges to stereotypical ideas about girls and boys, a gender hierarchy that positions some boys in a superior position to other boys and all girls remained entrenched in the basketball league. In “doing gender” (West and Zimmerman, 1987), gender differences were actively constructed and served as the basis for the distribution of reward and status. ...|$|R

40|$|Sport is {{perceived}} {{to be one of the}} last fortresses of heteronormative and homonegative attitudes that cause psychological and social issues for LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) athletes, especially in their self-confidence and self-concept. Furthermore, these negative mindsets challenge LGBT individuals' participation in organized sport and physical activity. To offer effective consulting services, it is vital for sport psychologists to be aware of the issues that LGBT athletes might struggle with throughout their sport careers. Adopting 'queer theory' as a theoretical framework, this study strives to understand a gay male athlete's experiences in sport and physical activity in Finland, and how these experiences reflects in his sexual identity development and management, and relationships to others in sport. Autoethnography, an 'autobiographical genre of writing', and narrative analysis was utilized in this study as it enables the reader to vicariously share author's own experiences in sport and physical activity. Self-observational and self-reflective data was gathered from author's exercise and personal memory logs. Findings are presented in the form of narrative, which is constructed based on the data produced by the author. The story reveals the challenge of sexual identity development in- and outside of sport, and the constant negotiation between social and <b>athletic</b> <b>identities.</b> Interpretations of the findings are discussed with relevant theories of sexual identity development and previous LGBT research in sport. This study shows albeit there are general positive change of attitudes towards LGBT people in Finland, homosexual athletes can still have various difficulties in developing and expressing their sexual identity in organized sport and physical activity. Queer practice has a potential to confront the unequal and oppressive heteronormative constructs in sport and physical activity domains. However, more studies and stories are needed to understand the experiences of LGBT people in sport to develop programs and interventions aimed at increasing athletes' and sport practitioners' openness to LGBT athletes...|$|R

30|$|Findings {{from the}} present {{research}} may {{be of interest to}} professionals who work in the body image area (e.g., counselors/therapists, sports psychologists, nutritionists). Given the popularity of CrossFit, these professionals may benefit from an increased understanding of some of the various and complex ways that participating in the CrossFit may shape women’s embodied experiences and practices; such an understanding could inform their work with female CrossFitters who seek their services. In a similar vein, from an academic perspective, findings {{from the present}} work could be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate curricula in disciplines such as apparel and merchandising, gender studies, health and exercise science, nutrition, psychology, and sociology, among others. Students in these disciplines may find themselves in a position to engage with or to serve women who participate in CrossFit and who are seeking support in relation to body image or culturally gendered expectations of behavior. For instance, from a managerial perspective, being aware {{of the ways in which}} participation in CrossFit can support—as well as possibly undermine—women’s body images and identities can help apparel designers to create CrossFit apparel that reinforces women’s self-esteem and that builds their identities in positive ways. Functional and comfortable designs might be developed and marketed to appeal to women’s <b>athletic</b> <b>identities.</b> Additionally, designers may wish to consider developing CrossFit apparel that could be worn in various ways in different contexts, affording women varying degrees of body exposure depending upon their comfort level. Findings also suggest managerial implications for CrossFit box owners and coaches, who could use results from this work to inform the development of CrossFit environments that would likely foster more positive body experiences. For example, findings highlight the value of creating CrossFit spaces that support women’s subversion of gendered expectations for fitness, that are safe and supportive, and that are not experienced as obliging participants to conform to specified behavioral or body norms. Given that some women described feeling “exposed” in the context of co-ed classes, CrossFit box owners/coaches may wish to consider offering selected classes for women, only. To address some of the body image concerns that may arise among female CrossFit participants, box owners also may be advised to add body image professionals to their staffs and/or to offer educational body image programming for their female participants.|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy at the University of LutonSince {{the late nineteenth century}} boxing in England has been socially organised into two ideologically distinctive versions - amateur and professional boxing – that to this day are practiced in spatially segregated social universes. Nonetheless, both amateur and professional boxing-practitioners understandings and lived experiences in and through boxing are necessarily grounded in the wider social and cultural contexts through which they interpret meaning and construct worldviews and identity. Thus despite the institutional, ideological and spatial boundaries demarcating either code, on a rather more subtle yet incredibly powerful cultural level, amateur and professional boxing are both symbolically and practically deeply intertwined. Over a five year period, I conducted ‘insider’ ethnographic research among distinct cohorts of amateur and professional boxers based in Luton and London to investigate the lived experiences and socially constructed worldviews, values and identities developed by practitioners immersed in either code. The overriding aim of this research was to critically evaluate the limits and possibilities of boxing-practitioners association with and development through ‘boxing’ henceforth. The findings of this ethnography reveal that it was common for the amateur and professional boxing-practitioners studied to cultivate empowering identities through intersubjective and socially validating instances of purposefulness, expressivity, creativity, fellowship and aspiration. These lived dimensions were grounded in sensuous, symbolic and emotional attachments respective to the social organization defining the social practice of either code of boxing. Equally, the research reveals that under the veneer of collective passion for and consequent fellowship experienced through boxing, an undercurrent yet ever-present sense of dubiety, tension and intra-personal conflict was in evidence among both the amateur and professional boxing-practitioners studied. It is suggested, therefore, that as a consequence of an array of both micro and macro post-industrial societal reconfigurations defining the structural principles of amateurism and professionalism in the practice of ‘boxing’, contemporary boxers are increasingly predisposed to developing <b>athletic</b> <b>identities</b> predisposed towards patterns of meaning production “…dominated by market-mediated consumer choice and the power of individualism” (Jarvie 2006 p. 327). Thus through complex, historically dynamic and seemingly paradoxical social processes of cultural (re) production and transformation - dialectically fusing individualistic aspirations geared towards self-interested gain, acts of group and subcultural fellowship and social resistance to measures of institutionalised control - it is argued that the role of boxing as an agent for humanistic personal and social development in the contemporary late-modern era of structural reconfiguration is progressively rendered impotent...|$|R

40|$|All {{elite athletes}} must, at some point, {{disengage}} (i. e. retire/terminate participation) from competitive sports. Regardless of competition level (high school, collegiate or professional), career termination in athletics can {{be due to}} a number of circumstances. In most cases, sport retirement is a gradual process, rather than an impulsive decision (Coakley, 2004; Koukouris, 1994). Webb, Nasco, Riley & Headrick (1998) categorized career termination into freely chosen retirements and forced career termination. The majority of past and current athlete career termination research has focused on various reasons for career termination, athlete adjustment, and the repercussions of career termination (Ball, 1976; Haerle, 1975; Hallinan & Snyder, 1988; Hill & Lowe, 1974; Lerch, 1984; Blinde & Stratta, 1992). Often, <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> is strongly connected with career termination. <b>Athletic</b> <b>identity</b> has been defined as "the degree to which an individual identifies with the athlete role" (Brewer et al., 1993, 237). <b>Athletic</b> <b>identity,</b> like any other identity (i. e. child, parent, friend, student, etc.), is formed in early childhood and progresses throughout the life span (Harter, 1990; Weiss, 1992; Baillee & Danish, 1992). In the past, <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> has been viewed as one single entity. However, more recent research has revealed two distinct dimensions of athletic identity: public (social) and private (self) (Webb et al., 1998). For instance, public or social <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> is the athlete's reputation (e. g. "Most people know me as an athlete"), whereas private or self refers to the more internalized, personal aspect of <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> (e. g. "Being an athlete {{is an important part of}} who I am"). Furthermore, although <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> research has evolved in recent years (i. e. the emergence of the public/private dimensions), a great deal of the literature remains focused on the ways in which <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> affects individuals at differing participation levels (Harter, 1990; Baillee & Danish, 1992; Weiss, 1992; Nasco & Webb, 2006). At present, there is very little research linking athlete career termination to <b>athletic</b> <b>identity.</b> Although recent research has addressed both career termination and <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> (Grove, Lavallee, & Gordon, 1997; Webb et a 1., 1998; Brewer, Van Raalte, & Petitpas, 2000), effects of career termination on <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> as well as effects of <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> on career termination have not yet been assessed. A synthesis of career termination and <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> literature is much needed. This comprehensive review of literature will potentially provide valuable information concerning the elements associated with both athlete career termination and <b>athletic</b> <b>identity.</b> School of Physical Education, Sport, and Exercise ScienceThesis (M.

Cherokee culture, psychoSocial <b>identity,</b> and <b>athletic</b> competition were the three major selective codes discovered in this study. Qualitative analyses revealed that participants have lived in an environment that is conducive for athletic growth, cultural awareness, and Social exploration. The family, schools, and communities offer simple, yet stable surroundings. <b>Athletic</b> and Social <b>identities</b> are formed at early ages and are fostered by the close knit Cherokee culture...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigated}} {{the development of}} body satisfaction among women rugby players, cricketers, and netballers. I also sought {{to assess the impact}} of sport participation on both <b>athletic</b> and “feminine” <b>identity.</b> Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 rugby players, 10 cricketers, and 10 netballers. The interviews focused on the experience of playing sport and the impact sport had made on respondents’ perceptions of their bodies. Using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to explore the interview data it was found that, although sport participation did lead to positive perceptions of their bodies, this effect was transient. Once placed in a social environment body satisfaction decreased, and women’s perceptions of their bodies changed because of a perceived demand to conform to socially accepted and expected norms of (heterosexual) physical attractiveness. Fear of being perceived as lesbian and the perceived naturalness of body concern were also identified...|$|R
40|$|Through a phenomenologically-inspired approach, {{we explore}} {{some of the}} {{different}} ways in which sportspeople experience asthma and adopt various ‘asthma identities’ in sport. Here, we focus upon the centrality of the ‘visceral’ body in asthmatic being-in-the-world. The bodily disruptions associated with asthma are likely to heighten awareness of the body-self and contingency, and may ‘amplify’ the ways in which sportspeople listen to their own embodied selves when engaged in sporting action. This may lead to a re-ordering/re-negotiation of <b>athletic</b> and asthma <b>identities</b> through ‘emotion work’ and ‘somatic work’. Drawing upon interview data from non-elite sportspeople (n = 14), all of whom had been diagnosed with asthma, ranging in degree of severity, we employ a narrative approach to explore asthma embodiment in sport via a tripartite typology; Conformers, Contesters, Creators. This form of typology may be useful as a framework to assist both health care and sporting professionals in developing more appropriate and effective rehabilitation regimes for sportspeople, in order {{to improve the quality of}} treatment and outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{order for}} coaches and sport {{psychologist}} help athletes {{to improve their}} <b>athletic</b> <b>identity,</b> {{they need to be}} aware of athletes’ <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> with different sporting background. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine different levels of <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> among different types of sports and also more specifically, between team and individual sports. Methodology: A sample of 107 athletes (57 women and 50 men) who were members of national teams in taekwondo, karate, wushu, basketball, volleyball, and canoe polo were selected. <b>Athletic</b> <b>identity</b> questionnaire was used. To identify <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> and its four sub categories differences among six groups and also between team and individual sports One way Manova and independent T-test were used respectively. Results: The findings showed that different sports influence <b>athletic</b> <b>identity.</b> F (2, 350) = 5. 41, p < 0. 005. The highest <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> was observed within taekwondo athletes. The second and third highest were in karate and wushu athletes, followed by basketball, volleyball, and canoe polo. Canoe polo was the only team that had significant differences in total <b>athletic</b> <b>identity,</b> and three sub categories: self-identity, social identity, and exclusively compared to other sports. While karate athletes had the highest exclusively, taekwondo athletes had the highest score on self-identity, social identity, and negative affectivity. There was no significant difference on negative affectivity among all six groups, indicating that facing up to a fail or physical injury is very difficult for all athletes. Conclusion: The findings suggest coaches and sport psychologists should take these different identity levels and the reasons causing them into account when they work with different athletes within different sports.

40|$|Sport {{motivation}} {{plays an}} integral role in sport participation. Research has revealed possible differences in competitive versus recreational athlete 2 ̆ 7 s motivational factors, with competitive athletes possessing less intrinsic motivation {{as compared to}} recreational athletes (Michelle, Vallerand, Briere, 2 ̆ 6 Provencher 1995). <b>Athletic</b> <b>identity</b> is a personality construct that considers an athlete 2 ̆ 7 s identification of his/her role as an athlete. <b>Athletic</b> <b>identity</b> describes {{the extent to which}} an individual sees themselves as an athlete as opposed to someone who plays a sport. <b>Athletic</b> <b>identity</b> is associated with self-motivation and competitiveness (Tusak, Faganel, and Bednarik, 2005). There has been minimal research examining the relationship between an athlete 2 ̆ 7 s identity and sport motivation variables. Finding a relationship of an athlete 2 ̆ 7 s identity and motivational factors will enhance coaches’ and sport psychologists’ ability to enhance an athlete 2 ̆ 7 s performance by utilizing motivational techniques according to his/her <b>athletic</b> <b>identity.</b> Participants consisted of 508 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division-II student athletes at a university in the Southeastern United States, ranging in ages from 18 to 29 years-old. Participants completed the Sport Motivation Scale and the <b>Athletic</b> <b>Identity</b> Measurement Scale. Pearson Product Correlations will be conducted to analyze the subscales of the AIMS with the subscales of the SMS. It is predicted that athletes with higher <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> will be more intrinsically motivated than athletes with lower <b>athletic</b> <b>identity.</b> In contrast, athletes with lower <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> are predicted to be more extrinsically motivated.

40|$|International Journal of Exercise Science 10 (6) : 915 - 925, 2017. This study {{examines}} {{the correlation between}} <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> and academic major selection among intercollegiate student-athletes. A thorough review of literature focusing on academic clustering, <b>athletic</b> <b>identity,</b> and academic development leads {{to the development of}} two hypotheses – 1) student-athletes with stronger <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> will have a declared major of decreased academic rigor; and 2) student-athletes with stronger <b>athletic</b> <b>identity</b> {{will be more likely to}} be undecided on their major. Data were collected through a survey administered to Division I, II, and III student-athletes recording academic major and their <b>Athletic</b> <b>Identity</b> Measurement Scale (AIMS). After analyzing the student responses, Hypothesis I is supported, while Hypothesis II is met with some limitation that leads to a lack of statistical significance. Overall, this study sheds light on a connection between academic choice and athletic identit...|$|E
40|$|Objectives This study explores gendered {{experiences}} of the mastery stage in endurance runners' athletic careers in terms of (a) key themes in this period of life, (b) retirement decision-making and (c) changes in <b>athletic</b> and runner <b>identities.</b> Design and method Ten male and nine female athletes aged between 25 and 62 participated in individual interviews. The data were analyzed via thematic narrative analysis. Results and conclusion Gendered meanings permeate career decision-making and retirement patterns of Finnish runners. Female athletes reported many difficulties, including health problems, loneliness, societal pressure and lack of social support during {{the final years of}} their careers. These aspects were important reasons for them to start considering retirement from sport. Male athletes reported less social pressure and suggested that friendship in sport was a major reason for postponing retirement. Male athletes expressed more interest for coaching others, wherein women perceived themselves as incompetent and/or lacked time and interest for it. Running remained important for the majority of athletes after retirement and they anticipated or had continued regular running post-retirement...|$|R
40|$|Women {{in sports}} have {{historically}} been marginalised. Feminist studies have revealed a struggle to balance <b>athletic</b> and feminine <b>identities</b> in “conventionally masculine” sports. However, {{there is a need}} to explore women's experiences in a variety of sports. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to explore the experiences of three highly skilled Finnish female athletes of Japanese kendo in order to better understand personal and social meanings of gender and sport. Participants were asked to write a personal story based on a prompt statement “A woman in kendo” and comment on other participant's stories. The data was then interpreted and the following broad themes emerged: personal, socio-cultural, gender and sports framework. The findings reveal that personal motivations to practice kendo are related with the process of personal development and learning skills that can be transferred into other areas of life; perceptions of gender construction and gender differences vary among the participants; kendo sports framework is seen as facilitating non-gendered interactions through promotion of equality and respect; differences between Finnish and Japanese socio-cultural contexts become evident as participants discuss gendered cultural encounters. The findings can be relevant to those committed to creating bias-free sporting environment, assuring equal access and increasing participation in sports...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{depression}} during {{the career of}} elite male athletes {{has been the subject}} of much public interest and attention in recent years. Despite numerous debates and personal disclosures within the media, there is a dearth of published research directly exploring the phenomenon. This study sought to explore how elite male athletes experience depression during their sporting careers. Eight former/current elite male athletes who had previously publically self-identified as having experienced depression while participating in sport were recruited for this study. A qualitative methodology was employed and each participant was interviewed using semi-structured interviews. Data analysis which was conducted using descriptive and interpretive thematic analysis uncovered three domains: (1) The emergence of depression, (2) The manifestation of symptoms of depression, and (3) Adaptive and Maladaptive proceesses of recovery. Findings from the current study reveal the nature of how male athletes experience, express, and respond to depression during their careers. Additionally, this is influenced by a myriad of factors embedded in the masculine elite sport environment. Implications are discussed particularly in relation to atypical expressions of depression not necessarily reflected on or in standard diagnostic criteria. Future research is encouraged to examine in depth moderating factors (e. g., <b>athletic</b> sense of <b>identity</b> and masculine elite sport environments) for the relationship between depression and participation in elite sport...|$|R
