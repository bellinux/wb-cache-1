5|$|During an altercation on {{a crowded}} subway platform, John Lange (Vincent D'Onofrio) falls against a moving train and is pinned at waist level between a subway car and {{the edge of the}} platform. Detectives Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) arrive to {{investigate}} and are told the man's spinal cord is severed. Although Lange is not feeling much pain, emergency personnel tell the detectives he has less than an hour to live and will die as soon as he is moved. Bayliss questions Larry Biedron (Bruce MacVittie), who was involved with the altercation that led to Lange's fall. Biedron says he was bumped from behind with Lange, but witnesses give conflicting reports: Some say that Biedron pushed Lange, some that Lange pushed Biedron, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> that it was an accident. Pembleton tries to talk to Lange, who becomes uncooperative and angry when told he will die.|$|E

25|$|Rudi Dornbusch (1998) <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> {{that income}} rises {{can change the}} ratio of demand for goods and {{services}} (tradable and non-tradable sectors). This is because services tend to be superior goods, which are consumed proportionately more heavily at higher incomes.|$|E
25|$|Also, it {{is alleged}} that The Trump Organization {{has a history}} of not paying for {{services}} rendered.

25|$|Common {{manifestations of}} sensory issues include {{numbness}} or painful sensations {{in the arms}} and legs, abnormal sensations like “pins and needles,” and heat intolerance. Pain experienced by individuals depends on {{the severity of the}} polyneuropathy. It may be dull and constant in some individuals while being sharp and lancinating in others. In many subjects, tenderness is seen upon the palpitation of muscles in the feet and legs. Certain people may also feel cramping sensations in the muscles affected <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> there is a burning sensation in their feet and calves.|$|E

25|$|Stout was {{probably}} born in Little Creek Hundred, Kent County, Delaware, son of Jacob Emanuel Stout {{and his second}} wife Mary Griffin Stout. His ancestors came to Kent County from New Jersey in the 17th century. Like many in the area, {{his father was a}} reluctant revolutionary in 1776, but later served six years in the Delaware General Assembly. Jacob Stout married Angelica Killen in 1795 and had four children, Mary, William, Henry, Sarah Ann, and William Jacob. The exact location of their home is debated. Some say it was north of Leipsic <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> it was west of it, on the Cheswold Road. It was nearby in any case, as {{he was one of the}} founders of Leipsic.

2500|$|Rav Judah {{asked in}} the name of Rav why Joseph {{referred}} to himself as [...] "bones" [...] during his lifetime (in [...] ), and explained that it was because he did not protect his father's honor when in [...] his brothers called Jacob [...] "your servant our father" [...] and Joseph failed to protest.

2500|$|Images of Venus {{have been}} found in {{domestic}} murals, mosaics and household shrines (lararia). Petronius, in his Satyricon, places an image of Venus among the Lares (household gods) of the freedman Trimalchio's lararium. Prospective brides offered Venus a gift [...] "before the wedding"; the nature of the gift, and its timing, are unknown. Some Roman sources say that girls who come of age offer their toys to Venus; it is unclear where the offering is made, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> this gift is to the Lares. In dice-games, a popular pastime among Romans of all classes, the luckiest, best possible roll was known as [...] "Venus".|$|E
2500|$|Vagulāns {{decreed that}} it as of July 3, 1941, {{it would be}} illegal to sell {{anything}} to Jews, that the employment of all Jews was terminated, and those who lived in designated {{areas of the city}} were to vacate their residences by 18:00 hours on July 5, 1941.

2500|$|If the Hague Conventions is {{admitted}} as applicable, {{the critical question}} becomes whether the bombed cities met the definition of [...] "undefended". Some observers consider Hiroshima and Nagasaki undefended, some say that both cities were legitimate military targets, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> that Hiroshima {{could be considered a}} legitimate military target while Nagasaki was comparatively undefended. Hiroshima has been argued as not a legitimate target because the major industrial plants were just outside the target area. It has also been argued as a legitimate target because Hiroshima was the headquarters of the regional Second General Army and Fifth Division with 40,000 combatants stationed in the city. Both cities were protected by anti-aircraft guns, which is an argument against the definition of [...] "undefended".|$|E
2500|$|Another Muslim scholar, Ghulam Muhiuddin Bute Shah, {{wrote his}} Tarikh-i-Punjab in 1842, {{over a century}} and half {{after the death of}} Guru Tegh Bahadur, saying that there was ongoing hostility from Ram Rai, the elder brother of Guru Har Kishan, against Tegh Bahadur. Ghulam Muhiuddin Bute Shah said that [...] "Ram Rai {{represented}} to the Emperor that Guru Tegh Bahadur was very proud of his spiritual greatness and that he would not realise his fault unless he was punished. Ram Rai also suggested that Guru Tegh Bahadur be asked to appear before the Emperor to work a miracle; if he failed, he could be put to death." [...] Satish Chandra <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> that this account is also doubtful as to the circumstances or cause of Guru Tegh Bahadur's execution.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the TM {{technique}} received [...] "major publicity" [...] through its associations with The Beatles, and by identifying itself with {{various aspects of}} modern day counterculture. However, Goldberg <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> that during {{the first decade of}} the TM organization, the Maharishi's main students in the West were not rock stars and their fans, but ordinary, middle-aged citizens. In the late 60's, young people coming to learn TM at the center in London, England, were surprised [...] "to be greeted not by fellow hippies but by the proper, middle-aged men and women who were Maharishi's earliest followers." [...] Another author notes that, [...] "By the time the Beatles first met the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London in 1966, Mahesh had already made seven trips around the globe, established 38 centres, and amassed more than 100,000 followers." ...|$|E

5000|$|As a grim {{reminder}} of those times, {{there is even}} a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for [...] "when the knife is at the throat", for those dying [...] "to sanctify God's Name".

2500|$|Rabbi Aha said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Samuel ben Nahman (or others say Rabbi Alexandri's name) in Rabbi Nathan's name that Abraham knew (and observed) even the laws of the {{courtyard}} eruv.

[...] Rabbi Berekiah, Rabbi Hiyya, and the Rabbis of Babylonia taught in Rabbi Judah's name that a day does not pass in which God does not teach a new law in the heavenly Court.

[...] And meditation refers to nothing but Torah, as [...] says, [...] "You shall meditate therein day and night." [...] And Abraham knew them all.|$|E
2500|$|Indian astrologers {{were aware}} of axial {{precession}} since before the Common Era. Although many of the astronomical texts stored in Taxila were burnt during Muslim invasion of India, the classic astronomical text Suryasiddhanta survived and contains references about ayana movements. In a later commentary on Suryasiddhanta around twelfth century, Bhāskara II says: [...] "sampāt revolves negatively 30000 times in a Kalpa of 4320 million years according to Suryasiddhanta, while Munjāla <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> ayana moves forward 199669 in a Kalpa, and one should combine the two, before ascertaining declension, ascensional difference, etc." [...] Lancelot Wilkinson translated the last of these three verses in a too concise manner to convey the full meaning, and skipped the portion combine the two which the modern Hindu commentary has brought to the fore. According to the Hindu commentary, the final value of period of precession should be obtained by combining +199669 revolutions of ayana with −30000 revolutions of sampaat, to get +169669 per Kalpa, i.e. one revolution in 25461 years, which is near the modern value of 25771 years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{geologic}} {{column and}} {{the fossil record}} are used as major pieces of evidence in the modern scientific explanation of the development and evolution of life on Earth {{as well as a}} means to establish the age of the Earth. Young Earth Creationists such as Morris and Whitcomb in their 1961 book, The Genesis Flood, say that the age of the fossils depends on the amount of time credited to the geologic column, which they ascribe to be about one year. Some flood geologists dispute geology's assembled global geologic column since index fossils are used to link geographically isolated strata to other strata across the map. [...] Fossils are often dated by their proximity to strata containing index fossils whose age has been determined by its location on the geologic column. Oard <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> that the identification of fossils as index fossils has been too error-prone for index fossils to be used reliably to make those correlations, or to date local strata using the assembled geologic scale.|$|E
