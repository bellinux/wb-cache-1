5|$|Aside from {{overseeing}} the new clergy, Soegijapranata {{continued to work}} towards Catholic education and prosperity, similar to his pre-war work. He emphasised that students must not only be good Catholics, but <b>also</b> <b>good</b> Indonesians. The Church began further development of its schools, ranging from elementary schools to universities. Soegijapranata also began reforming the Church in his apostolic vicariate, making it more Indonesian. He advocated the use of local languages and Indonesian during mass, allowing it throughout his diocese beginning in 1956. In addition, he pressed {{for the use of}} gamelan music to accompany services, and agreed to the use of wayang shows to teach the Bible to children.|$|E
5|$|In the field, the AWS is less exuberant {{than the}} English Springer Spaniel, {{but it is}} as skilled in {{retrieval}} as Labrador or Golden Retriever. It is versatile regardless {{of the type of}} terrain, and in the water it is not the fastest swimmer but has a high level of endurance. The breed is <b>also</b> <b>good</b> at agility and flyball, with the first of the breed receiving a flyball championship title in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the mountainous}} and forested {{sections}} of the drainage basin lie protected under national forest lands. There are several campgrounds overseen by the U.S. Forest Service in {{the headwaters of the}} Potlatch River watershed. Fishing is <b>also</b> <b>good</b> in the Potlatch River and many of its tributaries. Anglers are only permitted to catch brook trout, cutthroat trout, and rainbow and steelhead trout. The Department of Fish and Game annually stocks fish in the river. Fishing is permitted on the Potlatch from its mouth upstream to where Moose Creek joins the river near Bovill, {{as well as on the}} East Fork.|$|E
5|$|Samarium-149 {{has high}} {{cross-section}} for neutron capture (41,000barns) {{and is therefore}} used in the control rods of nuclear reactors. Its advantage compared to competing materials, such as boron and cadmium, is stability of absorption – most of the fusion and decay products of samarium-149 are other isotopes of samarium that are <b>also</b> <b>good</b> neutron absorbers. For example, the cross section of samarium-151 is 15,000barns, {{it is on the}} order of hundreds of barns for 150Sm, 152Sm, and 153Sm, and is 6,800barns for natural (mixed-isotope) samarium. Among the decay products in a nuclear reactor, samarium-149 is regarded as the second most important for the reactor design and operation after xenon-135.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can reach up to Hero on the Good side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are <b>also</b> <b>Good</b> and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E

5|$|The Seventh and Eighth Armies Ottoman {{defenders}} were {{supplied by}} two railways which crisscrossed the battlefield. A railway ran from Haifa on the Mediterranean coast {{to join the}} main railway from Istanbul to Deraa, which crossed the Jordan River before passing Beisan to enter the Judean Hills at Jenin. There were <b>also</b> <b>good</b> roads from Haifa and Damascus, via Nazareth and Jenin. From Deraa the extensive railway network, branched into two lines. The southern line known as the Hejaz railway continued east of the Jordan River to supply the Ottoman Fourth Army headquarters at Amman, the garrisons at Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt and the forces scattered along several hundred miles of the southern Hejaz railway. The western line known as the Palestine Railways crossed the Jordan River at Jisr Mejamie to become the Jezreel Valley railway, as it ran southwards down {{the west bank of}} the Jordan River to Beisan, on the western edge of the Esdraelon Plain. From there it turned westward to run parallel to the front line in the Judean Hills, to Afulah. Here the railway branched again into two lines, one line running north–westerly to Haifa on the Mediterranean coast, while the main line turned south across the Esdraelon Plan to Jenin. From Jenin the railway wound through a narrow pass in the foothills to climb to Messudieh Junction in the Judean Hills where it again branched. One line continued south–eastward to Nablus the Seventh Army headquarters, located on the main road to Jenin, Nazareth and Damascus, while the second line ran westward to Tulkarm and the Eighth Army headquarters before turning south to reach railhead behind the Eighth Army' front line on the coastal plain.|$|E
