5|$|The season four premiere {{introduces}} {{several new}} interns, {{to be trained}} under Meredith, Yang, Karev, Stevens, and eventually O'Malley. Among them are Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul) who continues to make appearances, and Dr. Sadie Harris (Melissa George) who formed a friendship with Meredith while the two were in college. Harris is fired in the fifth season, due to not <b>actually</b> <b>having</b> a medical degree, and departs the show immediately after. Meredith and Shepherd's relationship reaches a toll, and the two separate, leading Shepherd to entertaining a relationship with Rose (Lauren Stamile), a nurse. Rose appears frequently until season five, when Derek and Meredith decide to rekindle their flame. Throughout the fifth season, Stevens experiences full-out hallucinations of Duquette, signaling that she is ill, and once she is lucid, he departs, marking his final appearance. Following the announcement of her relationship with Robbins, Callie's father Carlos Torres (Hector Elizondo) initially contests his daughter's concurrence in homosexuality, but eventually accepts it, and he reappears several times throughout the series.|$|E

As such, it has found application as a training guide for many competitive endeavors that do not involve actual combat.|$|E

The north bridge should link to Lee Boulevard, the commission said, and the south bridge should link to an approach from the south.|$|E
25|$|Leopold {{responded in}} 1891 by sending two {{expedition}}s, and Sharpe's view {{seemed to be}} borne out. The Paul Le Marinel expedition only managed to obtain a vaguely worded letter (the Le Marinel letter) from Msiri agreeing to Free State agents having a presence in Katanga, but nothing more. This expedition was hampered by an accident when the gunpowder it was bringing for Msiri blew up, killing several men and damaging {{some of the other}} gifts being brought to sweeten the deal. A Belgian officer from the expedition, Legat, stayed behind with a group of askaris at a boma on the Lufoi River about 40km from Bunkeya {{to keep an eye on}} Msiri. (Msiri later accused Legat of <b>actually</b> <b>having</b> kept the supplies lost in the explosion for himself).|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} giving celebrity status to architects is not new, but is {{contained}} within the general tendency, from the Renaissance onwards, to give status to artists. Until the modern era, artists in Western civilization were generally working under a patron - usually the Church or the rulers of the state - and their reputation could become commodified, such that their services could be bought by different patrons. One of the first records of celebrity status is artist-architect Giorgio Vasari's monograph Le Vite delle più eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori (in English, Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects), first published in 1550, recording the Renaissance (rinascita) {{at the time of}} its flourishment. Vasari, himself under the patronage of Grand Duke CosimoI de' Medici, even favoured architects from the city where he resided, Florence, attributing to them innovation, while barely mentioning other cities or places further away. The importance of Vasari's book was in the ability to consolidate reputation and status without people <b>actually</b> <b>having</b> to see the works described. The development of media has thus been equally of central importance to architectural celebrity as other walks of life.|$|E
500|$|On {{the editing}} of Death Proof, Tarantino stated [...] "There is half-an-hour's {{difference}} between my Death Proof {{and what is}} playing in Grindhouse. [...] I was like a brutish American exploitation distributor who cut the movie down {{almost to the point}} of incoherence. I cut it down to the bone and took all the fat off it to see if it could still exist, and it worked." [...] An extended, 127-minute version of Death Proof was screened in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 60th Cannes Film Festival. Tarantino is quoted as saying [...] "It works great as a double feature, but I'm just as excited if not more excited about <b>actually</b> <b>having</b> the world see Death Proof unfiltered. [...] It will be the first time everyone sees Death Proof by itself, including me." ...|$|E
500|$|The book Teen Spirit: The Stories Behind Every Nirvana Song {{describes}} [...] "Teen Spirit" [...] as [...] "a typically murky Cobain {{exploration of}} meaning and meaninglessness." [...] Azerrad plays upon the juxtaposition of Cobain's contradictory lyrics (such as [...] "It's fun to lose and to pretend") and states [...] "the point that emerges isn't just the conflict of two opposing ideas, but the confusion and anger that the conflict produces in the narrator—he's angry that he's confused." [...] Azerrad's conclusion is that the song is [...] "alternately a sarcastic reaction {{to the idea of}} <b>actually</b> <b>having</b> a revolution, yet it also embraces the idea." [...] In Heavier Than Heaven, Charles R. Cross' biography of Kurt Cobain, the author argues that the song is a reference to Cobain's relationship with ex-girlfriend Tobi Vail. Cross cites the line [...] "She's over-bored and self-assured" [...] and states the song [...] "could not have been about anyone else." [...] Cross backs up his argument with lyrics which were present in earlier drafts, such as [...] "Who will be the King & Queen of the outcasted [...] teens." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{key feature}} of the song {{is the use of}} stop time, or pauses in the music, {{during the first half of}} the progression. [...] This musical device is {{commonly}} heard in New Orleans jazz, when the instrumentation briefly stops, allowing for a short instrumental solo before resuming. However, Waters' and Dixon's use of stop time serves to heighten the tension through repetition, followed by a vocal rather than an instrument fill. [...] The accompanying riff, which Dixon described as a five-note figure, is similar to that of [...] "Mad Love". [...] He attributed it to the band and using such a phrase for eight bars was a new approach. [...] Although Palmer comments that the entire group phrases the riff in unison, Boone describes it as a [...] "heavy, unhurried counterpoint by all the instruments together". [...] Campbell identifies the opening as <b>actually</b> <b>having</b> [...] "two competing riffs" [...] or contrapuntal motion, with one played by Little Walter on an amplified harmonica and another by Waters on electric guitar.|$|E

[...] On March 16, 2016, the Russo stated the film was [...] "about {{a week and a half}} away from" [...] completion, with Joe adding that the film would have a post-credits scene, with the possibility for two or three total. The film was completed on April 4, 2016. Later in April, Alfre Woodard and Jim Rash were revealed to be cast in the film, while Feige explained that Black Panther director Ryan Coogler contributed some dialogue for Black Panther in several scenes during reshoots. At the film's premiere, it was revealed that Marisa Tomei appears in the film as May Parker, Peter Parker's aunt.|$|E
500|$|English fantasy author Neil Gaiman guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, helping Homer and the others write the book. He {{recorded}} his lines in January 2011 in Los Angeles, California {{under the direction of}} Selman. Gaiman has said that when he first agreed to guest star, he assumed he would only be getting a brief appearance, popping up for a few seconds. He told the press that [...] "when they actually sent me the script and I started to read it and discovered that I was in it all the way through and was <b>actually</b> <b>having</b> to act and that stuff happened, it was enormously fun." [...] Gaiman also noted that he does not think the episode gives an entirely accurate portrayal of him, commenting: [...] "Truthfully, the real-life me almost never hangs around in Barnes & Noble-like bookstores waiting to find groups of local townsfolk who've decided to write pseudonymous young adult fantasy series, offering my services. And even if I did, I probably wouldn't be doing the catering." [...] On his official Tumblr page, Gaiman noted that while he did not have much input on the story, he got to improvise while recording and gave suggestions on how to make his dialogue sound as close to something he might actually say in real life.|$|E

500|$|In 1915, during World War I, Butlin volunteered {{somewhat}} reluctantly {{for service}} in the Canadian Army. Knowing that the army already had a full quota of despatch riders, Butlin intended to volunteer for service in that category {{in the knowledge that}} although his application would be declined he would still receive an [...] "I volunteered" [...] badge for his actions without <b>actually</b> <b>having</b> to serve. While applying, Butlin forgot to tell the recruiter of this intention, and was consequently allocated to the Canadian Expeditionary Force which was taking part in the fighting along the Western Front. He was subsequently posted to the 170th (Mississauga Horse) Battalion on 29 December 1915. His attestation papers give his date of birth as 1898 (rather than the actual 1899), allowing him to enlist although only 15 at the time. The papers give his occupation as a [...] "Suit Case Maker". The papers also show, as Butlin himself later stated, that he had been selected to serve as a bugler. Before his deployment to Europe, Butlin transferred to the 216th (Bantams) Battalion, with which he was sent to England. Once in England, he was stationed at Sandgate near Folkestone before being deployed to France. In France, the 216th became part of the 3rd Canadian Division which took part in the second battle of Vimy Ridge, as well the battles at Ypres and Arras, and the second battle of Cambrai; while in France, Butlin served as a stretcher-bearer.|$|E
500|$|They {{believed}} in empowering children by {{practices such as}} greeting their audience members with [...] "Hello, everyone", instead of [...] "Hello, boys and girls" [...] because as Paul Field has explained, the second greeting [...] "unnecessarily separates children and has undertones of condescension". Kathleen Warren, the group's former professor at Macquarie University, believed that the group's practice of asking their audience to [...] "Wake Up Jeff" [...] when Fatt pretended to fall asleep was [...] "very much {{in keeping with the}} way they work with children". [...] Warren stated that asking children to interrupt Fatt's slumber helped them build confidence and to feel more in control of their lives. [...] Fatt was the only original member of The Wiggles without a background in early childhood education; he explained that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his gimmick and that [...] "it was a way of getting me involved in the shows without <b>actually</b> <b>having</b> to do anything". [...] Paul Field reported that children in The Wiggles' audience felt [...] "great excitement" [...] and were disappointed if not given the opportunity to help Jeff in this way. [...] Anthony Field, who called it [...] "a simple audience participation and interaction gag we've done {{since the start of the}} group", claimed that it endeared Fatt to their audiences. [...] The group's members took turns falling asleep in the early days of the group, but it became Fatt's gimmick because [...] "it was a perfect fit". [...] When Fatt retired, Gillespie took over the task of falling asleep.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Matt Groening, the lone episode (discounting the Tracey Ullman shorts) in which he {{received}} an individual writing credit, though he has co-written for the episodes [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", [...] "The Telltale Head", and [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield". [...] "Colonel Homer" [...] was partly based on the 1980 film Coal Miner's Daughter, which {{tells the story of}} country music singer Loretta Lynn. Groening said he had always wanted to write an episode in which Homer is offered a chance at being rich and famous, other than being with his family, but then chooses his family over glamour at the end. He pitched the idea to the writers of the show, who suggested the parody of Coal Miner's Daughter and also that Homer should become a manager for a country singer. Show runner Mike Reiss was originally skeptical about the episode, as he did not think Homer could get a new job when he already had a full-time job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Reiss eventually gave in, but in future episodes the writers tried to develop the explanation that he got fired from the plant and then rehired at the end. Groening said that during the episode production, he received comments from the production team that Homer was acting like a [...] "jerk" [...] in it, but his explanation was that Homer's behavior was due to his desire to make Lurleen a star and he was oblivious to her attempts to seduce him until the end. Mike Reiss stated that [...] "Whenever we want to write stories about characters getting divorced or <b>actually</b> <b>having</b> an affair, rather than with Homer and Marge, which we could never do, we use secondary characters for that." ...|$|E
