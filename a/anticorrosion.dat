50|$|Since its {{introduction}} in 1970, ECTFE {{has been used}} in industries where corrosion resistance is needed. It is resistant to acids at high concentrations and temperatures, caustic media, oxidizing agents and many solvents. It is said to have similar chemical resistance to PTFE. A chemical resistance table based on immersion tests is available. Permeation of large molecules is usually rather slow in fluoropolymers and thus not relevant in the final application. Small molecules, however, may permeate through the polymer matrix in a relevant time. In lining or coating applications, the permeation of certain small molecules determine the lifetime of <b>anticorrosion</b> protection. H2O, O2, Cl2, H2S, HCl, HF, HBr, N2, H2, CH3OH, etc. are relatively mobile in a polymer matrix and lead to measurable effects. In particular in lining and coating applications, the permeation resistance is necessary as permeating species may attack the underlying mechanical layers, such as fiber reinforced plastic or steel. This high permeation resistance to small molecules is a consequence of the free volume occupied by the chlorine atom on the polymer chain.|$|E

High {{strength}} {{aluminium alloys}} {{are widely used}} in the civil and military aerospace industry due to their low weight and high mechanical properties, achieved by selected alloying elements and heat treatments.

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{synthesise}} <b>anticorrosion</b> pigments containing molybdenum for paints intended for corrosion protection of metals. Design/methodology/approach - The <b>anticorrosion</b> pigments were prepared by high-temperature solid-state synthesis from the appropriate oxides, carbonates and calcium metasilicate. Stoichiometric molybdates and core-shell molybdates with a non-isometric particle shape containing Ca, Sr, Zn, Mg and Fe were synthesised. The pigments were examined by X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Paints {{based on an}} epoxy resin and containing the substances at a pigment volume concentration of 10 volume per cent were prepared. The paints were subjected to physico-mechanical tests and to tests in corrosion atmospheres. The corrosion test results were compared {{to those of the}} paint with a commercial pigment, which is used in many industrial applications. Findings - The molybdate structure of each pigment prepared was elucidated. The core-shell molybdates exhibit a non-isometric particle shape. The pigments prepared were found to impart a very good <b>anticorrosion</b> efficiency to the paints. A high <b>anticorrosion</b> efficiency was found with the pigments Fe- 2 (MoO 4) (3) and Fe- 2 (MoO 4) (3) /CaSiO 3 and with Mg and Zn molybdates. Practical implications -The pigments can be used for the formulation of paints intended for the corrosion protection of metals. The pigments also improve the paints' physical properties. Originality/value - The use of the pigments in <b>anticorrosion</b> paints for the protection of metals is new. The benefits include the use and the procedure of synthesis of the <b>anticorrosion</b> pigments which are free from heavy metals and are acceptable from the aspect of environmental protection. Moreover, the core-shell molybdates, whose high efficiency is comparable to that of the stoichiometric molybdates, have lower molybdenum contents.
