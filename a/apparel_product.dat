40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Apparel, Textiles, and Interior DesignJoy KozarChina is the world’s largest apparel producer, exporter, and {{maintains}} the largest domestic apparel market. Since economic {{reform in the}} 1980 s that opened up the Chinese market for foreign investors, China’s domestic apparel market has attracted many foreign (Western) apparel brands (Shenkar, 2005). More than 10, 000 different international apparel brands share China’s domestic apparel market, including brands from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States, Britain, and South Korea, among others. Around 2, 000 Chinese domestic apparel brands have experienced difficultly surviving in China’s domestic apparel market. Besides {{the large number of}} foreign (Western) apparel brands, counterfeit <b>apparel</b> <b>products</b> have grown faster than China’s government can control. As a result, China has become the world’s largest counterfeit market. This has become a secondary threat to China’s domestic apparel market and national economy. Additionally, because of economic growth and modernization in China, Chinese consumers have accepted more Westernized values, but also retained their traditional face-saving values. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to explore how their attitudes toward counterfeit <b>apparel</b> <b>products,</b> China’s domestic <b>apparel</b> brands, and foreign (Western) apparel brands are influenced by their level of perception about knowledge and attitudes toward counterfeit <b>apparel</b> <b>products,</b> face-saving values, materialistic values, and ethical values. This study utilized a sample of males and females between the ages of 18 and 64, who reside in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Wuhan, China. A questionnaire was utilized as part of this study and data was collected online by SOJUMP Survey Company. A total of 1, 192 participants (736 males and 456 females) participated in this study. There are in total nine significant relationships that have been found in this study. First, the researcher found a positive relationship between Chinese consumers’ perception about knowledge of counterfeit <b>apparel</b> <b>products</b> and their attitudes about counterfeit <b>apparel</b> <b>products.</b> Second and third, the present study also discovered that Chinese consumers with favorable attitudes of foreign apparel brands or negative attitude of China’s domestic apparel brands would similarly hold positive attitudes of counterfeit <b>apparel</b> <b>products.</b> Fourth, the present scholar concluded that Chinese consumers with favorable attitudes of China’s domestic apparel brands tend to hold negative attitudes of counterfeit <b>apparel</b> <b>products.</b> Fifth and sixth, it was found that Chinese consumers with high level of face-saving values show positive attitudes of foreign (Western) apparel brands and counterfeit <b>apparel</b> <b>products.</b> Seventh, Chinese consumers with high level of face-saving values also possess strong materialistic values. Consequently Chinese consumers with strong materialistic values tend to hold positive attitudes of counterfeit <b>apparel</b> <b>products</b> and foreign (Western) <b>apparel</b> <b>products,</b> but negative attitudes of China’s domestic apparel brands. The findings of this study show that Chinese consumers have a very low level of perception about knowledge of counterfeit <b>apparel</b> <b>products.</b> It is necessary to connect educators, government, apparel industry, and brand owners to develop and enhance anti-counterfeit educational programs. These programs should clearly explain the perception about knowledge of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), trademark, and the negative causes of counterfeit products are warranted. Also, it is better for China’s domestic apparel brand companies to develop better brand images and improve product quality to meet Chinese consumers’ face-saving standards and materialistic values...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, apparel design {{refers to}} {{creative}} processes of developing an <b>apparel</b> <b>product</b> line {{to meet the}} target market’s needs and wants. <b>Apparel</b> <b>product</b> development refers {{to the process of}} engineering apparel products so the finished products can be serviceable, producible, and salable with certain profits (Kunz 2009). Merchandising is defined as planning, developing, and presenting <b>apparel</b> <b>product</b> lines for the target markets, including plans of prices, styles, assortments, and sales (Idem). Finally, marketing is concerned with facilitating exchanges and relationships between products and consumers by creating values and satisfying target consumers’ needs and wants (Bickle 2011). For small companies, all of these functions could be carried out by one or a few people within the company. However, typically, in large companies, these functions are divided into different groups/teams of people, and each individual is focused on a few specific tasks. With the main domains of design, product development, merchandising, and marketing in mind, the role of global sourcing in research and education with each of these functions is explored next.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the relationship between reference groups (in-groups vs. out-groups) and self-brand connections, the influential role of self-brand connections on apparel brand attitudes, and brand image perceptions of design, prestige, and workmanship. The moderating role of <b>apparel</b> <b>product</b> involvement, and self-construal on the relationship between self-brand connections and perceptions of brand images were also examined. The results revealed that self-brand connections with in-group/out-group brands are closely related to consumers' favorable/unfavorable brand attitudes. In addition, the findings showed that individuals' <b>apparel</b> <b>product</b> involvement does not moderate the relationship between self-brand connections and brand image perceptions. Only independent self-construal had a moderating effect on the degree of self-brand connections concerning design image perception. Overall, the findings in this study indicate that consumer responses toward apparel brands (e. g., brand attitudes, brand image perceptions) can vary according to self-brand connections with different type of reference groups. In addition, the design aspect of the brand image was found to be very critical in one's self-expression of uniqueness. The influential role of reference groups on consumers' apparel brand preferences is highlighted in this study with special marketing implications for apparel companies.

30|$|Efforts should {{therefore}} be made to address such problems and increase consumer demand for sustainable <b>apparel</b> <b>products</b> (Chen and Burns 2006; Nelliyat 2004). One barrier to this effort is that consumers experience challenges in identifying sustainable products and practices in the marketplace (Goswami 2008). An increased number of companies have added marketing claims focused on their environmentally responsible practices within product advertisements (Kim et al. 2012).

From fibre and fabric production and garment manufacturing and finishing, to usage and disposal of the <b>apparel</b> <b>products</b> after use, the apparel life cycle is complicated (Chen and Burns 2006). This reality is further challenged by the more than 300 different sustainability labels being used in consumer products in general (Case 2009).
