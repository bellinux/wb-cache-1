5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed <b>a</b> <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.|$|E

The following day an Italian column cleared the rebels from Avtovac and relieved the hard-pressed NDH garrison in the town of Gacko. From 3 July, an NDH force of over 2,000 fanned out from Nevesinje, clearing towns, villages and routes of rebels. The rebel forces did not put up any significant opposition to the clearing operation, and either retreated into nearby Montenegro, or hid their weapons in the mountains and went home.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the possibilities of two methods to reduce the weight of small commercial timber prior to logging. The two methods studied are injection of cacodylic acid and sour-felling. Treatments were applied in November, 1965 and May, 1966, with final harvest of the stand occurring in September and October, 1966. The weight reduction, as indicated by the moisture content, was compared to untreated trees. Results are based on wood samples taken from all trees and <b>a</b> weighed <b>truckload</b> <b>of</b> logs from each treatment. The data indicate small differences among the same treatments due to seasonal application. Reductions in weight range from ten to 20 percent when compared to the untreated trees. Some indication of economic potentials is presented. Sour-felled trees were readily attacked by insects but chemical treatments suffered negligible attack. Felling and woods operations were not adversely influenced. Backflash, while present to aiimited degree, may be a result of application method and could be reduced by other means of treating...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores how {{truckload}} carriers use conditional bids {{within the}} framework of a combinatorial auction to win more business and balance their existing networks. Because a considerable portion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truckload</b> carrier's cost <b>of</b> serving a given lane is associated with the probability of finding a follow-on load (i. e. economies of scope), bidding on a lane-by-lane basis may not accurately reflect a carrier's true cost of serving that lane. In a combinatorial auction, <b>a</b> <b>truckload</b> carrier can more accurately reflect its true cost of serving a given lane by offering package discounts, conditional on winning lanes that increase the probability of finding follow-on loads. Though a considerable amount {{has been written about the}} economics <b>of</b> <b>truckload</b> carrier's operations and the benefits of combinatorial auctions to shippers, few have studied conditional bidding from a bidder's (carrier's) perspective. This thesis makes three contributions. First, an explanation of why bidders do and don't submit conditional bids in combinatorial auctions is provided. Second, a model of carrier costs functions, including package discounts (a measure of economies of scope) is developed. Finally, this thesis examines regional pricing differences, and quantifies the amount by which carriers will change their prices in different regions of the US. by Clinton Lee Plummer. Thesis (M.

40|$|Accounting for {{transportation}} {{is an important}} part of the life cycle analysis (LCA) of beef cattle production because it is associated with energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper describes the development and application of a model that estimates energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of transport in beef cattle production. The animal transport model is based on the weight and number of animals in each weight category, type of trailer, vehicle, and fuel used. The energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission estimates of animal feed transportation are based on the weight <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truckload</b> and the number <b>of</b> <b>truckloads</b> <b>of</b> feed transported. Our results indicate that <b>a</b> <b>truckload</b> is travelling approximately 326 km in connection with beef cattle production in the study region. The fuel consumption amounts to 24 L of fossil fuel per 1000 kg of boneless beef. The corresponding greenhouse gas emission is 83 kg.
