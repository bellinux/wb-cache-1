40|$|Abstract. This paper measure {{moisture}} porosity to {{test pieces}} of explosive lining. So are the test pieces curing in standard condition <b>and</b> <b>curing</b> in equal condition. The measured moisture porosity {{data of the}} three kinds of test pieces after flooding is analyzed. The {{results indicate that the}} moisture porosity of explosive lining test pieces is higher than that of curing in standard condition <b>and</b> <b>curing</b> in equal condition. And the different value of moisture porosity increase as the standing time moves on. There is no significant difference in water-loss porosity among the explosive lining test pieces <b>and</b> <b>curing</b> in standard condition ones <b>and</b> <b>curing</b> in equal condition ones...|$|R

The queen and her retinue live under a dormant volcano in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of Kôr. There, Holly is presented to the queen, a white sorceress named Ayesha. Her beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it. She, who is veiled and lies behind a partition, warns Holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear, but he is dubious. When she shows herself, however, Holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. Ayesha reveals that she has learned the secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others, a form of telegnosis and the ability to heal wounds <b>and</b> <b>cure</b> illness; she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry, but is notably unable to see into the future.
