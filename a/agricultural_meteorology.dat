40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{some ideas}} about the basic tasks of <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorology</b> in the present situation when agrometeorologists must face some new challenges. The scope of <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorology</b> as many other applied disciplines has changed during the last decades. While the basic task of <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorology</b> has stayed the same, the socio-economic expectations of society have {{changed in the last}} decades. It seems that the stress has somehow shifted from the increasing of yield towards sustainable development in agriculture. There is also an additional problem in that the focus of agrometeorological activities varies from region to region. This poses problems to international organizations. The basic aim of “agrometeorology” is to improve the applications of meteorology to agriculture and environment in reference to crop management, groundwater contamination by fertilisers and pesticides, erosion, etc. This paper provides an overview of various European agrometeorological activities in relation to the conservation of natural and environmental resources...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Agricultural {{planning}} {{and use of}} agricultural technologies need applications of <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorology.</b> Satellite remote sensing technology is increasingly gaining recognition as {{an important source of}} agrometeorological data as it can complement well the traditional methods agrometeorological data collection. Agrometeorologists {{all over the world are}} now able to take advantage of a wealth of observational data, product and services flowing from specially equipped and highly sophisticated environmental observation satellites. In addition, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology is becoming an essential tool for combining various map and satellite information sources in models that simulate the interactions of complex natural systems. The Commission for <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Meteorology</b> of WMO has been active in the area of remote sensing and GIS applications in agrometeorology. The paper provides a brief overview of the satellite remote sensing and GIS Applications in <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorology</b> along with a description of the WMO Satellite Activities Programme. The promotion of new specialised software should make the applications of the various devices easier, bearing in mind the possible combination of several types of inputs such as data coming from standard networks, radar and satellites, meteorological and climatological models, digital cartography and crop models based on the scientific acquisition of the last twenty years...|$|E
