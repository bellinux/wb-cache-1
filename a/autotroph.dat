2500|$|Food webs {{provide a}} {{framework}} within which a complex network of predator–prey interactions can be organised. A food web model is a network of food chains. Each food chain starts with a primary producer or <b>autotroph,</b> an organism, such as a plant, which is able to manufacture its own food. Next in the chain is an organism that feeds on the primary producer, and the chain continues in this way as a string of successive predators. The organisms in each chain are grouped into trophic levels, based on how many links they are removed from the primary producers. The length of the chain, or trophic level, {{is a measure of}} the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from plants to top predators. Food energy flows from one organism to the next and to the next and so on, with some energy being lost at each level. [...] At a given trophic level there may be one species or a group of species with the same predators and prey.|$|E

50|$|Heterotrophs, such as animals, use {{light from}} the Sun {{indirectly}} by consuming the products of <b>autotrophs,</b> either by consuming <b>autotrophs,</b> by consuming their products, or by consuming other heterotrophs. The sugars and other molecular components produced by the <b>autotrophs</b> are then broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival. This process is known as cellular respiration.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Autotrophs</b> are {{fundamental}} to the food chains of all ecosystems in the world. They take energy from the environment {{in the form of}} sunlight or inorganic chemicals and use it to create energy-rich molecules such as carbohydrates. This mechanism is called primary production. Other organisms, called heterotrophs, take in <b>autotrophs</b> as food to carry out functions necessary for their life. Thus, heterotrophs [...] - [...] all animals, almost all fungi, as well as most bacteria and protozoa [...] - [...] depend on <b>autotrophs,</b> or primary producers, for the energy and raw materials they need. Heterotrophs obtain energy by breaking down organic molecules (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) obtained in food. Carnivorous organisms rely on <b>autotrophs</b> indirectly, as the nutrients obtained from their heterotroph prey come from <b>autotrophs</b> they have consumed.|$|R

40|$|In Utah {{and other}} western states, stream biofilms are {{commonly}} limited by nitrogen or co-limited by both nitrogen and phosphorus. Our study explored how the relative balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic constituents in stream biofilms influences nutrient limitation at sixteen sites in three urban watersheds in Utah. We measured nutrient limitation with nutrient diffusing substrates containing nitrogen (NH 4 -N), phosphorus (PO 4 -P), both nitrogen and phosphorus, or no nutrients. Biofilm responses to nutrient additions were measured as chlorophyll a (<b>autotrophs)</b> and ash-free dry mass (<b>autotrophs</b> + heterotrophs). Nutrient additions affected chlorophyll levels at ten sites. Most commonly, <b>autotrophs</b> were co-limited by N and P (three sites) or primarily limited by N and secondarily limited by P (three sites). Nutrient additions suppressed chlorophyll levels at four sites. Nutrient additions affected ash-free dry mass at only three sites, suppressing biomass at two sites, and increasing biomass at one site. At a given site, chlorophyll a and ash-free dry mass never had the same response to nutrient additions. These preliminary results indicate <b>autotrophs</b> and heterotrophs respond differently to nutrient additions. Further analyses will consider how the relative balance <b>autotrophs</b> and heterotrophs, stream nutrient concentrations, and light availability affect nutrient limitation patterns along an urbanization gradient...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{microbial}} <b>autotrophs</b> play {{a significant}} role in CO 2 fixation in terrestrial ecosystem, particularly in vegetation-constrained ecosystems with environmental stresses, such as the Tibetan Plateau characterized by low temperature and high UV. However, soil microbial autotrophic communities and their driving factors remain less appreciated. We investigated the structure and shift of microbial autotrophic communities and their driving factors along an elevation gradient (4400 - 5100 m above sea level) in alpine grassland soils on the Tibetan Plateau. The autotrophic microbial communities were characterized by quantitative PCR, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and cloning/sequencing of cbbL genes, encoding the large subunit for the CO 2 fixation protein ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO). High cbbL gene abundance and high RubisCO enzyme activity were observed and both significantly increased with increasing elevations. Path analysis identified that soil RubisCO enzyme causally originated from microbial <b>autotrophs,</b> and its activity was indirectly driven by soil water content, temperature, and NH 4 (+) content. Soil autotrophic microbial community structure dramatically shifted along the elevation and was jointly driven by soil temperature, water content, nutrients, and plant types. The autotrophic microbial communities were dominated by bacterial <b>autotrophs,</b> which were affiliated with Rhizobiales, Burkholderiales, and Actinomycetales. These <b>autotrophs</b> have been well documented to degrade organic matters; thus, metabolic versatility could be a key strategy for microbial <b>autotrophs</b> to survive in the harsh environments. Our results demonstrated high abundance of microbial <b>autotrophs</b> and high CO 2 fixation potential in alpine grassland soils and provided a novel model to identify dominant drivers of soil microbial communities and their ecological functions...|$|R
25|$|Links in food webs map {{the feeding}} {{connections}} (who eats whom) in an ecological community. Food cycle is an obsolete term that {{is synonymous with}} food web. Ecologists can broadly group all life forms into one of two trophic layers, the <b>autotrophs</b> and the heterotrophs. <b>Autotrophs</b> produce more biomass energy, either chemically without the sun's energy or by capturing the sun's energy in photosynthesis, than they use during metabolic respiration. Heterotrophs consume rather than produce biomass energy as they metabolize, grow, and add to levels of secondary production. A food web depicts a collection of polyphagous heterotrophic consumers that network and cycle the flow of energy and nutrients from a productive base of self-feeding <b>autotrophs.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Carbon {{fixation}} or сarbon assimilation is {{the conversion}} process of inorganic carbon (carbon dioxide) to organic compounds by living organisms. The most prominent example is photosynthesis, although chemosynthesis is {{another form of}} carbon fixation that can {{take place in the}} absence of sunlight. Organisms that grow by fixing carbon are called <b>autotrophs.</b> <b>Autotrophs</b> include photoautotrophs, which synthesize organic compounds using the energy of sunlight, and lithoautotrophs, which synthesize organic compounds using the energy of inorganic oxidation. Heterotrophs are organisms that grow using the carbon fixed by <b>autotrophs.</b> The organic compounds are used by heterotrophs to produce energy and to build body structures. [...] "Fixed carbon", [...] "reduced carbon", and [...] "organic carbon" [...] are equivalent terms for various organic compounds.|$|R

In common with other obligate <b>autotrophs</b> and in contrast to facultative <b>autotrophs,</b> Nitrosomonas extracts lacked α-ketoglutaric dehydrogenase and KCN-sensitive NADH oxidase activity and had low succinic dehydrogenase activity.

5000|$|Heterotrophs, by {{consuming}} reduced carbon compounds, {{are able}} to use all the energy that they obtain from food for growth and reproduction, unlike <b>autotrophs,</b> which must use some of their energy for carbon fixation. [...] Both heterotrophs and <b>autotrophs</b> alike are usually dependent on the metabolic activities of other organisms for nutrients other than carbon, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, and can die from lack of food that supplies these nutrients. This applies not only to animals and fungi but also to bacteria.|$|R
50|$|A {{food web}} (or food cycle) {{is a natural}} {{interconnection}} of food chains and a graphical representation (usually an image) of what-eats-what in an ecological community. Another name for food web is consumer-resource system. Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels: 1) the <b>autotrophs,</b> and 2) the heterotrophs. To maintain their bodies, grow, develop, and to reproduce, <b>autotrophs</b> produce organic matter from inorganic substances, including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide. These chemical reactions require energy, which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis, although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs. A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete <b>autotrophs</b> that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere, to mixotrophs (such as carnivorous plants) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere, and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter. The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on <b>autotrophs</b> and other heterotrophs. The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory, carnivory, scavenging and parasitism. Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs, such as sugars, provides energy. <b>Autotrophs</b> and heterotrophs come in all sizes, from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods, and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales.|$|R

5000|$|Trophic {{mutualism}} {{is a key}} type {{of ecological}} mutualism. Specifically, [...] "trophic mutualism" [...] refers to the transfer of energy and nutrients between two species. This is also sometimes known as resource-to-resource mutualism. Trophic mutualism often occurs between an <b>autotroph</b> and a heterotroph.

40|$|In this study, {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} were addressed. (1) Bacteria contribute proportionally less than <b>autotrophs</b> to ecosystem respiration as trophic status increases. This hypothesis was examined {{in a pond}} phosphorus-fertilization experiment and two microcosm nutrient-fertilization experiments. (2) The relative contribution of <b>autotrophs</b> to ecosystem respiration, at a given nutrient availability, increases as light availability increases. This hypothesis was tested in three light by nutrient factorial microcosm experiments. Rates of total plankton community, bacterial (� 1 �m fraction), and phytoplankton (total � bacterial) respiration all increased as nutrient availability increased. The contribution of bacteria to community respiration ranged between � 10 and 90 %, with the highest contribution occurring under the most oligotrophic conditions. As light availability increased within each nutrient availability treatment, there was a similar decline in the contribution of bacteria to community respiration. Under oligotrophic conditions bacteria are better competitors for nutrients that limit both <b>autotrophs</b> and heterotrophs, but as nutrient availability increases, conditions become increasingly favorable for larger celled phytoplankton that have higher maximal nutrient uptake rates. As light availability increases, the relative contribution of phytoplankton to ecosystem respiration also increases. Light and nutrient availability are important regulators of the relative contributions of <b>autotrophs</b> and heterotrophs to ecosystem respiration, but the observed patterns are primarily driven by changes in phytoplankton production rates...|$|R
