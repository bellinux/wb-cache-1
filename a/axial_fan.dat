25|$|Many <b>Axial</b> <b>fan</b> {{failures}} {{have happened}} after controlled blade axial fans {{were locked in}} a fixed position and Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) were installed. The VFDs are not practical for some Axial fans. Axial fans with severe instability regions should not be operated at blades angles, rotational speeds, mass flow rates, and pressures that expose the fan to stall conditions.|$|E
25|$|An <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> {{is a type}} of a {{compressor}} that increases the pressure of the air flowing through it. The blades of the axial flow fans force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate. In other words, the flow is axially in and axially out, linearly, hence their name. The design priorities in an <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> revolve around the design of the propeller that creates the pressure difference and hence the suction force that retains the flow across the fan. The main components that need to be studied in the designing of the propeller include the number of blades and the design of each blade. Their applications include propellers in aircraft, helicopters, hovercraft, ships and hydrofoils. They are also used in wind tunnels and cooling towers. If the propeller is exercising propulsion, then efficiency is the only parameter of interest and other parameters like power required and flow rate are considered of no interest. In case the propeller is used as a fan, the parameters of interest includes power, flow rate, pressure rise and efficiency.|$|E
25|$|An <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> {{consists}} of much fewer blades i.e., two to six, {{as compared to}} ducted fans. Axial fans operate at high specific speed i.e., high flow rate and low head and hence adding more blades will restrict the high flow rate required for its operation. Due to fewer blades, {{they are unable to}} impose their geometry on the flow, making the rotor geometry and the inlet and outlet velocity triangles meaningless. Also the blades are made very long with varying blade sections along the radius.|$|E

50|$|Variable pitch <b>axial</b> <b>fans</b> - The blades {{on these}} <b>axial</b> <b>fans</b> are {{manually}} adjustable {{to permit the}} blade angle to be changed. This allows operation over a much wider range of volume/pressure relationships. The blades are adjusted periodically to optimize efficiency by matching the blade pitch to the varying conditions for the application. These fans are often used in mining applications.|$|R
50|$|Variable pitch {{on-the-fly}} <b>axial</b> <b>fans</b> - These {{are similar}} to “Variable Pitch Axial Fans” except they include an internal mechanism that allows the blade pitch to be adjusted while the fan rotor is in motion. These versatile fans offer high-efficiency operation at many different points of operation. This instantaneous blade adjustment capability is an advantage that is possible with <b>axial</b> <b>fans</b> only.|$|R

2500|$|The {{cause for}} this [...] is the {{separation}} of the flow from the blade surfaces. This effect {{can be explained by the}} flow over an air foil. When the angle of incidence increases (during the low velocity flow) at the [...] entrance of the air foil, flow pattern changes and separation occurs. This is the first stage of stalling and through this separation point the flow separates leading to the formation of vortices, back flow in the separated region. For a further the explanation of stall and rotating stall, refer to compressor surge. The stall zone for the single <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> and axial fans operated in parallel are shown in the figure.|$|E
