Using a linear minimal mean-squared error (MMSE) receiver at the destination node, we demonstrate that the optimal amplifying matrix at each relay node {{can be viewed as a}} linear MMSE filter concatenated with another linear filter. As a consequence, the MSE matrix of the signal waveform estimation at the destination node is decomposed into the sum of the MSE matrices at <b>all</b> <b>relay</b> nodes. We show that at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment, this MSE matrix decomposition significantly simplifies the solution to the problem of optimizing the source precoding matrices and relay amplifying matrices.

Asynchronous forms of space-time coding have been proposed (e.g. [8]), but the decoding complexity may still be prohibitively complex to permit their use in low-cost wireless ad hoc networks.

30|$|Early {{works of}} buffer-aided <b>relaying</b> <b>systems</b> can be founded in [14] and [15], where a three-node <b>relaying</b> <b>system</b> was {{considered}} and a data buffer was introduced at relay node. Due to the prefixed transmission and reception schedule abandoned, {{the results in}} [14] and [15] showed that the utilization of data buffer at relay can improve the throughout of <b>relaying</b> <b>systems.</b> The literature [16] focused on the multi-antenna <b>relaying</b> <b>system</b> with buffer at relay and pointed out that if the numbers of antennas at source and destination are equal or larger {{than the number of}} antennas at relay, the buffer-aided half-duplex systems can outperform the ideal full-duplex ones. Motivated by the works [14] and [15], the buffer-aided <b>relay</b> <b>systems</b> have been investigated widely such as in [17 – 25]. Later, in [26] and [27] the idea of buffer-aided relaying was expanded to multiple <b>relay</b> <b>systems,</b> where the authors have proposed the max-max link selection (MMLS) protocol firstly. Specially, to exploit the quality of relay channels as possible, the MMLS schemes abandon the restriction of using the same relay for reception and transmission in a round of communications. Because the strongest links from both S-R and R-D group channels are always selected for data transmission, respectively, the MMLS scheme has significant coding gain over the traditional max-min scheme [12]. However, the results in [26] and [27] show also that the diversity gain achieved by the max-max selection schemes is still the same as the one achieved by the T-BRS schemes owing to a prefixed transmission and reception schedule employed, such that the available diversity degree being not full exploited. Therefore, to overcome this prefixed schedule constraint and to improve the diversity gain of buffer-aided <b>relay</b> selection <b>systems,</b> in [28], the max-link selection (MLS) scheme has been proposed. In the MLS schemes, the constraint on the prefixed transmission and reception order is further relaxed so that, at any time, a best link is selected from all available source-relay and relay-destination links. Depending on whether one S-R or R-D link is selected, either source or relay transmits opportunistically a data packet to the corresponding destination. The MLS schemes incorporate the instantaneous quality of wireless links as well as the states of finite relay buffers (e.g., full, empty, neither full nor empty) and adapt the time slot allocation accordingly. It was achieved that when <b>all</b> <b>relay</b> channels obey independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Rayleigh fading, the MLS schemes not only obtain coding gain over the T-BRS and MMLS schemes but also has higher diversity gain than the two schemes. The achievable diversity order approaches two times of the one of T-BRS and MMLS schemes in the ideal case where all channels experience i.i.d fading and the size of buffers grows to infinity. In [29], the buffer-aided amplify-and-forward (AF) MLS schemes have been considered over symmetric relaying channel. With the promising MLS protocol, in [30], a hybrid cooperative relaying policy was proposed. In [31], the buffer-aided multi-relay cognitive system has been investigated.|$|R

30|$|Nevertheless, all {{the above}} works {{assume that the}} <b>relaying</b> <b>systems</b> operate in a noise-limited environment.

Motivated by this observation, many works have investigated the effect of co-channel interference (CCI) {{on the performance of}} the <b>relaying</b> <b>systems</b> in a variety of different scenarios. In [9], the authors proposed a relay selection algorithm for dual-hop CSI-assisted AF relaying networks in the presence of interference at the relay. In [10], the outage probabilities for both AF and DF <b>relaying</b> <b>systems</b> with noisy <b>relay</b> and interference-limited destination were derived. In [11], the authors investigated the outage performance of dual-hop fixed-gain <b>relaying</b> <b>systems</b> in the presence of interference at both the relay and destination and pointed out that the worst outage performance occurred when the power of interference at the relay and destination was equal.

30|$|While it {{has been}} proved that in buffer-aided <b>relaying</b> <b>systems,</b> the MLS schemes can provide both the {{diversity}} and coding gains over the T-BRS and MMLS schemes when the <b>all</b> <b>relay</b> channels obey the i.i.d fading, the corresponding diversity and delay performance of the MLS schemes have not been reported when the relay channels experience the practical i.ni.d fading. Thus, in this paper, the MLS schemes are investigated over the i.ni.d Nakgami-m channels. By employing Markov chain model, the statistical descriptions of the MLS schemes are achieved firstly. Then, with the derived statistical descriptions, the average packet delays are investigated over the i.ni.d Nakgami-m fading channels. The obtained {{results show that the}} non-identically distributed relay links impose a severe loss in the diversity and coding gains for the MLS schemes. Moreover, when the disparity of the powers of relay links is very large, the MLS schemes no longer provide any diversity gain over the T-BRS and MMLS ones even if the buffers’ size is enough large. However, when the disparity of the powers of relay links is little relatively, the enough diversity and coding gains can be still provided by the MLS schemes. For the average packet delays, it is achieved that under the i.ni.d fading channels, the average packet delays at <b>all</b> <b>relays</b> are different. The results indicate that at some relays, the average packet delays can be very large, and at other relays, they are small. This phenomenon yields that at some relays, the data packets would be trapped {{for a long time and}} the <b>relay</b> <b>systems</b> with MLS schemes are unstable. However, it is enough lucky that when the powers of S-R links are less than the ones of R-D links, the average packet delays are reduced evidently. Inspired this observation, a W-MLS diversity-delay trade-off scheme is proposed to reduce the delay and to enhance the stability of MLS schemes but still obtain the enough diversity and coding gains over T-BRS and MMLS schemes. In the proposed W-MLS schemes, before selecting a best link, the systems multiply the link gains by a weight vector, such that the equivalent signal-to-noise ratios of S-R links are same, so does the ones of R-D links, such that the data packet delays at <b>all</b> <b>relays</b> are same. By adjusting the weight vector, it is guaranteed that the equivalent SNRs of R-D links are greater than the ones of S-R links, such that the delays can be decreased evidently. Moreover, by designing feasible weight vector, the W-MLS can still provide the enough diversity and coding gains.|$|R
