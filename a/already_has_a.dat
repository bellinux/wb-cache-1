5|$|Because SI prefixes {{may not be}} {{concatenated}} (serially linked) {{within the}} name or symbol for a unit of measure, SI prefixes are used with the gram, not the kilogram, which <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> prefix {{as part of its}} name. For instance, one-millionth of a kilogram is 1mg (one milligram), not 1µkg (one microkilogram).|$|E
5|$|As {{the pair}} leave separately, Mařenka's parents, Ludmila and Krušina, enter with the {{marriage}} broker Kecal. After some discussion, Kecal announces {{that he has}} found a groom for Mařenka – Vašek, younger son of Tobiáš Mícha, a wealthy landowner; the older son, he explains, is a worthless good-for-nothing. Kecal extols the virtues of Vašek ("He's a nice boy, well brought up"), as Mařenka re-enters. In the subsequent quartet she responds by saying that she <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> chosen lover. Send him packing, orders Kecal. The four argue, but little is resolved. Kecal decides he must convince Jeník to give up Mařenka, as the villagers return, singing and dancing a festive polka.|$|E

5|$|If {{there are}} {{multiple}} different cations and/or anions, multiplicative prefixes (di-, tri-, tetra-,...) are often required to indicate the relative compositions, and cations then anions are listed in alphabetical order. For example, KMgCl3 is named magnesium potassium trichloride to distinguish it from K2MgCl4, magnesium dipotassium tetrachlorideMgCl4 and Cs2MgCl4|journal=Canadian Journal of Chemistry|date=January 1975|volume=53|issue=1|pages=114–118|doi=10.1139/v75-015}} (note that in both the empirical formula and the written name, the cations appear in alphabetical order, but the order varies between them because the symbol for potassium is K). When one of the ions <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> multiplicative prefix within its name, the alternate multiplicative prefixes (bis-, tris-, tetrakis-,...) are used. For example, Ba(BrF4)2 is named barium bis(tetrafluoridobromate).|$|E
5|$|Back at the office, a few outsiders attend Michael's party. One of the {{attendees}} (Tate Hanyok) strikes {{up a conversation}} with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), who tries to sell her paper; Dwight becomes angry when she tells him she <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> paper supplier. Another attendee named Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt) converses with Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), who is still somewhat depressed over his breakup with his fiancée Stacy and walks away when he admits it was she who broke it off. Kevin returns later to apologize to Lynne and admits he gets nervous talking to pretty girls; Lynne is flattered and gives Kevin her e-mail address. Afterwards, Michael is disappointed the woman who lost her glove does not show up and tells the employees they can go home early, but the empathetic staff decide to stay and later encourage Michael to leave with them.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the middle}} of this final section Rousseau reasons that the theatre does very little good for the poor, who cannot afford the taxes {{required}} to support a theatre. Geneva, which <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> large degree of inequality, does not need any more. Rousseau continues to say that actors coming to the town of Geneva will be indifferent to the town's morality, and will quickly corrupt it. Even though there are other forms of entertainment in Geneva that exemplify bad manners, Rousseau claims that none of these areas are more destructive to the people's good taste than the theatre. The best alternative to theatres is open-air festivals, in nature, to provide a unifying, patriotic spirit.|$|E

25|$|Beebe Bluff (Alice Playten): The heiress to the Bluff family fortune. Beebe is the {{daughter}} of Bill Bluff, the richest man in the town and a friend of Mayor White. The Bluff family is the namesake of the town of Bluffington, and in the second series, the school is even named after Beebe. Despite a certain air of superiority over her peers, Beebe maintains friendships with Patti Mayonnaise and most of her other contemporaries. Doug had his first kiss with her in the episode Doug's Secret Admirer, although it was out of gratitude rather than love, since she <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> crush on Skeeter. Beebe was Alice Playten's final animated role before her death in 2011.|$|E
25|$|This {{proposed}} future route {{would cross}} the downtown core {{at right angles}} to the downtown transit mall and connect two new legs: the Southeast leg and the North-Central leg. It would exceed the capacity of the downtown transit mall, requiring that it use a new right of way going over or under the existing transit mall. Elevated tracks would conflict with Calgary's downtown +15 system, which is the most extensive pedestrian skywalk system in the world, so this option is unlikely. Most likely the system will go underground, crossing underneath the future downtown subway, which <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> short section of tunnel built under 8th Avenue S and a ghost station under the Calgary Municipal Building. The exact routes and station locations are currently in the planning stages.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, a {{motivating}} {{operation that}} causes {{a decrease in}} the effectiveness of a reinforcer, or diminishes a learned behavior related to the reinforcer, functions as an abolishing operation, AO. Again using the example of food, satiation of food prior to the presentation of a food stimulus would produce a decrease on food-related behaviors, and diminish or completely abolish the reinforcing effect of acquiring and ingesting the food. Consider the board of a large investment bank, concerned with a too small profit margin, deciding to give the CEO a new incentive package in order to motivate him to increase firm profits. If the CEO <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lot of money, the incentive package might not be a very good way to motivate him, because he would be satiated on money. Getting even more money wouldn't be a strong reinforcer for profit-increasing behavior, and wouldn't elicit increased intensity, frequency or duration of profit-increasing behavior.|$|E
