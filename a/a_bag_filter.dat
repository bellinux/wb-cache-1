40|$|Abstract: Co-combustion {{of sewage}} sludge with coal or wood as base fuels may cause high {{emissions}} of sulphur dioxide and hydrogen chlorine to the atmosphere. The conventional technique for sulphur capture in fluidised bed combustion using coal, lime addition, works well under co-combustion conditions with coal as base fuel but not with wood. The concentration of SO 2 certainly plays a role, but phosphorous, originating from the sewage sludge, forms calcium phosphate that may interfere with the sulphur capture reactions normally taking place when lime {{is added to the}} bed. Lime addition to the fluidized bed during combustion of pulp&paper sludge, not containing phosphorous and with similar sulphur levels as for the sewage sludge, gives a normal sulphur capture.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare 3 methods for the {{reduction}} of aerosol transmission of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) : high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration, low-cost filtration, and ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation. The HEPA-filtration system involved a pre-filter screen, <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>filter</b> (EU 8 rating), and a HEPA filter (EU 13 rating). The low-cost-filtration system contained mosquito netting (pre-filter), a fiberglass furnace filter, and an electrostatic furnace filter. For UV irradiation, a lamp emitted UVC radiation at 253. 7 nm. No form of intervention was used in the control group. The experimental facilities consisted of 2 chambers connected by a 1. 3 -m-long duct. Recipient pigs, housed in chamber 2, were exposed to artificial aerosols created by a mechanically operated mister containing modified live PRRSV vaccine located in chamber 1. Aerosol transmission of PRRSV occurred in 9 of the 10 control replicates, 8 of the 10 UVC-irradiation replicates, 4 of the 10 low-cost-filtration replicates, and 0 of the 10 HEPA-filtration replicates. When compared with no intervention, HEPA filtration and low-cost filtration significantly reduced PRRSV transmission (P < 0. 0005 and = 0. 0286, respectively), whereas UV irradiation had no effect (P = 0. 5). However, low-cost filtration and UV irradiation were significantly less effective (P = 0. 043 and P < 0. 0005, respectively) than HEPA filtration.

40|$|Coal-fired utility boilers are {{the single}} largest {{anthropogenic}} source of mercury emissions. Mercury is a naturally occurring trace element in coal and, when combusted, may exist in three different forms: Hg 0, Hg 2 +, or Hg particulate. During oxy-fuel combustion, impurity concentrations, such as SOᵪ, NOᵪ, and Hg, can be up to 4 times higher than concentrations in air combustion. An increased mercury concentration is of concern because mercury is known to attack aluminum heat exchangers required in the compression of CO 2. As {{a result of the}} elevated concentrations during oxy-fuel conditions, interactions of Hg and SOᵪ were investigated in this study to verify if there is any competition between SOᵪ and Hg. The effect of Hg, SOᵪ, H 2 O, and temperature on the native capture of Hg by fly ash was assessed using a quartz flow reactor packed with fly ash to simulate <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>filter.</b> Doubling Hg in the system from 5 to 10 μg/Nm 3 doubled the amount of Hg captured in the fly ash from 1. 6 to 2. 8 % and increased the amount of Hg unaccounted from 5. 8 to 18. 1 %. Increased SO 2 decreased the proportion of Hg 0 in the flue gas. The temperature in the bag filter was found to have a large impact on the mercury capture by fly ash.

The different occurrence states of fluorine during coal combustion and emission show that fluorine in coal mainly assumes insoluble inorganic mineral forms. The results illustrate that the three typical occurrence modes in coal are CaF 2, MgF 2 and AlF 3. The fluorine in fly ash can be captured by an electrostatic precipitator (EPS) or <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>filter.</b> In contrast, the gaseous fluorine content in flue gas is only in the range of several parts per million; thus, it cannot be used in this study. The occurrence mode of fluorine in bottom ash and slag is inorganic villiaumite (e. g., soluble NaF, KF and insoluble CaF 2) which is difficult to break down even at high temperatures. The occurrence mode of fluorine with the highest content in fly ash is physically adsorbed fluorine along the direction of the flue gas flow. The insoluble inorganic mineral fluoride content in fly ash is also high, but the gradually increasing fluorine content in fly ash is mainly caused by physical adsorption. Fluorine in the coal-fired power plant discharges mostly as solid products; however, very little fluorine emitted into the environment as gas products (HF, SiF 4) cannot be captured.

It was our aim to compare various pooling sets that are currently marketed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LR-PCs were made by pooling five BCs and adding 250 g of PAS-II. In study I, filters were compared: four BC pools (of five BCs each) were mixed and divided, and after centrifugation the platelet-rich supernatant (PRS) was expressed through one of the following filters: CLX- 5, BioP-plus, Autostop or Imugard. In study II, storage containers were compared: five LR-PCs were mixed and divided over the following storage containers: 1300 -ml PL- 2410, 1000 -ml and 1500 -ml polyolefin, 1500 -ml CLX or 1000 -ml DnDP-PVC. These LR-PCs were stored for 9 days with sampling performed on days 1, 2, 5, 7 and 9. We required that the pH remained between 6. 8 and 7. 4, and that the swirling effect was present {{at the end of the}} storage period. RESULTS: All filters gave LR-PCs that contained uniformly 6. 8 until day 9. With the CLX container, the oxygen level remained adequate until day 9, but low glucose, high lactate and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels suggested high platelet metabolism and/or activation. CONCLUSIONS: BC pooling sets have various benefits, such as less welding, resulting in a lower work-load, but not all combinations of filters and storage containers tested were suitable.
