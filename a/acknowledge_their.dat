5|$|The Normans {{first arrived}} in Southern Italy in 1015 from {{northern}} France and served local Lombard lords as mercenaries against the Byzantine Empire. As they were paid with lands, soon they were powerful enough to challenge Papal authority; in 1054, they defeated the Pope at the Battle of Civitate, forcing him to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>their</b> authority. In 1059, the Pope made Robert Guiscard, of the Hauteville family, Duke of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily. However, most of Apulia and Calabria were in Byzantine hands, and Sicily was in Saracen hands.|$|E

The protesters engage in a brawl, while Tracy runs to the Pingletons' home and hides in a fallout shelter.

Link visits Tracy’s house to look for her and realizes he loves her. Seaweed and Penny also <b>acknowledge</b> <b>their</b> love during the escape.|$|E
5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>their</b> use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
5|$|NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{addressed the}} issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>their</b> injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues. Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.|$|E

25|$|Since journalism {{relies on}} the public trust, a reporter's failure to {{honestly}} <b>acknowledge</b> <b>their</b> sources undercuts a newspaper or television news show's integrity and undermines its credibility. Journalists accused of plagiarism are often suspended from their reporting tasks while the charges are being investigated by the news organization.|$|E
25|$|Lynne Kelly {{has spoken}} against the {{portrayal}} of native peoples by the media, and sometimes even in academia, as having {{a close relationship with}} their environment but being at the same time simplistic and superstitious. These portrayals tend to focus only on their religion and rituals, and very rarely <b>acknowledge</b> <b>their</b> vast scientific knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Casualties were {{relatively}} {{light and the}} action {{had little effect on}} the outcome of the war, but the North scored a propaganda victory. It was the first significant combat encounter between the Army of Northern Virginia and black soldiers, who had fought well in a defensive battle against a larger attacking force. Southerners, unwilling to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>their</b> defeat against a predominantly African-American force, claimed that six gunboats and substantial numbers of white Union soldiers were involved in the action.|$|E
25|$|Originally the hobbits of the Shire swore nominal {{allegiance}} to the last Kings of Arnor, being required only to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>their</b> lordship, speed their messengers, and keep the bridges and roads in repair. During the final fight against Angmar at the Battle of Fornost, the Hobbits maintain that they sent a company of archers to help but this is nowhere else recorded. After the battle, the kingdom of Arnor was destroyed, {{and in the absence}} of the king, the Hobbits elected a Thain of the Shire from among their own chieftains.|$|E
25|$|She {{used the}} work as a {{platform}} to offer a new, more inclusive feminist theory. Her theory encouraged the long-standing idea of sisterhood but advocated for women to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>their</b> differences while still accepting each other. Hooks challenged feminists to consider gender's relation to race, class, and sex, a concept known as intersectionality. She also argues {{for the importance of}} male involvement in the equality movement, stating that, in order for change to occur, men must do their part. Hooks also calls for a restructuring of the cultural framework of power, one that does not find oppression of others necessary.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish admiral Don Pedro de Leyva {{closed in}} {{but did not}} attack instead sending a {{messenger}} aboard the Merchant Royal; they asked {{what they were doing}} and where they had come from. The English explained that trade had bought them to Turkey and were returning home to England. De Leyva then demanded to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>their</b> duty and obedience to the Spanish king but this was flatly refused by Wilkinson. After more demands were refused De Leyva then sent an ultimatum they would, 'either be sunk or be escorted into port' but he was rebuffed once more and the two fleets prepared for battle.|$|E
25|$|Bungie had {{confirmed}} that players' characters and progression would carry over into future releases. However, {{this was only}} true for the expansions of the original Destiny. For the sequel, players who reached level 20 and completed the Black Garden quest in the original had their characters' physical appearance carry over, but not their progression (e.g., powers and gear). Bungie did award veteran players in the sequel to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>their</b> accomplishments in the original Destiny. Bungie stated that the original Destiny would remain online even {{after the release of}} the sequel; players' characters will remain intact with their progression and items, and the game will be supported with patch updates.|$|E
25|$|The show's visual {{style is}} that of digital ink-and-paint. The style was chosen both for the retro feel it gives the show and for the {{versatility}} and freedom it allows the animators, providing {{an environment in which}} it is possible to combine many different styles of animation. Another unique aspect of the show is that, where most cartoons present their characters, though animated, as real within the show's world, the Drawn Together characters retain their identities as cartoon characters even within their animated world, and <b>acknowledge</b> <b>their</b> status as animations. The show has cameo appearances by famous characters (or in some cases, copyright-avoiding clones) from all across the animated spectrum.|$|E
