5|$|Page {{references}} to Dawson {{are from the}} 1596 edition; each folio or double-page spread has a single number, so there <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> as many actual sides as numbers.|$|E
5|$|Cysts of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are more {{resistant}} to adverse environmental factors than the vegetative cells; in particular, they <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> as resistant to UV light. They are also resistant to drying, ultrasound and gamma and solar irradiation, but not to heating.|$|E
5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 21 dorsal scales rows (rarely 19, 20, 22, or 23). These are {{strongly}} keeled scales, {{except for those}} bordering the ventral scales. These scales seem loosely attached to the skin and lower rows become increasingly wide; those closest to the ventral scales <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> {{as wide as the}} ones along the midline. The ventral scales number 132-150 in males and 132–158 in females. The anal plate is single. The subcaudals are paired, numbering 32–46 in males and 23–38 in females.|$|E

5000|$|Aristides Quintilianus (writing {{probably}} in the 3rd century AD) enumerates the incomposite intervals: [...] "the smallest, so far as their use in melody is concerned, is the enharmonic diesis, followed—to speak rather roughly—by the semitone, which <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> the diesis, the tone, which <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> the semitone, and finally the ditone, which <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> the tone".|$|R

5|$|SCSFLS afflicts 5 out {{of every}} 100,000 people. On average, the {{condition}} is developed {{at the age of}} 42, and women <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> as likely as men to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the jack jumper sting problem differs among areas. Allergy {{prevalence}} rates are significantly lower in highly urbanised areas and much higher in rural areas. These ants represent a hazard towards people in the southern states of Australia, due to {{a high proportion of}} the population having significant allergies to the ant's sting. The ant is a significant cause of major insect allergies, responsible for most anaphylaxis cases in Australia, and rates of anaphylaxis <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> those of honeybee stings. One in three million annually die of general anaphalaxis in Australia alone. Over 90% of Australian ant venom allergies have been caused by the jack jumper.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus.|$|E

5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid is a small, soft-bodied insect that has {{specialised}} {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts which are used to suck the juice from plants. This aphid is usually seen in large numbers and is a tiny, plump insect about two millimetres long with a small head and bulbous abdomen. The body is blackish or dark green in colour. Many adults are devoid of wings, a state known as aptery. Winged forms, known as alates, are longer and more slender than aptates and have shiny black heads and thoraxes. The membranous wings of the alates are held angled over the body. The antennae are less {{than two-thirds of the}} length of the body and both they and the legs are pale yellow in colour with black tips. The tibiae of the hind legs are swollen in egg-laying females. Near the rear of the abdomen are a pair of slender, elongated tubes known as cornicles or siphunculi. Their function is the production of a defensive waxy secretion. They <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> as long as the finger-like tail and both are brownish-black.|$|E

25|$|Current {{research}} shows that tobacco smokers who are exposed to residential radon <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> as likely to develop lung cancer as non-smokers. As well, {{the risk of developing}} lung cancer from asbestos exposure is twice as likely for smokers than for non-smokers.|$|E

25|$|APD {{can affect}} both {{children}} and adults, although the actual prevalence is currently unknown. It {{has been suggested that}} males <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> as likely to be affected by the disorder as females, but there are no good epidemiological studies.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan Under-19 cricket team <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> (2004 and 2006) Cricket World Champions at the under-19 level.

25|$|Advocates {{responding}} to {{criticisms of the}} efficacy of nonviolence point {{to the success of}} non-violent struggles even against the Nazi regimes in Denmark and even in Berlin. A study by Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan found that nonviolent revolutions <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> as effective as violent ones and lead to much greater degrees of democratic freedom.|$|E
2500|$|With {{respect to}} the base plane the slope of a face (2) <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> that of an edge (...) , {{corresponding}} {{to the fact that}} the horizontal distance covered from the base to the apex along an edge <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> that along the median of a face. In other words, if C is the centroid of the base, the distance from C to a vertex of the base <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> that from C to the midpoint of an edge of the base. This follows from the fact that the medians of a triangle intersect at its centroid, and this point divides each of them in two segments, one of which <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> as long as the other (see [...] ).|$|R

25|$|Gender: Women <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> as {{susceptible}} to alcohol-related liver disease, and may develop alcoholic liver disease with shorter durations and doses of chronic consumption. The lesser amount of alcohol dehydrogenase secreted in the gut, {{higher proportion of}} body fat in women, and changes in fat absorption due to the menstrual cycle may explain this phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Residential {{segregation}} by {{race and}} economic class prevent low-skilled workers, especially minorities, from moving closer to suburban jobs. Female minority householders <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> as likely as their white counterparts to live in central cities. As more businesses have retreated to suburban areas, the inner-city, where most low-income minorities reside, often face a decline in employment opportunities.|$|E

His abdomen is stouter than the abdomen of workers or queen. Although heavy bodied, the drone must be able to fly fast enough to accompany the queen in flight.|$|E
