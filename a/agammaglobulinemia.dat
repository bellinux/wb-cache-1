40|$|Primary {{antibody}} deficiencies (PADs) are {{the most}} common primary immunodeficiencies. The hallmark of PADs is a defect in the production of normal amounts of antigen specific antibodies. These antibodies or immunoglobulins are indispensible for the adaptive immune response against a wide variety of pathogens. A defect in antibody production results in recurrent and/or severe infections. PADs represent a heterogeneous spectrum of conditions, ranging from often asymptomatic selective IgA and IgG subclass deficiencies to the severe congenital <b>agammaglobulinemia’s,</b> in which antibody production of all immunoglobulin isotypes is severely decreased. Apart from recurrent infections there is a wide range of other clinical complications associated with primary antibody deficiency, affecting quality of life and life expectancy. Primary antibody deficiencies are the result of primary or secondary defects in B-cell development. This Chapter will discuss the principles of adaptive immunity including normal B-cell development, followed by an introduction of the known immunogenetic and clinical characteristics of primary antibody deficiency. Next, we give an overview of potential pathophysiological mechanism in idiopathic primary immunodeficiency. Finally, the aims of the thesis are explained...|$|R
50|$|While at Walter Reed {{during his}} second tour, Bruton studied an 8 year-old boy, Joseph S. Holtoner, Jr., who had {{recurrent}} pneumonia infections and who lacked gamma globulin in his serum. This type of <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> {{is now called}} Bruton's syndrome or X-linked <b>agammaglobulinemia,</b> which was later found by others to be an X-linked congenital condition. The gene defect has since been mapped to the gene code for Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk), at band Xq21.3.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Ochs' {{research}} {{focuses on}} the molecular basis of Primary immunodeficiency diseases with special interest in the genes that {{have been linked to}} the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, Hyper IgM syndrome, X-linked <b>agammaglobulinemia,</b> IPEX syndrome and autosomal dominante Hyper IgE syndrome. To improve the long-term outcome of these disorders, he has actively participated in clinical trials to develop strategies of immunoglobulin replacement therapies, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and gene therapy.|$|E
5000|$|Ecto-5'Nucleotidase is {{considered}} a maturation marker for T cells and B cells. This {{is due to the}} fact that the enzyme activity is approximately 10-times higher for peripheral T cells than thymocytes, 5-6 times higher in adult peripheral B cells than fetal B cells, and largely absent in non-T cell and non-B cell lymphocytes. [...] In immunodeficiency diseases with arrested lymphocyte maturation, ex-5'nucleatidase activity is generally low. Such diseases include severe combined immuno-deficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, congenital X-linked <b>agammaglobulinemia,</b> selective IgA deficiency and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).|$|E
50|$|<b>Agammaglobulinemia</b> (XLA) {{is similar}} to the primary {{immunodeficiency}} disorder Hypogammaglobulinemia (CVID), and their clinical conditions and treatment are almost identical. However, while XLA is a congenital disorder, with known genetic causes, CVID may occur in adulthood and its causes are not yet understood.XLA was also historically mistaken as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), a much more severe immune deficiency ("Bubble boys").A strain of laboratory mouse, XID, is used to study XLA. These mice have a mutated version of the mouse Btk gene, and exhibit a similar, yet milder, immune deficiency as in XLA.|$|E
50|$|Injections {{are most}} {{commonly}} used on patients having been exposed to hepatitis A or measles, or to make a kidney donor and a recipient compatible regardless of blood type of tissue match. Injections are also used to boost immunity in patients unable to produce gamma globulins naturally because of an immune deficiency, such as X-linked <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> and hyper IgM syndrome. Such injections are less common in modern medical practice than they were previously, and injections of gamma globulin previously recommended for travelers have largely {{been replaced by the}} use of hepatitis A vaccine.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to chronic and/or recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases including arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, scleroderma and {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus are also seen in X-linked <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> (XLA).Recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and chronic inflammation of the gut and lungs are seen in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) as well. CGD is a caused by decreased production of {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) oxidase by neutrophils.Hypomorphic RAG mutations are seen in patients with midline granulomatous disease; an autoimmune disorder that is commonly seen in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener’s granulomatosis) and NK/T cell lymphomas.|$|E
50|$|Many of Apt's {{innovations}} {{were outside}} of pediatric ophthalmology. He {{was one of}} the early physicians to adopt the use of plastic tubing and containers in blood transfusions. Such transfusions had usually been given with glass or metal equipment. He was the first to report on a case of an immune system disorder known as <b>agammaglobulinemia.</b> The Apt test is performed when a newborn passes blood into the stool; it differentiates between swallowed maternal blood and blood originating from the newborn. Swallowing of maternal blood can occur at delivery, while infant gastrointestinal bleeding may account for blood coming from the baby.|$|E
50|$|X-linked <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> (XLA) {{is a rare}} genetic {{disorder}} discovered in 1952 that affects the body's ability to fight infection. As the form of <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> that is X-linked, {{it is much more}} common in males. In people with XLA, the white blood cell formation process does not generate mature B cells, which manifests as a complete or near-complete lack of proteins called gamma globulins, including antibodies, in their bloodstream. B cells are part of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), which defend the body from infections by sustaining a humoral immunity response. Patients with untreated XLA are prone to develop serious and even fatal infections. A mutation occurs at the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene that leads to a severe block in B cell development (at the pre-B cell to immature B cell stage) and a reduced immunoglobulin production in the serum. Btk is particularly responsible for mediating B cell development and maturation through a signaling effect on the B cell receptor BCR. Patients typically present in early childhood with recurrent infections, in particular with extracellular, encapsulated bacteria. XLA is deemed to have a relatively low incidence of disease, with an occurrence rate of approximately 1 in 200,000 live births and a frequency of about 1 in 100,000 male newborns. It has no ethnic predisposition. XLA is treated by infusion of human antibody. Treatment with pooled gamma globulin cannot restore a functional population of B cells, but it is sufficient to reduce the severity and number of infections due to the passive immunity granted by the exogenous antibodies.|$|E

50|$|Even {{in modern}} times, Spanish {{bureaucracy}} is notorious for unusually extreme levels of red tape (in the figurative sense). As of 2013, the World Bank ranked Spain 136 out of 185 countries {{for ease of}} starting a business, which took on average 10 procedures and 28 days. Similar issues persist throughout Latin America. As of 2009 in Mexico, it took six months and a dozen visits to government agencies to obtain a permit to paint a house, and to obtain a monthly prescription for gamma globulin for X-linked <b>agammaglobulinemia,</b> a patient had to obtain signatures from two government doctors and stamps from four separate bureaucrats before presenting the prescription to a dispensary.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Bruton {{wrote to}} medical {{schools in the}} United States of America that had a {{pediatric}} service to ask {{if they had any}} such patients with <b>agammaglobulinemia.</b> His findings were published in June 1952 in the journal [...] "Pediatrics". Dr. Bruton was also the first physician to provide specific immunotherapy for this X-linked disorder by administering intramuscular injections of IgG immunoglobulin. Time magazine featured Dr. Bruton and his medical discovery in the May 18, 1953 issue.There is also a milder form of X-linked congenital Swiss-type agammaglobunemia referred to as Bruton-Gitlin syndrome. It is characterized by decreased amounts of humoral gammaglobulin in serum, with cellular functional deficiencies as well. There is also a defect in the Btk gene in this condition.|$|E
50|$|CD79a plays {{multiple}} and diverse roles in B cell development and function. The CD79a/b heterodimer associates non-covalently with the immunoglobulin heavy chain through its transmembrane region, thus forming the BCR {{along with the}} immunoglobulin light chain and the pre-BCR when associated with the surrogate light chain in developing B cells. Association of the CD79a/b heterodimer with the immunoglobulin heavy chain is required for surface expression of the BCR and BCR induced calcium flux and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Genetic deletion of the transmembrane exon of CD79A results in loss of CD79a protein and a complete block of B cell development at the pro to pre B cell transition. Similarly, humans with homozygous splice variants in CD79A predicted to result in loss of the transmembrane region and a truncated or absent protein display <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> and no peripheral B cells.|$|E
50|$|The main {{function}} of nRTKs is {{their involvement in}} signal transduction in activated T- and B-cells in the immune system. Signaling by many receptors is dependent on nRTKs including T-cell receptors (TCR), B-cell receptors (BCR), IL-2 receptors (IL-2R), Ig receptors, erythropoietin (EpoR) and prolactin receptors. CD4 and CD8 receptors on T lymphocytes require for their signaling the Src family member Lck. When antigen binds to T-cell receptor, Lck becomes autophosphorylated and phosphorylates the zeta chain of the T-cell receptor, subsequently another nRTK, Zap70, binds to this T-cell receptor and then participates in downstream signaling events that mediate transcriptional activation of cytokine genes. Another Src family member Lyn is involved in signaling mediated by B-cell receptor. Lyn is activated by stimulation of B-cell receptor, {{which leads to the}} recruitment and phosphorylation of Zap70-related nRTK, Syk. Another nRTK, Btk, is also involved in signaling mediated by the B-cell receptor. Mutations in the Btk gene are responsible for X-linked <b>agammaglobulinemia,</b> a disease characterized by the lack of mature B-cells.|$|E
50|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{immunodeficiency}} syndromes that present clinical and laboratory characteristics of autoimmunity. The decreased ability of the immune system to clear infections in these patients may be responsible for causing autoimmunity through perpetual immune system activation.One example is common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) where multiple autoimmune diseases are seen, e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune thyroid disease.Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency, is another example. Pancytopenia, rashes, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are commonly seen in these patients. Presence of multiple uncleared viral infections due to lack of perforin are thought to be responsible.In addition to chronic and/or recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases including arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, scleroderma and type 1 diabetes are also seen in X-linked <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> (XLA).Recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and chronic inflammation of the gut and lungs are seen in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) as well. CGD is caused by a decreased production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase by neutrophils.Hypomorphic RAG mutations are seen in patients with midline granulomatous disease; an autoimmune disorder that is commonly seen in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegner’s disease) and NK/T cell lymphomas. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients also present with eczema, autoimmune manifestations, recurrent bacterial infections and lymphoma. In autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) also autoimmunity and infections coexist: organ-specific autoimmune manifestations (e.g., hypoparathyroidism and adrenocortical failure) and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.Finally, IgA deficiency is also sometimes associated with the development of autoimmune and atopic phenomena.|$|E
