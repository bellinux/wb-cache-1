5|$|The 2nd Division {{moved to}} France in March 1916. Berryman became a {{temporary}} captain on 1 April 1916, a rank which became substantive on 10 June 1916. In January 1917, he was posted to the 7th Infantry Brigade as a trainee staff captain. During the Second Battle of Bullecourt he served with 2nd Division headquarters. He {{was appointed to}} command the 18th Field Artillery Battery, and became a temporary major on 1 September 1917, which became substantive on 10 September 1917. This was <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> go, for Duntroon graduates could not be promoted above major in the AIF. This policy was aimed at giving them {{a broad range of}} experience, which would benefit the Army, while not allowing them to outnumber the available post-war positions.|$|E
5|$|Kamara {{secured a}} {{play-off}} spot {{with a final}} day victory over Hull City, before City defeated Blackpool in the play-off semi-finals. The final against Notts County was City's first game at Wembley. Goals from Des Hamilton and Mark Stallard gave them a 2–0 win, which secured promotion to Division One. Kamara used 42players in 1996–97 when City avoided relegation with a 3–0 victory in the final game against Queens Park Rangers. Kamara was sacked in January 1998 after an FA Cup defeat to Manchester City, when Richmond claimed the manager had taken the club <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> Richmond again elevated from within and Paul Jewell, who {{had been at the}} club since 1988, was installed as manager, originally on a caretaker basis. He was appointed full-time in May 1998 and Richmond backed his new appointment with a multi-million transfer budget. Jewell signed strikers Lee Mills, from Port Vale and Isaiah Rankin, from Arsenal, for £1million and £1.3million respectively, and signed former captain Stuart McCall from Rangers on a free transfer to lead the side. Despite a poor start, the club secured promotion to the top division {{for the first time in}} 77years with a 3–2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final game of the 1998–99 season.|$|E
25|$|During the 2003 provincial election, the Saskatchewan Party {{campaigned on}} a {{platform}} of tax reduction and decreased government involvement in the private sector. The party won 28 seats, while the NDP won 30 seats. The party was accused of having undisclosed plans to privatize the province's crown corporations. Hermanson stated he would not sell the four major crown corporations, but would consider offers. The NDP used the ambiguity in the Saskatchewan Party's position to turn the election into a referendum on crown corporation ownership for many voters, and won the one seat it needed to regain a majority government. Hermanson resigned as leader shortly afterward. He stated he had taken the party <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and {{it was time for the}} party to elect a new leader who could take it further.|$|E

25|$|Their Champions League ambitions {{were also}} ended {{following}} a defeat and a draw against Arsenal which saw them finish bottom of their group. Once again, {{it had been}} English opposition that had thwarted Roma in Europe. Roma lost the Coppa Italia final to Milan, with Capello particularly angered by supporters who waved banners calling on him to go. Capello's final year at Roma began well with the team playing much better football. They went on a seven-game winning streak before Christmas, including comfortable victories over Juventus and Internazionale. This led to speculation linking him with Juventus, despite his past differences with Luciano Moggi. Capello believed he had taken Roma <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and began to seriously considered a move. In the run-in, the club's form dipped and they ended up finishing 11 points behind champions Milan.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the serial, Kneale felt that he had now taken the {{character}} of Quatermass <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> [...] "I didn't want to go on repeating because Professor Quatermass had already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, and that {{seemed to me to be}} quite enough," [...] he said in 1986. It was also his final new collaboration with Rudolph Cartier, although the director did later handle a new version of Kneale's 1953 adaptation of Wuthering Heights for the BBC in 1962.|$|E
500|$|In {{its first}} {{season in the}} new building, Smythe fired coach Art Duncan after five games and hired Dick Irvin to coach. [...] Irvin {{promptly}} led the Maple Leafs to their first Stanley Cup as the Maple Leafs, and the franchise's third overall. [...] While the Leafs {{would go to the}} finals every year except for 1934 and 1937 during Irvin's nine-year tenure, they were unable to win another Cup. By 1940, Smythe believed that Irvin had taken the Leafs <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and decided to replace him with former Leafs captain Hap Day, who had retired. Smythe also knew that he would be away in the war and felt that Irvin would not be tough enough without Smythe to back him up. Meanwhile, the Montreal Canadiens had had a ten-win season, and were looking for a new coach. At the suggestion of Smythe, Irvin became the new coach of the Canadiens.|$|E

500|$|The 10th Light Horse was reorganised after {{returning}} to Egypt in January 1916, and Robertson assumed command of B Squadron, with the AIF rank of major from May 1916. This was <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> go, for Duntroon graduates could not be promoted above major in the AIF. This {{was the result of}} an AIF policy aimed at giving them a broad a range of experience, which would benefit the post-war Army, while not allowing an accumulation of young officers of high rank, for whom the reduced post-War Army would not have sufficient posts. His substantive rank remained that of lieutenant; he would not be promoted to the substantive rank of captain in the PMF until 30 September 1920, and promotion to major would not come until 1 July 1932. At the Battle of Magdhaba, his colonel was wounded and Robertson took over command of the 10th Light Horse. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions during this battle. His citation read: ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{does not}} {{directly}} adapt any one storyline from the comics, with DeKnight feeling {{that it was more}} important to focus on [...] "nailing the spirit of the comics". He stated that Netflix's support of [...] "the creatives" [...] coupled with Marvel's restrictions on their properties led to him pushing the source material <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> while remaining respectful of the characters and their history, and being surprised at [...] "how willing everyone is to take a really fresh look and really push what we’re doing." [...] Vincent D'Onofrio compared telling a story on Netflix to more of a [...] "13-hour film" [...] than a television series and noted that time can be taken to tell the story and [...] "be much more specific". Deborah Ann Woll explained that what she saw {{as one of the most}} important themes in the series was normal people having an impact in [...] "seemingly insurmountable circumstances", with the focus not being on Daredevil's abilities or the characters' qualifications, but on their willingness to help people.|$|E
500|$|Though Daubeny's {{book in the}} Beagles library {{described}} the volcanic geology of the Canary Islands, it said that {{the structure of the}} Cape Verde Islands was [...] "too imperfectly known". Darwin saw Quail Island as his key to understanding the structure of St. Jago, and made careful studies of its stratigraphy in the way he had learnt from Adam Sedgwick. He collected specimens and described a white layer of hard white rock formed from crushed coral and seashells lying between layers of black volcanic rocks, and noted a similar white layer running horizontally in the black cliffs of St. Jago at [...] above sea level. The seashells were, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> tell, [...] "the same as those of present day". He speculated that in geologically recent times a lava flow had covered this shell sand on the sea bed, and then the strata had slowly risen to their present level. Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology presented a thesis of gradual rising and falling of the Earth's crust illustrated by the changing levels of the Temple of Serapis. Darwin implicitly supported Lyell by remarking that [...] "Dr. Daubeny when mentioning the present state of the temple of Serapis. doubts the possibility of a surface of country being raised without cracking buildings on it. – I feel sure at St Jago in some places a town might have been raised without injuring a house." [...] In a letter to Henslow he wrote that [...] "The geology was preeminently interesting & I believe quite new: there are some facts on a large scale of upraised coast... that would interest Mr. Lyell. While still on the island, Darwin was inspired to think of writing a book on geology, and later wrote of [...] "seeing a thing never seen by Lyell, one yet saw it partially through his eyes".|$|E

2500|$|... 1937 {{was a year}} of {{transition}} for Fred Noonan, whose reputation as an expert navigator, along with {{his role in the}} development of commercial airline navigation, had already earned him a place in aviation history. The tall, very thin, dark auburn-haired and blue-eyed 43-year-old navigator was living in Los Angeles. He resigned from Pan Am because he felt he had risen through the ranks <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> as a navigator, and he had an interest in starting a navigation school. In March, he divorced his wife, Josie, in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Two weeks later, he married Mary Beatrice Martinelli (born Passadori) of Oakland, California. Noonan was rumored to be a heavy drinker of alcoholic beverages. That was fairly common during this era and there is no contemporary evidence Noonan was an alcoholic, although decades later, a few writers and others made some hearsay claims that he was.|$|E

2500|$|A little-known {{example of}} Jones' heroic {{instincts}} in action {{is described by}} his biographer and friend Fred J. Lee in his book, Casey Jones: Epic of the American Railroad (1939). He recounts an incident in 1895 as Jones' train approached Michigan City, Mississippi. He had left the cab in charge of fellow Engineer Bob Stevenson, who had reduced speed sufficiently for Jones to walk safely out on the running board to oil the relief valves. He advanced from the running board to the steam chest {{and then to the}} pilot beam to adjust the spark screen. He had finished well before they arrived at the station, as planned, and was returning to the cab when he noticed a group of small children dart in front of the train some [...] ahead. All cleared the rails easily except for a little girl who suddenly froze in fear {{at the sight of the}} oncoming locomotive. Jones shouted to Stevenson to reverse the train and yelled to the girl to get off the tracks in almost the same breath. Realizing that she was still immobile, he raced to the tip of the pilot or cowcatcher and braced himself on it, reaching out <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to pull the frightened but unharmed girl from the rails. The event was partially spoofed in The Brave Engineer, in which the hero rescued a damsel from a cliché bandit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{massacre}} [...] "spawned a [...] mass of polemical literature, bubbling with theories, {{prejudices and}} phobias" [...] Many Catholic authors were exultant in their {{praise of the}} king for his bold and decisive action (after regretfully abandoning a policy of meeting Huguenot demands <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could)</b> against the supposed Huguenot coup, whose details were now fleshed out in officially sponsored works, though the larger mob massacres were somewhat deprecated: [...] " [...] must excuse the people's fury moved by a laudable zeal which is difficult to restrain once it has been stirred up". Huguenot works understandably dwelt on the harrowing details of violence, expounded various conspiracy theories that the royal court had long planned the massacres, and often showed extravagant anti-Italian feelings directed at Catherine, Gondi, and other Italians at court. Diplomatic correspondence was readier than published polemics to recognise the unplanned and chaotic nature of the events, which also emerged from several accounts in memoirs published over the following years by witnesses to the events at court, including two dramatic and influential accounts {{by members of the}} royal family that were not recognised as fake until the 19th century, those supposedly by Marguerite of Navarre, and Anjou. Anjou's supposed account was the source of the quotation attributed to Charles IX: [...] "Well then, so be it! Kill them! But kill them all! Don't leave a single one alive to reproach me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Larry Linville {{noted that}} his [...] "Frank Burns" [...] {{character}} {{was easier to}} make light of after head comedy writer Larry Gelbart departed after season 4 and Frank and Margaret parted ways in season 5. After season 4, Linville realized that he had taken Frank Burns <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and he decided that since he had signed a five-year contract, he would leave the series after season 5. During the first episode of season 6, [...] "Fade Out, Fade In", Burns (off camera) suffers a nervous breakdown due to Margaret's marriage and is held for psychiatric evaluation. Hawkeye offered a toast to Frank's departure, pausing only a moment, then stating [...] "Goodbye, Ferret Face." [...] In an unexpected twist, Burns is transferred to an Indiana Veterans Administration hospital, near his home in Fort Wayne, and is promoted to lieutenant colonel – in a sense, Frank's parting shot at Hawkeye. Unlike McLean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers, Linville had no regrets about leaving the series, saying, [...] "I felt I had done everything possible with the character." [...] Linville was not alone when he left; Executive Producer Gene Reynolds left after the production of season 5, and Burt Metcalfe and star Alan Alda took over the producing responsibilities. During season 6, Alda and Metcalfe even consulted Reynolds once a week, mainly to obtain help with their jobs as executive producers. These two men remained as executive producers for the remaining six seasons, as Reynolds was credited as a creative consultant along with Alan Alda.|$|E

2500|$|Many people {{believed}} that {{the decision not to}} evacuate the ship was a grave error by Captain Locke, and that some or even all of the passengers could have been saved. [...] The Ministry of Marine reached a similar conclusion in 1919 after hearing the evidence from first hand witnesses. [...] Later, the courts ruled that right or wrong, the decision was within the reasonable range of judgment of the captain. [...] Captain Ledbetter of the Cedar stated that in his opinion, he never saw conditions that would have permitted evacuation of the ship, but he was careful, even almost 50 years later, to state that this was <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> tell from {{when he arrived at the}} reef, which was at 20:00 on the 24th. [...] As early as 10:20 on the 24th there were enough rescue vessels at the reef to have accommodated all of the people on the Sophia, and there would be 4 or 5 hours until the wind began to rise. [...] Also Sophia had 8 lifeboats built of steel, not wood, which would presumably have fared better on wave-washed rocks. [...] On the other hand, Captain Locke could not have known the weather would worsen, and there seem to have been signs that it would improve. [...] Historians Coates and Morrison speculate that the memory of the wreck of the Clallam, when everyone in the lifeboats died after a premature abandonment of the vessel, may have played a role in Locke's decision.|$|E
2500|$|Raglan {{was anxious}} to exploit Scarlett's success and drive the Russians off the Causeway Heights, but Cathcart's and Cambridge's {{infantry}} divisions had still not arrived; every minute that passed gave the Russians more time to prepare their defences for the expected British counter-attack. The British commander believed that the enemy had retreated in such disorder that {{a show of force}} by his cavalry — in advance of the infantry's arrival – would be enough to persuade the Russians to abandon the Causeway Heights. At 10:00, therefore, he gave his third order of the day to the Cavalry Division: Cavalry to advance and take advantage of any opportunity to recover the Heights. They will be supported by infantry which have been ordered. Advance on two fronts. Raglan wished his cavalry to advance immediately, but the ambiguity of the order had again resulted in a misunderstanding. Lucan had assumed he was first to wait for the infantry before moving forward. Accordingly, he ordered the Light Brigade into the North Valley, while the Heavy Brigade held the entrance of the South Valley, perhaps in response to the order 'Advance on two fronts'. Lucan believed he had complied with the order <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> until the infantry arrived, but Raglan looked on with growing impatience at his immobile cavalry. It was at this moment when a staff officer (identity unknown) shouted out that the Russians in the redoubts on the Causeway Heights were dragging away the captured British guns. The British infantry divisions were now only minutes away, but only the cavalry could move fast enough and prevent the loss of the guns. With growing impatience Raglan dictated to General Richard Airey the fourth and final order to Lord Lucan. This order was to be understood in conjunction with the third as an instruction to do immediately what had been previously ordered: ...|$|E
