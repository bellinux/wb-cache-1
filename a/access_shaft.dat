Barsanti, seeing that several corridors and chambers were seemingly unfinished and that all were completely devoid of artefacts, deemed that the pyramid had never been used. Shortly after, in 19101911, George Reisner and Clarence S. Fisher worked on the site, excavating {{the north and east}} exteriors of the pyramid as well as the cemeteries surrounding it. The dimensions of the pyramid as estimated by Barsanti, Reisner and Fisher differ greatly and even the numbers of subterranean galleries they report are in disagreement. Unfortunately, the pyramid lies within a restricted military area since 1970 and consequently no excavation has been undertaken there since Reisner and Fisher's superficial work, leaving the structures beneath the pyramid in doubt. Furthermore, the pyramid is now sanded up, hampering modern estimations of its dimensions.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a survey}} in 1958, the {{geologist}} C.C. Fagg identified 25 active swallow holes between Dorking and Mickleham; most {{were only a}} few centimetres in diameter and were located in the vertical banks of the river below the water line. Most holes were difficult to observe in times of normal or heavy flow and were susceptible to silting up as new holes were continually being formed. A few much larger swallow holes were also observed separated from the main river by a channel of about a metre. About six of these larger swallow holes were found {{to the west of the}} Burford Bridge Hotel, along the course of the A24 Mickleham Bypass during its construction in 1936. Initially the surveyors tried to fill the holes with rubble to prevent the foundations of the new road subsiding. However this proved to be impractical and they were instead covered by concrete domes, up to 18 m in diameter, each fully supported by the surrounding chalk and provided with a manhole and <b>access</b> <b>shaft</b> to allow periodic inspection. In the late 1960s the domes were reopened and inspected and the alluvium in the largest swallow hole was observed to have subsided by [...] under the centre of one of the domes. When the Dorking to Leatherhead railway was constructed in 1859, a fossilised swallow hole was discovered in the cutting at the south end of Box Hill and Westhumble railway station, suggesting that even in its early history, the river had swallow holes.|$|E
25|$|Sub-surface mining {{consists}} of digging tunnels or shafts {{into the earth}} to reach buried ore deposits. Ore, for processing, and waste rock, for disposal, are brought to the surface through the tunnels and shafts. Sub-surface mining can be classified {{by the type of}} <b>access</b> <b>shafts</b> used, the extraction method or the technique used to reach the mineral deposit. Drift mining utilizes horizontal access tunnels, slope mining uses diagonally sloping <b>access</b> <b>shafts,</b> and shaft mining utilizes vertical <b>access</b> <b>shafts.</b> Mining in hard and soft rock formations require different techniques.|$|R

With {{the closure of the}} East London Line in December 2007 for extensive upgrading the museum hoped that the <b>access</b> <b>shaft</b> into the tunnel (originally built to be the grand entrance hall to the tunnel) could be capped with a concrete shelf at the bottom, above the level of the trains. This shelf was completed in early 2010, with the inauguration taking place in late January. The <b>access</b> <b>shaft</b> took in its first groups from the general public on 14 February 2010 (Valentine's Day) when it was opened as the 'Tunnel of Love' for short historical presentations detailing the history of the tunnel and of some interesting historical notes from the private life and diary of Brunel's son, Isambard.|$|E

50|$|The East Side tunnel was {{the largest}} sewer {{construction}} project ever undertaken by the City of Portland. A contractor, Kiewit-Bilfinger Berger (KBB), used a tunnel boring machine that was 300 ft long and had a cutting head that was 25 ft in diameter. In addition to the tunnel and the pipe, the project involved building seven <b>access</b> <b>shafts,</b> connecting pipelines, and the Portsmouth Forcemain, which carries sewage from the Swan Island Pump Station to the Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant.|$|R

50|$|A {{temporary}} <b>access</b> <b>shaft</b> {{is sometimes}} necessary during the excavation of a tunnel. They are usually circular and go straight down {{until they reach}} {{the level at which}} the tunnel is going to be built. A shaft normally has concrete walls and is usually built to be permanent. Once the access shafts are complete, TBMs are lowered to the bottom and excavation can start. Shafts are the main entrance {{in and out of the}} tunnel until the project is completed. If a tunnel is going to be long, multiple shafts at various locations may be bored so that entrance to the tunnel is closer to the unexcavated area.|$|E
50|$|The Lumes, {{which are}} hostile to Cores, {{propagate}} large plant-like <b>access</b> <b>shafts</b> {{until they are}} close to a Core, and then launch a coordinated attack on the Core until it is destroyed.

This is done from an <b>access</b> <b>shaft,</b> 25 x 40 m, with four NATM drives, with a diameter of 10 m each. All are progressing simultaneously parallel to the works for the shaft building, using both hydraulic excavators and smooth blasting techniques.|$|E
500|$|In March 2007, the Second Avenue Subway was revived.

Its construction site was designated as being from 105th Street and Second Avenue to 63rd Street and Third Avenue. The MTA awarded a $337 million contract—one that included constructing the tunnels between 92nd and 63rd Streets, building a launch box for the tunnel boring machine (TBM) at 92nd to 95th Streets, and erecting <b>access</b> <b>shafts</b> at 69th and 72nd Streets—to Schiavone Construction, Skanska USA Civil, and J.F.

30|$|In Afghanistan, most {{of active}} and {{abandoned}} karezes {{are located on}} the eastern, southern and western flanks of the Hindu Kush (Fig.  3 b). In a study of a local area (Fig.  3 a), an algorithm was designed to automatically locate chahs in a GIS environment. First, visual identification of kariz features (vertical <b>access</b> <b>shafts</b> or chahs) was made using orthophotography and the locations entered in a GIS environment. Karezes in Afghanistan exhibit a surface expression of roughly circular depressions ringed by piles of sediment, chahs, that lead to a surface canal delivering water to a village (Figs.  1, 2). Active and abandoned chahs were distinguished by considering whether the holes appeared open or collapsed.|$|R
