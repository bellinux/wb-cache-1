These three men were joined in the room later by the mystery figure who was introduced as Vladislav, a man who could help Litvinenko win a lucrative contract with a Moscow-based private security firm.|$|E
5|$|Harry asked printer James E. James (who had printed Frank Comments), if {{he could}} borrow the {{printing}} blocks he used for photos, as they were too expensive for the fledgling company at the time. Harry also borrowed blocks from the Widnes Weekly News, Pantosphinx and local cinemas, but contributed to charities by printing free charity advertisements {{at the side of}} the front cover page. After taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening, Harry would often return to the office and work throughout the night, pausing only to go to the Pier Head to buy <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> and a hot pie at four in the morning. Virginia's parents helped the paper during this time, as they paid for classified ads, and arranged for Harry and his future wife's first photographs together.|$|E
5|$|The war, lasting under a fortnight, {{saw more}} than 90,000 Pakistani {{soldiers}} taken as {{prisoners of war}} (POWs), and it ended with the unconditional surrender of Pakistan's eastern half, resulting in the birth of Bangladesh as a new nation. Apart from the POWs, Pakistan lost six thousand men, while India lost two thousand. After the war, Manekshaw {{was known for his}} compassion towards the POWs. Singh recounts that in some cases he addressed POWs personally, talking to them privately with just his aide-de-camp in his company while they shared <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea.</b> He ensured that POWs were well treated by the Indian Army, making provisions for them to be supplied with the copies of the Quran, and allowing them to celebrate festivals, and to receive letters and parcels from their loved ones.|$|E

5|$|During a {{party at}} the {{community}} centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses Denise Fox (Diane Parish), angering her husband Lucas (Don Gilet), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily preaching to him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and ZsaZsa to replace it, but as they dig it up, they uncover a dead body, that of Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window and she makes Fatboy fix it. He does a bad job so she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy to wait in her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new window and make her <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three days, the group {{undertook}} a series of tasks by which they could earn the right to become housemates. The remaining non-housemates were instructed to change into a special uniform. Anyone not obeying would lose {{the opportunity to become}} a housemate. Lisa gained housemate status {{in the early hours of}} Day 2 when she answered a ringing phone in the living room. Given 15 minutes to select the fourth housemate, she chose Kris. Charlie and Saffia later became housemates after walking barefoot over broken sugar glass, believing it to be real glass, and Karly became the seventh housemate after being tricked into believing that she had a motorbike ridden over her stomach. Freddie and Sophie became housemates after changing their names, documented by deed poll to Halfwit and Dogface respectively. On Day 3 Cairon earned housemate status by dunking a biscuit in <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> for 25.5 seconds without it disintegrating. Remaining non-housemates Angel, Beinazir, Marcus, Siavash, Sophia and Sree faced the public vote on Day 4 to determine which five would become housemates and which one would be evicted. With 6.8% of a vote to save, Beinazir became the first evictee without ever becoming a housemate.|$|E

25|$|In 1875, he {{was named}} Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and in 1876 assumed the new Chair of Chinese Language and Literature at Oxford, where he {{attracted}} few students to his lectures but worked hard for some 20 years in his study at 3 Keble Terrace, on his translations of the Chinese classics. According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was in his study every morning at three o'clock, winter and summer, having retired to bed at ten. When he {{got up in the}} morning {{the first thing he did}} was to make himself <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> over a spirit-lamp.

25|$|According to {{the report}} by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), several correspondents were {{detained}} or otherwise harassed after arriving in Beslan (including Russians Anna Gorbatova and Oksana Semyonova from Novye Izvestia, Madina Shavlokhova from Moskovskij Komsomolets, Elena Milashina from Novaya Gazeta, and Simon Ostrovskiy from The Moscow Times). Several foreign journalists were also briefly detained, including a group of journalists from the Polish Gazeta Wyborcza, French Libération, and British The Guardian. Many foreign journalists were exposed to pressure from the security forces and materials were confiscated from TV crews ZDF and ARD (Germany), AP Television News (USA), and Rustavi 2 (Georgia). The crew of Rustavi 2 was arrested; the Georgian Minister of Health said that the correspondent Nana Lezhava, who had been kept for five days in the Russian pre-trial detention centers, had been poisoned with dangerous psychotropic drugs (like Politkovskaya, Lezhava had passed out after being given <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea).</b> The crew from another Georgian TV channel, Mze, was expelled from Beslan.|$|E
25|$|Hoover {{was best}} known for his civil air show career, which started when he was hired to {{demonstrate}} the capabilities of Aero Commander's Shrike Commander, a twin piston-engined business aircraft that had developed a staid reputation due to its bulky shape. Hoover showed the strength of the plane as he put the aircraft through rolls, loops, and other maneuvers, which most people would not associate with executive aircraft. As a grand finale, he shut down both engines and executed a loop and an eight-point hesitation slow roll as he headed back to the runway. Upon landing he would touch down on one tire followed gradually by the other. After pulling off the runway, he would start his engines to taxi back to the parking area. On airfields with large enough parking ramps (such as the Reno Stead Airport, where the Reno Air Races take place), Hoover would sometimes land directly on the ramp and coast {{all the way back to}} his parking spot in front of the grandstand without restarting the engines. He was also known for creating the stunt of successfully pouring <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> while performing a 1G barrel roll.|$|E
25|$|The {{order of}} steps in {{preparing}} <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> is a much-debated topic, and can vary widely between cultures or even individuals. Some {{say it is}} preferable to add the milk before the tea, as the high temperature of freshly brewed tea can denature the proteins found in fresh milk, similar to the change in taste of UHT milk, resulting in an inferior-tasting beverage. Others insist {{it is better to}} add the milk after brewing the tea, as black tea is often brewed as close to boiling as possible. The addition of milk chills the beverage during the crucial brewing phase, if brewing in a cup rather than using a pot, meaning the delicate flavour of a good tea cannot be fully appreciated. By adding the milk afterwards, it is easier to dissolve sugar in the tea and also to ensure the desired amount of milk is added, as the colour of the tea can be observed. Historically, the order of steps was taken as an indication of class: only those wealthy enough to afford good-quality porcelain would be confident of its being able to cope with being exposed to boiling water unadulterated with milk. Higher temperature difference means faster heat transfer so the earlier you add milk the slower the drink cools. A 2007 study published in the European Heart Journal found certain beneficial effects of tea may be lost through the addition of milk.|$|E
