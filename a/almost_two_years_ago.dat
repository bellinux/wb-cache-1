This is {{borne out by the}} Irish 2006 Census, which revealed that Dunleer had 2,340 people living in the Town. This meant the population had grown by more than 30% in five years. Since the most recent census <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> {{it could be argued that}} this figure may be higher, as a significant number of new dwellings have been constructed in the time since the census. With the town experiencing renewed prosperity as a result of this growth, a wide range of shops, pubs, restaurants and cafes have been established in the thriving town centre. Dunleer's proximity to Drogheda, Ardee, Dundalk, and its location as a crossroads on the main north-south economic corridor of Ireland have made this once rural village officially a town.|$|E

The older the cheese gets, bigger and harder its crust get, making the taste of this product more pungent and striking.|$|R

When Elena arrives, he {{alternates}} between his feelings of love for her and pain because of their separation.

The reader then learns about Andrea and Elena's first meeting, which took place at a dinner party hosted by the Marchesa of Ateleta, Andrea's cousin. The two talk at the party and the next day meet each other again. The two begin an affair, which ends abruptly when Elena announces one night that she is leaving him. After she leaves, Andrea begins a long line of seductions, seducing seven noble women in total. At last he begins to try to seduce Ippolita Albònico. One day, while at a horse race, Andrea angers Ippolita's husband who challenges him to a duel. Even though Andrea is better at fencing, he sustains a grave injury during the duel.|$|E

We must recall at this point that the standard chessboard has 64 squares arranged in 8 equal rows and columns. The knight is the chess piece that often looks like a horse.

Financial markets were volatile and illiquid, and the viability of some of the world’s leading financial institutions had been called into question. With asset prices falling and the flow of credit to the non-financial sector constricted, most of the world’s economies had entered what would prove to be a sharp and protracted economic downturn. By the time of that meeting, the world’s central banks had already taken significant steps to stabilise financial markets and to mitigate the worst effects of the recession, and they would go on to do much more. Very broadly, the responses of central banks to the crisis fell into two classes.

40|$|The {{veterinary}} {{school that}} {{was established in}} Edinburgh in 1823, <b>almost</b> <b>two</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> has had an interesting and rich history. Recent studies have revealed details {{of some of the}} personalities who created its academic foundations, and these investigations have also shown that the early beginnings {{can be traced back to}} the 1600 s.

Nevertheless, in this process of exploration, various other gaps in our appreciation of the veterinary school have begun to make themselves more obvious. For example, what the veterinary school was called by people locally, nationally and internationally really mattered to the ones who worked and studied there.

40|$|<b>Almost</b> <b>two</b> {{thousand}} <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> Claudius Ptolemy {{created a}} guide to drawing maps of the world, identifying the names and coordinates of over 8, 000 settlements and geographical features. Using the coordinates of those cities and landmarks which have been identified with modern locations, a series of best-fit transformations {{has been applied to}} several of Ptolemy’s regional maps, those of Britain, Spain, and Italy. The transformations relate Ptolemy’s coordinates to their modern equivalents by rotation and skewed scaling. These reflect the types of error that appear in Ptolemy’s data, namely those of distance and orientation. The mathematical techniques involved in this process are all modern. However, these techniques have been altered {{in order to deal with}} the historical difficulties of Ptolemy’s maps. To think of Ptolemy’s data as similar to that collected from a modern random sampling of a population and to apply unbiased statistical methods to it would be erroneous. Ptolemy’s data is biased, and the nature of that bias is going to be informed by the history of the data. Using such methods as cluster analysis, Procrustes analysis, and multidimensional scaling, we aimed to assess numerically the accuracy of Ptolemy’s maps. We also investigated the nature of the errors in the data and whether or not these could be linked to historical developments in the areas mapped.
