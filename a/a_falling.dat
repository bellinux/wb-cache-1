40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{agreement between}} hospital staff on what constitutes <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> {{and should be}} recorded on an incident report, to identify factors that influence whether a scenario is classified as <b>a</b> <b>fall,</b> and to {{examine the effect of}} providing a definition of <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> on interrater agreement. DESIGN: Two interrater agreement trials with pre–postintervention design. SETTING: Seven hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred forty-six hospital staff (nursing 76 %, physiotherapy 14 %, occupational therapy, 6 %) working on participating wards over a 24 -hour period. MEASUREMENTS: Fourteen video scenarios were played before participants, who were asked whether they would classify each scenario as <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> and whether they would complete an incident report in that scenario. A definition of <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> was then provided and the video scenarios replayed. Two definitions were investigated; the World Health Organization definition and a custom definition. RESULTS: Consensus was not evident in five of the 14 scenarios examined. Falls onto surfaces higher than the ground {{were less likely to be}} recorded on incident reports. Hospital and ward type influenced whether a scenario was classified as <b>a</b> <b>fall.</b> Overall agreement in classifying scenarios as <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> was only marginally greater after provision of the definition in both phases, although neither had an effect on whether staff would complete an incident report. CONCLUSION: Disagreement between hospital staff in what constitutes <b>a</b> <b>fall</b> may contribute to inconsistent research findings in this field and is not meaningfully improved through provision of a definition...|$|R
