500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical {{content of the}} song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with {{the weight of the world}} that I held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the moon. Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] Jon Pareles for The New York Times wrote that Carey [...] "coos" [...] the lyrics [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon" [...] and [...] "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{away on a}} trip to England in March 2004, Christopher {{received}} an email from Joan Porco's account admonishing him for failing classes at Hudson Valley Community College in Troy, NY. In the message, Joan and Peter complained to their son, [...] "You just left and (we) can't believe (our) eyes <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your interim grade report. You know what they say, 'Three strikes and you're out.' Explain yourself." [...] The email's subject header was [...] "Failing Grades-You did it again!" [...] Several days later, Christopher replied in a message to his father. Blaming the community college's office of registrar, he wrote, [...] "ut obviously they are incorrect...My lowest grade that I got on anything was a B on a physics test...Don't jump to conclusions, I'm fine." [...] Porco earned readmission to the University of Rochester with a forged transcript from HVCC. Judge Berry refused to allow prosecutors to use the forged transcripts as evidence in their criminal case against Christopher Porco.|$|E
6000|$|She paused again a little. [...] "It was high, certainly--for those fragments. I think I feel, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them there, rather {{ashamed to}} say." ...|$|E
60|$|I waited--feeling awe, but no fear. My {{heart was}} all hers <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
60|$|He sat, {{with that}} carved {{grin on his}} face, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the fire, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have no time}} {{to write}} more. I thought of Lady... <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the {{chronometers}} and instruments, and of you all <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the beautiful vessel slipping along through the water with scarce a stitch of canvas. I pray that she may be spared many years to the Mission, and that we may have grace to use her, as she ought to be used, to His glory.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will not}} say it again, but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you, and the home to which I have brought you, I feel that I have acted selfishly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I was {{a little}} boy, Marian," [...] he said, gazing at her, [...] "I {{used to think that}} Paul Delaroche's Christian martyr was the most {{exquisite}} vision of beauty in the world. I have the same feeling <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you now." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them now, these pages, {{written in}} the days of stress and dread, wear a look of strange serenity. They were written calmly, yet not in cold blood, and are perhaps the only kind of pages I could have written at that time full of menace, but also full of faith.|$|E
60|$|She was {{standing}} in thought, a doubtful expression on her face. But <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her she shook her head.|$|R
6000|$|I will {{confess that}} that Mordet Island {{nightmare}} of mine returned, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him his hand {{went out for}} the drug again. [...] "Stomach, George," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pardon, Mademoiselle,' I said to {{the young}} miss. She turned and {{withered}} me with a rather overdone contempt--'bourgeoise,' I said to myself, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her--'Vous avez laiss√© votre parasol.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dunno as the Lord has {{had much}} to do with this, sir. Seems to me as if 'twas the other one as was running it, with Joe Moore for deputy. The main thing, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, is to get a cinch on him. How much does the {{mortgage}} amount to, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, {{that may}} be," [...] Hiram replied reflectively; [...] "but you see yonder sleepy heads {{declared}} they would turn in because another night had surely come, and I {{was trying to}} persuade them they would be spending the day in slumber, which <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the matter is wrong, even though we may not venture out." ...|$|E
60|$|Copeland! Stop a moment. Was it {{yesterday}} I visited Copeland's works, and saw them making plates? In {{the confusion of}} travelling about, it might be yesterday {{or it might be}} yesterday month; but I think it was yesterday. I appeal to the plate. The plate says, decidedly, yesterday. I find the plate, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, growing into a companion.|$|E
60|$|I went to Sadler {{and found}} him, to my surprise, in bed. As I entered {{he sat up}} and turned a face toward me which sickened me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{more likely}} to come now. He knows he can get nothing out of me--" [...] Then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the order, he added, [...] "Beyond my mother's rights. Poor mother!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a coffee}} service of china in the salon," [...] said M. Paul, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the six {{green and white}} dinner-plates; the four dishes, the cups and jugs to match.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{speaking}} {{of my own}} grapes, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them when I use that argument for my own comfort. The worst {{of it is that}} when we know that the grapes are not sour,--that they are the sweetest grapes in the world,--the argument is of no use. I won't tell any lies about it, to myself or anybody else. I want my grapes at once." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could feel}} that Beverly-Jones grew {{depressed}} as {{he showed me}} round. I was sorry for him, but unable to help. I realized that there were certain sections of my education that had been neglected. How to be shown things and make appropriate comments {{seems to be an}} art in itself. I don't possess it. It is not likely now, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this pond, that I ever shall.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I've {{been told}} all that before, Mr. Slide; them things weren't given by no manner of means, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. We just {{went in and}} took 'em. It was hall a haccident whether it was Cobden or Peel, Gladstone or Disraeli, as was the {{servants}} we employed to do our work. But Liberal is Liberal, and Conservative is Conservative. What are you, Mr. Slide, to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{climbed to}} the top of a {{mountain}} one day [...] To see the sun setting in glory, [...] And <b>I</b> thought, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his vanishing ray, [...] Of a perfectly splendid story.|$|R
60|$|He {{handed me}} the open book. <b>I</b> started <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the picture. In this reconstructed animal of a dead world there was {{certainly}} a very great resemblance to the sketch of the unknown artist.|$|R
60|$|I felt my face fire up <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Joe. <b>I</b> hope one {{remote cause}} of its firing {{may have been}} my {{consciousness}} that if I had known his errand, I should have given him more encouragement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; and that, no doubt, is his {{argument}} {{when he sees}} me. He is delighted to have me down at Tretton, and, to tell the truth, I do not feel the slightest animosity toward him. But <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him I think {{him to be the}} most remarkable old gentleman that the world has ever produced. He is quite unconscious that I have any ground of complaint against him." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{always had}} been, I still am, a passionate student of social problems. The world of to-day with its roaring machinery, the unceasing toil of its working classes, its strife, its poverty, its war, its cruelty, appals me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. I love {{to think of}} the time that must come some day when man will have conquered nature, and the toil-worn human race enter upon an era of peace.|$|E
60|$|Am I finding {{fault with}} you {{and the rest of}} the populace? No--I assure you I am not. For I know the human race's limitations, and this makes it my duty--my {{pleasant}} duty--to be fair to it. Each person in it is honest in one or several ways, but no member of it is honest in all the ways required by--by what? By his own standard. Outside of that, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, there is no obligation upon him.|$|E
50|$|I lost my handbag the {{day before}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the wound <b>I</b> {{sustained}} from the shoe. The handbag contained my salary, and I was feeling very upset at that time <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had also lost my job.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will," [...] I answered, {{thrusting}} {{back the}} wide-brimmed hat <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him. [...] "The {{last time we}} traveled together you were not so accommodating. We had a little dispute at Elktail one night in the snow." ...|$|R
6000|$|I was not {{flattering}} her, for <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her <b>I</b> thought I {{had never}} seen such a lovely woman in my life. Ada laughed and coloured a little, and declared I was an old goose; and then I said:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Sol {{joined in}} the laugh until his wife plucked his sleeve, and whispered {{something}} in his ear. In an instant his face became at once mysterious and demure. [...] "I owe you an apology," [...] he said, turning to Rand, but in a voice ostentatiously pitched high enough for Miss Euphemia to overhear: [...] "I see I have made a mistake. A resemblance--only a mere resemblance, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you now--led me astray. Of course you don't know any young lady in the profession?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{added the}} sleeper quietly, [...] "her {{favorite}} color, as you know. She fades and fades <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her," [...] he went on. [...] "She is gone. I only see you, {{under a new}} aspect. You have a pistol in your hand. Opposite to you, there stands the figure of another man. He, too, has a pistol in his hand. Are you enemies? Are you meeting to fight a duel? Is the lady the cause? I try, but I fail to see her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No doubt;--and so in {{real truth}} can I. I can stand apart and defy them all; and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them looking at me, and almost know with what words they are maligning me, I can tell myself {{that they are}} beneath me, and that I care nothing for them. I shall do nothing which will enable any one to {{interfere}} with me. But it seems hard that all this should be so because I am a widow,--and because I am alone,--and because I am poorly clothed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I am {{a soldier}} now, Edie," [...] said I, very stiffly; for <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her pretty face, I seemed to see behind it that other face which had {{looked up to}} the morning sky on the Belgium battle-field.|$|R
6000|$|... "Try {{to forgive}} me," [...] I said, when Anne Catherick took her friend's arm to go away. Innocent <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had been of any {{intention}} to terrify and agitate her, my heart smote me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the poor, pale, frightened face.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right, Saxon," [...] he said. [...] "He's {{just a big}} stiff. I {{took his}} measure <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him. He won't bother you again. I know his kind. He's a dog. Roughhouse? He couldn't rough-house a milk wagon." ...|$|R
