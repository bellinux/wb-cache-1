5|$|In the rideability test, {{the horse}} is {{evaluated}} {{by a member of}} the studbook evaluation committee by being ridden at a walk, trot and canter. The horse's movement, balance and disposition <b>are</b> <b>evaluated</b> and given 4 to 10 points. The horse should express cooperation, gentleness, attentiveness, sensitivity to cues, and active effort. This test is required for riding-type horses, and optional for pony-sized horses in lieu of the driveability test.|$|E
5|$|The general {{drivability}} test {{is performed}} by trotter stallions.

5|$|Administered by the International Baccalaureate (IB), the IBDP {{is taught}} in schools in over 140 countries, {{in one of three}} languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, {{students}} must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each subject group, and three core requirements. Students <b>are</b> <b>evaluated</b> using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator.|$|E

In Spain, donors <b>are</b> <b>evaluated</b> with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.|$|E
5|$|Only {{purebred}} Mérens may {{be registered}} in the breed stud book. The selection of stallions is rigorous, based on tests {{at the age of}} three. The breeding goal is to produce horses with the ideal conformation and good character. The gaits are subject to particular observation in all stallions, and during the three-year-old inspections, they must perform a dressage test, a cross-country jumping test, a test on the longe line and a physical inspection. The Mérens {{has one of the most}} stringent inspection procedures, and breeders aim to achieve a steady increase in the quality of the breed. Mares <b>are</b> <b>evaluated</b> during a breed competition organized by the French National Stud.|$|E

Given the similarities between geographical forms of the Eurasian nuthatch, subspecies boundaries are somewhat fluid, although fewer than half as many are recognised now as in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN Red List {{does not}} {{distinguish}} the hooded crow from the carrion crow, {{but the two}} species together have an extensive range, estimated at 10millionkm2 (3.8million mi2), and a large population, including an estimated 14 to 34 million individuals in Europe alone. They are not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), so <b>are</b> <b>evaluated</b> as Least Concern.
