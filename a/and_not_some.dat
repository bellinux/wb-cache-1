5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} 18th and through the 19th century, {{criticism}} centred on debates over the moral message of the play. Actor and playwright David Garrick's 1748 adaptation excluded Rosaline: Romeo abandoning her for Juliet was seen as fickle and reckless. Critics such as Charles Dibdin argued that Rosaline had been purposely included in the play to show how reckless the hero was {{and that this was}} the reason for his tragic end. Others argued that Friar Laurence might be Shakespeare's spokesman in his warnings against undue haste. With the advent of the 20th century, these moral arguments were disputed by critics such as Richard Green Moulton: he argued that accident, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> character flaw, led to the lovers' deaths.|$|E

500|$|The English {{version of}} Cobra was named {{as one of}} [...] "The Top 25 Translated-To-English Manga of All Time" [...] by Wizard {{magazine}}. Ivevei Upatkoon of EX online magazine praised it as a [...] "rich fantasy" [...] that was unmatched by any other. She said the main character took [...] "after James Bond, albeit somewhat on the silly side, and the costumes and bizarre worlds are but a shade shy of plagiarizing Barbarella". She was impressed that the series [...] "is surprisingly devoid of the sexual innuendo and exploitation that anime fans have come to associate with decorative female characters"; it avoids the stereotypical, beautiful women, and instead creates its own [...] "extreme" [...] world. Upatkoon also said that modern readers might find the manga dated and would be discouraged from reading it, despite the improvement in artistic quality as the series progresses. Writing for Anime News Network (ANN), Jason Thompson described Cobra as [...] "a significant piece of manga history". Thompson wrote that {{the women of the}} series have a [...] "realistic physique <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> moe jailbait or grotesque bakunyu explosion". Thompson deemed Cobra as a parody of both Western action heroes and Star Wars and 1970s shōjo science fiction and its concept of beauty".|$|E

She criticized proponents of the theory, stating that they believed that teenagers [...] "somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman's particular situation, and instead make some sort of primitive cause-and-effect connection" [...] and that [...] "by talking about pregnant girls, and most of all, by daring to portray some of them as ordinary, even likable, we'd get way more babies having babies." [...] She concluded that [...] "depicting teen parents may not glamorize them, so much as humanize them. You know, that thing that happens when one person recognizes that someone else is a person too? So, now that we can firmly state that realistically depicting the lives of the tiny percentage of girls who do become pregnant won't necessarily contaminate the rest of them, it's time to stop worrying and ask what we can do to help." ...|$|E

Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer praised Dreamcast's NAOMI arcade ports, opining [...] "The thrill of playing Crazy Taxi in the arcade knowing full well that a pixel-perfect conversion (<b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> cut-down port) was set to arrive on the Dreamcast is an experience gamers are unlikely to witness again." [...] Nick Montfort and Mia Consalvo, writing in Loading... The Journal of the Canadian Game Studies Association, argued that [...] "the Dreamcast hosted a remarkable amount of videogame development that went beyond the odd and unusual and is interesting when considered as avant-garde... {{it is hard to imagine}} a commercial console game expressing strong resistance to the commodity perspective and to the view that game production is commerce. But even when it comes to resisting commercialization, it is arguable that Dreamcast games came closer to expressing this attitude than any other console games have." [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish favorably compared Sega's Dreamcast output, which included some of [...] "the most varied, creative, and fun [...] the company had ever produced", with its [...] "enervated" [...] status as a third-party.

2500|$|... "Copyright {{protection}} for computer software is a given, but I {{do not feel}} that the courts should be astute to extend that protection into a region where only the functional effects of a program are in issue. There is a respectable case for saying that copyright is not, in general, concerned with functional effects, and there is some advantage in a bright line rule protecting only the claimant's embodiment of the function in software <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> superset of that software. The case is not truly analogous with the plot of a novel, because the plot is part of the work itself. The user interface {{is not part of the}} work itself. One could permute all the letters and other codes in the command names, and it would still work in the same way, and all that would be lost is a modest mnemonic advantage. To approach the problem in this way may at least be consistent with the distinction between idea and expression that finds its way into the Software Directive, but, of course, it draws the line between idea and expression in a particular place which some would say lies too far on the side of expression. I think, however, that such is the independence of the particular form of the actual codes used from the overall functioning of the software that it is legitimate to separate them in this way, and not to afford them separate protection when the underlying software is not even arguably copied." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Battle of the Trench, the Jewish {{tribe of}} Banu Qurayza who were {{located at the}} south of Medina were charged with treachery. After the retreat of the coalition, Muslims besieged Banu Qurayza, the {{remaining}} major Jewish tribe in Medina. The Banu Qurayza surrendered and all the men, apart from a few who converted to Islam, were beheaded, while all {{the women and children}} were enslaved. In dealing with Muhammad's treatment of the Jews of Medina, aside from political explanations, Arab historians and biographers have explained it as [...] "the punishment of the Medina Jews, who were invited to convert and refused, perfectly exemplify the Quran's tales of what happened to those who rejected the prophets of old." [...] F.E. Peters, a western scholar of Islam, states that Muhammad's treatment of Jews of Medina was essentially political being prompted by what Muhammad read as treasonous <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> transgression of the law of God. Peters adds that Muhammad was possibly emboldened by his military successes and also wanted to push his advantage. Economical motivations according to Peters also existed since the poorness of the Meccan migrants was a source of concern for Muhammad. Peters argues that Muhammad's treatment of the Jews of Medina was [...] "quite extraordinary", [...] "matched by nothing in the Qur'an", and is [...] "quite at odds with Muhammad's treatment of the Jews he encountered outside Medina." [...] According to Welch, Muhammad's treatment of the three major Jewish tribes brought Muhammad closer to his goal of organizing a community strictly on a religious basis. He adds that some Jews from other families were, however, allowed to remain in Medina.|$|E
2500|$|Depending {{on whether}} or not Mathgamain and Máel Muad were {{successful}} in achieving anything following their resolution in 972, Ivar {{may or may not have}} found himself in a very weakened position. Curiously neither of our major primary sources has anything clear to say about the state of affairs at this time. But in 974 Ivar met with misforture, the Annals of Inisfallen reporting that [...] "The son of Aralt made a circuit of Ireland with a great company, and plundered Inis Cathaig, and brought Ímar from it into captivity.", and the Annals of the Four Masters [...] "The plundering of Inis-Cathaigh by Maghnus , son of Aralt, with the Lag-manns [...] of the islands along with him; and Imhar, lord of the foreigners of Luimneach, was carried off from the island, and the violation of Seanan thereby." [...] His captor is easily identified as Maccus mac Arailt, King of Mann and the Isles, but what are unknown are the circumstances. Ivar may have gone to Scattery because he had been driven out of Limerick proper, or it could have been for some other reason, and whether or not he and Maccus were already associated is unknown. Benjamin Hudson has offered the explanation that this event can be related to Ivar's earlier adventure in Britain as reported in the Cogad, arguing that the [...] "King of Britain" [...] reported slaying his comrade Amlaíb mac Amlaíb should be understood as either Maccus or his brother Gofraid mac Arailt <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> king of the Welsh, otherwise [...] "it probably would have been mentioned in the insular records". (Assuming Hudson is referring only to the Welsh and English records.) Elaborating, he reads this sequence beginning with [...] "a battle over the exploitation of the Welsh" [...] which the sons of Aralt won, and eventually ending with Maccus following Ivar all the way around Ireland to finish it.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Germany {{hoped to}} {{transform}} Poland into a satellite state, but by March 1939 German demands had {{been rejected by}} the Poles three times, which led Hitler to decide, with enthusiastic support from Ribbentrop, upon the destruction of Poland as the main German foreign policy goal of 1939. On 21 March 1939, Hitler first went public with his demand that Danzig rejoin the Reich and for [...] "extra-territorial" [...] roads across the Polish Corridor. This marked a significant escalation of the German pressure on Poland, which until then had been confined to private meetings between German and Polish diplomats. That same day, on 21 March 1939, Ribbentrop presented a set of demands to the Polish Ambassador Józef Lipski about Poland allowing the Free City of Danzig to return to Germany in such violent and extreme language that {{it led to the}} Poles to fear their country {{was on the verge of}} an immediate German attack. Ribbentrop had used such extreme language, in particular his remark that if Germany had a different policy towards the Soviet Union then Poland would cease to exist, that it led to the Poles ordering partial mobilization and placing their armed forces on the highest state of alert on 23 March 1939. In a protest note at Ribbentrop's behaviour, Poland's Foreign Minister Józef Beck reminded the German Foreign Minister that Poland was an independent country <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> sort of German protectorate that Ribbentrop could bully at will. Ribbentrop in turn sent out instructions to the German Ambassador in Warsaw, Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke, that if Poland agreed to the German demands, then Germany would ensure that Poland could partition Slovakia with Hungary and be ensured of German support for annexing the Ukraine. If the Poles rejected his offer, then Poland would be considered an enemy of the Reich. On 26 March, in an extremely stormy meeting with the Polish Ambassador Józef Lipski, Ribbentrop accused the Poles of attempting to bully Germany by their partial mobilization and violently attacked them for only offering consideration of the German demand about the [...] "extra-territorial" [...] roads. The meeting ended with Ribbentrop screaming that if Poland were to invade the Free City of Danzig, then Germany would go to war to destroy Poland. When the news of Ribbentrop's remarks was leaked to the Polish press despite Beck's order to the censors on 27 March, it caused anti-German riots in Poland with the local Nazi Party headquarters in the ethnically mixed town of Lininco destroyed by a mob. On 28 March, Beck told Moltke that any attempt to change the status of Danzig unilaterally would be regarded by Poland as a casus belli. Though the Germans were not planning an attack on Poland in March 1939, Ribbentrop's bullying behaviour towards the Poles destroyed whatever faint chance there was of Poland allowing Danzig to return to Germany.|$|E
