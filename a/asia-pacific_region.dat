5|$|Due to the {{emphasis}} placed on cooperation with Britain, relatively few Australian military units were stationed in Australia and the <b>Asia-Pacific</b> <b>region</b> after 1940.

An AIF battalion was also allocated to garrison Rabaul, and another brigade would be dispersed piecemeal to Timor and Ambon. Meanwhile, in July 1941 the 1st Independent Company was deployed to Kavieng on New Britain {{in order to protect}} the airfield, while sections were sent to Namatanai in central New Ireland, Vila in the New Hebrides, Tulagi on Guadalcanal, Buka Passage in Bougainville, and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers.|$|E

The holistic sustainability evaluation framework established and validated aims to assist the design and decision making in urban design which is suitable for Chinese cities and other cities in the <b>Asia-Pacific</b> <b>Regions...</b>|$|R
