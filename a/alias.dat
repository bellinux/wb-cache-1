50|$|<b>Aliasing</b> {{can occur}} in signals sampled in time, for {{instance}} digital audio, and {{is referred to as}} temporal <b>aliasing.</b> <b>Aliasing</b> can also occur in spatially sampled signals, for instance moiré patterns in digital images. <b>Aliasing</b> in spatially sampled signals is called spatial <b>aliasing.</b>|$|R

40|$|An <b>aliasing</b> {{correction}} in a {{wave field}} synthesis system is performed by determining the <b>aliasing</b> filter characteristic specific to a virtual source. Said <b>aliasing</b> filter characteristic, which can be the <b>aliasing</b> frequency for example, is determined {{by means of the}} source position information. The <b>aliasing</b> filter characteristic is used for an adaptive anti-aliasing filter for the adaptive filtering of the audio signal associated with the source or the component signals associated with the source...|$|R
50|$|In computing, <b>aliasing</b> {{describes}} {{a situation in}} which a data location in memory can be accessed through different symbolic names in the program. Thus, modifying the data through one name implicitly modifies the values associated with all <b>aliased</b> names, which may not be expected by the programmer. As a result, <b>aliasing</b> makes it particularly difficult to understand, analyze and optimize programs. <b>Aliasing</b> analysers intend to make and compute useful information for understanding <b>aliasing</b> in programs.|$|R
2500|$|An {{example of}} spatial <b>aliasing</b> is the moiré pattern {{observed}} in a poorly pixelized image of a brick wall.

40|$|When using plenoptic {{camera for}} digital refocusing, an-gular undersampling can cause severe (angular) <b>aliasing</b> artifacts. Previous {{approaches}} {{have focused on}} avoiding <b>aliasing</b> by pre-processing the acquired light field via pre-filtering, demosaicing, reparameterization, etc. In this pa-per, we present a different solution that first detects and then removes <b>aliasing</b> at the light field refocusing stage. Differ-ent from previous frequency domain <b>aliasing</b> analysis, we carry out a spatial domain analysis to reveal whether the <b>aliasing</b> would occur and uncover where in the image it would occur. The spatial analysis also facilitates easy sepa-ration of the <b>aliasing</b> vs. non-aliasing regions and <b>aliasing</b> removal. Experiments on both synthetic scene and real light field camera array data sets demonstrate that our approach {{has a number of}} advantages over the classical prefiltering and depth-dependent light field rendering techniques. 1...|$|R

2500|$|In {{video or}} cinematography, {{temporal}} <b>aliasing</b> {{results from the}} limited frame rate, and causes the wagon-wheel effect, whereby a spoked wheel appears to rotate too slowly or even backwards. <b>Aliasing</b> has changed its apparent frequency of rotation.

40|$|It is {{becoming}} {{well known that}} <b>aliasing</b> associated with ocean tides could be {{a major source of}} systematic error in altimeter sea-level measurements, due to asynoptic sampling and imperfect tide modelling. However, {{it has been shown that}} signals of non-tidal origin may also contribute significantly to the observed <b>aliasing.</b> In this paper, numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the full <b>aliasing</b> potential associated with altimeter observations of seasonal sea-level variability and annual Rossby waves. Our results indicate that ignorance of non-tidal <b>aliasing</b> may lead to the possibility of underestimating the total <b>aliasing</b> and misinterpreting or overlooking existing geophysical phenomena. Therefore, it is argued that an entire <b>aliasing</b> picture should be kept in mind when satellite altimeter data are analysed...|$|R
40|$|Type {{systems that}} track <b>aliasing</b> can verify {{state-dependent}} program properties. For example, such systems can verify that a program does not access a resource after deallocating the resource. The simplest way to track <b>aliasing</b> {{is to use}} linear types, which on the surface appear to ban the <b>aliasing</b> of linear resources entirely. Since banning <b>aliasing</b> is considered too draconian for many practical programs, researchers have proposed type systems that allow limited forms of <b>aliasing,</b> without losing total control over state-dependent properties. This paper describes how to encode one such system, the capability calculus, using a type system based on plain linear types with no special support for <b>aliasing.</b> Given well-typed capability calculus source programs, the encodings produce well-typed target programs based on linear types. These encodings demonstrate that, contrary to common expectations, linear type systems can express <b>aliasing</b> of linear resources...|$|R

40|$|<b>Aliasing</b> is {{a general}} problem in the {{analysis}} of any measurements that make sampling at discrete points. Sampling in the spatial domain results in a periodic pattern of spectra in the wave vector domain. This effect is called spatial <b>aliasing,</b> and it is of particular importance for multi-spacecraft measurements in space. We first present the theoretical background of <b>aliasing</b> problems in the frequency domain and generalize it to the wave vector domain, and then present model calculations of spatial <b>aliasing.</b> The model calculations are performed for various configurations of the reciprocal vectors and energy spectra or distribution that are placed at different positions in the wave vector domain, and exhibit two effects on <b>aliasing.</b> One is weak <b>aliasing,</b> in which the true spectrum is distorted because of non-uniform <b>aliasing</b> contributions in the Brillouin zone. It is demonstrated that the energy distribution becomes elongated in the shortest reciprocal lattice vector direction in the wave vector domain. The other effect is strong <b>aliasing,</b> in which <b>aliases</b> have a significant contribution in the Brillouin zone and the energy distribution shows a false peak. These results give a caveat in multi-spacecraft data analysis in that spectral anisotropy obtained by a measurement has in general two origins: (1) natural and physical origins like anisotropy imposed by a mean magnetic field or a flow direction; and (2) <b>aliasing</b> effects that are imposed by the configuration of the measurement array (or the set of reciprocal vectors). This manuscript also discusses a possible method to estimate <b>aliasing</b> contributions in the Brillouin zone based on the measured spectrum and to correct the spectra for <b>aliasing...</b>|$|R

40|$|High-performance {{control design}} for {{electromechanical}} sampled-data systems with <b>aliased</b> plant dynamics is investigated. Though from a theoretical viewpoint the <b>aliasing</b> phenomenon is automatically handled by direct sampled-data control, {{such an approach}} cannot be {{used in conjunction with}} models derived through system identification. From a practical viewpoint, <b>aliasing</b> is often considered as an undesirable phenomenon and a typical remedy is the increase of the sampling frequency. However, the sampling frequency is upper bounded due to physical and economical constraints and <b>aliasing</b> may be inevitable. Control design for plants with <b>aliased</b> dynamics has not received explicit attention in the literature and {{it is not clear how}} to handle this situation. In this paper, it is shown that <b>aliased</b> resonance phenomena can effectively be suppressed in sampled-data feedback control design without the need for increasing the sampling frequency. Furthermore, it is shown experimentally on an industrial wafer stage that ignoring <b>aliasing</b> during control design can have a disastrous effect on closed-loop performance. Additionally, a novel, practically feasible procedure for identification of (possibly <b>aliased)</b> resonance phenomena based on multirate system theory is proposed...|$|R
