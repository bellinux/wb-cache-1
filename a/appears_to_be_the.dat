5|$|Although MUS81 is a {{component}} of a minor crossover pathway in the meiosis of budding yeast, plants and vertebrates, in the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila, MUS81 appears {{to be part of}} an essential, if not the predominant crossover pathway. The MUS81 pathway also <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> predominant crossover pathway in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.|$|E

The {{process of}} separating it from graphite will require some further technological development {{before it is}} economical for industrial processes. If successful, graphene {{could be used in}} the construction of a space elevator. It could also be used to safely store hydrogen for use in a hydrogen based engine in cars.|$|E

5|$|Radial {{cleavage}} in {{the earliest}} divisions of the egg <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> original condition for the ancestral bilaterians, {{in the earliest}} Ecdysozoa and possibly in the earliest Eutrochozoa, a major sub-group of the Lophotrochozoa. Hence radial cleavage {{does not imply that}} brachiopods are affiliated with deuterostomes.|$|E
5|$|Species {{recognition}} {{is based on}} combinations of minor structural variations in the shape, aperture, whorl contour, umbilical region, and color pattern. It <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case that many species have a stable color pattern, while other species seem to vary tremendously. Adequate unselected field samples will enable {{a better understanding of}} the relative stability or variability of particular species in single localities.|$|E
5|$|The {{ambiguity}} {{inherent in}} the IAU's definition was highlighted in December 2005, when the Spitzer Space Telescope observed Cha 110913-773444 (above), only eight times Jupiter's mass with what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> beginnings of its own planetary system.

5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} is found from {{southern}} Colombia south through eastern Ecuador and Peru to the Madre de Dios region and east through extreme northwestern Bolivia and into western Amazonian Brazil.

The purple-throated cotinga's total range covers approximately , throughout which it occurs in patches at low population densities.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} main road, there are five avenues, each planted in its own species and named accordingly: oak, poplar, birch, lime, and sycamore. The tree-lined avenues give Barrhill a charming appearance. Wason had trees planted in an unusual pattern around the market square. Residents only noticed in 1975 when viewing an aerial photo that those trees form what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> three circles of Trinity, with the two inner avenues {{possibly}} symbolising a crucifix.|$|E

5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon {{in patients who}} receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|Cyprus <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{principal}} intermediary station between Mycenaean Greece and the Middle East, {{based on}} the considerable greater quantities of Mycenaean goods found there. On the other hand, trade with the Hittite lands in central Anatolia {{appears to have been}} limited. Trade with Troy is also well attested, while Mycenaean trade routes expanded further to the Bosphorus and the shores of the Black Sea. Mycenaean swords have been found as far away as Georgia in the eastern Black Sea coast.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{of active}} {{volcanic}} {{activity on the}} moon Io was probably the greatest surprise. It {{was the first time}} active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire Jovian system. Io <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere – the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at {{the outer edge of the}} magnetosphere of Jupiter.|$|E

The attribution in certain quarters of such a wish to the judiciary is misconceived and <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which the courts are bound to apply.|$|E
5|$|Most frogs {{identify}} prey by movement, {{and vision}} <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> primary {{method by which}} the cane toad detects prey; however, the cane toad can also locate food using its sense of smell.

5|$|Smilodon {{and other}} saber-toothed cats have been reconstructed with both plain-colored coats and with spotted {{patterns}} (which <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> ancestral condition for feliforms), {{both of which}} are considered possible. Studies of modern cat species have found that species that live in the open tend to have uniform coats while those that live in more vegetated habitats have more markings, with some exceptions. Some coat features, such as the manes of male lions or the stripes of the tiger, are too unusual to predict from fossils.|$|E

5|$|The Moon {{may have}} {{dramatically}} affected {{the development of}} life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case for Mars.|$|E
5|$|The long-awaited {{excavation}} {{began on}} 29 September 2004, {{led by a}} handful of archaeologists and dedicated archaeology volunteers called Southeast Asian Archaeology. Nearly 2 metres down, the volunteers uncovered significant remains of the fort still in situ—a pair of infantry bastions that did not appear in the original plans, the perimeter of the moat's inner escarpment and what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> drawbridge superstructure. Experts call it Singapore's only 'true fort'—one with protection all around—and it was considered one of Singapore's most important archaeological finds.|$|E

The Insular majuscule script of the text itself <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> work {{of at least three}} different scribes.
