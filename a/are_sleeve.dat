The improve-ment is not limited to diabetes alone and includes hyper-tension, dyslipidemia and obstructive sleep apnea as well. The magnitude and onset of this improvement outweighs the weight loss leading to the concept of ‘metabolic sur-gery ’ rather than bariatric surgery [1]. The observed meta-bolic benefits lead to the extension of this concept to non primarily divided into restrictive and malabsorptive types. The most common surgical procedures <b>are</b> <b>sleeve</b> gas-trectomy (SG), gastric banding, Roux-en-Y-Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and Jejuno-Ileal Bypass (JIB). The observed remis-sion in diabetes after these surgeries is reported to range between 45 - 95 % [6]. The standard procedures have been modified to achieve maximum remission with minimal long term complications. The modified surgical techniques are Ileal Interposition (II) ...|$|E

Once finished, the next <b>sleeve</b> <b>is</b> opened, concurrently isolating the previous stage, and the process repeats. For the sliding <b>sleeve</b> method, wireline <b>is</b> usually not required.|$|R
