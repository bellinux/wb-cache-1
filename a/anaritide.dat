40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF) in modulating arteriolar tone in hypertension, a synthetic 25 AA human ANF-analogue (<b>anaritide)</b> was infused intraarterially in the forearm vascular bed of five patients with mild hypertension. A dose-dependent increase in blood flow (plethysmographic technique) was seen at rates covering a thousand-fold range (0. 008, 0. 08, 0. 8, 8. 0 micrograms/dl tissue/min x 15 minutes each). At the lowest infusion rate, the forearm blood flow increment was associated with changes in local venous ANF concentrations comparable with those reported during biological stimuli in hypertensive man and consistent with an ANF physiologic role in forearm arterioles of hypertensive patients. However, at local venous concentrations greater than 1000 pg/ml, ANF did not relax forearm vessels by more than about one-fourth of the total forearm vasodilator capacity (as assessed through a maximally active ischemic stimulus). These data confirm the low potency of ANF as an endogenous vasodilator, although vasodilator potency is not a necessary requirement for physiologic systems involved in the regulation of muscular vascular tone. Systemic arterial pressure, heart rate, and contralateral flow did not change during the study {{in spite of the}} markedly increased peripheral ANF levels recirculating from the local forearm administration. This behavior indicates that arteriolar vasodilation is apparently not the main mechanism of action of ANF on systemic hemodynamics in hypertensive patients...|$|E
40|$|Contrasting data exist about a {{possible}} modulation of the autonomic function by atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in human beings, particularly at low, biologically, significant concentrations. We have evaluated that possibility by increasing plasma ANF levels through the infusion of a synthetic analogue (WY- 47, 663, <b>anaritide)</b> in five male patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension. Nonhypotensive lower body negative pressure (- 10 mm Hg x 5 min) was used to selectively deactivate cardiopulmonary receptors and to stimulate sympathetic efferent tone reflexogenically. ANF was given at either a low rate (0. 005 micrograms/kg/min x 60 min, which was previously shown to increase plasma ANF in a range compatible with physiologic stimuli) or at a high rate (0. 05 micrograms/kg/min x 60 min, each). Administration of ANF was preceded and followed by vehicle infusion (Haemacell x 30 min). Forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography), intraarterial blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored continuously, and venous immunoreactive ANF, plasma renin activity, aldosterone level, and venous hematocrit were measured {{at the end of}} both control and infusion periods. Arterial norepinephrine values, an indirect index of sympathetic discharge, were measured at rest and during lower body negative pressure conditions. Graded systemic ANF infusion increased immunoreactive ANF and venous hematocrit, decreased aldosterone level and plasma renin activity, whereas resting norepinephrine levels, blood pressure, and heart rate did not change. Lower body negative pressure decreased forearm blood flow during vehicle infusion, but it lost its vasoconstrictor effect during infusion of ANF. To identify the site of that inhibitory action, ANF was also infused into the brachial artery at rates that raised local but not systemic levels of immunoreactive ANF.
