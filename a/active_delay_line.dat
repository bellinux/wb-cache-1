5|$|Transversal {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept {{can be found in}} a Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes a filter consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. The outputs of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required frequency function. This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to antiphase, at different sections and will tend to cancel when added. These are the frequencies rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach did not find any immediate applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an <b>active</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed data transmission.|$|E

After transient capture, each channel is fed into 128 parallel 10 -bit analog to digital converters for fast, channelparallel digitization, followed by digital readout. The fast triggering and waveform capture, channel-parallel digitization and convenient word-parallel digital readout results in a responsive and low dead-time system. Acquisition sample rates range from ~ 50 kHz to ~ 3 GHz. Analog input bandwidth was measured to be ~ 350 MHz. Temporal noise is typically equivalent to ~ 1 mV RMS, for a signal to noise ratio of ~ 2, 500 : 1, RMS. Fixed-pattern spatial noise, after on-chip digitization, is equivalent to ~ 5 mV, RMS.

In STB- 3, fringe stability is mostly affected by the attitude motion of the test bed’s instrument table relative to a pseudo-star table, with the inevitable exception of instrument vibration, thermal drift, and atmospheric fluctuations. The location of the science star relative to the guides is presumed well known (as is the case for SIM) such that the attitude vector from the instrument to the science star is a linear combination of the vectors to the guide stars.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} neural and analog computation on reconfigurable mixed-signal platforms. Many engineered {{systems could}} gain tremendous benefits by emulating neural systems. For example, neural systems are incredibly power efficient and fault-tolerant. They are also capable {{of types of}} computation that we cannot yet match with conventional computers. Neuromorphic engineers typically implement neural computation using analog circuits because they are low-power and naturally model some aspects of neurobiology. One problem with analog circuits {{is that they are}} typically inflexible. To address this shortcoming, our lab has developed reconfigurable analog systems known as Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs). This dissertation consists of two main parts. The first is the implementation of neural and analog circuits on FPAAs. We first implemented an adaptive winner-take-all circuit, which could model attention in neural systems. Next, we modeled the dendrite, which is the conductive tissue that relays inputs from synapses to the neuron cell body. We also implemented a subtractive music synthesizer, perhaps providing the electronic music synthesis community with a good platform for experimentation. Finally, we conducted a number of neural learning experiments on a neuromorphic platform. The second part of this dissertation includes design aspects of new FPAAs, including configurable blocks that can be used as current-mode DACs in a digitally-enhanced FPAA, the RASP 2. 9 v. We also consider the design of a new neuromorphic platform containing 256 neurons and over 200, 000 synapses, many with learning capability. We also created an <b>active</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> {{that could be used for}} beamforming or FIR filter applications.

These circuits depend on analog circuits and careful tailoring for each new process, and making them fault tolerant is an incompletely solved problem. Until now, all digital PLLs have been restricted to sampled data DSP techniques and not available for the highest frequency baseband applications. This paper presents the design and preliminary evaluation of an all-digital baseband technique built entirely with an easily portable 10 -cell digital library. The library is also described, as it aids in research and low volume design porting to new processes.

This paper will be devoted to the theoretical and experimental studies of <b>active</b> coupled resonator <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> High-quality (Q) factor resonators are strongly dispersive systems {{which can be used}} to control the group velocity of light. As it is the case for atomic systems the dispersion properties of these artificial media is dependent on their absorption or optical gain. Moreover by coupling several resonators it is also possible to tailor their transmission or high dispersion orders. For these two reasons, active coupled resonators may be of high interest for optical dispersion or <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> In the aim of practical applications, the first step consists in defining an experimental protocol allowing a resonator complete description to be obtained.

Although the jitter performance is not as fine as that of optical-based <b>delay</b> <b>lines,</b> extensive work to produce sub-picosecond jitter performance CMOS <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> is actively undertaken by many parties {{due to the fact that}} IC-based <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> are robust in terms of system integration and cost reduction when compared to their optical counterpart. The second issue is in realizing a long delay range that is linear with high-resolution delay steps simultaneously (Xanthopoulos 2009). Fine-resolution CMOS <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> cannot simply be cascaded like optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> because <b>delay</b> increments are non-linear mainly due to the complex nature of the parasitic capacitance network in the delay elements of the <b>delay</b> <b>line.</b> The cascading methodology also leads to a complex PCB implementation. Thus, a single chip solution should be developed to overcome these shortcomings.|$|R

In this paper, {{we are interested in}} another aspect of queueing theory, the theory to construct queues via switched <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> We consider three types of discrete-time queues: linear compressors, non-overtaking <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> and flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> These three types of queues correspond to certain conditional nonblocking switches and (strict sense) nonblocking switches in switching theory. Analogous to their counterparts in switching theory, there exist multistage constructions for these three types of queues. Specifically, we develop a two-stage construction of a linear compressor and a three-stage construction of a non-overtaking <b>delay</b> <b>line.</b> Similarly, there is a three-stage construction of a flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line.</b> Moreover, a flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> can also be constructed by a layered Cantor network.
