A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full fecundity. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination.

However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.B. cuneata is very unusual in apparently suffering no seed loss due to granivory. In nearly all other species, burrowing insect larvae eat a large proportion of seeds, and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat. The seed-eating insects are mostly species-specific, and it appears that no insect species has adapted to B. cuneata. Possible reasons for this are the very low seed counts, and the rarity of the species, both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species. There is also no evidence of granivores feeding on seed after it has fallen. As a result, this species has the highest rate of seed viability recorded for a Banksia species: in one study, 74% of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable. This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old, about 90% of which is viable. After the ninth year, viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and senescence sets in. Seed production itself starts very slowly. On average, plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy. Storage increases exponentially, however, and 25-year-old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds. Seed production probably never plateaus. In fact, by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches more often than not. As plants age, branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death, and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years.|$|E

The components of the OPTR are the compressor, transfer line, <b>after</b> <b>cooler,</b> regenerator, cold heat exchanger, pulse tube, hot heat exchanger, orifice valve (usually a needle valve to control the mass flow rate) and the buffer.

The effect of axial conduction on performance of pulse tube refrigerator is also analyzed by introducing the wall thickness. The results show that the no-load temperature reached in the cold heat exchanger of IPTR in-line configuration is lower compared to other models.

The simulations represent a fully-coupled system operating in steady periodic mode, without any arbitrary assumptions. The objective was to examine the extent of multi-dimensional flow effects in an inertance tube pulse tube cryocoolers, and their impact on the performance of these cryocoolers. 	Computer simulations were performed for two complete ITPTC systems that were geometrically similar except for the length-to-diameter ratios of their regenerators and pulse tubes. For each ITPTC system three separate simulations were performed, one with an adiabatic cold-end heat exchanger (CHX), one with a known cooling heat load, and one with a pre-specified CHX temperature. Each simulation would start with an assumed uniform system temperature, and continue until steady periodic conditions were achieved. 	The results indicate that CFD simulations are capable of elucidating the complex periodic processes in PTCs very well. The simulation results also show that a one-dimensional modeling of PTCs is appropriate only when all the components of the PTC have very large aspect ratios (i. e., L/D >> 1). Significant multi-dimensional flow effects occur at the vicinity of component-to-component junctions, and secondary-flow recirculation patterns develop, when one or more components of the PTC system have small aspect ratios. The simulation results, although limited in scope, also suggest that ITPTCs will have a better overall performance if they are made of components with large aspect ratios. M. S.

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of herbivores on plant {{communities}} is needed for anticipating how variation in grazing regimes will impact natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Prominent ecological hypotheses predict that drastic reductions of herbivory, as have occurred in many European mountains, will trigger fast diversity loss and structural changes in grasslands, because grazing tolerant species {{are expected to be}} rapidly replaced by taller and more competitive species. The aims of this study were to test generalizations of herbivory effects (mostly from lowlands) in high elevation grasslands over ecological relevant times scales, and to unravel the contribution of climatic conditions to observed changes. Species richness, canopy height, plant community structure, and transition probabilities among ecological groups were monitored throughout 19 years in herbivore exclusions and control plots in the Central Pyrenees. We used ordination analyses to track the long-term community response to herbivore exclusion, and generalized additive models to assess the non-linear effects of herbivore exclusion and climatic conditions on measured variables. Contrary to expectations, herbivore exclusion did not significantly affect species richness, and although canopy height increased, it was not drastic enough to suppress shade intolerant species. The strongest shifts in plant community structure and transition probabilities between ecological groups occurred during a sequence of warm and dry growing seasons, whereas in control plots, these changes were smaller, and largely reversed <b>after</b> <b>cooler</b> and wetter climatic conditions returned. Our results suggest that long-term effects of grazing cessation in high elevation grasslands can be weaker and slower than predicted. However, these effects can act synergistically with dry and warm events. Therefore, the maintenance of past grazing activities can be key in the face of ongoing climatic warming. We thank F.

40|$|After {{decades of}} rapid development, {{the absence of}} moving parts in the cold head, low vibration, long {{lifetime}} and high reliability, pulse tube refrigerators are the most promising cryo-coolers. Because of these momentous advantages, they are widely used in Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs), cooling of infrared sensors, low noise electronic amplifiers, missiles and military helicopters, superconducting magnets, liquefaction of gases, gamma ray spectrometers, liquefaction of gases, X-ray devices and high temperature superconductors etc. It has also got wide applications in preservation of live biological materials {{as well as in}} scientific equipment. It is essential to accurate modelling of the pulse tube cryocooler and predicts its performance, thereby arrive at optimum design. At the current stage of worldwide research, such accurate models are not readily available in open literature. Further, the complexity of the periodic flow in the PTR makes analysis difficult. Although different models are available to simulate pulse tube cryocoolers, the models have its limitations and also range of applicability. In order to accurately predict and improve the performance of the PTR system a reasonably thorough understanding of the thermos fluid- process in the system is required. One way to understand the processes is by numerically solving the continuum governing equations based on fundamental principles, without making arbitrary simplified assumptions. The recent availability of powerful computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software that is capable of rigorously modelling of transient and multidimensional flow and heat transfer process in complexgeometries provides a good opportunity for analysis of PTRs. Performance evaluation and parametric studies of an Inertance tube pulse tube refrigerator (ITPTR) and an orifice pulse tube refrigerator (OPTR) are carried out.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 In rural Alaska, {{there are}} about 180 villages that run {{independent}} electrical power systems using diesel generator sets. A diesel engine generator loses fuel {{energy in the form}} of waste heat through the charge air cooler (<b>after</b> <b>cooler),</b> the jacket water cooler, friction, and exhaust. Diesel engine jacket water and exhaust account for about 20 % and 30 % of the total fuel energy, respectively. In previous studies it has been demonstrated that about 80 % of the heat present in jacket water and 50 % of the heat from exhaust gases can be recovered for useful purposes such as heating, power generation, refrigeration, and desalination. In this study, the diesel engine waste heat application selected was power generation using an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) heat engine. The basic principle of an ORC system {{is similar to that of}} the traditional steam Rankine cycle; the only difference is the working fluid. The working fluids generally used in an ORC are refrigerants, such as R 11, R 113, R 123, R 134 a, R 245 fa, and HFE- 7000. The working fluid in the ORC system under study is R 245 fa. A typical ORC consists of a pump, preheater, evaporator, expansion machine (expander), and condenser. The working fluid is pressurized through the pump and supplied to the preheater and evaporator, where it is heated by the heat source. The working fluid exits the evaporator as vapor or liquid/vapor. It expands in the expander, generating power. The low-pressure working fluid exiting the expansion machine is liquefied in the condenser by a cooling source, returned to the pump, and the cycle repeats. At the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) power plant, a lab experimental setup was designed: a hot water loop (heat source) and cold water loop (heat sink) for testing the 50 kW ORC power unit. Different diesel engine waste heat recovery conditions were simulated to study the unit's reliability and performance. After lab testing, the ORC system was installed permanently on a 2 MW Caterpillar diesel engine for jacket water heat recovery in Tok, Alaska, and tested further. These two tests provide for the goals of the present dissertation which are: (i) testing of a 50 kW ORC system for different heat source and heat sink supply conditions, (ii) develop guidelines on applying the present 50 kW ORC system for individual rural Alaska diesel gen-sets, (iii) develop empirical models for the screw expander, (iv) develop heat transfer correlations for single-phase and two-phase evaporation, and two-phase condensation for refrigerant R 245 fa in the preheater, evaporator and condenser, respectively, and (v) parametric modeling and validation of the present ORC system using the empirical correlations developed for a screw expander and R 245 fa in heat exchangers to predict the performance of the ORC system for individual diesel generator sets. The lab experimental data were used to plot performance maps for the power unit. These maps were plotted with respect to hot water supply temperature for different ORC parameters, such as heat input to power unit in evaporator and preheater, heat rejection by power unit in condenser, operating power output, payback period, and emissions. An example of how performance maps can be used is included in this dissertation. As detailed in this dissertation, the resulting lab experimental data were used to develop guidelines for independent diesel power plant personnel installing this ORC power unit. The factors influencing selection of a waste heat recovery application (heating or power) are also discussed. A procedure to find a match between the ORC system and any rural diesel generator set is presented. Based on annual electrical load information published in Power Cost Equalization data for individual villages, a list of villages where this ORC system could potentially be beneficial is included. During lab work at the UAF power plant, experimental data were also collected on the refrigerant side (R 245 fa) of the ORC system. Inlet and outlet pressures and temperatures of each component (evaporator, pump, and expander) of the ORC were measured. Two empirical models to predict screw expander power output were developed. The first model was based on polytropic work output, and the second was based on isentropic work output. Both models predicted screw expander power output within ± 10 % error limits. Experimental data pertaining to the preheater, evaporator, and condenser were used to develop R 245 fa heat transfer correlations for single-phase and two-phase evaporation and two-phase condensation in respective heat exchangers. For this study the preheater, evaporator, and condenser were brazed plate heat exchangers (BPHEs). For single-phase heat transfer in the preheater, a Dittus-Boelter type of correlation was developed for R 245 fa and hot water. For R 245 fa evaporation in the evaporator, two heat transfer correlations were proposed based on two-phase equation formats given in the literature. For condensation of R 245 fa in the condenser, one heat transfer correlation was proposed based on a format given in the literature. All the proposed heat transfer correlations were observed to have good agreement with experimental data. Finally, an ORC parametric model for predicting power unit performance (such as power output, heat input, and heat rejection) was developed using the screw expander model and proposed heat transfer correlations for R 245 fa in heat exchangers. The inputs for the parametric model are heating fluid supply conditions (flow rate and temperature) and cooling fluid supply conditions, generally the only information available in rural Alaska power plant locations. The developed ORC parametric model was validated using both lab experimental data and field installation data. Validation has shown that the ORC computation model is acceptable for predicting ORC performance for different individual diesel gen-sets...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of prestressing steel at elevated temperatures and <b>after</b> <b>cooling</b> {{are essential to}} the fire resistance design and post-fire evaluation of residual load-carrying capacity of prestressed concrete structures. Although previous tests have provided useful results of {{mechanical properties}} of prestressing steel at elevated temperatures, the data obtained are somewhat scattered and still insufficient. Furthermore, few empirical formulas fitting the deterioration of prestressing steel at elevated temperatures and <b>after</b> <b>cooling</b> can be found. This study therefore aims to extend the existing database with reliable data obtained by an accurate testing system. The study focuses on the mechanical properties of prestressing steel at elevated temperatures and <b>after</b> <b>cooling</b> by employing the central core wire of prestressing strand. Grade 1860 strands to GB/T 5224 mostly used in Mainland China and Grade 1860 strands to BS 5896 used in European countries are tested. The results are obtained using the steady-state method and compared with those from available literature and design standards. postprin...|$|R
