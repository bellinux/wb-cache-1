5|$|And matters {{continued}} {{thus for}} a considerable time. But a sedition and civil war came upon the wretched people and turned their cruelty toward us against one another. So we breathed for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> as they ceased from their rage against us. But presently the change from that milder reign was announced to us, and great fear of what was threatened seized us.|$|E
5|$|After Picard is {{returned}} to the schoolroom, the lead Ferengi threatens to harm the children if Riker does not unlock the computer and teach his lieutenant how to operate the Enterprise. Riker pretends to instruct the Ferengi officer, but only spouts deliberately meaningless technobabble as he unlocks the computer console in Picard's schoolroom. With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a transporter safety function. With help from Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko (Brian Bonsall), Guinan, and Ro, they use communication badges to trap most of the Ferengi on a transporter pad with their weapons disarmed and the exit blocked by a force field. Once {{most of them are}} detained, the children and Riker are able to overpower the remaining members and retake the Enterprise. After the events, the transporter is used to return Picard, Guinan, and Keiko to their adult states. Ro, buoyed by her experience, decides to remain a child for just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer and draw some pictures, something she never did during her childhood.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Isabella {{misses a}} meeting {{she set up}} with Rook, and does {{not return to the}} class. Through Amie texts and wall posts, the other {{students}} insinuate that she committed suicide, while the school is unable to provide Rook with any contact information for her. Class continues without her, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> later Arianna, if the player rejected her earlier in the game, makes another attempt to have a relationship with Rook. The player may choose to accept or reject her again. Through Amie, Rook learns that both Charlotte and Kendall wish to resume their relationship, and can influence Charlotte to try again or not, which changes whether or not they get back together. Taylor jealously and unsuccessfully tries to drive a wedge between Nolan and Akira.|$|E
25|$|I guess {{though you}} could {{honestly}} say {{the relationship between}} Greg (Chappell) and myself, {{when he came back}} from World Series Cricket, {{and all of a sudden}} I was playing in Queensland with him, was difficult for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E

On 31 October Circe captured Palinure.|$|E
25|$|According to the Sifra, {{some say}} that Nadab and Abihu died because earlier, when at Sinai they were walking behind Moses and Aaron, they remarked to each other how in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> the two old men would die, and they would head the congregation. And God said that we would see who would bury whom.|$|E

25|$|The Attacker {{had a brief}} {{career with}} the Fleet Air Arm, not seeing any action during its time with the FAA and being taken out of {{first-line}} service in 1954. It remained in service with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer, being taken out of service in early 1957. The Attacker was replaced in the front line squadrons by the later and more capable Hawker Sea Hawk and de Havilland Sea Venom.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 {{two of the}} 737-200s were {{replaced}} by Boeing 737-400s (C2-RN10 and 'RN11), leaving the venerable C2-RN3 (kept because it was convertible between passenger and freight configurations) to soldier on for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer. The airline, by now only operating a single 737-400, was corporatised in July 1996 as the Nauru Air Corporation (NAC) headed by a new CEO without ties to the government, enabling it to operate independently in a commercial marketplace, free from most of its government constraints.|$|E
25|$|In 1807 Captain George Reynolds {{replaced}} Wise, who {{had become}} ill and who remained in the West Indies for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> to recuperate before returning home.

Her role became one of conveying supplies to the various squadrons blockading French ports. On 15 March 1808 Mediator recaptured the Swedish ship Maria Christiana. In May 1808 Captain John Pasco managed to obtain the command of Mediator for three months.|$|E

25|$|Under heavy fire, the U.S. 35th Regiment {{infantry}} {{soldiers and}} dismounted 10th Cavalry troops advanced across the Mexico–US border through {{the buildings and}} streets of Nogales, Sonora and up onto the nearby hilltops. This was done while other units of the 35th Regiment held the main line near the border post. About 7:45pm, the Mexicans waved a large white flag of surrender over their customs building. Lt. Colonel Herman observed and then ordered an immediate cease fire. Snipers on both sides continued shooting for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> after the cease fire, but were eventually silenced upon orders from their superiors.|$|E

While Kanin was acting in Irwin Shaw's Bury the Dead, {{she came to the}} attention of Michael Kanin, who had just been hired as a writer in the B unit. Michael was trained as an artist and had turned to commercial art and painting scenery for burlesque houses to help support his parents during the Depression. They were introduced by a mutual friend, and Michael practically asked Kanin to marry him right then and there, but it took her <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> to come around to the idea.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} Anglicisation {{of the upper}} classes in general has {{happened}} before the Anglicisation of the peasantry in other areas which have given up speaking Celtic languages it is not implausible that the peasantry continued to speak Cumbric for at least <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> after. Around 1200 there {{is a list of}} the names of men living in the area of Peebles. Amongst them are Cumbric names such as Gospatrick: servant or follower of Saint Patrick, Gosmungo: servant of Saint Mungo, Guososwald: servant of Oswald of Northumbria and Goscubrycht: servant of Cuthbert. Two of the saints– Oswald and Cuthbert— are from Northumbria showing influence on Cumbric not found in Welsh.|$|E

25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band. My whole idea was to play the {{saxophone}} and I really wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause we were really great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that really made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really and I thought Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while.</b> – Joe Camilleri.|$|E
25|$|While the fruitless {{negotiations}} {{were taking place}} the Fallschirmjägers were preparing {{to move away from}} their stronghold and find a new place to fight from. The arrival of the two Norwegian mortars had completely changed the tactical situation and the German force′s supply of ammunition was also running dangerously low. Schmidt decided that he had to move his troops into a new and more defensible position. Negotiations were kept up to buy time so the paratroopers could slip away into cover of darkness. Schmidt believed that strong German forces were advancing up the Gudbrandsdal valley and that if he could hold out for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer the situation might still be salvaged. The reality of the situation was however that the German advanced units were stuck just north of Minnesund far to the south of both Gudbrandsdal and Dombås.|$|E
25|$|JR is {{diagnosed}} with Hepatitis A {{not long after}} Richie steals his bone marrow. Babe soon realizes the truth that Richie set up JR, and JR later saves Babe from being raped by two guys when she goes undercover as a prostitute to clear JR's name {{and find out what}} crimes Richie did. Richie schemes with his sister, Annie Lavery (Melissa Claire Egan), to kill Greenlee Smythe (Rebecca Budig) as a favor for Annie, but due to his own selfish needs he instead kidnaps Babe and tells her that he is in love with her. Babe is disgusted by his actions. She is later rescued by Kendall and Greenlee; they knock Richie out and tie him up. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> afterwards, Richie is freed by Annie while Kendall and Greenlee are distracted, but Annie later kills him out of frustration. His death sparks a murder mystery.|$|E
