5|$|Popular {{pressure}} {{continued for}} the establishment of the 8-hour day. At the convention of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1888, the union decided to campaign for the shorter workday again. May 1, 1890, was agreed upon as the date on which workers would strike for <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> work day.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Stanley {{was elected}} as a U.S. Representative from Kentucky's 2nd congressional district. During his tenure in the House, {{he served on}} the Committee on Mines and Mining, the Committee on Territories, and the Committee on Agriculture. He {{advocated}} for progressive reforms such as more extensive study of mine accident prevention, railroad regulation, a pure food and drug act, and <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> work day.|$|E

5|$|The ILO {{successfully}} {{restricted the}} addition of lead to paint, and convinced several countries to adopt <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> work day and forty-eight-hour working week. It also campaigned to end child labour, increase {{the rights of women}} in the workplace, and make shipowners liable for accidents involving seamen. After the demise of the League, the ILO became an agency of the United Nations in 1946.|$|E
5|$|By 1907, Sprigg {{was one of}} {{the oldest}} active members of the Allegany County bar. While {{chairman}} of the Allegany County Democratic Convention in August 1907, a resolution supporting <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> workday was formally adopted by the convention. Also that year, Sprigg received his party's nomination and unsuccessfully ran for election to the Maryland House of Delegates. In September 1908, Sprigg gave an introductory speech for William Jennings Bryan, who visited Cumberland on his Chautauqua circuit. In May 1908, the Cumberland city council appointed Sprigg as the city attorney, in which post he served during the mayoral administration of George A. Kean.|$|E
5|$|In his {{biennial}} {{message to}} the legislature in 1910, Willson called for a uniform system of accounting based on legislation recently passed in the neighboring state of Indiana. He also advocated a measure requiring full disclosure of campaign expenditures. Due to its hostility toward Willson, the Assembly scarcely considered the governor's agenda or other needed legislation such as tax reform and redistricting. The reforms Willson advocated would later pass under a Democratic administration. The few accomplishments of this legislature included making electrocution the legal form of capital punishment and establishing of <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> work day for public workers.|$|E

25|$|During the 1870s, {{eight hours}} became a central demand, {{especially}} among labour organisers, with <b>a</b> network of <b>Eight-Hour</b> Leagues which held rallies and parades. A hundred thousand workers in New York City struck {{and won the}} eight-hour day in 1872, mostly for building trades workers. In Chicago, Albert Parsons became recording secretary of the Chicago Eight-Hour League in 1878, and was appointed a member of <b>a</b> national <b>eight-hour</b> committee in 1880.|$|R
50|$|During the 90s, the company, {{despite having}} a {{clientele}} with mostly small print runs of difficult prints, was turning out {{nearly a million}} shirts a year (with only <b>a</b> single <b>eight-hour</b> shift per day) and won numerous awards despite being a relatively small business.|$|R
5|$|In the 1928 provincial election, the Liberals regained some {{of their}} lost {{popularity}} {{in one of the}} closest votes in Nova Scotia history. The Conservatives remained in power with 23 seats to the Liberals' 20. Economic conditions worsened after the stock market crash of 1929 making it seem increasingly likely that the Liberals would return to power in the next election. Macdonald helped draft a 15-point party platform for approval at a Liberal convention in the fall of 1930. It promised <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> working day and free elementary school textbooks. It also pledged to establish a formal inquiry into Nova Scotia's economic prospects and the province's place within Confederation.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats renominated former President Cleveland, {{making the}} 1892 {{election}} a rematch {{of the one}} four years earlier. The tariff revisions {{of the past four}} years had made imported goods so expensive that now many voters shifted to the reform position. Many westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to the new Populist Party candidate, James Weaver, who promised free silver, generous veterans' pensions, and <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> work day. The effects of the suppression of the Homestead Strike rebounded against the Republicans as well, although the federal government did not take action.|$|E
5|$|The Haymarket affair (also {{known as}} the Haymarket {{massacre}} or Haymarket riot) was {{the aftermath of a}} bombing that took place at a labor demonstration on Tuesday May 4, 1886, at Haymarket Square in Chicago. It began as a peaceful rally in support of workers striking for <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> day and in reaction to the killing of several workers the previous day by the police. An unknown person threw a dynamite bomb at police as they acted to disperse the public meeting. The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police officers and at least four civilians; scores of others were wounded.|$|E
50|$|Pettirossi {{received}} a scholarship {{given by the}} Paraguayan government, and in 1912 moved to France where he obtained the title of aviator pilot from the international aeronautic federation. Once he had received the title, he made many important flights, setting <b>a</b> record <b>eight-hour</b> flight.|$|R
5000|$|White was {{generally}} {{seen as one}} of the more conservative members of the court. He originated the term, the “Rule of Reason."

5|$|When Osiel {{was arrested}} in 2003, Antonio and Costilla Sánchez took {{the lead of the}} {{criminal}} organization, and Los Zetas eventually broke apart from the Gulf Cartel in 2010. However, Antonio was killed in <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> shootout between Gulf Cartel gunmen and soldiers of the Mexican Navy in Matamoros on 5 November 2010. According to the Mexican government, ten people were killed that day in Matamoros, but local media outlets suggested that over 40 people were killed by gunfire. One anonymous law enforcement officer, witnesses, and several local newspapers indicated over 100 were killed in Matamoros.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, {{and working conditions}} changed markedly in the United States during the early 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{surgeons}} recommended <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> {{procedure to}} remove the tumours; however, their size and proximity to his voice box eventually persuaded them to recommend radiotherapy, of which Boycott had 35 sessions from 22 October. By December, scans revealed {{that the majority of}} the tumours had disappeared, and the final tumour's disappearance was confirmed in early 2003. Although initially reluctant to discuss his health with the public, he spoke privately with his daughter, Emma, and then released a statement publicly, which evoked a significant emotional response. On 16 August 2003, he was given his own standing ovation by the crowd at Trent Bridge as he and a number of other cricketers did a lap of the ground in vehicles to celebrate Trent Bridge's 50th Test match.|$|E
2500|$|The general {{election}} was very heated, described by former governor Michael Dukakis as [...] "the dirtiest gubernatorial campaign in my memory". Patrick faced criticism for having once written {{letters to the}} parole board describing correspondence from Benjamin LaGuer, a man convicted of <b>a</b> brutal <b>eight-hour</b> rape, as [...] "thoughtful, insightful, eloquent, [...] humane".|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicles}} {{were not a}} commercial success. There has been some debate over the efficacy of an electric taxi. Bob Oddy, the {{general secretary of the}} Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association was quoted saying that [...] "only about 40% of London cabbies will be able to work <b>a</b> full <b>eight-hour</b> shift on <b>a</b> 100-mile charge." ...|$|R
25|$|At the end {{of every}} {{semester}} but one since 1966, WCFM has hosted <b>an</b> all-night, <b>eight-hour</b> trivia contest. Teams of students, alumni, professors, friends, and others compete to answer questions on a variety of subjects, while simultaneously identifying songs and performing designated tasks. The winning team's only prize is the obligation to create and host the following semester's contest.|$|R
5|$|Morris aided the DF {{using his}} artistic and {{literary}} talents; he designed the group's membership card, and helped author their manifesto, Socialism Made Plain, {{in which they}} demanded improved housing for workers, free compulsory education for all children, free school meals, <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> working day, the abolition of national debt, nationalisation of land, banks, and railways, and the organisation of agriculture and industry under state control and co-operative principles. Some of his DF comrades {{found it difficult to}} reconcile his socialist values with his position as proprietor of the Firm, although he was widely admired as a man of integrity. The DF began publishing a weekly newspaper, Justice, which soon faced financial losses that Morris covered. Morris also regularly contributed articles to the newspaper, in doing so befriending another contributor, George Bernard Shaw.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Victor B.2s {{had been}} {{converted}} for Strategic Reconnaissance missions following the retirement of the Valiant in this capacity. In service, this type was primarily used in surveillance of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Seas, capable of surveying 400,000 square miles in <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> mission; they were also used to sample the fallout from French nuclear tests conducted in the South Pacific. Originally reconnaissance Victors were equipped for visual reconnaissance; however, it {{was found to be}} cheaper to assign Canberra light bombers to this duty and as such the cameras were removed in 1970. Subsequently, radar-based reconnaissance was emphasised in the type's role. The reconnaissance Victors remained in use until 1974 when they followed the standard bombers into the tanker conversion line; a handful of modified Avro Vulcans assumed the maritime radar reconnaissance role in their place.|$|E
5|$|Sprigg {{relocated}} to Cumberland in 1890. He {{was one of}} three incorporators of the Allegany County Bar Association, and in 1899 he was elected by the association as one of its directors. He unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Cumberland city council in 1905 and a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates in 1907. In response to pollution of the North Branch Potomac River, Sprigg became chairman of the Pure Water League and waged a successful campaign to require the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company to abandon the sulfite process of pulping in favor of a cleaner soda pulping method. While chairman of the Allegany County Democratic Convention in 1907, a resolution supporting <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> workday was formally adopted by the convention. In 1908, he was appointed city attorney for Cumberland. Following a prolonged illness, he died in 1911.|$|E
50|$|High {{noise levels}} {{can result in}} {{cardiovascular}} effects and exposure to moderately high levels during <b>a</b> single <b>eight-hour</b> period causes <b>a</b> statistical rise in blood pressure of five to ten points {{and an increase in}} stress, and vasoconstriction leading to the increased blood pressure noted above, as well as to increased incidence of coronary artery disease.|$|R
50|$|The Italian Alenia Aeronautica Sky-Y is a self-financed MALE Unmanned air {{vehicle for}} {{demonstration}} and research purpose; on 30 October 2007 it {{set a new}} European endurance record in the over 1000 kg category with <b>a</b> spotless <b>eight-hour</b> flight.. Since 2016 manufacturer became Leonardo-Finmeccanica as Alenia Aermaccchi merged into the new Finmeccanica (definitively rebrended Leonardo since 2017).|$|R
50|$|The Government {{tried to}} appease the workers, who were clearly {{on the verge of}} insurrection. Tens of {{thousands}} of unemployed workers were returned to their jobs. The eight-hour day was declared for all workers. Thus, Spain became the first country in the world to pass <b>a</b> national <b>eight-hour</b> day law, as a result of 1919's general strike.|$|R
5|$|The {{issue of}} the tariff worked to the Republicans' {{advantage}} in 1888. The legislative revisions {{of the past four}} years also made imported goods so expensive that now many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of big business. Many Westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to James Weaver, the candidate of the new Populist Party. Weaver promised Free Silver, generous veterans' pensions, and <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> work day. The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York. At the campaign's end, many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland after an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the Homestead strike in Pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between big business and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co. The final result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes, and it was Cleveland's third consecutive popular vote plurality.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{financial}} position was poor. Supporters of the dictatorship attempted to block progress on reforming the economy. The {{redistribution of wealth}} supported by the new government seemed {{a threat to the}} richest, in light of the recent Wall Street Crash and the onset of the Great Depression. The government attempted to tackle the dire poverty in rural areas by instituting <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> day and giving the security of tenure to farm workers. Landlords complained. The effectiveness of the reforms was dependent on the skill of the local governance, which was often badly lacking. Changes to the military were needed and education reform was another problem facing the Republic. The relationship between central government and the Basque and Catalan regions also needed to be decided.|$|E
5|$|The revolutionary {{committee}} {{headed by}} Niceto Alcalá-Zamora became the provisional government, with Zamora as the President and Head of State. The Republic had broad support from {{all segments of}} society; elections in June 1931 returned {{a large majority of}} Republicans and Socialists. With the onset of the Great Depression, the government attempted to assist rural Spain by instituting <b>an</b> <b>eight-hour</b> day and giving tenure to farm workers. Land reform and working conditions remained important issues throughout the lifetime of the Republic. Fascism remained a reactive threat, helped by controversial reforms to the military. In December a new reformist, liberal, and democratic constitution was declared. The constitution secularised the government, and this, coupled with their slowness to respond to a wave of anti-clerical violence prompted committed Catholics to become disillusioned with the incumbent coalition government. In October 1931 Manuel Azaña became Prime Minister of a minority government. The Right won the elections of 1933 following an unsuccessful uprising by General José Sanjurjo in August 1932, who would later lead the coup that started the civil war.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of safe-driving training on risk perception isinvestigated. 228 subjects {{took part in}} <b>an</b> <b>eight-hours</b> safe-driving training including four driving exercises, simulating risk situations in everyday driving contexts, such as someone suddenly crossing the road or driving on slippery road surface. Before and after the training, all the subjects were submitted a questionnaire to test the risk perception in everyday driving environment (RIPAQ, Risk Perception in Action Questionnaire). Repeated measures ANOVA showed {{a significant increase in}} the estimate of risk incidental to some situations, like “using your mobile while driving”, “not fastening the lifebelt” or “driving at a speed of 60 km/h in the city center”, but not to other ones, as “avoiding slowing down next to a cross road”. Data are discussed in the light of the dual process theory about risk perception: the emotional component seems to be more aroused by the safe-driving experience than the analytic one...|$|R
50|$|In 1971, the It Is Written {{production}} studios {{moved to}} the Adventist Media Center in Thousand Oaks, California. In 1975, Vandeman began conducting Revelation Seminars.
