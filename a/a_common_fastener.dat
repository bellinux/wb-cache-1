This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s along two separate paths that soon converged: the mass production of wood screws screws made of metal to be used in wood in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, toolroom-style production of machine screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).|$|E

When wiring {{something that did}} not come with pre-drilled fasteners stock, however, the more cost-effective way (as opposed to replacing all stock fasteners with pre-drilled ones of the same type) is often to drill the stock fasteners.|$|R

50|$|Crossbars were {{historically}} <b>common,</b> simple <b>fasteners</b> consisting simply of a plank or beam {{mounted to}} one side of a door by a set of cleats. The board could be slid past the frame to block the door. Alternatively, the bar can be a separate piece that is placed into open cleats or hooks, extending across the frame on both sides. The effect of this device is essentially the opposite of the crash bar in that its operation is to permit the door to be opened inward rather than outward. On a set of double doors, the same principle works, but needn't extend past the frame. The bar simply extends into another set of cleats on the other door such as to interfere with the door opening.|$|R
