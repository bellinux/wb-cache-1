5|$|Scáthach teaches Cú Chulainn <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> of war, {{including}} the use of the Gáe Bulg, a terrible barbed spear, thrown with the foot, that has to be cut out of its victim. His fellow trainees include Ferdiad, who becomes Cú Chulainn's best friend and foster-brother. During his time there, Scáthach faces a battle against Aífe, her rival and in some versions her twin sister. Scáthach, knowing Aífe's prowess, fears for Cú Chulainn's life and gives him a powerful sleeping potion to keep him from the battle. However, because of Cú Chulainn's great strength, it only puts him to sleep for an hour, and he soon joins the fray. He fights Aífe in single combat, and the two are evenly matched, but Cú Chulainn distracts her by calling out that Aífe's horses and chariot, the things she values most in the world, have fallen off a cliff, and seizes her. With his sword at her throat, he agrees to spare her life on the condition that she call off her enmity with Scáthach, and bear him a son.|$|E
5|$|Sociology of literature, film, and art is {{a subset}} of the {{sociology}} of culture. This field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire, translated by Susan Emanuel as Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field (1996). None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts,</b> literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.|$|E

25|$|The monasteries, which {{sometimes}} also functioned as cathedrals, and the cathedrals that had bodies of secular clergy often living in community, were {{a major source}} of power in Europe. Bishops and the abbots of important monasteries lived and functioned like princes. The monasteries were the major seats of learning of all sorts. Benedict had ordered that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> were to be taught and practiced in the monasteries. Within the monasteries books were transcribed by hand, and few people outside the monasteries could read or write.|$|E
25|$|The 18th century {{witnessed}} {{three major}} changes in the production of Shakespeare's plays. In England, the development of the star system transformed both acting and production; {{at the end of the}} century, the Romantic revolution touched acting as it touched <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts.</b> At the same time, actors and producers began to return to Shakespeare's texts, slowly weeding out the Restoration revisions. Finally, by the end of the century Shakespeare's plays had been established as part of the repertory outside of Great Britain: not only in the United States but in many European countries.|$|E
25|$|It {{may have}} been out of this {{atmosphere}} that there was formed a tradition which, going underground for centuries and suffering transformations in the process, appeared in the Middle Ages as the Ars Notoria, a magical art of memory attributed to Apollonius or sometimes to Solomon. The practitioner of the Ars Notoria gazed at figures or diagrams curiously marked and called 'notae' whilst reciting magical prayers. He hoped to gain in this way knowledge, or memory, of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> and sciences, a different 'nota' being provided for each discipline. The Ars Notoria is perhaps a descendant of the classical art of memory, or of that difficult branch of it which used the shorthand notae. It was regarded as a particularly black kind of magic and was severely condemned by Thomas Aquinas.|$|E

25|$|The highest {{civilization and}} culture, {{apart from the}} ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found {{exclusively}} among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All {{this is due to}} the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.|$|E
25|$|Germany's {{defeat in}} World War I, {{the fall of}} the German monarchy and the {{abolition}} of censorship under the new, liberal Weimar Republic allowed an upsurge of radical experimentation in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts,</b> which had been suppressed by the old regime. Many Germans of left-wing views were influenced by the cultural experimentation that followed the Russian Revolution, such as constructivism. Such influences can be overstated: Gropius did not share these radical views, and said that Bauhaus was entirely apolitical. Just as important was the influence of the 19th century English designer William Morris, who had argued that art should meet the needs of society and {{that there should be no}} distinction between form and function. Thus, the Bauhaus style, also known as the International Style, was marked by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or a building and its design.|$|E
500|$|Advertisements, {{specifically}} {{ones that}} show the family, commentate on the transition from modernity to postmodernity. This transition is the transition of middle class nuclear families where heterosexuality is the norm to the recognition and acceptance {{of a variety of}} different family types, an embracing of societal polysexuality and plurality; it is furthermore the transition from mass culture to the prevalence of sub-cultures and multiculturalism.

2500|$|The art of Laurencin (and {{women more}} generally) brought a [...] "new vision {{full of the}} joy of the universe", an [...] "entirely {{feminine}} aesthetic" [...] writes Apollinaire.

[...] "Her art dances, like Salome, between that of Picasso, who like a new John the Baptist bathes <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> in a baptism of light, and that of Rousseau, a sentimental Herod."
