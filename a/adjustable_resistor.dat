50|$|The basic {{sensitivity}} of a meter might be, for instance, 100 microamperes full scale (with a voltage drop of, say, 50 millivolts at full current). Such meters are often calibrated {{to read some}} other quantity that {{can be converted to}} a current of that magnitude. The use of current dividers, often called shunts, allows a meter to be calibrated to measure larger currents. A meter can be calibrated as a DC voltmeter if the resistance of the coil is known by calculating the voltage required to generate a full scale current. A meter can be configured to read other voltages by putting it in a voltage divider circuit. This is generally done by placing a resistor in series with the meter coil. A meter can be used to read resistance by placing it in series with a known voltage (a battery) and an <b>adjustable</b> <b>resistor.</b> In a preparatory step, the circuit is completed and the resistor adjusted to produce full scale deflection. When an unknown resistor is placed in series in the circuit the current will be less than full scale and an appropriately calibrated scale can display the value of the previously unknown resistor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{very wide}} tuning range MOSFET-C filter has been introduced. The wide tuning range in this filter has been {{achieved}} without using any switchable components or programmable building blocks, while, the cutoff frequency of the filter can be adjusted simply through a controlling bias current. The filter has a low-pass characteristics with fc = 20 Hz to 184 kHz while exhibiting a constant power consumption per cutoff frequency over its entire tuning range. The proposed MOSFET-C filter uses PMOS transistors in subthreshold regime for implementing floating and widely <b>adjustable</b> <b>resistors.</b> The ultra high resistivity of the resistances make them very suitable for implementing very low frequency and compact filters. Implemented in 0. 18 µm CMOS technology, the filter exhibits a relatively constant noise and linearity performance over its entire tuning range.

40|$|Improvements in cell {{metallization}} {{result in}} busbars with high resistance or of non-continuous or nonuniform geometry. Measurements of bare solar cells at calibration laboratories demand a procedure which {{is free of}} any influence of lab-specific contacting schemes. For most large area cells with front side contacts shadowing of the active cell area by the contacting unit during current-voltage measurements cannot be avoided. We present an advanced multiple step measurement procedure as performed at the Fraunhofer ISE calibration laboratory which is suitable for many actual metallisation schemes. We explain the requirements for the measurement setup and discuss the influence of contacting resistances. Insights are transferred to current-voltage measurements of cells with an unequal collection of current per busbar. For those cells, we propose a new measurement technique with <b>adjustable</b> <b>resistors</b> to enable homogeneous operating conditions across the cell. We demonstrate the influence on fill factor measurements with circuit simulations and validate our method experimentally with a specially designed solar cell...|$|R

The effects of the exposed edge plane site density, inherent resistance of the carbon electrode, and <b>adjustable</b> <b>resistors</b> on the HET kinetics of several outer- and inner-sphere redox couples including [Fe(CN) 6] 3 -/ 4 -, Ru(NH 3) 6 3 +/ 2 +, Fe 3 +/ 2 +, dopamine, ascorbic acid, and uric acid are investigated using three kinds of carbon electrodes composed of core-shell quasi-aligned nanofiber arrays (QANFAs). The internal resistance is found to be a key factor affecting the HET kinetics and electrochemical biosensing properties. The electrodes exhibit high selectivity and sensitivity in dopamine detection in the presence of ascorbic acid and uric acid. In addition to the promising application to electrochemical biosensing, the core-shell TiC/C QANFAs encompassing a highly electroactive carbon shell and conductive TiC core provide insights into the design and construction of the ideal carbon electrode.

For many of these purposes it is important to quantitatively validate the dynamic response of the models in terms of the input impedance (Z = oscillatory pressure/oscillatory flow). To address this need, the authors developed an improved physical model. Using a computer study, the authors first identified the configuration of lumped parameter elements in a model of the systemic circulation; the result was a good match with human aortic input impedance with a minimum number of elements. Design, construction, and testing of a hydraulic model analogous to the computer model followed. Numeric results showed that a three element model with two resistors and one compliance produced reasonable matching without undue complication.

40|$|The voltage-biased SQUID {{bootstrap}} circuit (SBC) {{is suitable for}} achieving simple and low-noise direct readout of dc SQUIDs. In practice, an ideal voltage bias is difficult to realize because of non-zero internal resistance R-in of the bias voltage source. In order to clearly observe the influence of R-in on the SBC parameters (namely the flux-to-current transfer coefficient (partial derivative I=partial derivative Phi) (SBC) and the dynamic resistance R-d(SBC)) and the noise performance, we introduced an additional <b>adjustable</b> <b>resistor</b> R-ad at room temperature to simulate a variable R-in between the SQUID and the preamplifier. We found that the measured SQUID flux noise does not rise, even though R-ad increases significantly. This result demonstrates that a highly resistive connection can be inserted between the liquid-helium-cooled SQUID and the room-temperature readout electronics in the SBC scheme, thus reducing the conductive heat loss of the system. This work will be significant for developing multichannel SBC readout systems, e. g. for biomagnetism, and systems using SQUIDs as amplifiers, for example, in TES-array readout...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} emulsification of aqueous liquid in immiscible organic liquid in various microfluidic environments, and addresses both experimental characterization and theoretical {{interpretation of the}} dynamics and design guidelines, {{as well as an}} application of microfluidic emulsification in fabrication of disk-like colloidal particle suspensions for studying its sedimentation behavior. In an attempt to understand the dynamics of drop formation in flow-focusing microfluidic channels, especially for an explanation of a transition from unique drop size to bimodal oscillating drop sizes as observed in the experiments, numerical simulation is developed to use the volume-of-fraction method to model the drop formation, and the simulation results help to interpret the transition in the theory of saddle-node transition in drop formation, as well as show the importance of selecting proper orifice length in flow-focusing microfluidic channel design. The electric technique for controlling of microfluidic emulsification is explored by a detailed study on low-frequency alternating-current electro-flow-focusing (EFF) emulsification in microfluidic channels. It is found that the droplet size variation is not a monotonic function of the electric field {{as in the case of}} direct-current EFF emulsification, which originates from the relaxation oscillation of the flow rate through the Taylor cone, and a power-law droplet size distribution was obtained at the voltage ramping-up stage. This emulsification process was modeled in analog to the charge accumulation and release in a resistor-capacitor electric circuit with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>resistor,</b> and the simulated data exhibit good agreement with the experiments. As an application of the microfluidic emulsification, a method of fabricating disk-like wax colloidal particle suspensions using electrospray is reported.
