50|$|<b>Absolute</b> <b>{{specific}}ity</b> can {{be thought}} of as being exclusive, in which an enzyme acts upon one specific substrate. Absolute specific enzymes will only catalyze one reaction with its specific substrate. For example, lactase is an enzyme specific for the degradation of lactose into two sugar monosaccharides, glucose and galactose. Another example is Glucokinase, which is an enzyme involved in the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. It is primarily active in the liver and is the main isozyme of Hexokinase. Its <b>absolute</b> <b>specificity</b> refers to glucose being the only hexose that is able to be its substrate, as opposed to hexokinase, which accommodates many hexoses as its substrate.|$|E

The {{amino acid}} compositions, N-terminal amino acid sequences, sensitivities to chemical reagents, and catalytic {{properties of the}} two enzymes were determined. Both enzymes showed <b>absolute</b> <b>specificities</b> for their substrates. The subunit molecular weights of mannitol- 1 -phosphate and glucitol- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenases were 40, 000 and 26, 000, respectively; the apparent molecular weights of the native proteins, determined by gel filtration, were 40, 000 and 117, 000, respectively. It is therefore concluded that whereas mannitol- 1 -phosphate dehydrogenase is a monomer, glucitol- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase is probably a tetramer. These two proteins differed in several fundamental respects...|$|R

40|$|The clonal {{heterogeneity}} of nine monoclonal antibodies with <b>absolute</b> <b>specificities</b> for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was analyzed. These monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies were generated {{in three different}} fusion experiments using autoimmune (NZB X NZW) F 1 mouse spleen cells. Isoelectric focusing analyses demonstrated different isoelectric points within the IgG 2 a and IgG 2 b subclasses. Three anti-idiotypic antisera were prepared (one in a rabbit and two in mice) against two monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies. These antisera detected idiotypic determinants uniquely associated with homologous hybridoma anti-DNA antibodies. Two of these idiotypes could be detected at low levels in the sera of (NZB X NZW) F 1 mice. Anti-PME 77 idiotypic antiserum had no effect in vitro on the total binding capacity of (NZB X NZW) F 1 sera. Taken together these results demonstrate that, in (NZB X NZW) F 1 mice, the anti-DNA antibody repertoire contains molecules that show similar antigen binding characteristics but are not structurally uniform...|$|R

5000|$|Altogether {{there are}} about 17,000 tactile afferents in the glabrous skin area of one hand. They are of four {{distinct}} types. Two kinds of afferents have small receptive fields suited for high spatial resolution (Merkel and Meissner). They are particularly numerous in the pulp of the finger, a region often engaged in exploration of object properties. Pacini units are extremely sensitive to fast movements whereas spatial resolution is poor. Ruffini units are characterized by high sensitivity to skin stretch and forces acting on the nails. Micro-stimulation has shown that input from one single Meissner, Merkel, or Pacini unit may produce a distinct and differential percept {{in the mind of}} the subject indicating an <b>absolute</b> <b>specificity</b> within the tactile system. It has even been demonstrated that a single impulse in a Meissner afferent may produce a percept.In contrast, no percept is reported when a single Ruffini afferent is stimulated which might indicate that spatial summation is required. Consistent with the perceptive findings, neural responses in the somatosensory cortex have been recorded on micro-stimulation of single afferents connected to Meissner, Merkel, Pacini endings but not with single Ruffini afferents. On the basis of collateral studies in man and monkey a very tight match has been claimed between magnitude estimation of sensation of skin deformation, on the one hand, and response of Merkel afferents in the mnonkey, on the other. In man, deviations from such a linear relation was found in combined psychophysical and microneurography recordings. In the hairy skin Meissner units are lacking altogether. Instead there are hair follicle and field afferents which have large receptive fields while Merkel, Pacini, and Ruffini are present. Cutaneous Ruffini units in the hairy skin are important for position sense and kinesthesia as pointed out in another section. A caveat is justified with regard to end organ norphology. The four kinds of units considered above were physiologically identified in man (FA/RA and SA units, i.e. fast and slowly adapting type I and type II, [...] ) whereas end organ morphology has been inferred on the basis of animal studies. Particularly, it seems likely that SAII afferents may be connected to other morphological structures than the classical Ruffini ending.|$|E

30|$|The {{thorough}} kinetic {{analyses revealed}} that the transfer of glucose moiety onto a mammalian sterol or cholesterol can be catalyzed by MrSGT, but at a catalytic efficiency (17.5  min− 1  mM− 1) of only 20  % of that for β-sitosterol (81.2  min− 1  mM− 1). It is, thus, obvious that while MrSGT can utilize the two PSs as well as cholesterol as substrates, β-sitosterol is its preferred substrate. These {{results are consistent with}} our previous findings (Hoang et al. 2016) of the highest bioconversion rates obtained from the MrSGT reactions with β-sitosterol, but differ from the findings on other bacterial SGTs (Smith 1971; Lebrun et al. 2006; Thuan et al. 2013) which have been previously characterized.
