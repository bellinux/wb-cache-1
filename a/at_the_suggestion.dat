With feedback on the script from director Rudy Soedjarwo and after a period reading old, successful scripts, Aristo– at the time a film reviewer for a magazine– was able to befriend Hanung Bramantyo, who asked him to write a script about brownies.

In 2010, he released his directorial debut, Jakarta Maghrib.|$|E

5|$|In 1467, Catherine sailed {{towards the}} Italian Peninsula, {{possibly}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> of the Veronese humanist Leonardo Montagna, who dedicated two poems to her.

5|$|In 2003, in {{an effort}} to improve her in-ring skills, Stock {{relocated}} to Monterrey, Mexico to face the female wrestlers there. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> of a promoter, Stock began working while wearing a mask. She also took on the ring name Dark Angel, on the advice of Eddie Watts. She initially found it difficult to work with the wrestlers in Mexico, as she did not speak Spanish and could not communicate with them throughout the match. On October 17, she defeated Simply Luscious to win the Lucha Libre Femenil Juvenil Championship.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{had been}} ineligible {{to serve in}} Congress because of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbade anyone who had sworn {{allegiance}} to the United States and subsequently sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War from holding public office.

He {{was the first person}} who had sided with the Confederacy to serve in the United States Senate.|$|E
5|$|Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury is an oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Albert Chevallier Tayler completed in 1907. It was commissioned by the Kent County Cricket Club <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> of chairman Lord Harris to celebrate their first County Championship title win. Tayler painted the picture after taking individual sittings {{with each of the}} Kent players. With the exception of short-term loans, the painting remained at the St Lawrence Ground until 1999, at which time it was moved to the Lord's Pavilion as the Kent Club could no longer afford the insurance. In 2006, Kent sold the painting to a charity foundation at an auction. The piece is currently on display at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.|$|E

5|$|On 23 September 1896, Victoria surpassed her {{grandfather}} George III as the longest-reigning monarch in English, Scottish, and British history. The Queen requested that any special celebrations be delayed until 1897, {{to coincide with}} her Diamond Jubilee, which was made a festival of the British Empire <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> of Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain. The prime ministers of all the self-governing dominions were invited to London for the festivities.
