40|$|Aim To {{examine the}} types and {{frequencies}} of oral surgery diagnoses and ambulatory oral surgical treatments during one year period at the Department of Oral Surgery, University Hospital Dubrava in Zagreb, Croatia. Methods Sociodemographic and clinical data on 11 680 ambulatory patients, treated between January 1 and of December 31, 2011 were retrieved {{from the hospital}} database using a specific protocol. The obtained data were subsequently analyzed {{in order to assess}} the frequency of diagnoses and differences in sex and age. Results The most common ambulatory procedure was tooth extraction (37. 67 %) and the most common procedure in ambulatory operating room was alveolectomy (57. 25 %). The test of proportions showed that significantly more extractions (P < 0. 001) and intraoral incisions (P < 0. 001) were performed among male patients, whereas significantly more alveolectomies and <b>apicoectomies</b> were performed among female patients (P < 0. 001). A greater prevalence of periodontal disease was found in patients residing in Zagreb than in patients residing in rural areas.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the periodontal healing of apicomarginal defects 6 months after periradicular surgery and guided tissue regeneration in a series of consecutively treated patient. Additionally the periodontal healing of 134 <b>apicoectomies</b> without apicomarginal defects were evaluated. Study design: Patient with apicomarginal defects who were referred for periradicular surgery were included. Apicomarginal defects were grafted with Bio-Oss bone mineral and covered with a Bio-Guide membrane. Periodontal probing depths (PPDs) and relative attachment levels were measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively with a manual force-controlled probe. Results: Of the 23 defects in 22 patients for whom follow-up data were available, 22 were considered clinically successful and 1 was a failure. Overall, the baseline median PPD decreased from 9. 0 mm to 3. 0 mm, corresponding to a median relative attachment level gain of 3. 0 mm. In the case of periodontic-endodontic lesions, the median baseline PPD decreased from 10. 0 mm to 4. 0 mm,corresponding to a median relative attachment level gain of 4. 0 mm. Defects that involved a proximal root surface had a significantly higher residual PPD than did defects not involving a proximal root surface. Class II of apicomarginal defects shows similar decrease in PPD as a defects without apicomarginal lesion. Conclusion: Guided tissue regeneration treatment of apicomarginal defects yields good results in terms of periodontal healing after 6 months and should be considered as an adjunct to periradicular surgery in such cases...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{treatment}} {{in patients with}} heavy coagulation disorders needs measures that minimize immediate and post-surgical hemorrhagic risk. Besides the subjects afflicted with constitutional coagulation pathologies such as haemophilia A, B, C, AB, Von Willebrand disease, platelet disorders and others, too many are the patients that need pharmacological therapy to impede the creation of intra-vascular coagula. Today, surgical treatment of these patients is possible {{with the use of}} human fibrin glue (Tissucol) that permits excellent surgical and post-surgical hemostasis without therapy suspension, independently of coagulation disorder. The {{purpose of this study is}} a clinical evaluation of a surgical procedure based on the use of human fibrin glue in association or not with suture, hemostatic sponge and lyophilized dura mater in patients with coagulation disorders. In a group of 309 patients in oral anticoagulant therapy have been done a total of 822 operations such as root fragments extraction with mucoperiosteal flap elevation, teeth or roots simple extractions, third molar extractions, cyst removal, <b>apicoectomies.</b> Only patients with PA over 20 % have been treated. All the operations have been leaded with minimal trauma; after the extractions, alveolar margins have been regularized to improve flaps adaptation.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the relationships between clinicopathological findings and the resorptive conditions of root apices of teeth with periodontitis. The samples included 21 root apices with large periapical radiolucent lesions. The preoperative computed tomography (CT) and intraoperative findings were correlated with the presence, extension, and the progression pattern of periapical resorption using a scanning electron microscope. The subjects' age, gender, chief complaint, type of tooth, percussion test results, size of periapical lesion using CT, and intraoperative findings were recorded. All <b>apicoectomies</b> were performed under an operative microscope for endodontic microsurgery. A significant large size was observed in cystic lesions compared with granulomatous lesions. The cementum surface at the periphery of the lesion was covered with globular structures (2 – 3 μm in diameter). Cementum resorption started as small defect formations at the surface. As the defect formation progressed, a lamellar structure appeared at the resorption area, and the size of globular structures became smaller than that of globules at the surface. Further resorption produced typical lacuna formation, which was particularly observed in fracture cases. The most morphologically severe destructive pattern of dentin resorption was observed in large cystic lesions. This study is the first report to elucidate the relationships between three clinical types of undesirable periapical lesions: (1) undertreatment, (2) periapical fracture, (3) macro-level resorption, and the microstructure of external root resorption including from small defects at the cementum surface to a significant destructive pattern inside the dentin. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 906 号 学位授与年月日:平成 29 年 3 月 21 日Author: Kensuke Ookubo, Atsushi Ookubo, Masaki Tsujimoto, Kouji Sugimoto, Shizuka Yamada, Yoshihiko HayashiCitation: Microscopy Research and Technique, 79 (6), pp. 495 - 500; 201...|$|R
5000|$|Bismuth oxide is {{occasionally}} used in dental {{materials to}} make them more opaque to X-rays than the surrounding tooth structure. In particular, bismuth (III) oxide has been used in hydraulic silicate cements (HSC), originally in [...] "MTA" [...] (a trade name, standing for the chemically-meaningless [...] "mineral trioxide aggregate") from 10 to 20% by mass with a mixture of mainly di- and tri-calcium silicate powders. Such HSC is used for dental treatments such as: <b>apicoectomy,</b> apexification, pulp capping, pulpotomy, pulp regeneration, internal repair of iatrogenic perforations, repair of resorption perforations, root canal sealing and obturation. MTA sets into a hard filling material when mixed with water. Some resin-based materials also include an HSC with bismuth oxide. Problems have allegedly arisen with bismuth oxide because it is claimed not to be inert at high pH, specifically that it slows the setting of the HSC, but also over time can lose color by exposure to light or reaction with other materials that may have been used in the tooth treatment, such as sodium hypochlorite.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of ER: YAG laser on apical microleakage. Materials and Methods: Sixty extracted single-rooted teeth were used in this study. The roots were divided into six groups. Group 1 : <b>apicoectomy</b> by fissure bur, and apical cavities prepared by round bur, then cavities were filled with MTA. Group 2 : the roots preparations and fillings were the same as group 1, then the apical areas were treated by Er:YAG Laser. Group 3 : <b>apicoectomy</b> by fissure bur, and apical cavities prepared by ultrasound retrotip and cavities were filled with MTA. Group 4 : the roots preparations and fillings were the same as group 3, then the apical areas were treated by Er:YAG Laser. Group 5 : the roots obturation with gutta percha, then the apices were resected using Er:YAG Laser.

40|$|INTRODUCTION. Apicectomy {{has become}} an {{integral}} part of a comprehensive dental treatment. The primary objective of apicectomy is to eradicate the etiological agents of periapical pathoses and to restore the periodontium to a state of biologic and functional health. MATERIAL AND METHOD. The study consisted of 60 patients referred for oral surgical treatment - <b>apicoectomy</b> with periapical osteotomy. All patients were given a questionnaire with 15 questions to evaluate their quality of life for 7 days after the oral surgery interventions. The patient’s answers were referred as: not at all - 1; very little - 2; some- 3; quite a bit – 4; very much- 5). An equal number of patients were assigned to each group. Group 1 was treated by <b>apicoectomy</b> with gingival flap design and Group 2 was treated by <b>apicoectomy</b> with semilunar flap design. The statistical evaluation included descriptive and analytical methods. RESULTS. The average time needed for completion the surgical procedure was approximately 45 minutes. The results showed that patients in Group 1 reported significantly more pain and took significantly more analgesics on day 3. On days 1 and 2, patients of the Group 2 reported significantly more difficulty in mouth opening, mastication, and the ability to speak. CONCLUSION. High incidence of symptoms were reported by the patients in both groups. There were no significant differences found in the distribution of patients according to age, gender, periradicular diagnosis, and site of operation between the two groups.
