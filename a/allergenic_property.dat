40|$|BACKGROUND: Although fungal phytase is {{frequently}} {{used as an}} additive to animal feed few investigations of its <b>allergenic</b> <b>property</b> have been conducted. METHODS: Fifty-three subjects occupationally exposed to powdered phytase from Aspergillus niger were studied. Exposure data and symptoms were registered by the company physician. RESULTS: Thirty-eight subjects complained of work-related respiratory symptoms and 14 of them showed phytase-specific IgE antibodies; only one asymptomatic subject revealed such antibodies. IgE antibodies were significantly more frequently found in the high-exposure group (technical centre) {{when compared with the}} low-exposure group (laboratories, experimental animal husbandry). Phytase-specific IgG antibodies were present in 19 symptomatic (50 %) and five (33 %) asymptomatic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that powdered fungal phytase is a highly sensitizing substance whose inhalation exposure should be avoided. Hypersensitivity symptoms could be prevented by means of extensive hygienic measures and ongoing medical surveillance...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutraceutical}} role {{of dietary}} proteins and peptides is gaining considerable {{interest in the}} management of cardiovascular disease like hypertension. In order to investigate the contribution of Sesamum indicum seed proteins to its antihypertensive properties was investigated, there seed protein sequences: 7 S globulin (NCBI accession number, giǀ 13183177), 2 S albumin (NCBI accession number, giǀ 13183174) and 11 S globulin (NCBI accession number, giǀ 13183172) were selected for BLAST, BIOPEP and allergenicity analysis. BLAST gave the following similarities: 7 S globulin vs rice glutelin precursor (35 %), 7 S globulin vs oat 12 S seed storage globulin 1 (29 %), 11 S globulin vs rice glutelin precursor (41 %), 11 S globulin vs oat 12 S seed storage globulin 1 (39 %) and 2 S albumin vs oat 12 S seed storage globulin 1 (60 %). BIOPEP analysis showed that the sesame proteins demonstrated either di- or tri-peptide with a total of 92, 91 and 34 potential ACE inhibitory peptides from 7 S globulin, 2 S albumin and 11 S globulin, respectively. Papain hydrolysis theoretically released the highest numbers of predicted ACE inhibitory peptides (23, 14 and 5) from 7 S globulin, 2 S albumin and 11 S globulin, respectively. The 8 -mer and 80 -mer allergenicity analysis of these proteins showed significant matches with allergenic proteins from Lens culinaris, Anacardium occidentale, Carya illinoinensis.

40|$|Hypoallergenic {{antibacterial}} low-molecular-mass peptides {{were produced}} from defatted soybean meal in a membrane bioreactor. In the fi rst step, soybean meal proteins were digested with trypsin in the bioreactor, operated in batch mode. For the tryptic digestion of soybean meal protein, optimum initial soybean meal concentration of 75 g/L, temperature of 40 °C and pH= 9. 0 were determined. Aft er enzymatic digestion, low-molecular-mass peptides were purifi ed with cross-fl ow fl at sheet membrane (pore size 100 μm) {{and then with}} tubular ceramic ultrafi ltration membrane (molecular mass cut-off 5 kDa). Eff ects of transmembrane pressure {{and the use of}} a static turbulence promoter to reduce the concentration polarization near the ultrafi ltration membrane surface were examined and their positive eff ects were proven. For the fi ltration with ultrafi ltration membrane, transmembrane pressure of 3 • 105 Pa with 3 -stage discontinuous diafi ltration was found optimal. The molecular mass distribution of purifi ed peptides using ultrafi ltration membrane was determined by a liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-fl ight mass spectrometry setup. More than 96 % of the peptides (calculated as relative frequency) from the ultrafi ltration membrane permeate had the molecular mass M≤ 1. 7 kDa and the highest molecular mass was found to be 3. 1 kDa.

The present study aimed to identify B- cell epitopes of osmotin using bioinformatic tools and further modify these regions to study the <b>allergenic</b> <b>property.</b> B-cell epitopes were predicted based on amino acid physicochemical properties. Three single point mutations M 1, M 2, and M 3 and a multiple point mutant (M 123) were selected to disrupt the IgE binding. These mutants were cloned, expressed and proteins purified to homogeneity. The IgE binding of the purified proteins was evaluated by ELISA and ELISA inhibition with patients ’ sera. Three regions of osmotin M 1 (57 – 70 aa), M 2 (72 – 85 aa) and M 3 (147 – 165 aa) were identified as potential antibody recognition sites using in silico tools. The sequence similarity search of the predicted epitopes of osmotin using Structural Database of Allergenic proteins (SDAP) showed similarity with known allergens from tomato, kiwifruit, bell pepper, apple, mountain cedar and cypress. Mutants M 1, M 2 and M 3 showed up to 72 %, 60 % and 76 % reduction, respectively in IgE binding whereas M 123 showed up to 90 % reduction with patients ’ sera. The immunoblot of M 123 mutant showed 40 % reduction in spot density as compared to osmotin. All mutants showed decreased inhibition potency with M 123 exhibiting lowest potency of 32 % with osmotin positive pooled patients ’ sera.

40|$|ABSTRACTEuropean {{studies have}} shown that {{approximately}} 20 % of all pollen-allergic patients display IgE reactivity to various plant profilins. Profilins are ubiquitous intracellular proteins, with a role in cell signalling and morphology. Recently, functionally relevant human profilin tetramers were identified, but the characterization and allergenic roles of plant profilin multimers have not been reported. Because larger molecules are generally more antigenic, the present objectives were to: (i) determine if plant profilin forms multimers; (ii) use the <b>allergenic</b> <b>property</b> of profilin in the design of an immunoassay to detect type I allergies in the local population; and (iii) assess the allergenic potential of monomeric versus multimeric profilin. In agreement with other known profilin forms, silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analyses revealed that a significant 14. 8 kDa protein was purified from Escherichia coli transformed with the cDNA of a plant (Zea mays) profilin isoform (ZmPROI). Higher molecular weight proteins (particularly 60 kDa and 30 kDa) were also observed, which became predominant and larger (> 90 kDa) in the absence of reducing agents. Human IgE reactivity to profilin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that was developed using patient serum samples classified as either negative (no type I allergies), positive (type I plant allergies) or miscellaneous (i. e. allergies other than classical type I plant allergies). The IgE-ZmPRO 1 complexes were seen in three of nine patients with type I plant allergies, compared with one of eight negative controls and three of 14 from the miscellaneous category. Dot filtration immunoblots were subsequently developed to absorb profilin diluted in {{the presence or absence of}} reducing agent to yield mostly monomeric or multimeric profilin, respectively. Immunoglobulin E from positive patients displayed a greater intensity of binding to ZmPROI under conditions that favored profilin multimers. In summary, recombinant ZmPROI profilin forms multimers and is suitable for a developed ELISA. The data further suggest that profilin has pan-allergenic potential in the North American population and raise the possibility that profilin multimers have greater immunogenicity than monomers...|$|E

However, trout, the landlocked form of anadromous salmon, is not subject to the allergenlabeling requirements, even though both populations belong to a single species. Since no supporting data have been demonstrated to make a clear distinction between these two populations in terms of allergenicity, we comparatively examined their <b>allergenic</b> <b>properties</b> using sera from patients allergic to fish. Methods: Extracts of Oncorhynchus nerka from different habitats were obtained: kokanee (landlocked) and red salmon (anadromous). Control extracts were derived from four other species. This study focused on the (1) IgE-binding capacity of the fish extracts in patients' sera (n= 50), (2) ELISA inhibition test (n= 6), and (3) inhibition immunoblot test (n= 8) between the kokanee and red salmon. Results: The extracts from kokanee and red salmon showed the highest correlation with each other in terms of the IgE-binding capacity, and showed complete (100 %) reciprocal cross-inhibition in the ELISA inhibition test. On immunoblotting, there was no marked difference in the staining pattern between the two extracts, and each IgE-binding band gradually disappeared when the patients' sera were preincubated with the counterpart antigen in a dose-dependent manner.

The aim of this investigation was to determine whether the <b>allergenic</b> <b>properties</b> of Ber e 1 and SFA 8 reflected differential polarization of dendritic cell (DC) and Th cell responses. We thus investigated the effect of recombinant forms of both allergens on DC and Th cell responses as indicated by cell surface phenotype and cytokine production. Exposure of murine DCs to SFA 8, but not Ber e 1, resulted in production of the cytokines IL- 12 p 40 and TNF-{alpha} by a mechanism independent of recognition by TLRs. Furthermore, depending on the mouse strain used, increased expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules such as CD 40, CD 80, and CD 86 was associated with exposure to SFA 8, but not Ber e 1. In coculture experiments using the DO 11. 10 transgenic T cell that recognizes OVA peptide, DCs exposed to both allergens induced T cells to produce IFN-{gamma}, but only Ber e 1 could induce significant production of IL- 4 and IL- 5.

In this review the impact of processing (heat and non-heat treatment) on the allergenic potential of proteins, and on the antigenic (IgG-binding) and <b>allergenic</b> (IgE-binding) <b>properties</b> of proteins has been considered. A variety of allergenic foods (peanuts, tree nuts, cows' milk, hens' eggs, soy, wheat and mustard) have been reviewed.

Although there have been refinements, the key aspects of the evaluation have not changed. The <b>allergenic</b> <b>properties</b> of the gene donor and the host (recipient) organisms are considered in determining the appropriate testing strategy. The amino acid sequence of the encoded protein is compared to all known allergens to determine whether the protein is a known allergen or is sufficiently similar to any known allergen to indicate an increased probability of allergic cross-reactivity. Stability of the protein in the presence of acid with the stomach protease pepsin is tested as a risk factor for food allergenicity. In vitro or in vivo human IgE binding are tested when appropriate, if the gene donor is an allergen or the sequence of the protein is similar to an allergen. Serum donors and skin test subjects are selected based on their proven allergic responses to the gene donor or to material containing the allergen that was matched in sequence. While some scientists and regulators have suggested using animal models, performing broadly targeted serum IgE testing or extensive pre- or post-market clinical tests, current evidence does not support these tests as being predictive or practical. Based on the evidence to date, the current assessment process has worked well to prevent the unintended introduction of allergens in commercial GM crops. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|R
