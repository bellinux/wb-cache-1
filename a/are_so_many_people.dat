500|$|To be honest, {{one of the}} hesitations I had {{in taking}} on the movie {{is that it was}} a little like writing about the Beatles—that there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> out there who know so much about him and who revere him that I just saw a {{minefield}} of disappointment. Frankly, that I was going to do something and that people who ... hopefully, when I'm done with my research, I'll be in the same ball park of knowledge about Steve Jobs that so many people in this room are.|$|E

Local farmers assisted the emergency services by transporting equipment using quad bikes and four-wheel drive vehicles. Sergeant Jo Fawcett of the Cumbria Constabulary also offered thanks, saying that [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> who have given up their own time to contribute {{in some way to}} dealing with the aftermath of the derailment that it would be unfair to name them for fear of missing someone out." ...|$|E

500|$|During the shooting, {{the crew}} had some {{problems}} in filming some scenes. Leto told MTV News, [...] "It's been an incredible adventure, but it's also been really difficult, because there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> and we're shutting down streets of Los Angeles." [...] He further {{said that they were}} really worried about a scene regarding a lone horse running down a Los Angeles street: [...] "We only had three takes that we had time to do. The first take it went sideways, second take it went the other way. Third take? Perfect." [...] Leto described the experience of filming the music video saying, [...] "It's a lyrical and slightly metaphorical surreal journey through the city of Angels, from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Pier. We like to create an adventure and this has been an adventure. [...] This is what we were supposed to do. And I doubted the idea up until the very last minute, but the process has been phenomenal." [...] The music video premiered on November 9, 2009 at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|The {{on-screen}} {{relationship between}} Dot and Jim was halted in 2007 when Jim was hastily written {{out of the}} soap due to Bardon's health problems. In the script Jim suffered a stroke and {{was placed in the}} care of off-screen relatives. Dot and Jim remained together, with Jim making sporadic appearances between 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot. A more permanent return for the character was announced in 2009. However, it was reported in April 2011 that Bardon had filmed his exit from the series, and that the show's staff believed it marked the end of the character. A source told the Daily Mirror: [...] "Dot's been struggling for a while and realises that she can no longer give Jim the care and attention he deserves and is forced to make the heartbreaking decision that he should move into a home. [...] It was very emotional on the set for the scenes where Dot discusses her decision and talks to Jim about him going into care for good. There were a lot of tears. [...] The feeling is that {{this is the end of}} Jim as a character because he won't leave the home and won't ever be a regular in Albert Square again." [...] It was reported that Jim could still appear in the care home if Bardon's health permitted it. Jim left the show on 26 May 2011. Brown opined that Dot would feel lonely without Jim, saying, [...] "I think she'll be very lonely and feel she doesn't have much purpose in life. It was really important to tell this story because there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in a similar situation to Dot. It was moving to act out, too—not just because of Dot and Jim's relationship, but because I'm really good friends with John Bardon in real life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{reaction}} {{to the death of}} Freddie Gray and the 2015 Baltimore protests, Freeman said he was [...] "absolutely" [...] supportive of the protesters. [...] "That unrest [...] {{has nothing to do with}} terrorism at all, except the terrorism we suffer from the police. [...] Because of the technology—everybody has a smartphone—now we can see what the police are doing. We can show the world, Look, this is what happened in that situation. So why <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> dying in police custody? And why are they all black? And why are all the police killing them white? What is that? The police have always said, 'I feared for my safety.' Well, now we know. OK. You feared for your safety while a guy was running away from you, right?" ...|$|E

[...] "I have to tell you, I am in love with Judy Blye Wilson and Jean Dadario Burke [...] Jean is like my mother, and Judy is like my best friend. It's been really nice to be around people like that." [...] Budig additionally noted her favoritism for Jennifer Bassey (Marian). [...] "She's taken me under her wing a little bit.

Ocean {{previously}} co-wrote [...] "1st & Love" [...] and [...] "Locket (Locked in Love)" [...] with Rich King for Norwood's Human (2008) album. [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] was originally {{conceived as a}} duet between Norwood and Ocean, and features the duo exchanging lyrics about looking forwards and not backwards, with lines such as [...] "I wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more/ You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful". However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to me. Sometimes you get to a point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track. I just remember feeling like that at a point in my life. I know there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> out there that go through that dark time and I felt like it could speak to a lot of people." ...|$|E
