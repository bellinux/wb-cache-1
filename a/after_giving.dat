40|$|Background : {{pulmonary}} tuberculosis is disease that increase {{every year in}} Semarang, especially in Rowosari. So many people about 15 - 50 years old are infected. One of the method to decrease its prevalence is doing a health promotion about the prevention of {{pulmonary tuberculosis}}. There are so many methods {{can be used to}} health promotion, for example video and simulation. Aim : to find out difference level effectiveness of health promotion with video and simulation for level of knowledge about pulmonary tuberculosis prevention. Methods : this research use quasi experimental pre and post design. 55 samples are chosen from tenth class MA Husnul Khatimah by total sampling. 29 samples as experimental group health promotion with video and 26 samples as experimental group health promotion with simulation. Each group are given pretest, then given health promotion, last given posttest. Analyzing data for each group use dependent t-test and wilcoxon test. While analyzing data among groups use independent t-test. Results : there were a significant difference knowledge level <b>after</b> <b>given</b> health promotion at experimental group with video (p= 0, 000), significant difference knowledge level <b>after</b> <b>given</b> health promotion at experimental group with simulation (p= 0, 000), and no significant difference for analysis knowledge level among experimental group with video and experimental group with simulation(p= 0, 230). Conclusions : knowledge level of respondents <b>after</b> <b>given</b> health promotion with video and simulation is increased, but no significant difference among knowledge level of respondents <b>after</b> <b>given</b> health promotion with video and simulation.
