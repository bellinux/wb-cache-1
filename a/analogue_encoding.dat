40|$|A quantum {{computer}} is a multi-particle interferometer that comprises beam splitters {{at both ends}} and arms, where the n two-level particles undergo the interactions among them. The arms are designed so that relevant functions required to produce a computational result is stored in the phase shifts of the 2 ^n arms. They can be detected by interferometry {{that allows us to}} utilize quantum parallelism. Quantum algorithms are accountable for what interferometers to be constructed to compute particular problems. A standard formalism for constructing the arms has been developed by the extension of classical reversible gate arrays. By its nature of sequential applications of logic operations, the required number of gates increases exponentially as the problem size grows. This may cause a crucial obstacle to perform a quantum computation within a limited decoherence time. We propose a direct and concurrent construction of the interferometer arms by one-time evolution of a physical system with arbitrary multi-particle interactions. It is inherently quantum mechanical and has no classical <b>analogue.</b> <b>Encoding</b> the functions used in Shor's algorithm for prime factoring, Grover's algorithm and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm requires only one-time evolution of such a system regardless of the problem size n as opposed to its standard sequential counterpart that takes O(n^ 3), O(n) and O(n 2 ^n) ...|$|E

40|$|The ICP 0 protein (bICP 0) encoded by bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 is {{the major}} viral regulatory protein because it stimulates all viral promoters and, consequently, productive infection. Like other ICP 0 <b>analogues</b> <b>encoded</b> by Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily members, bICP 0 contains a zinc RING finger near its amino terminus that is necessary for activating transcription, regulating subcellular localization, and inhibiting interferon-dependent transcription. In this study, we discovered that sequences near the C terminus, and the zinc RING finger, are necessary for inhibiting the human beta interferon (IFN- Î²) promoter. In contrast to herpes simplex virus type 1 -encoded ICP 0, bICP 0 reduces interferon response factor 3 (IRF 3), but not IRF 7, protein levels in transiently transfected cells. The zinc RING finger and sequences near the C terminus are necessary for bICP 0 -induced degradation of IRF 3. A proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, interfered with bICP 0 -induced degradation of IRF 3, suggesting that bICP 0, directly or indirectly, targets IRF 3 for proteasome-dependent degradation. IRF 3, but not IRF 7, is not readily detectable in the nuclei of productively infected bovine cells during the late stages of infection. In the context of productive infection, IRF 3 and IRF 7 are detected in the nucleus at early times after infection. At late times after infection, IRF 7, but not IRF 3, is still detectable in the nuclei of infected cells. Collectively, these {{studies suggest that the}} ability of bICP 0 to reduce IRF 3 protein levels is important with respect to disarming the IFN response during productive infection...|$|R

Other analog video encoding systems include NTSC, PAL and SECAM. Unlike the FDM method used in those, MAC encoding uses a TDM method.

50|$|The Experimental and Development Department, {{as part of}} the IBA's Engineering Division, was {{responsible}} for much leading edge research into broadcasting technology as well as being responsible for the design and manufacture of specialist equipment that could not be procured from commercial manufacturers. In particular, the IBA's E&D Department developed SABRE (Steerable Adaptable Broadcast Receiving Equipment) that enabled mainland broadcast television channels to be received for re-broadcasting in the Channel Islands. During the early 1980s, the E&D Department designed and manufactured the specialised broadcast receiving and monitoring equipment used to build the national broadcast network for Channel Four. Subsequently, E&D's engineers proposed a system of <b>analogue</b> television <b>encoding</b> known as MAC (Multiplexed Analogue Component) to provide a standard for the forthcoming satellite television broadcasts that was more robust than an extension of the existing PAL system used for terrestrial broadcasts. E&D's engineers also designed and built some of the first digital audio equipment for satellite broadcasting including systems using data packets. E&D's engineers made many important contributions to digital television data-rate reduction whereby the encoding of a standard analogue PAL colour signal requiring some 130 Megabits/second has been reduced to less than 4 Megabits/second as used on current digital television broadcasting.|$|R

40|$|Computational {{tasks in}} {{biological}} systems that require short response times {{can be implemented}} in a straightforward way by networks of spiking neurons that <b>encode</b> <b>analogue</b> values in temporal coding. We investigate the question how spiking neurons can learn {{on the basis of}} differences between firing times. In particular, we provide learning rules of the Hebbian type in terms of single spiking events of the pre- and postsynaptic neuron and show that the weights approach some value given by the difference between pre- and postsynaptic firing times with arbitrary high precision. Our learning rules give rise to a straightforward possibility for realizing very fast pattern analysis tasks with spiking neurons. 1 Introduction Analogue variables within computations in artificial neural networks are usually represented by the average firing rate of some neuron. However, biological neural systems can perform certain computations within a time window being too small for sampling firing rates. I [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{experimental}} studies concerning the neuronal code {{are based on}} graded responses of neurons, given by the emitted number of spikes measured in a certain time window. Correspondingly, {{a large body of}} neural network theory deals with analogue neuron models and discusses their potential use for computation or function approximation. All physical signals, however, are of limited precision, and neuronal firing rates in cortex are relatively low. Here, we investigate the relevance of analogue signal processing with spikes in terms of optimal stimulus reconstruction and information theory. In particular, we derive optimal tuning functions taking the biological constraint of limited firing rates into account. It turns out that depending on the available decoding time T, optimal encoding undergoes a phase transition from discrete binary coding for small T towards <b>analogue</b> or quasi-analogue <b>encoding</b> for large T. The corresponding firing rate distributions are bimodal for all relevant T, in particular in the case of population coding...|$|R
