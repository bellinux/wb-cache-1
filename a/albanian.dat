5|$|Meksi's {{work was}} {{important}} {{for the development of}} written <b>Albanian,</b> and his endeavors strengthened the conviction that a stable <b>Albanian</b> alphabet had to be created. His translation served as the basis for Joseph Ritter von Xylander's studies of the <b>Albanian</b> language, which definitively refuted the thesis that the language had a Tatar origin. Von Xylander concluded that <b>Albanian</b> had an Indo-European root.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Albanian</b> state led also {{efforts to}} {{establish}} an independent orthodox church, contrary to {{the provisions of the}} Protocol of Corfu and thereby reducing the influence of Greek language in the region. According to a 1923 law, priests who were not <b>Albanian</b> speakers, as well as not of <b>Albanian</b> origin, were excluded from this new autocephalous church.|$|E

5|$|Two other {{international}} scholars also studied the <b>Albanian</b> language mainly based on Meksi's {{translation of the}} New Testament: August Schleicher, who stated that {{his knowledge of the}} conjugation of <b>Albanian</b> verbs was based on Meksi's work, and Johann Georg von Hahn an Austrian diplomat, philologist, and specialist in <b>Albanian</b> history, language, and culture, who translated the Bible into Gheg <b>Albanian</b> with the help of Kostandin Kristoforidhi.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{its value}} to <b>Albanian</b> Christians, who could {{for the first time}} read the Gospels in their own language, Meksi's work {{advanced}} the study of written <b>Albanian,</b> and in particular informed the work of 19th-century linguists and philologists such as Joseph Ritter von Xylander, August Schleicher, and Johann Georg von Hahn. Their studies of the <b>Albanian</b> language were significantly influenced by Meksi's Bible translation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the <b>Albanian</b> {{independence}} movement gathered momentum. On 28 November 1912 in Vlorë, Ismail Qemali declared Albania's independence, and a provisional government was soon formed that exercised its authority {{only in the}} immediate area of Vlorë. Elsewhere, the Ottoman general Essad Pasha formed the Republic of Central Albania at Durrës, while conservative <b>Albanian</b> tribesmen still hoped for an Ottoman ruler. Most of the area that would form the <b>Albanian</b> state was occupied at this time, by the Greeks {{in the south and}} the Serbs in the north.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though it}} has been adopted {{recently}} in <b>Albanian</b> folklore (around the 18th century), the clarinet, or gërneta as it is called, {{is one of the}} most important instruments in Albania, especially in the central and southern areas. The clarinet plays a crucial role in saze (folk) ensembles that perform in weddings and other celebrations. It is worth mentioning that the kaba (an instrumental <b>Albanian</b> Isopolyphony included in UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list) is characteristic of these ensembles. Prominent <b>Albanian</b> clarinet players include Selim Leskoviku, Gaqo Lena, Remzi Lela (Çobani), Laver Bariu (Ustai), and Nevruz Nure (Lulushi i Korçës).|$|E

The soccer matches are played in Gjirokastër Stadium, which can hold up to 8,500 spectators.|$|E
5|$|From the <b>Albanian</b> perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian {{sources of}} that time, the Northern Epirote {{movement}} was directly {{supported by the}} Greek state, {{with the help of}} a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania.

50|$|A {{referendum}} {{on the status of}} the <b>Albanians</b> in Macedonia, declared illegal by the Macedonian government, was held in January 1992. 74% out of 92% of those eligible to vote, voted for the autonomy of the <b>Albanians.</b> On March 31, 1992, about 40,000 ethnic <b>Albanians</b> demonstrated on the streets of Skopje, asking that Macedonia be recognized as a country lest the rights of ethnic <b>Albanians</b> were recognized.|$|R
5|$|In 1921 the Protocol of Corfu was annulled {{during the}} Conference of Ambassadors and Northern Epirus was {{definitively}} ceded to the <b>Albanian</b> state. However attempts to re-establish an autonomous Northern Epirus continued. In 1921 the <b>Albanian</b> government, during the country's {{entrance to the}} League of Nations, committed itself {{to protect the rights}} of minorities within its territory, which were ratified by the local Parliament next year. However, these rights were granted within a much more limited area compared to the Protocol, which included only some villages in the regions of Himara, Gjirokastër and Sarande, and none of the main towns. Moreover, Greek education was viewed as a potential threat to the territorial integrity of the <b>Albanian</b> state and Greek schools were either closed or converted to <b>Albanian</b> ones. As a result of this policy, education in Greek was limited and for a time virtually eliminated (1934–1935). Only after the intervention of the Permanent Court of International Justice, in April 1935, did the <b>Albanian</b> side allow the reopening of Greek-language schools and waive its insistence on the use of <b>Albanian</b> in Greek schools.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, Bedri Pejani, the {{chairman}} of the Second League of Prizren, an organization created after the Italian surrender to advance the interests of Kosovo Albanians, proposed to Hitler that a force of 120,000–150,000 Kosovo <b>Albanian</b> volunteers be raised to fight the Yugoslav and <b>Albanian</b> partisans. Pejani asked the German leadership to give the Albanians equipment and supplies to fight the communist insurgency, and requested the expansion of the borders of the German puppet state of Albania {{at the expense of the}} German-occupied Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia and the German occupied territory of Montenegro. These requests were not fulfilled, but in April 1944 Himmler ordered the establishment of a new <b>Albanian</b> volunteer division, which was subsequently named after the medieval <b>Albanian</b> warrior George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. By this point, the Germans and some members of the <b>Albanian</b> puppet government believed that about 50,000 men could be recruited from Albanian-held territory to join the SS. The SS had initially envisioned a force of 10,000–12,000 men for an <b>Albanian</b> SS division. Himmler saw the Muslim Albanians as a potential source of manpower in Germany's war against the Yugoslav Partisans, who faced significant difficulties in recruiting Kosovo Albanians to join their ranks. The Germans found that Kosovo Albanians were more cooperative than Albanians in Albania itself. This was mainly because they feared a return to Yugoslav rule. Consequently, many of the division's recruits were Kosovo Albanians. The quality of most of these recruits was poor, and only 6,000 were considered suitable to receive training. Those that were accepted were a combination of about 1,500 former Royal Yugoslav Army prisoners of war, elements of the failed <b>Albanian</b> army and gendarmerie, volunteers from both pre-war and expanded Albania, and conscripts from families that had more than two sons. The enlistment of <b>Albanian</b> civilians was organized in close cooperation with the <b>Albanian</b> puppet government.|$|E
5|$|Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's {{representative}} in Moscow, had met that {{year with a}} community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into <b>Albanian</b> was indeed possible. In {{a letter to his}} superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the <b>Albanian</b> nation occupied {{a large part of the}} ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, and that for the <b>Albanian</b> Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an <b>Albanian</b> bishop.|$|E

5|$|The Siege of Svetigrad {{began on}} May 14, 1448 when an Ottoman army, led by Sultan Murad II, besieged the {{fortress}} of Svetigrad (now Kodžadžik). After the many failed Ottoman expeditions into Albania against the League of Lezhë, a confederation of <b>Albanian</b> Principalities created in 1444 and headed by Skanderbeg, Murad II decided to march an army into Skanderbeg's dominions {{in order to}} capture the key <b>Albanian</b> fortress of Svetigrad. The fortress lay on an important route between Macedonia and Albania, and thus its occupation would give the Ottomans easy access into Albania. The force prepared by Murad was the largest force with which the Ottomans had ever attacked Skanderbeg. Murad planned to take the fortress, march into the <b>Albanian</b> interior, and capture the main citadel of Krujë, thus crushing the <b>Albanian</b> League.|$|E
5|$|The {{autonomy}} {{question remains}} on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations {{as part of the}} Northern Epirote issue. In 1925, Albania's borders were fixed by the Protocol of Florence, and the Kingdom of Greece abandoned all claims to Northern Epirus. In the 1960s, Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked his <b>Albanian</b> counterpart about giving autonomy to the Greek minority, with no results. In 1991, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania, the chairman of Greek minority organization Omonoia called for autonomy for Northern Epirus, on the basis that the rights provided for under the <b>Albanian</b> constitution were highly precarious. This proposal was rejected, spurring the minority's radical wing to call for a union with Greece. Two years later, Omonoia’s chairman was arrested by the <b>Albanian</b> police after publicly stating that the Greek minority goal was the creation of an autonomous region inside the <b>Albanian</b> borders, based on the provisions of the Protocol of Corfu.
