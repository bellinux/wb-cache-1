5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often {{propylene glycol}} or ethylene glycol, onto icy surfaces {{such as the}} bodies of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming {{on the body of}} the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> they provide while increasing drag. The ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{used this}} {{equation}} {{to calculate the}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> that a wing would produce. Over the years {{a wide variety of}} values had been measured for the Smeaton coefficient; Chanute identified up to 50 of them. Wilbur knew that Langley, for example, had used a lower number than the traditional one. Intent on confirming the correct Smeaton value, Wilbur performed his own calculations using measurements collected during kite and free flights of the 1901 glider. His results correctly showed that the coefficient was very close to 0.0033 (similar to the number Langley used), not the traditional 0.0054, which would significantly exaggerate predicted lift.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E

We show that {{this is only the}} GI-complete tip of a hierarchy and that the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lifting</b> depends on how local the inference algorithm is: if the LP relaxation introduces constraints involving features over at most k variables, then the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lifting</b> de-creases monotonically with k. This induces a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>lifted</b> inference algorithms, with lifted BP and MPLP at the bottom and exact inference methods at the top. In between, there are relaxations whose liftings are eq-uitable partitions of intermediate coarseness, which all can be computed in polynomial time...|$|R

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E
2500|$|Airspeed is {{the speed}} of an {{aircraft}} relative to the air. Among the common conventions for qualifying airspeed are indicated airspeed ("IAS"), calibrated airspeed ("CAS"), equivalent airspeed ("EAS"), true airspeed ("TAS"), and density airspeed. [...] Indicated airspeed is simply what is read off of an airspeed gauge connected to a pitot static system, calibrated airspeed is indicated airspeed adjusted for pitot system position and installation error, and equivalent airspeed is calibrated airspeed adjusted for compressibility effects. [...] True airspeed is equivalent airspeed adjusted for air density, and is also {{the speed of}} the aircraft through the air in which it is flying. [...] Calibrated airspeed is typically within a few knots of indicated airspeed, while equivalent airspeed decreases slightly from CAS as aircraft altitude increases or at high speeds. [...] With EAS constant, true airspeed increases as aircraft altitude increases. This is because air density decreases with higher altitude, but an aircraft's wing requires the same amount of air particles (i.e., mass of air) flowing around it to produce the same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> for a given AOA; thus, a wing must move faster through thinner air than thicker air to obtain the same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E

Various other characteristics affect the coefficient of drag as well, and are taken into account in these examples.

5|$|The elytra allow beetles to both fly {{and move}} through {{confined}} spaces, doing so by folding the delicate wings under the elytra while not flying, and folding their wings out just before take off. The unfolding and folding of the wings is operated by muscles {{attached to the}} wing base; {{as long as the}} tension on the radial and cubital veins remains, the wings remain straight. In some day-flying species (for example, Buprestidae, Scarabaeidae), flight does not include large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> the elytra, having the metathorac wings extended under the lateral elytra margins. The altitude reached by beetles in flight varies. One study investigating the flight altitude of the ladybird species Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis using radar showed that, whilst the majority in flight over a single location were at 150â€“195m above ground level, some reached altitudes of over 1100m.|$|R

The substantial propatagium would have produced a generous <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift,</b> while the likewise large postpatagium would have provided a large attachment area for the calami of the feathers, which would have kept them as a straight airfoil. This collectively is strongly indicative that Confuciusornis was capable of powered flight, if not only for short periods of time.|$|E
2500|$|Another problem {{discovered}} by the jet fighters was unexpectedly dropping a wing at high speeds and high altitudes. This was traced to manufacturing defects in the wings that made no difference at low speeds and altitudes, but meant that each wing had a slightly different airfoil and hence, a different <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift.</b> To counter this Sergey Ilyushin and his team developed a new manufacturing technique that reversed the traditional practice where the internal supporting members were affixed to the assembly jig and the aircraft's skin panels were then attached. This new method meant that the skin panels {{were placed in the}} jigs where the correct curvature and shape could be guaranteed and the internal structure was then fastened to them. This required that manufacturing joints be used along the chord lines of the wings and tail surfaces, which split the spars and ribs in half. [...] Similarly, the fuselage was built the same way, although it was split vertically along the centerline. This new technique did impose a small weight penalty, but had the unexpected advantage of greatly accelerating the assembly process as the internal equipment could be installed before the halves were joined together. This allowed several teams to work on a single sub-assembly before they were mated.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to the {{rotational}} effect mentioned above, {{the phenomena}} associated with flapping wings {{are not completely}} understood or agreed upon. Because every model is an approximation, different models leave out effects that are presumed to be negligible. For example, the Wagner effect says that circulation rises slowly to its steady-state due to viscosity when an inclined wing is accelerated from rest. This phenomenon would explain a lift value that is less than what is predicted. Typically, the case has been to find sources for the added lift. It {{has been argued that}} this effect is negligible for flow with a Reynolds number that is typical of insect flight. The Wagner effect was ignored, consciously, in at least one recent model. One of the most important phenomena that occurs during insect flight is leading edge suction. [...] This force is significant to the calculation of efficiency. The concept of leading edge suction first was put forth to describe vortex lift on sharp-edged delta wings. At high angles of attack, the flow separates over the leading edge, but reattaches before reaching the trailing edge. Within this bubble of separated flow is a vortex. Because the angle of attack is so high, a lot of momentum is transferred downward into the flow. These two features create a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> force as well as some additional drag. The important feature, however, is the lift. Because the flow has separated, yet it still provides large amounts of lift, this phenomenon is called stall delay. This effect was observed in flapping insect flight and it was proven to be capable of providing enough lift to account for the deficiency in the quasi-steady-state models. This effect is used by canoeists in a sculling draw stroke.|$|E

50|$|A {{helicopter}} pilot manipulates the helicopter flight controls {{to achieve and}} maintain controlled aerodynamic flight. Changes to the aircraft flight control system transmit mechanically to the rotor, producing aerodynamic effects on the rotor blades that make the helicopter move in a deliberate way. To tilt forward and back (pitch) or sideways (roll), requires that the controls alter the angle of attack of the main rotor blades cyclically during rotation, creating differing <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> (force) {{at different points in}} the cycle. To increase or decrease overall lift requires that the controls alter the angle of attack for all blades collectively by equal amounts at the same time, resulting in ascent, descent, acceleration and deceleration.|$|R
50|$|The gennaker {{has been}} around for several decades now, and as the name suggests, it is a hybrid between a genoa and an {{asymmetrical}} spinnaker. A brand name of North Sails, the gennaker started as a cruising sail based on the Code 0 spinnakers used on racing boats. Gennakers and similar code 0 variants offered by other makers are even larger than genoas (200% overlaps are not uncommon), and they have a much greater camber for generating larger <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> when reaching. Flat-cut gennakers can be effective for angles as low as 60-70 degrees. Spinnakers perform much better when running because the main sail blocks the wind of gennaker above 135-150 degrees.|$|R

50|$|A {{fixed-wing}} aircraft must build up forward speed during a lengthy takeoff roll. As the forward velocity increases, the wings produce greater <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift.</b> At a high enough speed, the lift force will exceed {{the weight of}} the aircraft, and the aircraft will become capable of sustained flight. Since the aircraft must reach flight speed using only its own engines for power, a long runway is required so that the aircraft can build up speed. On an aircraft carrier, the flight deck is so short that most aircraft cannot reach flight speed before reaching the end of the deck. Since lift is less than gravity, the aircraft will lose altitude after the wheels leave the flight deck and possibly fall into the sea.|$|R

50|$|This system {{consists}} of a cam lobe that varies along its length (similar to a cone shape). One end of the cam lobe has a short duration/reduced lift profile, and the other end has a longer duration/greater lift profile. In between, the lobe provides a smooth transition between these two profiles. By shifting area of the cam lobe which is {{in contact with the}} follower, the lift and duration can be continuously altered. This is achieved by moving the camshaft axially (sliding it across the engine) so a stationary follower is exposed to a varying lobe profile to produce different <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> and duration. The downside to this arrangement is that the cam and follower profiles must be carefully designed to minimise contact stress (due to the varying profile).|$|R

5000|$|During such turns, {{the wings}} travel at {{different}} speeds (despite no change to local velocity {{from the perspective}} of the flapping animal or machine). Thus, they create different <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>lift</b> and drag. At the speed and size of flapping animals, forces created by flapping are essentially proportional to the square of velocity relative to the fluid. Thus, even small asymmetries in (lab frame) velocity can create large asymmetries in forces or torques. In the case of flying animals, these torques counters the turn (and is thus known as [...] "countertorque"). Flapping countertorque specifically describes this type of damping in flapping flight, though other passive damping (rotational coutertorque) effects which arise from flapping are in the process of being described in the scientific field of animal flight biomechanics.|$|R
