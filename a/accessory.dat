5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the <b>accessory</b> nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal <b>accessory</b> nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal <b>accessory</b> nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal <b>accessory</b> nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal <b>accessory</b> nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E

5|$|The fibres {{that form}} the spinal <b>accessory</b> nerve are formed by lower motor neurons located in the upper {{segments}} of the spinal cord.

The lateral horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla oblongata, from which the cranial component of the <b>accessory</b> nerve is derived.|$|E

5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the {{portable}} device, which {{is required to}} have a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the <b>accessory</b> port, which is required to have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the charging port, which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The charging port does not pass data, but does use the D± signals for charging port detection. The <b>accessory</b> port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device can charge from the bus power {{as if there were}} a charging port present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the <b>accessory</b> port from the charging port transparently.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal <b>accessory</b> nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the <b>accessory</b> nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius muscle to provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E

5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal <b>accessory</b> nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. Injury to the spinal <b>accessory</b> nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E

5|$|The fibres of {{the spinal}} <b>accessory</b> nerve {{originate}} solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal <b>accessory</b> nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal <b>accessory</b> nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{idea for}} a video game that {{presented}} the Metroid series in a pinball setting came to Kensuke Tanabe after he learned that Fuse Games had previously worked on Mario Pinball Land, another pinball video game. Recalling that the series' protagonist, Samus, can morph into a ball, Tanabe {{was convinced that the}} Metroid universe could be adapted to a pinball setting. The game was sold with a Rumble Pak <b>accessory</b> for the Nintendo DS, marking the first time the <b>accessory</b> was available for the Nintendo DS.|$|E
5|$|The molars are {{slightly}} more high-crowned (hypsodont) {{than in most}} oryzomyines, {{and many of the}} <b>accessory</b> crests are reduced, but they are sharply distinct from the highly derived, hypsodont molars of Holochilus. The main cusps are located opposite each other and have rounded edges. The enamel folds do not extend past the midlines of the molars. The mesoloph, an <b>accessory</b> crest on the upper molars that is usually well-developed in oryzomyines, is present but short on the first and second upper molar; it is much more reduced in Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys. The corresponding structure on the lower molars, the mesolophid, is present on the first and second molars in Lundomys, but absent in both Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys. Another <b>accessory</b> crest, the anteroloph, is present, though small, on the first upper molar in Lundomys, but entirely absent in both other genera. As in Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys, the anterior cusp on the first lower molar, the anteroconid, contains a deep pit. Each of the three upper molars has three roots; unlike in both Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys, the first upper molar lacks an <b>accessory</b> fourth root. The first lower molar has four roots, including two small <b>accessory</b> roots located between larger anterior and posterior roots. The second molar has either two or three roots, with the anterior root split into two smaller roots in some specimens.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the <b>accessory</b> nerve is {{described}} as having a small cranial component that descends from the medulla and briefly connects with the spinal <b>accessory</b> component before branching off of the nerve to join the vagus nerve. A study, published in 2007, of twelve subjects suggests that {{in the majority of}} individuals, this cranial component does not make any distinct connection to the spinal component; the roots of these distinct components were separated by a fibrous sheath in all but one subject.|$|E
