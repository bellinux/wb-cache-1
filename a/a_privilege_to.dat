Władysław's policy of unifying the two legal systems was partial and uneven at first but achieved a lasting influence. By {{the time of the}} Union of Lublin in 1569, there was not much difference between the administrative and judicial systems in force in Lithuania and Poland.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this presentation, Adam Teller {{discusses}} {{the change of}} status of Jews in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the subjects of the King in the late medieval period to subjects of lords, in private dominions during the early modern period. He contrasts two legal documents: <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> granted <b>to</b> Jews by King Kazimierz Jagiellończyk (1453) and <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> granted <b>to</b> Jews {{in the town of}} Jampol by the town's owner.

25|$|On 15 July 2014, Gove's {{four-year}} {{stint in}} charge of the Department for Education came to an end when he was replaced as Secretary of State for Education by former Treasury Minister Nicky Morgan in a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle and moved to the post of Government Chief Whip. This was portrayed as a demotion by his detractors, although Prime Minister David Cameron denied this was the case. Gove told BBC News that he had mixed emotions about starting the new role, saying it was <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>to</b> become Chief Whip but that leaving the Department for Education was “a wrench”.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of domestic routes was a contentious political issue. SAS held <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>to</b> commence any route they wished, but lacked regional airliners {{to serve the}} smaller airports. Norway and Sweden had seen extensive construction of regional and smaller primary airports earlier than in Denmark. In Norway the independent operator Braathens SAFE was allowed to operate {{a majority of the}} domestic services and in Sweden Linjeflyg had been established to fly the larger portion of domestic hauls. This had been met by skepticism in Denmark, where this was seen as a breach of the agreements establishing the SAS consortium. It also made some Danish politicians call {{for the establishment of a}} Danish domestic carrier.|$|E
25|$|His {{interest}} in Italian music {{led to his}} receiving, in August 1739, <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>to</b> publish arrangements for the musette, hurdy-gurdy or flute of concertos and sonatas by ten specific Italian composers, in addition to Johann Joachim Quantz and Antoine Mahaut. Le printems, ou Les saisons amusantes (1739) is a particularly amusing result of this privilege; it is an arrangement of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons for hurdy-gurdy or musette, violin, and flute (though the French flute could also mean the recorder). He replaced Vivaldi's original Summer with his op. 8 no. 9 concerto, transferred the middle movement of Winter to Autumn, and replaced Winter op. 8 no. 12. All this was quite freely arranged and combined with some added Vivaldian material by Chédeville.|$|E

25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>to</b> serve.|$|E
25|$|To win {{support from}} the nobles, in May 1434 Sigismund granted <b>a</b> <b>{{privilege}}</b> <b>to</b> both Catholic and Orthodox nobles. The privilege guaranteed their right to buy, sell, exchange, gift, and inherit land. The veldamas, a class of dependent peasants, were released from taxes and obligations to the state—all their earnings now belonged to the nobles. No noble was to be punished or imprisoned for crimes without a court order. Lithuania divided into two camps: supporters of Sigismund (the Lithuanian lands, Samogitia, Trakai Voivodeship, and Minsk); and supporters of Švitrigaila (Polotsk, Vitebsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Volhynia). There began three years of devastating hostilities. On 8 December 1432 the armies of Švitrigaila and Sigismund met in the Battle of Ašmena. Švitrigaila had enlisted the aid of Sayid Ahmad I, Khan of the Golden Horde, and wrote to Pope Eugenius IV and Council of Florence hoping to gain their support by promising a church union. He planned to attack the Grand Duchy's capital, Vilnius, and resume the throne. Both sides suffered heavy losses, and final victory went to Sigismund. The Teutonic Order officially observed the truce, but continued its secret support for Švitrigaila, mostly through its Livonian branch.|$|E

At the behest of James Easton, {{president}} of the International Archery Federation, archery events were held in the historic stadium, hoping that its history and natural beauty would attract the public to the sport. Laurence Godfrey, the fourth-place finisher in the men's individual event, remarked that the stadium inspired pride, while American Vic Wunderle spoke for most of the archers in saying, [...] "It's a great honor and <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>to</b> be able to compete inside the 1896 Olympic Stadium." ...|$|E

[...] Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, [...] "Was I sorry that I chose to come by hand cart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since.

The creation of the Royal Air Force did not initially {{have a big impact}} on Allingham and he later remarked that at that time he still considered himself a navy man. [...] In the RAF he was ranked as a Rigger Aero, Aircraft Mechanic Second Class and was given a new service number: 208317. Allingham returned to the Home Establishment in February 1919 and was formally discharged to the RAF Reserve on 16 April 1919. During the last few years of his life Allingham was recognized as the last surviving founding member of the RAF. Speaking with Dennis Goodwin of the First World War Veterans' Association, Allingham said, [...] "It is a shock as well as <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>to</b> think that I am the only man alive from that original reorganisation when the RAF was formed." ...|$|E
