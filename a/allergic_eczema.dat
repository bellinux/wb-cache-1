40|$|Background: Allergic {{diseases}} co-occur in many patients. There is no published population-based epidemiologic study about allergic {{diseases in}} Turkey. Objective: The {{aim of this}} population-based {{study was to investigate}} the prevalence of <b>allergic</b> <b>eczema,</b> allergic rhinitis, and asthma and their co-occurence in Manisa. Methods: The sample size was calculated using an estimated prevalence of ever wheezing for the analyzed age group. Interviews were conducted with 725 children. The survey instrument consisted of a set of sociodemographic questions plus the questionnaire of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. Results: The mean (SD) age of the children studied was 8. 94 (5. 16) years. The prevalence of ever having <b>allergic</b> <b>eczema</b> was 4. 7 % whereas that of current <b>allergic</b> <b>eczema</b> was 3. 2 %. Current allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis were present in 14. 5 % and 13 %, respectively. Asthma was reported in 14. 7 % of the children older than 3 years of age while the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma was 7. 9 %. The burden of allergy was 27. 1 %. The prevalence of concomitant eczema and rhinitis was 1. 9 %. Among children aged between 3 and 17 years, 1. 5 % and 4. 7 % had asthma along with eczema and rhinitis respectively. Asthma was signifi cantly more common in children with rhinitis (31. 5 % vs 11. 8 %; P <. 01; odds ratio [OR], 3. 45). Asthma was diagnosed in 28. 1 % of children with eczema and 14 % of children without eczema (P =. 03; OR, 2. 41).

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} potential beneficial role of probiotic supplementation in the prevention and treatment of atopic diseases in children. Probiotics are defined as ingested live microorganisms that, when administered in an adequate amount, confer a health benefit to the host. They are mainly represented by Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. Several epidemiological data demonstrate that intestinal microflora of atopic children {{is different from the}} one of healthy children. Many literature data show that probiotics may modulate the intestinal microflora composition and may have immunomodulatory effect. Based on this hypothesis, probiotics are supposed to confer benefits to allergic diseases. Administration of probiotics when a natural population of indigenous intestinal bacteria is still developing could theoretically influence immune development by favoring the balance between Th 1 and Th 2 inflammatory responses. For this reason, some studies have evaluated the potential impact of probiotics supplementation in the prevention of atopic dermatitis, with contrasting results. Clinical improvement in immunoglobulin (Ig) E-sensitized (atopic) eczema following probiotic supplementation has been reported in some published studies and the therapeutic effects of probiotics on atopic dermatitis seemed to be encouraging. However, as far as the usefulness of probiotics as a prevention strategy is concerned, results are still inconclusive. In fact, the clinical benefits of probiotic therapy depend upon numerous factors, such as the type of bacteria, dosing regimen, delivery method and other underlying host factors, such as age and diet. More studies are still needed to definitively prove the role of probiotics in the treatment of <b>allergic</b> <b>eczema...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{conflicting}} evidence that traffic-related air pollution {{is a risk}} factor for allergic conditions. Few studies have investigated this in adults. In adults, a high proportion of asthma, rhinitis and eczema is triggered by non-allergic factors. We investigated traffic as {{a risk factor for}} allergic versus non-allergic asthma and rhinitis, and eczema, in adults. A questionnaire from 2000 (n = 9319, 18 – 77 years) provided individual data about disease outcome and self-reported traffic exposure. Additional exposure assessments were obtained using Geographical Informations Systems (GIS). Residential addresses were linked to the national Swedish Road Database and to a pollutant database with modelled annual means of NO x (Nitrogen Oxids). Results Living within 100 m from a road with a traffic intensity of > 10 cars/min (24 hour mean) was associated with prevalence of current asthma reported to be triggered by allergic factors (OR = 1. 83, 95 % CI = 1. 23 – 2. 72) and with allergic rhinitis (OR = 1. 30, 95 %CI = (1. 05 – 1. 61). No relation was seen with asthma or rhinitis triggered by other factors. Living within 100 m of a road with > 10 cars/min was also associated with hand-eczema during the last 12 months (OR = 1. 63, 95 % CI = 1. 19 – 2. 23), but not with <b>allergic</b> <b>eczema</b> or diagnosed hand-eczema. Consistent results were seen using self-reported traffic, but the associations with NO x were less consistent. Conclusion Exposure to traffic was associated with a higher prevalence of allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis, but not with asthma or rhinitis triggered by non-allergic factors. This difference was suggested by the overall pattern, but only clear using GIS-measured traffic intensity as a proxy for traffic exposure. An association was also found with hand-eczema during the last 12 months. We suggest that asthma and rhinitis should not be treated as homogenous groups when estimating effects from traffic in adults. </p...|$|E
40|$|Both {{genetic and}} {{environmental}} factors are important {{for the development of}} allergic diseases. However, a detailed understanding of how such factors act together is lacking. To elucidate the interplay between genetic {{and environmental factors}} in allergic diseases, we used a novel bioinformatics approach that combines feature selection and machine learning. In two materials, PARSIFAL (a European cross-sectional study of 3113 children) and BAMSE (a Swedish birth-cohort including 2033 children), genetic variants as well as environmental and lifestyle factors were evaluated for their contribution to allergic phenotypes. Monte Carlo feature selection and rule based models were used to identify and rank rules describing how combinations of genetic and environmental factors affect the risk of allergic diseases. Novel interactions between genes were suggested and replicated, such as between ORMDL 3 and RORA, where certain genotype combinations gave odds ratios for current asthma of 2. 1 (95 % CI 1. 2 - 3. 6) and 3. 2 (95 % CI 2. 0 - 5. 0) in the BAMSE and PARSIFAL children, respectively. Several combinations of environmental factors appeared to be important for the development of allergic disease in children. For example, use of baby formula and antibiotics early in life was associated with an odds ratio of 7. 4 (95 % CI 4. 5 - 12. 0) of developing asthma. Furthermore, genetic variants together with environmental factors seemed to play a role for allergic diseases, {{such as the use of}} antibiotics early in life and COL 29 A 1 variants for asthma, and farm living and NPSR 1 variants for <b>allergic</b> <b>eczema.</b> Overall, combinations of environmental and life style factors appeared more frequently in the models than combinations solely involving genes. In conclusion, a new bioinformatics approach is described for analyzing complex data, including extensive genetic and environmental information.

40|$|The hypolipidaemic {{effect of}} a new drug, {{gemfibrozil}} (CI- 719), was studied for 20 weeks in 20 patients with primary type IIb, III, IV or V hyperlipoproteinaemia. Baseline recordings of serum cholesterol (9. 1 mmol/l), triglyceride (3. 79 mmol/l) and ultra-centrifugally isolated lipoproteins were obtained during a six-week pretreatment period with stable diet and body weight. With 800 mg of gemfibrozil per day given in two divided doses, the mean serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels were decreased by 44. 6 % and 10. 5 % respectively, during 20 treatment weeks. Only 2 patients were completely resistant to the hypolipidaemic action of the drug. Serum triglyceride was brought down to normal levels in 9 subjects. After 12 weeks of treatment the mean VLDL-triglyceride, VLDL-cholesterol, and LDL-triglyceride were reduced by 48. 5 %, 57. 6 %, and 22. 7 % respectively, while the HDL-cholesterol rose by 16 %. The LDL-cholesterol increased slightly but significantly during treatment in type IV patients and decreased in type IIb patients. The change of LDL-cholesterol showed an inverse correlation with the initial LDL-cholesterol level (r=- 0. 87). The postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities, determined separately by an immunochemical method, increased during four weeks of gemfibrozil treatment (+ 18. 1 % and + 20. 6 % respectively), but neither of these changes was significantly correlated with the changes {{in any of the}} serum lipid or lipoprotein levels. Oral glucose tolerance was not influenced by the treatment, but one-hour plasma insulin increased slightly during administration of the drug. One patient discontinued the drug after eight weeks because of generalized <b>allergic</b> <b>eczema,</b> but no other side effects were recorded. It is concluded that gemfibrozil is highly effective in reducing elevated serum VLDL levels. The simultaneous elevation of LDL in type IV patients needs more attention and study.

40|$|Allergy is a {{hypersensitivity}} reaction mediated by specific antibody-mediated or cell-mediated immunologic mechanisms and clinically manifested as atopic <b>eczema,</b> <b>allergic</b> rhinoconjunctivitis, or asthma. During the recent decades {{there has been}} an increase in allergy prevalence, which is attributed to changes in environmental factors. The so-called "hygiene hypothesis' suggests that a lack of exposure to microbial stimulus early in childhood is a major factor involved in this trend. This provides a rationale for using probiotics to modify the gut microbiota and thereby shaping the immune response of the host, especially in infancy. Most success has been obtained in primary prevention of atopic eczema. A limited number of studies also provided evidence for a beneficial effect of different probiotics in the management of <b>allergic</b> diseases (atopic <b>eczema,</b> <b>allergic</b> rhinitis). However, choice of probiotic strains as well as timing of the intervention are important variables.

Also during the past 12 months the prevalence of night dry coughs, allergic rhinitis symptoms and eczema symptoms in those who had pet exposure in the first year of their life was lower than the children did not have it. However there was no significant difference in some other symptoms of asthma in two groups. Our findings suggest that pet exposure in the first year of life can have a protective effect on asthma, <b>allergic</b> rhinitis and <b>eczema...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Data on the {{association}} between attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and atopic diseases have been inconclusive. Objectives: We assessed whether children with ADHD {{are more likely to}} have a history of atopy like asthma, <b>allergic</b> rhinitis or <b>eczema</b> than children without ADHD. Methods: A retrospective nested case-control study among children (6 - 12 years) using the IADB. nl prescription database was preformed. Medication proxies were used for the identification of ADHD and atopy. Cases were defined as children with at least two prescriptions of methylphenidate within 12 months. Cases were matched to four controls: patients without ADHD medication, on age, sex and area code. For each case and control, we recorded the presence of asthma, <b>allergic</b> rhinitis and <b>eczema</b> in the 3 years prior to the inclusion. Asthma was defined as having at least three prescriptions of an inhaled corticosteroid or a short working betamimetic, allergic rhinitis was defined as having at least three prescriptions of a corticosteroid for nasal use and eczema was defined as having at least three prescriptions of ointments containing steroids or at least three prescriptions of calcineurin inhibitors, all within 12 months. We further assessed the parental ADHD and atopic diseases as a predicting parameter on developing ADHD in childhood. Conditional logistic regression analysis was applied to obtain odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Results: We identified 4257 cases and 17 028 controls. Asthma, <b>allergic</b> rhinitis and <b>eczema</b> were more common in cases than controls with odds ratios of 1. 4 (95 %CI: 1. 3 - 1. 6), 1. 4 (95 %CI: 1. 1 - 1. 8) and 1. 3 (95 %CI: 1. 1 - 1. 5), respectively. Association of parental use of medication for atopy on receiving ADHD medication in the offspring (OR: 1. 1; 95 %CI: 1. 0 - 1. 2) was higher in cases compared to controls. Conclusions: This study suggests that atopic diseases are associated with the development of ADHD. Future studies should focus on the genetic component of {{the association}} to clarify the possible underlying mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigate}} if long-term {{exposure to}} traffic pollution {{is a risk}} factor for development of chronic respiratory disease and allergy in adults and children in southern Sweden (Scania). Information about health was obtained from surveys and health care registers. Traffic pollution exposure was estimated by traffic intensity and levels of NOx at residential addresses, which were obtained by GIS-based methods. Paper 1 found that adults living close to dense traffic had higher prevalence of asthma and COPD. Paper 2 found that adults living close to dense traffic had higher prevalence of allergic asthma, <b>allergic</b> rhinitis and <b>eczema</b> but not non-allergic asthma or rhinitis. Paper 3 found that asthma in adults was associated with dense traffic at the home location but not traffic at the work location, daily time spent outdoor in traffic or a combined exposure estimate. Paper 4 found that growing up close to dense traffic was not associated with higher incidence of asthma medication, asthma diagnosis, obstructive bronchitis diagnosis or bronchiolitis diagnosis, in children 0 - 6 years. In conclusion, living close to dense traffic was associated with prevalence of asthma, COPD, <b>allergic</b> rhinitis and <b>eczema,</b> in adults, but not with incidence of asthma or other obstructive respiratory disease in young children...|$|R
