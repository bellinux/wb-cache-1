5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa may actually be composed of three distinct species.

5|$|Biomechanical {{studies by}} Ken Carpenter in 2002 {{confirmed}} that the most likely function of the forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods.

In laboratory studies, some dietary diversity seems necessary for proper larval development. Blood-only diets allow only 12% of larvae to mature, whereas blood and yeast or dog chow diets allow almost all larvae to mature. Another study <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> 90% of larvae matured into adults when the diet included nonviable eggs.

An Air Force reconnaissance flight was sent to Dean on September 27 and only reported winds of 35mph (55km/h) at 23miles (37kilometres) from the center. A pressure of 999millibars (29.50inHg) indicated that Dean was strengthening as it headed northward. Additionally, satellite pictures showed that the subtropical cyclone was emerging from the cloud.

5|$|At {{the onset}} of the Quaternary glacial cycles, around 2.6 mya, the extant Triturus species had already emerged. They were thus {{affected}} by the cycles of expansion and retreat of cold, inhospitable regions, which shaped their distribution. A study using environmental niche modelling and phylogeography showed that during the Last Glacial Maximum, around 21,000 years ago, crested and marbled newts likely survived in warmer refugia mainly in southern Europe. From there, they recolonised the northern parts after glacial retreat. The study <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> species range boundaries shifted, with some species replacing others during recolonisation, for example the southern marbled newt which expanded northwards and replaced the marbled newt. Today's most widespread species, the northern crested newt, was likely confined to a small refugial region in the Carpathian Basin during the last glaciation, and from there expanded its range north-, east- and westwards when the climate rewarmed.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, the Swedish team {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} Berkeley team's inability to detect element 102 in 1958, maintaining that they did discover it. However, later work has shown that no nobelium isotopes lighter than 259No (no heavier isotopes could have been produced in the Swedish experiments) with a half-life over 3minutes exist, and that the Swedish team's results are most likely from thorium-225, which has a half-life of 8minutes and quickly undergoes triple alpha decay to polonium-213, which has a decay energy of 8.53612MeV. This hypothesis is lent weight {{by the fact that}} thorium-225 can easily be produced in the reaction used and would not be separated out by the chemical methods used. Later work on nobelium <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the divalent state is more stable than the trivalent one and hence that the samples emitting the alpha particles could not have contained nobelium, as the divalent nobelium would not have eluted with the other trivalent actinides. Thus, the Swedish team later retracted their claim and associated the activity to background effects.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{an attempt}} was made to {{relocate}} the original quarry where A. fragillimus and other species had been found, using ground-penetrating radar in an attempt to image bones still buried in the ground. This attempt failed because the fossilized mudstone bones were the same density as the surrounding rock, making it impossible to differentiate the two. A study of the local topography <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the fossil-bearing rock strata was severely eroded, and probably was so at the time Lucas made his discovery of A. fragillimus, indicating {{that a majority of the}} skeleton was gone by the time the vertebra and femur were recovered.|$|E

They <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex nanomaterials.|$|E

5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for Civil Aviation that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of Civil Aviation had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine boost pump was operating, a vortex in the engine fuel tank prevented water from entering the engine. The tests <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> when the boost pump was turned off, any water would soon {{find its way into}} the engine. The Department of Civil Aviation believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off. However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's loss of power was not due to water in the fuel.|$|E
5|$|In The American Species of Crepis, Babcock and Stebbins {{described}} {{the concept of}} the polyploid complex, and its role in plant evolution. Some genera, such as Crepis, have a complex of reproductive forms that center on sexually diploid populations that have also given rise to polyploid ones. Babcock and Stebbins also observed that allopolyploid types formed from the hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or autotetraploid species, and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> hybridization in the polyploid complex could provide a mechanism for genetic exchange between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed. Their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all these complex processes could provide information on the history of a genus. This monograph was described by Swedish botanist Åke Gustafsson as the most important work on the formation of species during that period.|$|E

The charts <b>also</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the proposed top stages for K-25 should be abandoned, as should Lawrence's recommendation to add more alpha stages to the Y-12 plant. Groves accepted their proposal to add more base units to the K-27 gaseous-diffusion plant and one more Beta stage track for Y-12. These additions were estimated to cost $100 million, with completion in February 1946. Soon after Japan surrendered in August 1945, Peterson recommended that S-50 be shut down. The Manhattan District ordered this on 4 September. The last uranium hexafluoride was sent to K-25, and the plant had ceased operation by 9 September. S-50 was completely demolished in 1946.|$|E
