5|$|Renamed Aso by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) {{she served}} as a {{training}} ship after extensive repairs. The ship was converted into a minelayer in 1917 and was decommissioned in 1930 to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship. She was eventually sunk <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> in 1932.|$|E
5|$|During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, Nisshin {{participated in}} the Battle of the Yellow Sea and was damaged in the {{subsequent}} Battle of Tsushima. In addition she frequently bombarded the defenses of Port Arthur. The ship played a limited role in World War I and was used to escort Allied convoys and search for German commerce raiders in the Indian Ocean and Australasia. In 1918, Nisshin was deployed to the Mediterranean and then escorted the surrendered German submarines allocated to Japan from Britain to Japan after the war. She became a training ship in 1927 and was sunk <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship in 1936. Her wreck was later refloated and used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> again in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about her {{activities}} {{after the end of}} the war other than she was redesignated as a training ship on 12 May 1947. She was sunk <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship by SS-N-1 missiles on 21 November 1952.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Camäleon and Cyclop were {{stricken}} {{from the}} naval register owing to their deteriorated condition and were broken up. Throughout the 1870s, the remaining {{members of the}} class performed a variety of tasks, including conducting cartographic surveys, weapons testing with new self-propelled torpedoes, and fishery protection duties. In 1873, Delphin was sent to Spain to protect German nationals during the Third Carlist War. Basilisk was hulked in 1875 and used to store naval mines until at least 1900. Blitz was also reduced to a hulk in 1876 but was scrapped two years later. Meteor and Comet were stationed in the Mediterranean during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 to protect Germans in the Ottoman Empire. Later that year, Meteor returned to Germany and was sunk <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship. Comet and Delphin were discarded in 1881; the former was hulked in 1881 and broken up some time after 1891, while Delphin was simply scrapped after being stricken. Drache was the last surviving member of the class in service, conducting survey work until September 1887, when she too was stricken from the register and sunk <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship.|$|E
40|$|Trastuzumab (TZ) is a humanized {{monoclonal}} antibody targeted to the extracellular domain of human {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor 2 (HER 2), a tyrosine kinase receptor. TZ is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{for the treatment of}} HER 2 -overexpressing early stage and metastatic breast cancer and HER 2 -overexpressing metastatic gastric cancer. For breast cancer, it is recommended <b>as</b> both <b>a</b> single agent and in combination with standard chemotherapy. In the last few years, TZ has also been used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>targeting</b> ligand. Overexpression of HER 2 in breast cancer and the presence of free surface functional groups on TZ provide an opportunity to use it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>targeting</b> ligand. TZ can be conjugated to various nanoparticulate systems such as dendrimers, polymeric, and protein nanoparticles to target drug delivery. TZ-conjugated inorganic nanoparticles have been reported for imaging and diagnostic purposes. This review summarizes the applications of TZ both <b>as</b> <b>a</b> therapeutic agent and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>targeting</b> ligand...|$|R

30|$|MNT can be {{utilized}} to deliver 125 I into the nuclei of cancer cells overexpressing EGFR, significantly enhancing cytotoxicity. Further evaluation of [125 I]SGMIB-MNT <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>targeted</b> radiotherapeutic for EGFR-expressing cancer cells appears warranted.|$|R
5|$|After the war, Prinz Eugen {{was handed}} over to France. The French removed the main {{armament}} for inspection and used the ship to test aerial bombardment attacks, before she was finally used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship by the battleships , , and , and sunk in the Atlantic in June 1922.|$|E
5|$|Belliqueuse {{served with}} the Evolutionary Squadron for six months from 5 June 1877 and was reduced to reserve afterwards. She was paid off on 15 November 1884 and struck off the Navy List on 3 May 1886. Belliqueuse was used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Both New York and Texas entered {{service in}} 1914 and {{immediately}} {{served in the}} occupation of Veracruz, and service reinforcing the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet in the North Sea during World War I, during which time New York {{is believed to have}} sunk a U-boat in an accidental collision. Both ships undertook numerous training exercises and overhauls during the interwar era, and joined the Neutrality Patrol at the beginning of World War II. Outmoded by more advanced battleships in service, both ships served primarily as convoy escorts and naval artillery during the war. New York supported Operation Torch in North Africa, undertook convoy patrols and training in the Atlantic, and supported the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa. Texas supported Operation Torch, Operation Overlord, the bombardment of Cherbourg, Operation Dragoon and the battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Following the war, New York was used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship in Operation Crossroads and sunk <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> in 1948, while Texas was converted into a museum ship, and remains permanently moored in San Jacinto State Park today.|$|E

5|$|Chervona Ukraina {{was raised}} on 3 November 1947, repaired, {{and used as}} a {{training}} hulk until 30 October 1950 when she became a target ship. On 10 May 1952, she was grounded on a spit {{to serve as a}} fixed target. Little is known about Krasny Kavkazs activities {{after the end of the}} war other than she was redesignated as a training ship on 13 May 1947. She was sunk <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship by SS-N-1 missiles on 21 November 1952.|$|E
5|$|Hannover {{was struck}} from the navy list in 1936 and {{destined for the}} scrapyard. There were ideas to rebuild her <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship {{especially}} for aircraft, although this never occurred. Schlesien was re-boilered and converted into a training ship as well in 1936. The following year, Schlesien toured South America, including a stop in Argentina in December. By 1939, both ships had been replaced in front-line service by newer ships, and were instead relegated to training duties.|$|E
5|$|Hessen was recommissioned on 1 April 1937 {{and served}} in the Kriegsmarine through World War II. On 31 March 1940, Hessen acted as an {{icebreaker}} for the auxiliary cruisers , , and , on their trip from Kiel to the North Sea. She and her control ship, Blitz, were ceded to the Soviet Union in 1946. She recommissioned on 3 June 1946 as Tsel, and continued to operate <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship until scrapped in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Hizen {{supported}} the Japanese {{intervention in the}} Russian Civil War in 1918 and was often stationed in Vladivostok as a guardship. On 1 September 1921 she was reclassified as a 1st class coast defence ship and disarmed at Sasebo in April 1922 {{in accordance with the}} Washington Naval Treaty. She was stricken on 20 September 1923 and sunk <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship in the Bungo Channel on 25 July 1924.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 Resistance {{began to}} be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> for the testing of armour against the effects of torpedoes and gunfire. She was sold for scrap on 11 November 1898.

5|$|In 1900, Oldenburg {{was reduced}} {{to serve as a}} harbor guard ship. She was later used as a depot ship before being {{stricken}} from the naval register on 13 January 1912. The vessel was then used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>target</b> ship by the High Seas Fleet until after the German defeat in World War I. Oldenburg was sold to Hattinger Company, a ship-breaking firm, on 5 May 1919. The ship was dismantled for scrap in Wilhelmshaven that year.|$|E
