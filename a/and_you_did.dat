500|$|The game's {{difficult}} and unforgiving gameplay frustrated critics. Game Revolution explained that, while in previous Tomb Raider games [...] "instant death came {{about if you}} were trying to rush through an area <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> something stupid", every step in Tomb Raider III [...] "is a potential threat of instant death, no matter how careful you're trying to be." [...] The publication {{went so far as to}} call Tomb Raider III [...] "a marketing concept", stating that the game is so difficult that it is impossible to beat without buying a strategy guide. Similarly, Electronic Gaming Monthly criticised the game for being rushed and highly frustrating, noting that it has [...] "too many instances of cheap deaths." [...] The magazine also remarked that the stealth elements in the Nevada levels were ineffective, especially when compared to Konami's 1998 hit Metal Gear Solid.|$|E
500|$|In {{her first}} episode, it is {{revealed}} that Lauren {{is a member}} of William McKinley High's wrestling team. TV Squad has said that [...] "Lauren can deliver a zinger with the bite of Sue Sylvester and the humor of our beloved Brittany Pierce." [...] Seth Abramovitch of TV.com expressed his dissatisfaction with her attitude: [...] "Zizes isn't just a heavy, supremely confident girl. She's also extremely violent. She’s on the wrestling team, speaks regularly of injuring Puck, and, in one hallway smackdown against the jealous Santana Lopez, proved she was {{a lot more than just}} bark. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> catch that part about Zizes wanting to be famous for famous' sake, right? That she was willing to give herself up to Puck purely in pursuit of a reality show and fragrance line? There’s a word for people who do things like that in the real world: It's 'asshole'." [...] He went on to add: [...] "Zizes has been hailed by feminists groups (well, by Bust Magazine) as a new kind of plus-sized heroine—an obese female role model who for once doesn't hate herself. On the contrary, she thinks she's the bee's knees. When 'Puck serenaded her with Queen's [...] "Fat-Bottomed Girls," [...] she rebuffed him, saying, 'I look like America looks, and just like America, I need more than just a song to get my juices flowing'." ...|$|E

2500|$|My {{feeling was}} one of {{confidence}} when Spruance was there. When you moved into Admiral Halsey's command from Admiral Spruance's … you moved [...] {{an area in which}} you never knew what {{you were going to do}} in the next five minutes or how you were going to do it, because the printed instructions were never up to date.... He never did things the same way twice. When you moved into Admiral Spruance's command, the printed instructions were up to date, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> things in accordance with them.|$|E
2500|$|Eisner's {{most trusted}} {{assistant}} on The Spirit, however, was Jules Feiffer, later a renowned cartoonist, playwright and screenwriter {{in his own}} right. Eisner later said of their working methods [...] "You should hear me and Jules Feiffer going at it in a room. 'No, you designed the splash page for this one, then you wrote the ending— I {{came up with the}} idea for the story, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it up to this point, then I did the next page and this sequence here and...' And I'll be swearing up and down that 'he' wrote the ending on that one. We never agree".|$|E
