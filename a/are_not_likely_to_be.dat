The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.|$|E
25|$|After his {{expulsion}} from Rugby School for drunkenness, the young Flashman looks {{for an easy}} life.

Flashman throws himself into the social life that the 11th offered and becomes a leading light of Canterbury society. In 1840 the regiment is converted to Hussars with an elegant blue and crimson uniform, which assists Flashman in attracting female attention for the remainder of his military career.|$|E

25|$|Mutations in the pncA gene of M. tuberculosis, which encodes a pyrazinamidase and {{converts}} pyrazinamide to its active form pyrazinoic acid, {{are responsible}} for the majority of pyrazinamide resistance in M. tuberculosis strains. A few pyrazinamidase resistant strains with mutations in the rpsA gene have also been identified. However, a direct association between these rpsA mutations and pyrazinamide resistance has not been established. It is worth noting that the pyrazinamide resistant M. tuberculosis strain DHMH444 which harbors a mutation in the carboxy terminal coding region of rpsA is fully susceptible to pyrazinoic acid and pyrazinamide resistance of this strain was previously associated with decreased pyrazinamidase activity. Further, this strain was found to be susceptible to pyrazinamide in a mouse model of tuberculosis. Thus, current data indicates that rpsA mutations <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with pyrazinamide resistance. There are currently three main methods of testing for pyrazinamide resistance: 1) phenotypic tests where a tuberculosis strain is grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of pyrazinamide, 2) measuring levels of pyrazinamidase enzyme produced by the tuberculosis strain, or 3) looking for mutations in the pncA gene of tuberculosis. There have been concerns that the most widely used method for phenotypic resistance testing may overestimate the amount of resistant strains.|$|E
25|$|To {{explore a}} male {{strategic}} point of view, proponents of FCC make a simple model of alternative strategies. Female A uses cosmetics {{as part of}} her ritual coalition whenever one of them menstruates; Female B and all her female neighbors use no cosmetics. Male A is prepared to work/invest to gain access; Male B tries a philanderer strategy, moving to the next cycling fertile female, neglecting the previous partner once she is pregnant. Very quickly, Male A will end up working/doing bride-service for Female A's coalition, since he has no competition from Male B. Male A gains regular fitness as a result. Male B will pair up with Female B, but is then liable to abandon her if he finds a new cycling female. She then has little support during pregnancy/breastfeeding. The question will be whether Male B gains sufficient fitness via a roving strategy of picking up cycling, non-cosmetic females. If Male A is not able to compete with Male B in terms of dominance, he is better off choosing the cosmetic females. Because Female B and her non-cosmetic female neighbors get the attentions, but no reliable investment, from Male B, they discourage any investment from the likes of Male A. Once costs of encephalization begin to bite and cooperative strategies are needed to support offspring, how many females will be choosing philanderers in preference to investors? Those females <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ancestors of large-brained hominins like ourselves or the Neanderthals.|$|E
25|$|Distinguishing {{the golden}} eagle from other Aquila eagles in Eurasia is {{potentially}} a greater identification problem. This identification may {{rely on the}} golden's relatively long tail and patterns of white or gray on the wings and tail. Other Aquila eagles do not generally fly in a pronounced dihedral as do golden eagles. At close range, the golden to rufous nape-shawl of the golden eagle is distinctive from other Aquila. Most other Aquila eagles are darker looking in plumage, although the smaller tawny eagle (A. rapax) is often paler than the golden eagle (overlap in range verified only in Bale Mountains, Ethiopia). Among Eurasian Aquila, the adult eastern imperial (A. heliaca) and Spanish imperial eagle (A. adalberti) come closest to attaining similar sizes as golden eagles but this species pair are distinguished by their relatively longer neck, flatter wings in flight, white markings on their shoulder forewing-coverts, paler cream-straw colored nape patch and generally darker coloration. Juvenile imperial eagles are much paler overall (caramel-cream in the Spanish; cream and tawny streaks in the Eastern) and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confused. Steppe eagles (A. nipalensis) can also be nearly golden eagle-sized but are more compact and smaller headed than a golden eagle with little color variation to their dark earth-brown plumage but for juvenile birds which have distinctive cream-colored bands running through their coverts and secondaries. Verreaux's eagle (A. verreauxii) are most similar in size and body shape to the golden, with the Verreaux's being slightly longer overall but marginally less heavy and long-winged than the golden eagle. The plumage is very distinctly different, however, as Verreaux's eagles are almost entirely jet-black but for some striking, contrasting white on the wing primaries, shoulders and upper-wing. This closely related species is known to co-occur with the golden eagle only in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. Other booted eagles in the golden eagle’s range {{are unlikely to be}} confused, due to the differences in size and form. Among the Aquila genus, only the long-winged and tailed wedge-tailed eagle (A. audax) of Australasia notably exceeds the golden eagle in average wingspan and length. However, the wedge-tailed eagle is a slightly less heavy bird.|$|E

500|$|Germanium is not {{considered}} essential {{to the health of}} plants or animals. Germanium in the environment has little or no health impact.

He wrote, [...] "The thing is, I in no way felt like any of what occurred in 'Fundraiser' needed to take place outside the Scranton branch and that’s really why a sitcom should move locations for an episode – because the story couldn't function without it.
