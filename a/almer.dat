5|$|The first {{ascent of}} Mont Blanc in 1786 by Jacques Balmat and Michel Paccard {{initiated}} {{the sport of}} alpine mountaineering, and {{it was during the}} golden age of alpinism (185465) and the silver age of alpinism (186582) {{that the majority of the}} main summits of the massif were first attained. Members of the England-based Alpine Club were instrumental in many of the first ascents, usually accompanied by guides from the towns of Chamonix or Courmayeur, such as Michel Croz, Michel Payot and Émile Rey, as well as the Swiss guide, Christian <b>Almer.</b> Across the massif there are now more than two thousand different mountaineering routes to the summits, ranging greatly in both length and difficulty. These attract climbers from all over the world who, unlike the early ascensionists, now have access to numerous climbing guidebooks, modern safety equipment, good information on climbing routes and technical difficulty, as well as weather forecasts and mountain accommodation and food.|$|E

From the summit of Mont Pelvoux, Whymper discovered that it was overtopped by a neighbouring peak, subsequently named the Barre des Écrins, which, before the annexation of Savoy added Mont Blanc to the possessions of France, was the highest point in the French Alps. Whymper climbed the Barre des Écrins in 1864 with Horace Walker, A. W. Moore and guides Christian <b>Almer</b> senior and junior.|$|E

The authors discuss a multiplicative pricing model for multisource <b>ALM</b> based on the single-source cost model. By simulating various <b>ALM</b> protocols, the study discovered that a multiplicative characteristic is held between the cost of single-source and multisource <b>ALM</b> routing. The multiplicative pricing model makes the minimum cost of multisource <b>ALM</b> more clear for protocol designer and gives a intuitive way to examine the cost of a designed multisource <b>ALM</b> without incurring too many computation complexity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} graph {{construction}} method and restoration method for application level multicast (<b>ALM)</b> using network coding (NC). We tested and evaluated the proposed methods. Multicast communications {{have received a}} lot of attention in recent years because network load is increasing. There are two types of multicast communications: IP multicast and <b>ALM.</b> More flexible <b>ALM</b> has attention focused on it and is an active area of research. Network efficiency of <b>ALM</b> is lower than that of IP multicast. Therefore, we focus on NC to improve communication efficiency of <b>ALM.</b> When NC is applied to <b>ALM,</b> a special path design is needed unlike usual <b>ALM.</b> In addition, nodes often leave <b>ALM</b> because it consists of end hosts. We developed a graph construction method and restoration method for when NC is applied to <b>ALM.</b> We conducted an experiment to evaluate these methods. We evaluated delay and throughput to prove that our proposal is better than existing <b>ALM.</b> In addition, we measured overhead when paths were restored when nodes left and verified the method's practicality...|$|R
40|$|Acral lentiginous {{melanoma}} (<b>ALM)</b> is {{the most}} common type of cutaneous melanoma in Asians. The very early stage of <b>ALM</b> demonstrates only a proliferation of a few atypical melanocytes within the epidermis, and has been termed <b>ALM</b> in situ. A 74 -year-old male patient presented with a pigmented lesion on the left great toe for 12 years, which had initially showed only a few scattered hyperplastic atypical melanocytes without dermal invasion upon biopsy 5 years ago. This time however, rebiopsy of the lesion confirmed a diagnosis of <b>ALM,</b> stage IIIB. It could be inferred that the lesion had slowly progressed from <b>ALM</b> in situ to invasive <b>ALM</b> over a period of 12 years. Herein we report a case of <b>ALM</b> in situ which progressed to invasive <b>ALM</b> over a long period of time. We expect this report may assist physicians in early recognition and proper management of future cases of <b>ALM</b> in situ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Application Layer Multicast (<b>ALM)</b> is an {{effective}} supplement to IP Multicast, but {{it has the potential}} trouble of trust on end systems. For instance, multicast receivers may cheat in order to obtain a better position in the multicast tree. Receiver cheating may transform the multicast tree, and lead to its instability. We establish the cheating model of <b>ALM</b> receivers and analyze the stability of <b>ALM</b> tree when receiver cheating occurs. Simulation results show that receiver cheating has considerably negative effects on the stability of <b>ALM</b> tree. This discovery brings forward an issue in <b>ALM</b> study, that is, we should take receiver cheating into consideration to maintain a stable <b>ALM</b> tree when designing <b>ALM</b> protocols.

40|$|Abstract: In {{structured}} peer-to-peer (p 2 p) networks such as CAN, Pastry, Chord and Tapestry, {{there are}} two general approaches of doing application layer multicast (<b>ALM)</b> i. e. tree building and flooding. In terms of latency, routing length and link stress, tree based <b>ALM</b> like Scribe on Pastry provides better performance than flooding based <b>ALM</b> like in CAN. In this paper, we propose Multiple-Virtual-Rings (Mvring) based <b>ALM</b> {{as an alternative to}} tree based <b>ALM</b> on structured p 2 p network. We present mathematical analysis of Mvring, evaluation and comparison between Mvring and tree based <b>ALM</b> using NS 2 simulations and internet experiments. Mvring based <b>ALM</b> provides equal distribution of node degree, significantly high fault tolerance level, comparable link stress and latency with the tree based <b>ALM.</b> Key words: application layer multicast, group communications, Mvring, structured p 2 p network...|$|R
40|$|While scalability, routing and {{performance}} are core issues for Application-Level Multicast (<b>ALM)</b> protocols, an important but less studied problem is security. In particular, confidentiality (i. e. data secrecy, achieved through data encryption) in <b>ALM</b> protocols is needed. Key management schemes must be simple, scalable, and must not degrade {{the performance of}} the <b>ALM</b> protocol. We explore three key management schemes that leverage the underlying overlay to distribute the key(s) and secure <b>ALM.</b> We evaluate their impact on three well-known <b>ALM</b> protocols: ESM, ALMI and NICE. Through analysis and simulations, we show that utilizing the <b>ALM</b> overlay to distribute key(s) is feasible. For a given <b>ALM</b> protocol, choice of the best key management scheme depends on the application needs: minimizing rekeying latency or minimizing data multicasting latency. 1...|$|R

METHODS: Retrospective study of 17 cases of <b>ALM</b> and 26 acral nevi. RESULTS: Pagetoid cells were present in all <b>ALMs</b> with a visible epidermis and in three nevi. A proliferation of atypical melanocytes at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) and/or in the dermis was visible in nine <b>ALMs</b> but not in nevi.
