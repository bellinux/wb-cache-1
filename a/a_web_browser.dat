A URI {{reference is}} defined as a same-document reference if, when resolved to absolute form, it equates exactly to the base URI in effect for the reference. When encountering a same-document reference, document processing software, for example <b>a</b> <b>web</b> <b>browser,</b> to efficiently use its current representation of a document to satisfy the resolution of a reference to that document without fetching a new representation. URI equivalence is defined as when a URI reference, while not identical to the base URI, still represents the same resource.|$|E

5|$|In February 2011, Dugan {{demonstrated}} an automixer card, marketed by Yamaha, to plug into the accessory slot of a Yamaha digital mixer {{such as the}} O1V96, LS9, M7CL or PM5D.

The Dugan algorithm moved inside Yamaha's QL-eeries of mixers in March 2014, as an option on the graphic equalizer processing page. This internal version could mix 8 or 16 microphones.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS (NDS) {{features}} a touch screen and built-in microphone, and supports wireless IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards. Additionally, the {{revised version of}} the NDS, the Nintendo DSi, features two built in cameras, the ability to download games from the DSi store, and <b>a</b> <b>web</b> <b>browser.</b> The PlayStation Portable (PSP) released later the same year on December 12, 2004, followed a different pattern. It became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its primary storage media. Sony also gave the PSP robust multi-media capability, connectivity with the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 (only on some games), other PSPs, as well as Internet connectivity. The Nintendo DS likewise had connectivity to the internet through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and Nintendo DS Browser, as well as wireless connectivity to other DS systems and Wii consoles. Despite high sales numbers for both consoles, PlayStation Portable sales have consistently lagged behind those of the Nintendo DS; nevertheless, the PlayStation Portable has {{the distinction of being}} the best-selling non-Nintendo handheld gaming system.|$|E
