25|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of differential geometry, a Cartan connection is a flexible generalization {{of the notion}} of an affine connection. It may also be regarded as a specialization of the general concept of a principal connection, in which the geometry of the principal bundle is tied to the geometry of the base manifold using <b>a</b> <b>solder</b> form.

25|$|In general, {{suppose that}} M has {{dimension}} n and H acts on Rn (this {{could be any}} n-dimensional real vector space). <b>A</b> <b>solder</b> form on a principal H-bundle P over M is an Rn-valued 1-form θ: TP → Rn which is horizontal and equivariant so that it induces a bundle homomorphism from TM to the associated bundle P H Rn. This is furthermore required to be a bundle isomorphism. Frame bundles have a (canonical or tautological) solder form which sends a tangent vector X ∈ Tp'P to the coordinates of dπ'p(X) ∈ Tπ(p)M {{with respect to the}} frame p.|$|E

The station will normally have a stand for the hot iron when not in use, and a wet sponge for cleaning. It is most commonly used for soldering electronic components. Other functions may be combined; for example a rework station, mainly for surface-mount components may have a hot air gun, vacuum pickup tool, and <b>a</b> <b>soldering</b> head; <b>a</b> desoldering station will have a desoldering head with vacuum pump for desoldering through-hole components, and <b>a</b> <b>soldering</b> iron head.|$|R

25|$|Two {{processes}} {{play a role}} in <b>a</b> <b>solder</b> joint formation: {{interaction between}} the substrate and molten solder, and solid-state growth of intermetallic compounds. The base metal dissolves in the molten solder in an amount depending on its solubility in the solder. The active constituent of the solder reacts with the base metal with a rate dependent on the solubility of the active constituents in the base metal. The solid-state reactions are more complex – the formation of intermetallics can be inhibited by changing the composition of the base metal or the solder alloy, or by using a suitable barrier layer to inhibit diffusion of the metals.|$|E

2500|$|Note {{that this}} {{definition}} of a Cartan connection looks {{very similar to that}} of a principal connection. [...] There are several important differences, however. [...] First, the 1-form η takes values in g, but is only equivariant under the action of H. [...] Indeed, it cannot be equivariant under the full group G because there is no G bundle and no G action. Secondly, the 1-form is an absolute parallelism, which intuitively means that η yields information about the behavior of additional directions in the principal bundle (rather than simply being a projection operator onto the vertical space). [...] Concretely, the existence of <b>a</b> <b>solder</b> form binds (or solders) the Cartan connection to the underlying differential topology of the manifold.|$|E
2500|$|Colonial silversmiths used {{many of the}} {{techniques}} developed by those in Europe. Casting was frequently {{the first step in}} manufacturing silver pieces, as silver workers would melt down sterling silver into easily manageable ingots. Occasionally, they would create small components (e.g. teapot legs) by casting silver into iron or graphite molds, but it was rare for an entire piece to be fabricated via casting. Next, silversmiths would forge the ingots into the shapes they desired, often hammering the thinned silver against specially shaped dies to [...] "mass produce" [...] simple shapes like the oval end of a spoon. This process occurred at room temperature, and thus is called “cold-working”. The repeated strikes of the hammer work hardened (sterling) silver, causing it to become brittle and difficult to manipulate. To combat work-hardening, silversmiths would anneal their piecesheat it to a dull red and then quench it in water—to relieve the stresses in the material and return it to a more ductile state. Hammering required more time than all other silver manufacturing processes, and therefore accounted for the majority of labor costs. Silversmiths would then seam parts together to create incredibly complex and artistic items, sealing the gaps with <b>a</b> <b>solder</b> of 80 wt% silver and 20 wt% bronze. Finally, they would file and polish their work to remove all seams, finishing off with engraving and a maker’s mark.|$|E
