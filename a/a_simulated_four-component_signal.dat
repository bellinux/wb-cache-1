40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is use phase {{equilibrium}} modeling as an auxiliary tool for product design, especially for those whose desired final properties {{are directly related to}} solid fat content (SFC) and melting behaviour. Solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) modeling has been implemented for triacylglycerols mixtures, the main components of vegetable oils, a renewable raw-material {{for a wide variety of}} products. Excess Gibbs energy models were used to model solid-phases while direct optimization of Gibbs free energy using Generalized Reduced Gradient was performed aiming to compute the number of molecules in each phases at the whole range of melting. As results, a computed phase diagram was compared with experimental data from literature as well as a DSC curve. The model was also used to <b>simulate</b> <b>a</b> <b>four-component</b> DSC curve as a predictive tool...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of evolving projection analysis (EPA) to second-order bilinear data sets consisting {{of more than}} two components is described. EPA is a method for rank analysis of ordered data matrices where the components appear sequentially as a function of time or some other ordinal variable. It was found that extension of the method to mixtures {{of more than two}} components was best accomplished using principal components analysis to preprocess the data. The algorithm is demonstrated using <b>simulated</b> <b>four-component</b> chromatographic data, and experimental data from liquid chromatography (three- and four-component mixtures) and a spectrophotometric titration (four components), both employing UV-visible diode array detection. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a non-binary polar coding scheme that {{can reach the}} equidistant distant spectrum bound for discrete memoryless channels. This is the best that can be reached up to now and is tight for additive white Gaussian channels. To do this, we first define the equidistant property for the polarizing transforms. We have designed transforms that have better distance characteristics using a simple procedure for signal sets. Furthermore, we designed a new <b>four-component</b> <b>signal</b> set in two dimensions to define the equidistant transform for q = 4. We follow Sasoglu's work, which introduces polarizing transforms of all channels for any input alphabet size and defines some constraints to avoid a polarization anomaly. Alternatively, we removed the negative effect of the anomaly on polarization by using transforms with appropriate distance properties. Finally, the speed of polarization is significantly increased by using the proposed transforms with better distance characteristics. Moreover, we show improvement in error performance...|$|R
