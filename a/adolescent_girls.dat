25|$|Researchers {{interested}} in exploring adolescent sexuality using this perspective typically investigates how gender, race, culture, socioeconomic status {{and sexual orientation}} affect how adolescent understand their own sexuality.

Because they are girls, they believe they ought to engage in sexual behavior in order to please their boyfriends.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Uterine angioleiomyoma is a {{very rare}} {{gynecologic}} tumor; only a few such cases {{have been reported to}} date and we have found no such tumor reported in an <b>adolescent</b> <b>girl.</b> CASE: We report the case of a uterine angioleiomyoma in an <b>adolescent</b> <b>girl.</b> It presented as a huge abdomino-pelvic mass. The girl had severe menorrhagia and severe anemia. Intra-operatively no distinct planes were found between myoma and myometrium. Due to severe hemorrhage, she underwent sub-total abdominal hysterectomy. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: Uterine angioleiomyoma is an extremely rare tumor since only 16 such cases have been reported to date. Its appearance in an <b>adolescent</b> <b>girl</b> seems to be the first case of its kind. So it is being reported not only to familiarize the managing physicians with the possibility of such a tumor and its variable presentation, but also to highlight the need for inclusion of this tumor in WHO classification of tumors of the female genital tract...|$|R

25|$|O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} {{assessed}} 180 girls {{between the ages of}} 12 and 14 on their perceptions on what their first sexual encounters would be like; many girls reported feeling negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers think this is because <b>adolescent</b> <b>girls</b> are taught that society views adolescent pre-marital sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and often think about this before they think of their own sexual desires and needs.|$|E

One study observed, interviewed, and evaluated families on the Polynesian Island Sikaiana and found that fostering children from other families within the community is a common shared endeavor that serves to construct relationships, support the community, and nurture compassion and sympathy (aloha). As children mature within the family, they go {{through a process of}} having their needs attended and learn to provide and care for the younger children alongside the adults. <b>Adolescent</b> <b>girls</b> who are active caretakers are referred to as parents, even if there is no biological connection.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{clothing}} {{among the}} Antaifasy {{was made of}} bark cloth or woven mats of beaten reeds or sedges sewn together. The bark cloth from the Antaifasy region was made from a mix of fibers blended together for sheen and softness and became a specialty trade product of the area. For women, this material was sewn to form a tube that was belted at the waist or pulled up at the shoulder. Women and <b>adolescent</b> <b>girls</b> also often wore a mahampy reed band or short top with or without sleeves, to cover the breasts. Men wore a bark loincloth, and over it they would typically wear a vest or tunic; sleeves were added for older men. Woven hats were also commonly worn by Antaifasy men.|$|E

25|$|As {{children}} reach adolescence, {{the period}} of time between age 13 and 19, the dynamics of the parent-child relationship change as peer groups are now the focus of attention. An adolescent with cleft lip or cleft palate will deal with the typical challenges faced by most of their peers including issues related to self-esteem, dating and social acceptance. Adolescents, however, view appearance as the most important characteristic, above intelligence and humor. This being the case, adolescents are susceptible to additional problems because they cannot hide their facial differences from their peers. Adolescent boys typically deal with issues relating to withdrawal, attention, thought, and internalizing problems, and may possibly develop anxiousness-depression and aggressive behaviors. <b>Adolescent</b> <b>girls</b> are more likely to develop problems relating to self-concept and appearance. Individuals with cleft lip or cleft palate often deal with threats to their quality of life for multiple reasons including: unsuccessful social relationships, deviance in social appearance and multiple surgeries.|$|E
25|$|Hensel {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a study with 387 female participants {{between the ages of}} 14 and 17 and found that as the girls got older (and learned more about their sexual self-concept), they experienced less anxiety, greater comfort with sexuality and experienced more instances of sexual activity. Additionally, across the four years (from 14-17), sexual self-esteem increased, and sexual anxiety lessened. The researchers stated that this may indicate that the more sexual experiences the <b>adolescent</b> <b>girls</b> have had, the more confidence they hold in their sexual behavior and sexuality. Additionally, it may mean that for girls who have not yet had intercourse, they become more confident and ready to participate in an encounter for the first time. Researchers state that these patterns indicate that adolescent sexual behavior is not at all sporadic and impulsive, rather that it is strongly affected by the adolescent girls’ sexual self-concept and changes and expands through time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adolescent</b> <b>girls</b> {{and boys}} who are {{attracted}} to others {{of the same sex}} are strongly affected by their surroundings in that adolescents often decide to express their sexualities or keep them secret depending on certain factors in their societies. These factors affect girls and boys differently. If girls’ schools and religions are against same sex attractions, they pose the greatest obstacles to girls who experience same sex attractions. These factors were not listed as affecting boys as much. The researchers suggest that maybe this is because not only are some religions against same-sex attraction, but they also encourage traditional roles for women and do not believe that women can carry out these roles as lesbians. Schools may affect girls more than boys because strong emphasis is placed on girls to date boys, and many school activities place high importance on heterosexuality (such as cheerleading). Additionally, the idea of not conforming to typical male gender roles inhibited many boys from openly expressing their same-sex attraction. The worry of conforming to gender roles didn’t inhibit girls from expressing their same-gender preferences as much, because society is generally more flexible about their gender expression.|$|E
