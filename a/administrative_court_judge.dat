40|$|Legal democracies {{have been}} facing with the {{evolution}} of a system of administrative activity judicial review. Meanwhile the evolving of the Judicial Control over the Public Administration in different countries of civil law systems has produced even in Albania the possibility of a specific judiciary control over the Public Administration in an extended way. The new Albanian Law on Administrative Courts (Law 49 / 2012) provides the power of the Administrative Court of Appeal to judge as a Court of First Instance, in the cases regarding controversies on normative administrative acts. It is a new open door to judge political decision makers, with some implicit consequences on the entire system. Those acts are produced as a further explanation and specification of the Law. Meanwhile they also express the Government Political Direction and Political will. The most important issue which may rise in this case is: How can an <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> <b>judge</b> on the Executive Political Decision? May a Court judge the political will of the Executive? This power, given to the court, if we refer to administrative normative acts produced by public authorities of political nature, is in substance in contrast to the right of exercising political powers. This power to judge the politics should be evaluated case by case, but also some guiding lines should be established. These should be some basic guiding criteria and limits to be followed by the judges in the evaluation of objectives, purposes, aims or proportionality to the situation that has imposed the law. In most of the judiciary systems, the limits of reciprocal control between powers of the state remain a never ending process of practice. It is usual that the law gives to the administration a wide margin of opportunity. The way how executive would use its discretionarily, should be judged in an appropriate way by courts. The limits of court interference in administrative decision making would produce a fair system of judiciary control but may be even an usurpation of government independence of political decision making or administrative flexibility...|$|E

When a business enterprise asks the court to review actions taken by administration, judges decide whether an administrative body has used its powers in accordance with the law. The law in this case includes both the relevant statutory regulations but also more general principles originating from other sources, such as the Constitution or European Union law. It is generally accepted that in such cases courts have discretion, i. e. are able to select legal standards on which to base their judgments and to decide how to apply such standards to the case at hand. This does not mean, of course, that <b>administrative</b> <b>court</b> <b>judges</b> can do what they please.

40|$|This article assesses {{predictors}} of payouts and non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases {{decided by the}} Spanish Supreme Court from 2006 until 2010. Medical malpractice cases can be judged in <b>administrative</b> or civil <b>courts,</b> and this distinction heavily relies {{on the type of}} hospital where the medical accident took place (in general terms, <b>administrative</b> <b>courts</b> <b>judge</b> cases involving public hospitals and civil <b>courts</b> <b>judge</b> cases involving private hospitals). I find that cases decided by the Administrative Section of the Supreme Court are not more likely to receive damages than cases decided by the Civil Section. The probability of receiving compensation is significantly higher among cases involving permanent major/grave injuries. With respect to non-economic compensation amounts, there are no significant differences between Administrative and Civil cases. This result is confirmed by matching estimation and simulation exercises. There is evidence of vertical inequality according to the level of harm: cases involving permanent grave injuries are those receiving the highest non-economic damages, followed by permanent major, death, permanent minor and temporary /emotional cases. Differences in compensation awards between <b>Administrative</b> and Civil <b>courts</b> has been one argument widely used against the current separation of jurisdictions in many civil law tradition countries.
