6000|$|Up to {{this time}} Teddy had no very {{definite}} {{idea of how}} much money had been taken in, and he was thinking {{it would be a}} good idea to ascertain, when <b>a</b> gruff, <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> from the rear asked: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{opened his}} lips to invite her to pass through into the {{restaurant}} with him. Then {{the memory of that}} forged order still in his pocket, flashed into his mind. He hesitated. <b>A</b> cold, <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> at his elbow intervened.|$|R

60|$|Ralph {{heard her}} giving orders to attentive, rosy-checked men in white aprons, {{and in spite}} of his own preoccupation, he commented upon the {{determination}} with which she made her wishes known.

5000|$|Afonya's {{depression}} deepens - he {{has lost}} everything and has nowhere to go. He goes {{to the post office}} and tries to call Katya Snegireva on her memorable phone number 50-50-2, or as he says himself, [...] "rug-rug or two." [...] The answer comes back - Katya has left. Finally frustrated, he goes to the airport. He does not care where he's going or what will happen to him. Things have gotten so bad that a local policeman has to be convinced Afonya is the man in his passport photograph, so grim has he gotten since it was taken. Finally, just when Afonya is heading to the AN-2 aircraft, <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> girlish <b>voice</b> calls out.
