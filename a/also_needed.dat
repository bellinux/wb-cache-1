5|$|At Sampford Peverell two rectories {{were built}} in 1836, {{at the expense of}} the Grand Western Canal Company, in {{compensation}} for cutting through the grounds and demolishing the south wing of the Old Rectory. Two road bridges were <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> in the village.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{has driven}} {{a number of}} cars, {{including}} the Aston Martin V8 Vantage during the 1980s, the V12 Vanquish and DBS during the 2000s, {{as well as the}} Lotus Esprit; the BMW Z3, BMW 750iL and the BMW Z8. He has, however, <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> to drive a number of other vehicles, ranging from a Citroën 2CV to a AEC Routemaster bus, amongst others.|$|E
5|$|Efficiency is {{essential}} to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is <b>also</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1989, it was {{proposed}} to list Loring on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List. This {{was due to}} the presence of waste oil, fuel, solvents, and pesticides in the soil. Additionally, the burning of waste also created problems, in addition to the use of landfills in old gravel pits on site. The fire training area <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> clean up, as materials were burned until 1974 on that site. Loring was officially added to the list in February 1990.|$|E
5|$|In October 1927, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was {{accepted}} for publication by Century, and Marquis was prompted to take down his medical practice sign. However, this was premature, {{as it would be}} some time before royalties were forthcoming. Lack of funds drove Marquis to continue seeing patients and carrying out insurance medical examinations. He <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> to borrow money from relatives and cash in his war risk insurance policy. Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was published in April 1928 and received good reviews.|$|E
5|$|In many cases, {{magnetic}} resonance imaging of the spinal cord is performed to distinguish between Guillain–Barré syndrome and other conditions causing limb weakness, such as spinal cord compression. If an MRI scan shows enhancement of the nerve roots, this may be indicative of GBS. In children, this feature is present in 95% of scans, {{but it is not}} specific to Guillain–Barré syndrome, so other confirmation is <b>also</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|E

5|$|Surveys {{are needed}} to {{determine}} existing population densities and habitat viability for all species of slow loris. Connectivity between protected areas is important for slow lorises {{because they are not}} adapted to dispersing across the ground over large distances. For successful reintroductions, connectivity between sites with low population density is considered ideal. Protected area extensions are <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> in Borneo, Java, and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|The Bond of {{the films}} has driven a number of cars, {{including}} the Aston Martin V8 Vantage, during the 1980s, the V12 Vanquish and DBS during the 2000s, {{as well as the}} Lotus Esprit; the BMW Z3, BMW 750iL and the BMW Z8.

5|$|The Svalbard Treaty {{specifies}} that {{no military}} installations are permitted on the archipelago. The Soviet authorities {{were concerned that}} a permanent civilian airport {{could also be used}} by Norwegian and NATO forces. But the Soviets <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> an airport to serve their settlements at Barentsburg and Pyramiden, and by the early 1970s, an understanding was reached between the two countries.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of DKA is with intravenous fluids and insulin. Depending on the severity, insulin {{may be given}} intravenously or by injection under the skin. Usually potassium is <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> to prevent the development of low blood potassium. Throughout treatment blood sugar and potassium levels should be regularly checked. Antibiotics may be required in those with an underlying infection. In those with severely low blood pH, sodium bicarbonate may be given; however, its use is of unclear benefit and typically not recommended.|$|E
5|$|With {{this growth}} in commerce, Tudor's initial {{monopoly}} on the trade broke down, but he continued to make significant profits from the growing trade. Increased supplies of ice were <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> {{to keep up with}} demand. From 1842 onwards, Tudor and others invested at Walden Pond in New England for additional supplies. New companies began to spring up, such as the Philadelphia Ice Company, which made use of the new railroad lines to transport harvested ice, while the Kershow family introduced improved ice harvesting to the New York region.|$|E
5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E

5|$|A lull {{probably}} occurred {{early in}} the afternoon, and a break for rest and food {{would probably have been}} needed. William may have <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> time to implement a new strategy, which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of this tactic were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate tactic was invented after the battle; most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{recalled}} The Original Series, {{and said}} that she was pleased to be remembered as an Orion slave girl. However, she was not pleased with the make-up process which took between four and five hours to apply, and required each actress to be sprayed with green make-up over their whole body. Removal of the makeup was via the showers in the Paramount lot's executive gym. The make-up team <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> to apply fake sweat and bruises to other members of the cast to represent the results of the increased aggression shown by them in the episode's plot.|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E

5|$|For the film, Deodato cast several inexperienced actors {{from the}} Actors Studio in New York City. Luca Giorgio Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi were cast {{in part because}} they were Italian actors who also spoke English. Deodato decided to make the film in English to appeal to a wider {{audience}} and to lend the film credibility. However, he <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> to establish a European nationality so that the film could be more easily distributed among European countries. Under Italian law, for the film to be recognized as Italian, Deodato had to have at least two native Italian-speaking actors to star in the film.|$|E
5|$|French {{military}} planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more {{active participation in}} North America was needed. However, they <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> to co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making {{an assault on the}} British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations agaynst Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to be informed of the movements of the West Indies fleet.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, common {{starlings}} {{are exempt}} from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the taking or killing of migratory birds. No permit is required to remove nests and eggs or kill juveniles or adults. Research was undertaken in 1966 to identify a suitable avicide that would both kill common starlings and would readily be eaten by them. It <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> to be of low toxicity to mammals and not likely to cause the death of pets that ate dead birds. The chemical that best fitted these criteria was DRC-1339, now marketed as Starlicide. In 2008, the United States government poisoned, shot or trapped 1.7million birds, {{the largest number of}} any nuisance species to be destroyed. In 2005, the population in the United States was estimated at 140million birds, around 45% of the global total of 310million.|$|E
