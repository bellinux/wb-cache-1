The correlation length of the medium and the scale of the support of the source are slightly larger than the wavelength, and the waves propagate in a wide cone with opening angle less than $ 180 ^o$, so that the backward and evanescent waves are negligible. The scattering regime is a bridge between that of radiative transfer, where the waves propagate in all directions and the paraxial regime, where the waves propagate in a narrow <b>angular</b> <b>cone.</b> We connect the one-way radiative transport equation with the equations satisfied by the Wigner transform of the wave field in these regimes.

We show that lowest-order analyses based on this favorable kinematic configuration are only mildly affected by {{the inclusion of the}} O(α) radiative corrections in the ν¯e–e− {{differential cross}} section, thus providing an excellent opportunity for the search of “new physics”.

40|$|We {{study the}} gluon {{radiation}} spectrum off a hard in-medium produced quark in the multiple soft rescattering formalism of Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peigne-Schiff, and of Zakharov (BDMPS-Z). Its {{dependence on the}} quark and gluon energy, on the gluon transverse momentum, on the in-medium pathlength and on the rescattering properties of the nuclear medium is analyzed quantitatively. The two components of gluon radiation, the hard vacuum radiation associated to the quark production vertex, and the medium-induced rescattering contribution interfer destructively. For small spatial extensions of the medium, this destructive interference overcompensates the hard vacuum radiation, and the total medium-induced radiative energy loss decreases proportional to L^ 3. Medium-induced gluon production dominates only above a finite critical length which varies between 3 and more than 6 fm depending on the rescattering properties of the medium. Deviations from the BDMPS-L^ 2 -behaviour persist above the critical length. The medium dependence of the angular gluon distribution is dominated by Brownian transverse momentum broadening. This results in a depletion of the low transverse momentum part of both the hard and the medium-induced contribution. As a consequence, the medium-induced energy loss outside a finite <b>angular</b> <b>cone</b> size can {{be more than a}} factor two larger than the total medium-induced radiative energy loss.

The present study reports on the first attempt to jointly monitor diet and food selection in larvae of this species and to assess {{the influence of the}} ontogenetic development of feeding-related organs on the diet. A. rochei larvae from 2 to 7 mm long are diurnal feeders and highly active predators, with high values of feeding incidence, gut fullness and number of ingested prey items. The rate of change in prey item size in relation to larval size was higher than in other species. Only small, non-motile prey items are eaten at the onset of feeding. Rapid mouth development and the early appearance of teeth allow larvae from 3 to 5 mm long to ingest a wide range of prey. However, niche breadth decreases at 5 mm, when larvae avoid small prey items in favour of larger ones with a higher carbon content. Chesson’s selectivity index indicated that small larvae (from 2 to 3 mm long) selected a variety of small prey items, mainly copepod nauplii. Larvae measuring 3 to 5 mm selectively ate cladocerans and appendicularians, and larvae with lengths ≥ 5 mm preferred appendicularians and fish larvae.

Using this technique, frequency-domain finite-difference solutions accurate for propagation angles out to 60 ° are readily generated for both two-dimensional (2 -D) and three-dimensional (3 -D) models. Solutions for 3 -D problems are computed by applying the 2 -D paraxial operators twice, once along the x-axis and once along the y-axis, at each extrapolation step. The azimuthal anisotropy inherent to this splitting technique is essentially eliminated by adding a phase-correction operator to the extrapolation system. For heterogeneous models, scattering effects are incorporated by determining transmission and reflection coefficients at structural boundaries within the media. The direct forward-scattered waves are modeled with a single pass of the extrapolation operator in the paraxial direction for each frequency. The first-order backscattered energy is then modeled by extrapolation (in the opposite direction) of the reflected field determined on the first pass. Higher order scattering can be included by sweeping through the model with more passes. The chief advantages of the paraxial approach are (1) active storage is reduced by one dimension compared to solutions which must track both forward-scattered and backscattered waves simultaneously; thus, realistic 3 -D problems can fit on today's computers, (2) the decomposition in frequency allows the technique to be implemented on highly parallel machines, (3) attenuation can be modeled as an arbitrary function of frequency, and (4) {{only a small number of}} frequencies are needed to produce movie-like time slices...|$|E

40|$|A novel type of {{particle}} "cooling", called Ionization Cooling, is applicable to slow (v {{of the order}} of 0. 1 c) ions stored in a small ring. The many traversals through a thin foil enhance the nuclear reaction probability, in a steady configuration in which ionisation losses are recovered at each turn by a RF-cavity. For a uniform target "foil" the longitudinal momentum spread diverges exponentially since faster (slower) particles ionise less (more) than the average. In order to "cool" also longitudinally, a chromaticity has to be introduced with a wedge shaped "foil". Multiple scattering and straggling are then "cooled" in all three dimensions, with a method similar to the one of synchrotron cooling, but valid for low energy ions. Particles then stably circulate in the beam indefinitely, until they undergo for instance nuclear processes in the thin target foil. This new method is under consideration for the nuclear production of a few MeV/A ion beams. Simple reactions, for instance Li 7 + D Li 8 + p, are more favourably exploited with the heavier ion colliding against a gas-jet D 2 target. Kinematics is generally very favourable, with emission angles in a narrow <b>angular</b> <b>cone</b> and a relatively concentrated outgoing energy spectrum which allows an efficient collection as a neutral gas in a tiny volume with a technology at high temperatures perfected at ISOLDE.

40|$|The {{development}} of a paraxial extrapolation system to simulate seismic wave field propagation in complex three-dimensional (3 -D) media results in a practical approach to address modeling problems that require large computer memory. The paraxial approach applies to wave propagation problems in {{which most of the}} energy is traveling within a restricted <b>angular</b> <b>cone</b> about a principle axis of the problem. To set up the paraxial system, the equations of motion are initially cast as a first-order extrapolation system. Approximating the exact one-way extrapolation operator for this system with a truncated series expansion yields a sequence of paraxial extrapolation operators. Using the second-order operator results in a paraxial system which is accurate for propagation angles out to 60 ° with respect to the extrapolation axis. The acoustic formulation of this system produces excellent results as compared to a full wave field calculation. Formulating an appropriate system for the elastic case is more difficult due to the coupling between P and S energy. Specifying media variations as small perturbations to a homogeneous reference medium leads to a useful formulation of the paraxial system for the 2 -D elastic case. Using the acoustic system to model path effects for local earthquakes recorded at two southern California stations indicates the strong influence that the 3 -D crustal basins of this region have on the propagation of seismic energy. Although the simulation tracks only acoustic waves, the method is capable of modeling effects due to focusing, diffraction and the generation of multiple reflections and refractions. The modeling results show that the 3 -D structure of the Los Angeles, San Fernando and San Gabriel basins create strong patterns of focusing and defocusing for propagation paths coming into the stations located at Pasadena (PAS) and the University of Southern California (USC). These simulations compare well with earthquake data recorded at both stations. ...|$|E
40|$|Gas masses tightly {{correlate}} with the virial masses of galaxy clusters, {{allowing for a}} precise determination of cosmological parameters by means of large-scale X-ray surveys. However, according to recent Suzaku X-ray measurements, gas mass fractions, f_gas, appear to be considerably larger than the cosmic mean at the virial radius, R_ 200, questioning {{the accuracy of the}} cosmological parameter estimations. Here, we use a large suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study measurement biases of f_gas. We employ different variants of simulated physics, including radiative gas physics, star formation, and thermal feedback by active galactic nuclei. Computing the mass profiles in 48 <b>angular</b> <b>cones,</b> whose footprints partition the sphere, we find anisotropic gas and total mass distributions that imply an angular variance of f_gas at the level of 30 %. This anisotropic distribution originates from the recent formation epoch of clusters and from the strong internal baryon-to-dark-matter density bias. In the most extreme cones, f_gas can be biased high by a factor of two at R_ 200 in massive clusters, thereby providing a potential explanation for high f_gas measurements by Suzaku. While projection lowers this factor, there are other measurement biases that may (partially) compensate. We find that at R_ 200, f_gas is biased high by 20 % when assuming hydrostatic equilibrium masses, i. e., neglecting the kinetic pressure, and by another ~ 10 - 20 % due to the presence of density clumping. At larger radii, both measurement biases increase dramatically. While the cluster sample variance of the true f_gas decreases to a level of 5 % at R_ 200, the sample variance that includes both measurement biases remains fairly constant at the level of 10 - 20 %. The constant redshift evolution of f_gas within R_ 500 for massive clusters is encouraging for using gas masses to derive cosmological parameters.

The distribution of transverse momentum (pT) surrounding dijet systems is measured by selecting charged particles in different ranges of pT and at different <b>angular</b> <b>cones</b> of pseudorapidity and azimuth. The measurement is performed {{as a function of}} centrality of the PbPb collisions, the pT asymmetry of the jets in the dijet pair, and the distance parameter R used in the anti-kT jet clustering algorithm. In events with unbalanced dijets, PbPb collisions show an enhanced multiplicity in the hemisphere of the subleading jet, with the pT imbalance compensated by an excess of low-pT particles at large angles from the jet axesIndividuals have received support from the Marie-Curie programme and the European Research Council and EPLANET (European Union); the Leventis Foundation; the A.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} of coherent backscattering of light that is multiple scattered by a photonic crystal by using a broadband technique. The results significantly extend on previous backscattering measurements on photonic crystals by simultaneously accessing a large frequency and <b>angular</b> range. Backscatter <b>cones</b> around the stop gap are successfully modeled with diffusion theory for a random medium. Strong variations of the apparent mean free path and the cone enhancement are observed around the stop band. The variations of the mean free path are described by a semiempirical three-gap model including band structure effects on the internal reflection and penetration depth. A good match between theory and experiment is obtained without the need of additional contributions of group velocity or density of states. It is found that the internal reflection contribution does not improve the semiempirical fits. We argue that the cone enhancement reveals additional information on directional transport properties that are otherwise averaged out in diffuse multiple scatterin...|$|R
40|$|The cone-algorithm {{approach}} to jet finding is widely employed at hadron colliders and in two-photon physics. Such an algorithm {{has been developed}} for use on ALEPH data, primarily for two-photon analysis. This report gives an overview of how to implement the jet-finding package {{as well as some}} performance indicators. 1 Why use cone algorithms? An intuitive picture of a jet is of a large amount of hadronic energy in a small <b>angular</b> region. A <b>cone</b> algorithm for jet-finding has been developed to exploit this. Such programs are widely used at hadron colliders and in two-photon physics as they are more suited to interactions with underlying events (e. g. proton remnants). This algorithm follows standardized ideas thus facilitating the comparison of LEP data with that from different collision environments. Clustering algorithms allow particles to lie far away from their own jet axis, sometimes closer to the axis of a separate jet. Cone algorithms allow cones to overlap but this implies jets [...] ...|$|R
