40|$|The {{transformation}} of xenobiotics {{in the soil}} was studied in a model experimental system using pentachlorophenol (PCP), an enzyme, and a potential humic precursor.

Eect of humic substances on the enzymatic formation of OCDD from PCP. Chemosphere 34, 1277 – 1283). About 90 % of the PCP reacted but almost no transformation products were detected by GC/MS analysis. Most of the transformed PCP was detected in the polymeric products by the determination of the <b>adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halide</b> (AOX) in gel permeation chromatography (GPC) fractions. Pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) of the polymers showed that tetrachlorophenol (TeCP) was the major pyrolysis product. This accords with the ion chromatography observation that about 20 % of the PCP chlorine was released as chloride ion. However, nitrobenzene oxidation produced only a small amount of PCP and no TeCP. Based on the selectivity of the two degradation methods, it is concluded that TeCP is bound to the polymer by a diphenylether linkage, and PCP by an ether linkage to the aliphatic side chain. Thus, it was concluded that the major part of the PCP was incorporated into the polymer from p-coumaric acid by the release of a chlorine atom from the PCP molecule to form a diphenylether linkage with the p-hydroxyl group of the p-coumaric acid polymer. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Chlorinated organic {{molecules}} may {{be removed from}} wastewaters by adsorption onto the biomass present in biological treatment systems. This study assessed the adsorption onto biological solids of <b>Adsorbable</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Halide</b> (AOX) from two New Zealand kraft pulp and paper mill bleach plant wastewaters. Batch adsorption {{studies were carried out}} to determine the characteristics of this adsorption process, with activated sludge as an adsorbent. Different molecular weight AOX fractions from two bleach plants' wastewaters were studied. The first wastewater was a combined C and E stage effluent from the CEH bleach sequence previously used at the Tasman Pulp and Paper Co. Ltd, Kawerau. The second was a combined D and E o stage effluent from the OODEoD bleach sequence used at New Zealand Forest Products Kinleith Mill, Tokoroa. For each mill's wastewater, the adsorption isotherms were characterised for four different molecular weight fractions, and the unfractionated wastewater. Adsorption isotherm models used to fit the data for each of the fractions were the Freundlich, Langmuir and Irreversible isotherms. No single model was able to successfully describe the adsorption characteristics for all of the fractions analysed, indicating significant differences in the adsorption processes occurring in the various fractions. Analysis of the adsorption of the different molecular weight fractions demonstrated that the adsorption affinity of the AOX increased with increasing molecular weight. It appeared that molecules with higher chlorination levels were more effectively adsorbed onto the biomass. Competition for adsorption sites on the biomass by the different molecular weight fractions was a significant factor in the adsorption of the unfractionated wastewater. Analysis of the adsorption of AOX from the wastewaters at concentrations typical of those expected in different biological treatment systems showed that: • treatment systems with low biomass concentrations, such as aerated lagoons, would not be expected to remove significant amounts of AOX by adsorption. • treatment systems utilising higher biomass levels have the potential to remove significant amounts of AOX by adsorption. Conventional activated sludge systems could remove 15 - 20 %, and oxygen activated sludge systems 25 - 50 % of the AOX entering these systems. The impact of the modernisation of bleach sequences on the adsorption of AOX, by the introduction of oxygen delignification and chlorine dioxide substitution, was assessed. This was carried out by comparison of the adsorption characteristics of the two mills' wastewaters. The Tasman mill's bleach sequence was used as an example of older, conventional bleaching, and the Kinleith mill's sequence an example of modernised bleaching. Significant differences were found in the adsorptive behaviour of the molecular weight fractions, and that of the unfractionated wastewaters, between the two. From the analysis, adsorption onto biomass in a biological treatment system is predicted to alter the molecular weight distribution of the AOX in wastewaters. The conventional sequence's wastewater should show a decrease in the proportion of high molecular weight AOX due to this adsorptive removal, an effect not as significant in the adsorption of AOX from a modern bleach plant wastewater. Modern bleach sequence wastewaters are expected to reveal a decrease in the proportion of the low molecular weight material, an effect not as notable for the conventional sequence's AOX. Modernisation was found to decrease the adsorptive affinity of the wastewater, suggested to be due to the lower chlorination levels and average molecular weights of the molecules in the wastewater. It was concluded that the modernisation of bleach sequences has reduced the significance of adsorption onto biological solids as an AOX removal mechanis...|$|R

In 1832, scientist named Justus von Liebig synthesized the first <b>organic</b> <b>halide</b> (charcoal) via chlorination of ethanol. Since then, organohalides have gained a lot of attention. Organohalides are commonly used as pesticides, biodegradables, soil fumigants, refrigerants, chemical reagents - solvents, and polymers. It has been classified as pollutant despite of their wide use in various applications. Due to which, dehalogenation is a key reaction to convert toxic organohalides to less hazardous products.|$|R

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{degradation of}} different glyphosate herbicide formulations on RuO(2) and IrO(2) DSA(A (R)) electrodes is investigated. Parameters that could influence {{the formation of}} organochloride compounds during electrolysis are studied. The effects of chloride concentration, electrodic composition, current density, and electrolysis time are reported. The influence of the oxide composition on herbicide degradation seems to be almost insignificant; however, there is a straight relationship between anode composition and <b>organic</b> <b>halides</b> formation. Commercial herbicide formulations have lower degradation rates and lead {{to the formation of}} a larger quantities of organochloride compounds. In high chloride concentrations, there is a significant increase in organic mineralization, and the relationship between chloride concentration and <b>organic</b> <b>halides</b> formation is direct. Only in low chloride medium investigated the organochloride concentration obtained was below the limit values allowed in Brazil. The determination of <b>organic</b> <b>halides</b> absorbable (AOX) during electrolysis increases significantly with the applied current. Even during long-term electrolysis, a large amount of organochloride compounds is formed. FAPESPCNPqMS-CAPES fellowshi...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{reactive}} copper {{was prepared}} by the lithium naphthalide reductions of various copper(I) salt/ligand complexes. In particular, the reductions of copper(I) halide/phosphine complexes resulted {{in the production of}} active copper which reacted with a variety of <b>organic</b> <b>halides</b> to form highly functionalized, stable organocopper species. The nature and reactivity of the active copper was found to be highly dependent upon the choice of copper(I) salt and particularly upon the choice of ligand (phosphine). Organocopper species containing ester, nitrile, chloride, and even remote ketone and epoxide groups were prepared directly from the corresponding organic iodides or bromides. These highly functionalized copper reagents were utilized in a variety of reactions including conjugate additions to unsaturated carbonyl systems, epoxide-opening reactions, reactions with acid chlorides to form ketones, and cross-coupling reactions with other <b>organic</b> <b>halides.</b> Additionally, the copper was used to effect homocoupling of various <b>organic</b> <b>halides</b> under very mild conditions. ^ Active nickel was used effectively for the room temperature generation of o-xylylene intermediates from the corresponding α,α'-dihalo-o-xylene species. These highly reactive intermediates were efficiently trapped in situ with electron-deficient olefins, yielding substituted 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene cycloadducts in moderate to good yields. Isoindene and 2, 3 -dihydronaphthalene intermediates were generated and trapped in an analogous fashion to give the one- or two-carbon bridged cycloadducts, respectively. ^ Active zinc was used for preparing organozinc halide species directly from <b>organic</b> <b>halides.</b> The <b>organic</b> <b>halides</b> could contain considerable functionality such as ester, nitrile, and chloride groups. The organozinc halides were prepared readily from organic iodides and even bromides at room temperature. Significantly, functionalized arylzinc halides were prepared directly from the corresponding aryl halides. The organozinc halides underwent facile transmetallation with copper(I) cyanide complexes, generating highly functionalized cuprate species. These cuprates were found to be effective for conjugate additions to unsaturated carbonyl compounds, and for the formation of ketones from the coupling reaction with acid chlorides. ...|$|R
