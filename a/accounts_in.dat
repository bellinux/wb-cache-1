5|$|Chrysostom and Leontius both {{lived in}} Antioch, {{the site of}} Philip's alleged humiliation and repentance, and wrote in the mid-4th century, one hundred years after the event took place.

This tradition would have been perhaps partially oral in nature, and far removed from the written <b>accounts</b> <b>in</b> Eusebius' library at Caesarea. Many other historians trace Chrysostom and Leontius' accounts back to Eusebius: Hans Pohlsander counts Chrysostom and Leontius' accounts as later accretions to Eusebius original account, dependent on his Historia for their legendary core; John Gregg holds that this dependent relationship is most probable; and Stein claims all three Greeks as contributors to the same gerüchte.|$|E

Further, the 2 ̆ 7 sphere of influence 2 ̆ 7 methodology used by Enthoven (1977) for classifying <b>accounting</b> systems <b>in</b> the Third World is not applicable to HIOECs because, unlike in other TWCs, the development of accounting and <b>accounting</b> education <b>in</b> this particular group of countries is not an outcome of such historical factors as colonial experience and/or colonial affinity...|$|R
