5|$|After seeing minor {{action in}} the Battle of Hanover Court House on May 27, the 22nd {{remained}} in camp at Gaines' Mill for nearly a month as McClellan positioned his army for <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> Richmond. The men of the 22nd could see the steeples of Richmond from their camp. By this time, the regiment {{had been reduced to}} roughly 750 men due to sickness {{over the course of the}} campaign and minor casualties in action.|$|E

5|$|Bond infiltrates the circus, {{and finds}} that Orlov {{replaced}} the Soviet treasures {{with a nuclear}} warhead, primed to explode at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament, {{in the belief that}} the bomb was an American one that was detonated by accident, leaving the West's borders open to Soviet invasion. Bond deactivates the warhead and then he returns to India, joining <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> Khan's palace.|$|E
5|$|In 1801 while {{aboard the}} 74-gun HMS Ganges (commanded by Captain Thomas Fremantle, a {{personal}} friend), Brock {{was present at}} the Battle of Copenhagen. His troops were supposed to lead <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> the forts at Copenhagen. The outcome of the sea battle made such an assault unnecessary, and Brock was able to observe first-hand the tactical brilliance of Lord Nelson. After the battle, Fremantle and Brock celebrated the victory with Nelson. In 1802 Brock and the 49th Foot were ordered to Canada.|$|E
5|$|In early November, Vandegrift, {{fearing that}} the Japanese were {{planning}} <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> the Lunga perimeter {{from the east}} using Shōji's forces plus additional reinforcements, launched an operation against the Japanese units at Koli Point. Beginning on 4 November, two battalions of U.S. Marines and two battalions of U.S. Army troops attacked and attempted to encircle Shōji's men at Gavaga Creek {{near the village of}} Tetere in the Koli Point area.|$|E

5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The similarity was apparent in the climax; both films involved <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel shutters.|$|E
5|$|Initially, de Peyster {{had been}} {{selected}} to lead <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> the breastworks outside the city, however {{the night before the}} assault he noticed the city aflame from a signal tower and informed General Weitzel. The men of the corps then entered the city unmolested. Admiral David Farragut later claimed that de Peyster was due as much credit as he would have received had he actually taken the city by storming it, because doing it without bloodshed still carried the same intent.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August the Imperial Japanese Army, {{which had}} been slowly pushing south to Port Arthur, began <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> the city's outer defenses.

Over the course of November, Burnside moved the army south to Falmouth, Virginia, opposite the Rappahannock River from Fredericksburg. The 21st arrived in Falmouth on November 19. Nearly a month passed before Burnside could organize a crossing {{of the river and}} <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> the city and the heights beyond. The Battle of Fredericksburg took place on December 13, 1862.|$|E

Anezka rejects Christof and prepares to revive Vukodlak, but the outside assault collapses the castle upon them.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{response of the}} British was a two-hour cannon barrage at the heights, which had no effect because the British guns could not reach the American guns at such height. After {{the failure of the}} barrage, Howe and his officers agreed that the colonists must be removed from the heights if they were to hold Boston. They planned <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> the heights; however, due to a storm the attack never took place, and the British elected instead to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|The siege {{was broken}} in March 1776 when Continental Army Colonel Henry Knox brought heavy {{artillery}} from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston during the winter, and General Washington {{used them to}} fortify Dorchester Heights, overlooking Boston and its harbour. Howe at first planned <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> this position, but a snowstorm interfered, and he eventually decided to withdraw from Boston. On 17 March, British troops and Loyalists evacuated the city, and sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia.|$|E

5|$|Bond and Octopussy return {{separately}} to India. Bond {{arrives at}} Khan's palace just as Octopussy and her troops have launched <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> the grounds.

Bond pursues {{them as they}} attempt to escape in their plane, clinging to the fuselage and disabling the tailplanes. In a struggle with Bond, Gobinda takes a deadly plummet off the roof of the plane and Bond rescues Octopussy from Khan, the pair jumping onto a nearby cliff only seconds before the plane crashes into a mountain, killing Khan. While M and General Gogol discuss the transport of the jewelery, Bond recuperates with Octopussy aboard her private boat in India.|$|E

Grant also wanted Sheridan to push the Fifth Corps and his cavalry north of the Appomattox as quickly as possible on April 3.|$|R
5|$|British {{military}} forces in Kenya were {{made aware of the}} revolution at 4:45am on 12 January, and following a request from the Sultan were put on 15 minutes' standby to conduct <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> Zanzibar's airfield. However, the British High Commissioner in Zanzibar, Timothy Crosthwait, reported no instances of British nationals being attacked and advised against intervention. As a result, the British troops in Kenya were reduced to four hours' standby later that evening. Crosthwait decided not to approve an immediate evacuation of British citizens, as many held key government positions and their sudden removal would further disrupt the country's economy and government. To avoid possible bloodshed, the British agreed a timetable with Karume for an organised evacuation.|$|E
5|$|By mid-November, the Germans {{had nearly}} taken Stalingrad in bitter street {{fighting}} when the Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad and <b>an</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously. By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad {{had been forced}} to surrender, and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Russian city of Kursk.|$|E
