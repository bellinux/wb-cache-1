In Xenopus egg cell-free extracts, Xkid and Xklp 1 {{are essential for}} bipolar spindle formation but {{the functions of the}} human homologues, hKID (KIF 22) and KIF 4 A, are poorly understood. By using RNAi-mediated protein knockdown in human cells, we find that only co-depletion delayed progression through mitosis in a Mad 2 -dependent manner. Depletion of hKID caused abnormal chromosome arm orientation, delayed chromosome congression, and sensitized cells to nocodazole. Knockdown of KIF 4 A increased the number and length of microtubules, altered kinetochore oscillations, and decreased kinetochore microtubule flux. These changes were associated with failures in establishing a tight metaphase plate and an increase in <b>anaphase</b> <b>lagging</b> chromosomes. Co-depletion of both chromokinesins aggravated chromosome attachment failures, which led to mitotic arrest. Thus, hKID and KIF 4 A contribute independently to the rapid and correct attachment of chromosomes by controlling the positioning of chromosome arms and the dynamics of microtubules, respectively...|$|E
40|$|SummaryChromosomal {{instability}} (CIN) is {{a common}} feature of most human neoplasms and was defined, in a seminal study by Vogelstein and colleagues [1], as persistently elevated rates of whole chromosome mis-segregation. Since then, it was shown that certain errors in mitosis, including defects in the spindle assembly checkpoint [2], sister chromatid cohesion [3], kinetochore-microtubule (kMT) attachments [4, 5], and centrosome number [6] can cause chromosome mis-segregation {{in the form of}} merotelically attached <b>anaphase</b> <b>lagging</b> chromosomes — chromosomes that lag behind at the spindle equator while all the other chromosomes move toward the spindle poles [7] (Figure 1 A). A recent study has suggested that pre-mitotic replication stress generates partially replicated chromosomes during mitosis, and that this results in both numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities through the formation of chromosome bridges and acentric chromosome fragments during anaphase [8]. To determine whether whole chromosome instability in cancer cells is caused by defects originating in mitosis (lagging chromosomes) or from ones originating pre-mitotically (chromatin bridges and acentric fragments), we compared a variety of CIN+ to CIN- cells to determine the types of segregation defects that phenotypically distinguish CIN+ from CIN- cells and whose abrogation can rescue whole chromosomal instability...|$|E

Cytoskeleton-associated protein 2, CKAP 2, is a microtubule-associated protein that localizes to spindle poles and aids in microtubule stabilization, but the exact function and mechanism of action are poorly understood. In the present study, we utilized RNA interference {{to determine the extent}} to which the expression of CKAP 2 plays a role in chromosome segregation. CKAP 2 -depleted cells showed a significant increase of multipolar mitoses and other spindle pole defects. Notably, when interrogated for microtubule nucleation capacity, CKAP 2 -depleted cells showed a very unusual phenotype as early as two minutes after release from mitotic block, consisting of dispersal of newly polymerized microtubule filaments through the entire chromatin region, creating a cage-like structure. Nevertheless, spindle poles were formed after one hour of mitotic release suggesting that centrosome-mediated nucleation remained dominant. Finally, we showed that suppression of CKAP 2 resulted in a higher incidence of merotelic attachments, <b>anaphase</b> <b>lagging,</b> and polyploidy. Based on these results, we conclude that CKAP 2 is involved in the maintenance of microtubule nucleation sites, focusing microtubule minus ends to the spindle poles in early mitosis, and is implicated in maintaining genome stability...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMerotelic {{kinetochore}} {{orientation is}} a misattachment {{in which a}} single kinetochore binds microtubules from both spindle poles rather than just one and can produce <b>anaphase</b> <b>lagging</b> chromosomes, {{a major source of}} aneuploidy [1]. Merotelic kinetochore orientation occurs frequently in early mitosis, does not block chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate, and is not detected by the spindle checkpoint [2 – 5]. However, microtubules to the incorrect pole are usually significantly reduced or eliminated before anaphase [3, 6]. We discovered that the frequency of lagging chromosomes in anaphase is very sensitive to partial inhibition of Aurora kinase activity by ZM 447439 at a dose, 3 μM, that has little effect on histone phosphorylation, metaphase chromosome alignment, and cytokinesis in PtK 1 cells. Partial Aurora kinase inhibition increased the frequency of merotelic kinetochores in late metaphase, and the fraction of microtubules to the incorrect pole. Measurements of fluorescence dissipation after photoactivation showed that kinetochore-microtubule turnover in prometaphase is substantially suppressed by partial Aurora kinase inhibition. Our results support a preanaphase correction mechanism for merotelic attachments in which correct plus-end attachments are pulled away from high concentrations of Aurora B at the inner centromere, and incorrect merotelic attachments are destabilized by being pulled toward the inner centromere...|$|E
40|$|In a 24 -year-old {{man with}} mild {{intellectual}} disability, congenital heart defects and obesity, we identified up to 4 small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs) in blood metaphases. The ring-shaped sSMCs {{were derived from}} chromosomes 11, 12 and X {{as well as a}} fourth, unidentified chromosome. In interphase nuclei of epithelial cells from the urinary tract and buccal mucosa, the presence of the r(11), r(12) and r(X) was confirmed by FISH. Using Illumina Infinium 317 K SNP-arrays, we detected 3 copies of the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes 11, 12 and X. The r(X) was present in 84 - 89 % of cells in the various tissues examined, lacks the XIST gene, but contains FAM 123 B, a potential dosage-sensitive candidate gene for congenital cardiac abnormalities, and ARHGEF 9, a candidate gene for intellectual disability. ARHGEF 9 encodes collybistin (CB), which is required for localization of the inhibitory receptor-anchoring protein gephyrin and for formation and maintenance of postsynaptic GABAA and glycine receptors. We propose that the 2 -fold increase in dosage of ARHGEF 9 disturbs the stoichiometry of CB with its interacting proteins at inhibitory postsynapses. SNP alleles and short tandem repeat markers on the r(11) and r(X) were compatible with a maternal origin of both sSMCs through a meiosis II error. The sSMCs may have resulted from predivision chromatid nondisjunction, leading to <b>anaphase</b> <b>lagging,</b> followed by incomplete degradation of the supernumerary chromosomes...|$|E

5000|$|Fourteen {{years after}} the {{original}} description of the syndrome, 2 groups independently discovered that the buccal mucosal cells of these patients contained an extra chromatin mass, or were chromatin positive. A few years later, Jacobs and Strong found that these chromatin-positive patients had 47 chromosomes, with an extra X chromosome, and were XXY. The extra X chromosome results from either meiotic nondisjunction, in which a chromosome pair fails to separate during meiosis, or from <b>anaphase</b> <b>lag.</b> <b>Anaphase</b> <b>lag</b> might result in a gamete losing a sex chromosome; a chromosome lags and is not incorporated in the new cell in {{the next stage of}} mitosis (<b>anaphase).</b> Such <b>anaphase</b> <b>lag</b> could account for the largest minority of karyotypes, the mosaics XY/XXY and XX/XXY. Eighty percent of these patients have positive sex chromatin, and their karyotypes may vary widely, and with many mosaics.The syndrome in patients with positive chromatin in the buccal mucosa should probably be called Klinefelter's disease. Although these patients have positive female sex chromatin, they are phenotypic males and should never be considered otherwise. The other 20%, whose testes are not small, have XY chromosomes and should be studied further to determine etiology. These patients often have no complaints, and the condition is discovered {{in the course of a}} general physical examination. Sterility and gynecomastia are the most common complaints. It is thought that 5% to 10% of sterile males have this condition. When this disorder is suspected, a buccal smear is the first test to request. If the cells are chromatin positive, the diagnosis is made; testicular biopsy and karyotyping are not necessary. If the buccal mucosa is chromatin negative, further studies are indicated.The extra X chromosome in these men has stimulated much interest, but its function, if any, has not been determined. Systemic lupus erythematosus, a disorder more common in female patients, has been frequently reported in this syndrome, but the association is not statistically significant. The association with leukemia may also be coincidental. Leg ulcers, osteoporosis, and taurodontism occur with greater frequency in these patients than in control subjects, and dermatoglyphic studies have shown characteristic abnormalities.|$|R
40|$|Many {{cancer cells}} display a CIN (Chromosome Instability) phenotype, {{by which they}} exhibit high rates of {{chromosome}} loss or gain at each cell cycle. Over the years, {{a number of different}} mechanisms, including mitotic spindle multipolarity, cytokinesis failure, and merotelic kinetochore orientation, have been proposed as causes of CIN. However, a comprehensive theory of how CIN is perpetuated is still lacking. We used CIN colorectal cancer cells as a model system to investigate the possible cellular mechanism(s) underlying CIN. We found that CIN cells frequently assembled multipolar spindles in early mitosis. However, multipolar anaphase cells were very rare, and live-cell experiments showed that almost all CIN cells divided in a bipolar fashion. Moreover, fixed-cell analysis showed high frequencies of merotelically attached lagging chromosomes in bipolar anaphase CIN cells, and higher frequencies of merotelic attachments in multipolar vs. bipolar prometaphases. Finally, we found that multipolar CIN prometaphases typically possessed c-tubulin at all spindle poles, and that a significant fraction of bipolar metaphase/early anaphase CIN cells possessed more than one centrosome at a single spindle pole. Taken together, our data suggest a model by which merotelic kinetochore attachments can easily be established in multipolar prometaphases. Most of these multipolar prometaphase cells would then bi-polarize before anaphase onset, and the residual merotelic attachments would produce chromosome mis-segregation due to <b>anaphase</b> <b>lagging</b> chromosomes. We propose this spindle pole coalescence mechanism as a major contributor to chromosom...|$|E

40|$|Chromosomal {{instability}} (CIN) comprises {{an elevated}} rate of chromosome missegregation and correlates {{with the presence}} of extra centrosomes. Bipolar anaphases with clustered supernumerary centrosomes have been identified as a mechanism contributing to CIN via the formation of transient multipolar spindle intermediates, which promote merotelic kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors. However, the contribution of this model and that of potential additional mechanisms in human malignancies has not been addressed. Here we show that centriole rosettes, defined as multiple procentrioles engaged to a single parent, generate spindle asymmetry that favors kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors without centrosome clustering and ultimately results in CIN. Furthermore, we demonstrate that centriole rosettes, but not the progeny of clustered mitoses, are a common finding in primary human malignancies. Centriole rosettes are capable of arranging bipolar mitotic spindles but cause an increased frequency of <b>anaphase</b> <b>lagging</b> chromosomes and chromosome missegregation. The CIN phenotype is aggravated when spindle pole have asymmetric centriole numbers and it is not rescued by enhancement of kinetochore-microtubule attachment correction. Furthermore, by immunostaining for an array of centrosomal proteins, we find that, in primary human malignancies, centrosome amplification is characterized by supernumerary procentrioles forming rosettes around a single pair of parental centrioles, strongly arguing for a major contribution of this mechanism in the generation of CIN in vivo. Our results indicate that asymmetric centriole rosettes produce unbalanced microtubule numbers on mitotic half-spindles, thereby skewing the chance of binding microtubules from the more prominent spindle pole, resulting in impaired correction of merotelic kinetochore attachments and subsequent chromosome missegregation. We propose that centriole numbers at spindle poles must be carefully controlled to ensure chromosome segregation fidelity and disruption of this mechanism is an important source of CIN in human cancer. ...|$|E

Live-cell liquid crystal polarized light microscope imaging showed nondisjunction was caused by chromosome malorientation. Whereas amphitely (sister kinetochore fibers to opposite poles) is normal, cold recovery induced anaphase syntely (sister fibers to the same pole) and merotely (fibers to both poles from 1 kinetochore). Maloriented chromosomes had stable metaphase positions near the equator or between the equator and a pole. Syntelics were at the spindle periphery at metaphase; their sisters disconnected at anaphase and moved {{all the way to}} a centrosome, as their strongly birefringent kinetochore fibers shortened.

The last type is a heterogeneous group with various different asymmetrical patterns. We have studied 6 cases of Xqi with C, G, and Q banding: 3 showed one C-band and symmetrical arms and all these were without 45,X mosaicism; the other 3 cases showed two C-bands, 2 of the cases having symmetrical arms and being mosaic for 45 X/ 46,XXqi/ 47,XXqiXqi (those 2 were a pair of identical twins).

40|$|Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a DNA {{herpes virus}} {{and a common}} human {{pathogen}} of considerable clinical interest. To image the IE 1 - 72 kDa HCMV protein a recombinant virus encoding IE 1 fused to EGFP was constructed (CR 401). Using this construct, the IE 1 -EGFP fusion was detected at ND 10 within 2 h. p. i. and the complete disruption of ND 10 imaged through to 6 h p. i. HCMV genomes and IE 2 - 86 K protein could be detected adjacent to the IE 1 - 72 K/ND 10 foci. IE 1 - 72 K associates with metaphase chromatin, recruiting PML, Sp 100 and STAT 2. hDaxx, STAT 1 and IE 2 - 86 K did not re-locate to metaphase chromatin; the fate of hDaxx is particularly important as this protein contributes to an intrinsic barrier to HCMV infection. Since the progress of mitosis in infected cells has not thoroughly studied, we used the recombinant CR 401 to visualize this dynamic phenomenon in living fibroblasts. Time-lapse microscopy in transiently expressing EGFP-IE 1 and HcRed 1 -H 2 A HeLa cells revealed that IE 1 was clearly associated with condensed chromatin at various stages of mitosis and eventually the IE 1 -expressing cells successfully completed cell division. Monitoring of individually infected fibroblasts by live cell imaging showed that {{a small proportion of}} cells initiated mitosis, progressing to prometaphase and metaphase quite readily. However, in the very few cells continuing to <b>anaphase,</b> <b>lagging</b> chromosomes were evident. A destruction of the mitotic spindle because of a HCMV expressed protein results in severe chromosome segregation defects. We demonstrate here that the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immediate early (IE) proteins IE 1 and IE 2 differentially upregulate expression of ULBP 2 and MICA/B, respectively. Expression of either HCMV IE protein in target cells was sufficient by itself to promote NK cell activation. A panel of replication-deficient adenovirus recombinants encoding defined HCMV IE 1 mutants has been generated, and is being used to characterize the mechanism responsible for promoting the ULBP 2 response. Furthermore, the EBV IE proteins Zta and Rta were also found to provide a dramatic upregulation of MICA, MICB and ULBP 2 surface expression. The NKG 2 D receptor thus, appears to be exquisitely sensitive to herpesvirus IE gene expression. ...|$|E
40|$|Telomeres are {{nucleoprotein}} complexes {{that protect}} {{the ends of}} linear chromosomes and are required {{for a wide range}} of cellular processes, as apoptosis, aging, cancer and chromosome stability. Telomere shortens every time a somatic human cell divides. Furthermore human cancers, avoid the progressive loss of telomeric DNA by the telomerase or the telomerase-independent mechanism, termed ALT (Alternative Telomere Lengthening), result into indefinite cell proliferation. However, it has been demonstrated, that several physical or chemical agents are able to modulate telomere length; in particular oxidative stress accelerates telomere shortening. Literature data showed that telomeres are the preferential target for oxidative damage because of ROS able to induce 8 -oxodG from triplet GGG present in human telomeric sequence TTAGGG. Nevertheless, the effects of prolonged oxidative stress on telomere metabolism are still poorly investigated. With the aim to investigate the effects of oxidative stress on telomere length and chromosome segregation and to test mitotic defects, human primary lung fibroblasts (MRC- 5) were daily treated with 10 μM H 2 O 2 and analysed at regular intervals over period of 94 days. The telomere length analysed by Q-FISH (Quantitative-FISH), showed a telomere shortening at 9 - 21 days, and a telomere elongation between 21 - 48 days. Moreover we observed that this trend of “shortening-lengthening” was repeated on time up to 94 days. Based on this repeated trend, we focused our attention to the first 45 days, because at longer time several mechanisms, as senescence, not straight related to oxidative stress effects, could interfere with the results. At this interval of time, we saw a significant telomere shortening after 5 days and a telomere elongation at 15 days of treatment. Based on these results, we confirm that prolonged oxidative stress is responsible of telomere shortening even at low daily doses. Considering that telomere shortening could have an effect on cell viability, first of all, we analysed other endpoints: a) Possible cell cycle perturbation by Cytofluorimetric analysis. We noticed any differences between treated and own control samples. b) The entity of DNA damage induced by prolonged treatment with H 2 O 2 by “Alkaline Comet Assay”. Moreover we used Trypan Blue Assay to evaluate cell viability and this analysis has relieved in all cases that cell death was less than 30 %, value above which the mortality is considered significant. c) To understand if the DNA damage and telomere shortening observed could induce premature senescence, we assessed the number of β- galattosidase positive cells, typically expresses in senescence cells. As expected, we observed a light trend of senescence on time in treated and control samples, with a difference between the two only at 10 - 15 and 20 - 27 days. This led us to conclude that oxidative stress did not induce significant premature senescence in treated cells. Considering that telomere shortening did not alter cell viability, we studied the mechanism responsible of telomere elongation observed at 15 days. To evaluate this mechanism the analysis of telomerase activity was performed by RTQ-TRAP assay that showed no telomerase activation for all fixation times. On the other hand, to verify ALT activation, we assessed two ALT markers: telomeric-sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCE) by CO-FISH analysis and colocalization of telomeres-PML proteins by FISH and immunostainig. We showed a higher frequency of both these ALT markers at 15 days of treatment, corresponding to the time of telomere elongation observed. This led us to hypothesize Human Primary Fibroblast could activate ALT mechanism, known in literature be present in a little percentage of tumor cells. However we cannot exclude the presence of a cellular selection system that promotes cells with longer telomeres due their major viability. In literature is known that telomere shortening could alter chromosomes segregation by inducing chromosome bridges (end-to-end fusion). To analyse the relation between telomere length and chromosome segregation defects, like chromosome bridges, during my period at the Virginia Tech University we performed Time lapse on live cells and immunostainig (that detect Kinetochore and mitotic spindle) in mitotic cells in the range of 1 - 48 days. Data obtained were pulled and showed an increase of chromosome bridges in treated cells at 5, 27, 41 and 48 days of treatment. The induction of chromosome bridges at 5 days indicated a relation between telomere shortening and chromosome segregation defects. Moreover the reduction of chromosome bridges, observed at 15 days, was related to telomere lengthening saw at the same day. Based on these results, we could observe that telomere shortening induced by oxidative stress at 5 days of treatment could triggers the increase of chromosome bridges induction. Subsequently, we observed a chromosome bridges decrease corresponding to the time of telomere elongation and based on previous results obtained, we hypothesized that ALT mechanism restores telomere length inducing a reduction of chromosome segregation defects related to telomere shortening. In fact, according to literature data, the loss of chromosome ends could result in “sticky” chromosomes that will give rise to dicentric/ring chromosomes: when these dicentric/ring chromosomes will try to separate in anaphase, they will create a chromosome bridge that breaks before or in transition to telophase. Then, the breakage of bridge will create new sticky chromosome ends that could fuse with other sticky ends or that could determine the sister chromatid fusion at the following cell cycle, creating the so called “breakage/fusion/bridge cycle” (BFB). This BFB cycle will continue until the affected chromosome will acquire a new telomere, as in our case when ALT mechanism restores the telomere length. To further assess the effects of telomere length changes on chromosome instability, we evaluated abnormal nuclear structures at 1 - 20 days. We estimated the quantity of NBPs (nucleoplasmic bridge) and NBuds (nuclear Buds), markers of chromosome segregation defects, measuring a significant increase of these biomarkers at 5 days of treatment and confirming previous result obtained for chromosome bridges. These data have been supported by anaphase-lagging chromosomes, marker of chromosome loss. In both fixed- and live-cells. We observed an increase in <b>anaphase</b> <b>lagging</b> chromosomes frequencies over the control at 5, 20, 27 and 41 days of treatment. Additionally, kinetochore positive micronuclei (MN) were analysed by immunostainig. Kinetochore positive MN represents a marker of chromosome loss and aneuploidy (Fenech, M. and Morley, A. A. 1985). Our analysis resulted in a significant increase of kinetochore positive MN in almost all-fixing time. With the aim to evaluate if also other mitotic defects, in addition to chromosome segregation defects, were induced by prolonged oxidative stress, cells with tilted mitotic spindles, defined as the positioning of the spindle long axis at an angle instead of parallel to the substrate, were observed. We observed frequencies of tilted spindles above the control frequencies during the first 10 days, at 27, and 48 days of treatment. These results indicated that prolonged oxidative stress affected spindle structure and/or function. Thus, in addition to the telomeric damage, which causes chromosome rearrangements and can result in chromosome bridges in mitosis, prolonged oxidative stress could also induce telomere-independent mitotic defects, such as MN, lagging chromosomes, which can result in aneuploidy, and cells with tilted spindle. Taken together, these data indicated that prolonged oxidative stress could cause the two most common karyotype defects observed in cancer cells: chromosome rearrangements and aneuploidy...|$|E

Autosomal laggards in cold-recovering cells are contained in bivalents until anaphase (Janicke, M. A., and J. R. LaFountain, 1982, Chromosoma, 85 : 619 - 631). We report here documentation that lagging autosomes in cold-treated and cold- recovering cells are maloriented. During meiosis I, half-bivalents usually associate with only one pole via kinetochore fibers, with sister chromatids being oriented to the same pole. In contrast, laggards had kinetochore microtubules (kMTs) extending from them toward both poles: one sister was oriented to one pole and the other had {{some or all of}} its kMTs extending toward the opposite pole. Bipolar malorientation of autosomal laggards also was observed in one untreated cell.

The overall spindle structure in cold- recovering cells was similar to that observed in untreated anaphase cells. Giemsa-stained centromeric dots of sister chromatids were contiguous in non-laggards and separated in laggards at anaphase.

40|$|Fluorescent in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) {{studies of}} human preimplantation embryos have demonstrated {{a high proportion of}} chromosomal mosaicism. To investigate the different timings and nature of chromosomal mosaicism, we developed single cell multiplex ¯uorescent (FL) -PCR to distinguish meiotic and mitotic cell division errors. Chromosome 21 was investigated as the model chromosome as trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) represents the most common chromosomal aneuploidy that reaches live birth. Sister blastomeres from a total of 25 chromosome 21 aneuploid embryos were analysed. Of these, 13 (52 %) comprised cells with concordant DNA ®ngerprints indicative of meiotic non-disjunction errors. The remaining 12 (48 %) aneuploid embryos comprised discordant sister blastomere allelic pro®les and thus were mosaic. Errors at all stages including metaphase (MI) (12 %) and ®rst (38 %), second (31 %) and third (19 %) mitotic cleavage divisions were identi®ed from the types and propor-tion of different allelic pro®les. In addition, three embryos showed combined meiotic and mitotic cell division errors including non-disjunction and <b>anaphase</b> <b>lag,</b> suggesting that diploid cells had resulted from an aneuploid zygote. However, the majority of the mosaic aneuploid embryos showed mitotic gains and losses from a diploid zygote occurring prior to the activation of the embryonic genome. Allelic pro®ling of amniocytes from 15 prenatal diagnosis samples displayed only meiotic errors. There appears to be a large difference between the proportion of mosaic mitotic-derived trisomy 21 embryos and fetuses.

40|$|Despite the {{clinical}} importance of aneuploidy, surprisingly {{little is known}} concerning its impact during the earliest stages of human development. This study aimed {{to shed light on}} the genesis, progression, and survival of different types of chromosome anomaly from the fertilized oocyte through the final stage of preimplantation development (blastocyst). 2, 204 oocytes and embryos were examined using comprehensive cytogenetic methodology. A diverse array of chromosome abnormalities was detected, including many forms never recorded later in development. Advancing female age was associated with dramatic increase in aneuploidy rate and complex chromosomal abnormalities. <b>Anaphase</b> <b>lag</b> and congression failure were found to be important malsegregation causing mechanisms in oogenesis and during the first few mitotic divisions. All abnormalities appeared to be tolerated until activation of the embryonic genome, after which some forms started to decline in frequency. However, many aneuploidies continued to have little impact, with affected embryos successfully reaching the blastocyst stage. Results from the direct analyses of female meiotic divisions and early embryonic stages suggest that chromosome errors present during preimplantation development have origins that are more varied than those seen in later pregnancy, raising the intriguing possibility that the source of aneuploidy might modulate impact on embryo viability. The results of this study also narrow the window of time for selection against aneuploid embryos, indicating that most survive until the blastocyst stage and, since they are not detected in clinical pregnancies, must be lost around the time of implantation or shortly thereafter. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

Purpose: To quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the changes in chromosomal aberrations during early cleavage in mouse embryos derived from γ-irradiated spermatozoa. Materials and methods: Mature males were exposed to 2 [*]Gy or 4 [*]Gy of ^ Cs γ-rays, and their spermatozoa were used to produce embryos via in vitro fertilisation (IVF). The metaphase chromosomes were prepared from one-cell, two-cell, and four-cell embryos. In the chromosome preparations from two-cell and four-cell embryos, the separation of the sister blastomeres was precluded by treatment of the embryos with concanavalin A. The incidence of embryos with structural chromosomal aberrations, aneuploidy, or mosaicism was estimated. The fates of the different types of γ-ray-induced structural chromosomal aberrations were also investigated in those embryos. Results: The exposure of spermatozoa to 2 [*]Gy or 4 [*]Gy γ-rays caused structural chromosomal aberrations in 25. 9 % and 35. 7 % of the resultant one-cell embryos, respectively. At two-cell embryonic stage, the incidence of structural chromosomal aberrations was 17. 4 % in the 2 [*]Gy group and 27. 1 % in the 4 [*]Gy group. At the four-cell embryonic stage, although the incidence of control embryos with structural chromosomal aberrations was considerably high, the net incidence of embryos with radiation-induced structural chromosomal aberrations was similar to that at the one-cell stage. The incidence of aneuploidy was high in two-cell and four-cell embryos after both doses of γ-rays. The incidence of mosaicism increased significantly in dose- and embryonic-stage-dependent manners. <b>Anaphase</b> <b>lag,</b> and the degeneration and non-disjunction of the aberrant chromosomes were frequently observed in aneuploid and mosaic embryos. Conclusions: Mouse sperm DNA is highly vulnerable to γ-rays. The structural chromosomal aberrations of sperm origin are unstable in their behaviour and structure during cleavage, and therefore cause secondary aneuploidy and mosaicism in the early cleavage embryos...|$|R
50|$|Micronucleus is {{the name}} given to the small nucleus that forms {{whenever}} a chromosome or a fragment of a chromosome is not incorporated {{into one of the}} daughter nuclei during cell division. It usually is a sign of genotoxic events and chromosomal instability. Micronuclei are commonly seen in cancerous cells and may indicate genomic damage events that can increase the risk of developmental or degenerative diseases. Micronuclei form during <b>anaphase</b> from <b>lagging</b> acentric chromosome or chromatid fragments caused by incorrectly repaired or unrepaired DNA breaks or by nondisjunction of chromosomes. This incorrect segregation of chromosomes may result from hypomethylation of repeat sequences present in pericentromeric DNA, irregularities in kinetochore proteins or their assembly, dysfunctional spindle apparatus, or flawed anaphase checkpoint genes. Many micronucleus assays have been developed to test for the presence of these structures and determine their frequency in cells exposed to certain chemicals or subjected to stressful conditions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Cytological {{characters}} in meiosis of three Mahonia species-Mahonia fortunei, M. bealei and M. polydonta were investigated {{using the method}} of wall degradation and hypotonic treatment for chromosomal preparations. Chromosome numbers of the three species were all 2 n = 2 x = 28; those of M. fortunei and M. polydonta represent the first report. The three species at metaphase I possessed the same configuration of 14 II, however, the secondary asso-ciation was also observed. During anaphase I, 1. 5 % of the cells of M. fortunei had lagging chromosomes and chro-mosome bridges. During <b>anaphase</b> II, <b>lagging</b> chromosomes, chromosome bridges and asynchronism in second divi-sion were observed, with abnormality rate in M. fortunei being about 9. 5 %. The rate of fertile pollen grains of the three species amounted to more than 90 %, which {{was consistent with the}} cell abnormality rate at anaphase II. The results indicate that, overall, meiotic process of the three species is normal, which is in line with the high pollen fer-tility rate and high seed yield of the three species. Our results support the view that Mahonia and Berberis represent a sister group in phylogenetic evolution, and that they should be treated as two distinct genera.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aneuploidy is a {{hallmark}} of most human cancers that arises {{as a consequence of}} chromosomal instability and it is frequently associated with centrosome amplification. Functional inactivation of the Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) has been indicated as a cause promoting chromosomal instability as well centrosome amplification. However, the underlying molecular mechanism still remains to be clarified. RESULTS: Here we show that pRb depletion both in wild type and p 53 knockout HCT 116 cells was associated with the presence of multipolar spindles, <b>anaphase</b> bridges, <b>lagging</b> chromosomes and micronuclei harbouring whole chromosomes. In addition aneuploidy caused by pRb acute loss was not affected by p 53 loss. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that pRB depletion altered expression of genes involved in centrosome duplication, kinetochore assembly and in the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). However, despite MAD 2 up-regulation pRb-depleted cells seemed to have a functional SAC since they arrested in mitosis after treatments with mitotic poisons. Moreover pRb-depleted HCT 116 cells showed BRCA 1 overexpression that seemed responsible for MAD 2 up-regulation. Post-transcriptional silencing of CENPA by RNA interference, resulting in CENP-A protein levels similar to those present in control cells greatly reduced aneuploid cell numbers in pRb-depleted cells.

40|$|Fluorescence in situ Hybridisation (FISH) revolutionised {{cytogenetics}} using fluorescently labelled probes {{with high}} affinity with target (nuclear) DNA. By the early 1990 s FISH was adopted {{as a means}} of PGD sexing for couples at risk of transmitting X-linked disorders and later for detection of unbalanced translocations. Following a rise in popularity of PGD by FISH for sexing and the availability of multicolour probes (5 - 8 colour), the use of FISH was expanded to the detection of aneuploidy and selective implantation of embryos more likely to be euploid, the rationale being to increase pregnancy rates (referral categories were typically advanced maternal age, repeated IVF failure, repeated miscarriage or severe male factor infertility). Despite initial reports of an increase in implantation rates, reduction in trisomic offspring and spontaneous abortions criticism centred around experimental design (including lack of randomisation), inadequate control groups and lack of report on live births. Eleven randomised control trials (RCTs) (2004 - 2010) showed that PGS with FISH did not increase delivery rates with some demonstrating adverse outcomes. These RCTs, parallel improvements in culturing and cryopreservation and a shift to blastocyst biopsy essentially outdated FISH as a tool for PGS and it has now been replaced by newer technologies (array CGH, SNP arrays, qRT-PCR and NGS). Cell-by-cell follow up analysis of individual blastomeres in non-transferred embryos is however usually prohibitively expensive by these new approaches and thus FISH remains an invaluable resource for the study of mosaicosm and nuclear organization. We thus developed the approach described herein for the FISH detection of chromosome copy number of all 24 human chromosomes. This approach involves 4 sequential layers of hybridization, each with 6 spectrally distinct fluorochromes and a bespoke capturing system. Here we report previously published studies and hitherto unreported data indicating that 24 chromosome FISH is a useful tool for studying chromosome mosaicism, one of the most hotly debated topics currently in preimplantation genetics. Our results suggest that mosaic embryo aneuploidy is not highly significantly correlated to maternal age, probably due, in part, to the large preponderance of post-zygotic (mitotic) errors. Chromosome loss (<b>anaphase</b> <b>lag)</b> appears to be the most common mechanism, followed by chromosome gain (endoreduplication), however 3 : 1 mitotic non- disjunction of chromosomes appears to be rare. Nuclear organisation (i. e. the spatial and temporal topology of chromosomes or sub-chromosomal compartments) studies indicate that human morula or blastocyst embryos (day 4 - 5) appear to adopt a "chromocentric" pattern (i. e. almost all centromeric signals reside in the innermost regions of the nuclear volume). By the blastocyst stage however, a more ordered organisation with spatial and temporal cues important for embryo development appears. We have however found no association between aneuploidy and nuclear organization using this approach despite our earlier studies. In conclusion, while FISH is mostly "dead and buried" for mainstream PGS, it still has a place for basic biology studies; the development of a 24 chromosome protocol extends the power of this analysis...|$|R

40|$|The proper {{transmission}} of genetic materials into progeny cells {{is crucial for}} maintenance of genetic integrity in eukaryotes and fundamental for reproduction of organisms. To achieve this goal, chromosomes must be attached to microtubules emanating from opposite poles in a bi-oriented manner at metaphase, and then should be separated equally through proper spindle elongation in anaphase. Failure to do so leads to aneuploidy, which {{is often associated with}} cancer. Despite the presence of a safety device called the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to monitor chromosome bi-orientation, mammalian cells frequently possess merotelic kinetochore orientation, in which a single kinetochore binds microtubules emanating from both poles. Merotelically attached kinetochores escape from the surveillance mechanism of the SAC and when cells proceed to <b>anaphase</b> cause <b>lagging</b> chromosomes, which are a leading cause of aneuploidy in mammalian tissue cultured cells. The fission yeast monopolin complex functions in prevention of mal-orientation of kinetochores including merotelic attachments during mitosis. Despite the known importance of Cdk 1 activity during mitosis, it has been unclear how oscillations in Cdk 1 activity drive the dramatic changes in chromosome behavior and spindle dynamics that occur at the metaphase/anaphase transition. In two separate studies, we show how dynamic Cdk 1 phosphorylation regulates chromosome segregation. First, we demonstrate that sequential phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of monopolin by Cdk 1 and Cdc 14 phosphatase respectively helps ensure the orderly execution of two discrete steps in mitosis, namely sister kinetochore bi-orientation at metaphase and spindle elongation in anaphase. Second, we show that elevated Cdk 1 activity is crucial for correction of merotelic kinetochores produced in monopolin and heterochromatin mutants...|$|R

Cytological results showed that chromosomal abnormalities were significantly higher in autotetraploid rice hybrids with allelic interactions at SaSb and SaSbSc loci than other hybrids with single pollen locus interaction. In addition, we found lower percentage of abnormal cells in Telophase І and Telophase II than other stages, and this probably happened due to the short duration of these stages or chromosomes have already moved towards opposite poles. All of these results indicated that abnormal male meiocytes caused by the interaction of SaSb and SaSbSc loci, and higher percentage of abnormalities resulted in high pollen sterility.|$|R
