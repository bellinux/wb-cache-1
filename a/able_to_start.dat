5|$|After the {{critical}} success of Karma, the couple returned to India in 1934. Although the Hindi {{version of the}} film, released in India in 1934, flopped without a trace, Himanshu Rai had established the required networks in Europe, and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> a film studio named Bombay Talkies, partnering with Niranjan Pal, a Bengali playwright and screenwriter who he had met previously in London, and Franz Osten, who directed several of Rai's films.|$|E

Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo set his fastest lap on the harder supersoft compound tyre, meaning {{that he would be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the race on them, should it have stayed dry. On the back end, Williams struggled for pace and both Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa missed out on Q3 by qualifying 11th and 14th respectively. Also eliminated were Esteban Gutiérrez, Jenson Button, Romain Grosjean and Magnussen.|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to base, the {{expedition}} {{learned of the}} presence of Amundsen, camped with his crew and a large contingent of dogs in the Bay of Whales, 200miles (320km) to their east.

5|$|The Phase 2 {{budget was}} {{originally}} $1.5 billion, {{which would be}} used to start construction of the tunnels; the MTA reduced the amount of money allocated in the budget, projecting that the agency would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> construction {{by the end of the}} 5-year cycle in 2019. Although the MTA previously expressed concerns about funding the Capital Program, a spokesman stated that the reduction in funding was a result of uncertain timing and not money problems.

5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} December 1883, a {{humpback}} whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off Dundee, attracting much local interest. It was harpooned, but after an all-night struggle escaped. A week later it was found dead, and was towed on to the beach at Stonehaven, near Aberdeen. Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet long with a tail 11 feet 4 inches wide. Struthers was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> dissecting it at once, as a local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale {{and took it to}} his yard in Dundee, where on the first Sunday, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Connex Norge {{offered to}} {{purchase}} Timetoget from NSB, and start operations. However, by February, Connex had changed their mind, {{and no longer}} wanted to purchase the company. Terje Bulling admitted that Timetoget {{had a very good}} agreement for operating the Arendal Line, and that a fourth Y1 railcar had been bought from Sweden for this route. However, when NSB had tried to sell Timetoget, this agreement {{was not part of the}} estate. By April, NSB estimated that they had lost NOK10 million on their engagement in Timetoget.

5|$|Stoke City {{went into}} their first FA Cup Final as underdogs {{according}} to their manager Tony Pulis, while Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini saw in-form Stoke's underdog tag as a risk for complacency from his side. There were fitness doubts over key players for both teams, Carlos Tevez for Manchester City, and Matthew Etherington for Stoke City, who suffered a hamstring tear only 17 days prior to the final, but both were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the match. However, Stoke City's underdog tag proved true as Mancini's Manchester City side had the better of the match, with a 59percent share of ball possession and 23 attempts on goal to Stoke City's nine, only {{one of which was}} on target.|$|E
5|$|Burebista inevitably {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Rome. During the Roman civil war of 49–44 BC, Pompey gained the support of Burebista through Akornion of Dionysopolis. Pompey himself had recognized Burebista's and Dacia's might with their successful conquests against the Greek Black Sea cities. Caesar, however, ended any alliance between Pompey and Burebista at the Battle of Pharsalus. Caesar was also aware of the growing strength of the Dacians and had himself planned to lead an attack against Burebista. Burebista at this time had a force that may have numbered up to 200,000 men – though it is disputed whether this force was an actual military force {{or the number of}} able bodied men within the kingdom. Regardless, Dacia was a formidable power which Caesar perceived as a threat to Rome. But Caesar was never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> his intended campaign because he was assassinated in 44 BC. Burebista met with the same fate as a civil uprising had him killed in either 45 or 44 BC.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013 Van Dijk {{announced}} that she signed a three-year contract with Boels Dolmans Cycling Team. She is a teammate of among others Lizzie Armitstead, Katarzyna Pawłowska and Christine Majerus. The time trial at the 2016 Summer Olympics will be her big goal. She will keep her focus on time trials, world cup races and flat short stage races. Due to her focus on road cycling, she will not compete on the track. Van Dijk was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> in the Ladies Tour of Qatar {{because she did not}} recover in time from an illness after riding mountainbikerace Egmond-pier-Egmond. She got back her shape during the first races and just missed the podium in the GP Le Samyn. At the first World Cup race of the season, the Ronde van Drenthe, Van Dijk helped teammate Lizzie Armitstead to victory by closing a massive gap in the final of the race.|$|E

5|$|Lewis Hamilton set {{the fastest}} time in Q2 at 1:06.228, the fastest time set in any {{session at the}} Red Bull Ring. However, both Ferrari and Red Bull set their fastest times in Q2 on the supersoft tyres, unlike Mercedes, who used the ultrasoft compound, meaning that both teams were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the race on the harder tyre. Realizing this, Mercedes tried to counter the move and sent their cars back out on supersoft tyres, but were unable to improve on their times due to rain {{starting}} to fall. Jenson Button moved into Q3, while his teammate Fernando Alonso did not, ending up 14th on the grid. In 12th place, Wehrlein equalled Manor's highest ever qualifying result, being between the two Haas drivers Esteban Gutiérrez and Romain Grosjean on the grid. Following their problems in Q1, Pérez and Sainz were unable to set a time and were thus eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Long's {{strategy}} of proclaiming {{himself as a}} royal descendent or claiming to have supernatural powers in order to rally support for political ends was not new; it has been repeatedly used throughout Vietnamese history. In 1516, a man calling himself Trần Cảo rebelled against the Lê Dynasty, claiming to be a descendant of the deposed Trần Dynasty and a reincarnation of Indra. During the 19th century, there was a Buddhist revival and many people masqueraded as monks claiming to have supernatural powers. These false monks were frequently <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> new religious movements and secret societies based on millenarianism. Quickly gathering large numbers of disciples, they staged rebellions against Vietnamese imperial and French colonial armies alike. However, these uprisings were typically incoherent and caused minimal disruption to the ruling authorities. On the other hand, the French were often troubled by resistance movements in southern Vietnam that were led by more conventionally motivated nationalist militants, such as the guerrilla outfits of Trương Định and Nguyễn Trung Trực.|$|E
5|$|On 25 March 1942, Mickl was {{appointed}} to command the 12th Rifle Brigade of Generalmajor Walter Wessel's 12th Panzer Division on the Eastern Front. The division was the main reserve formation of Army Group North, and when Mickl joined his brigade headquarters it was located on the coast near Narva west of Leningrad. The 12th Rifle Brigade consisted of the 5th and 25th Motorised Infantry Regiments. As a subordinate formation of General der Kavallerie Georg Lindemann's 18th Army, during the Red Army Winter Campaign of 1941–42 it had fought on the Volkhov Front, during which the Lyuban Offensive Operation had penetrated deep into its area of operations {{in an attempt to}} relieve Leningrad. When Mickl arrived to take command, elements of his command were fighting as part of a total of twenty 18th Army kampfgruppen engaged in encircling and destroying cut-off Soviet units. It was not until May that Mickl was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> gather his brigade together. At the end of June, Mickl was still collecting and re-organising his brigade when he received news that his son Manfred had been seriously wounded in the leg during the Axis capture of Tobruk. Manfred was a Leutnant in the Pioneers, and had already been decorated with the Iron Cross 1st Class.|$|E

5|$|Six {{drivers were}} reprimanded by the {{stewards}} for being slow {{to react to}} the red flag, while the fastest times from the No. 50 Larbre Compétition Chevrolet, the No. 78 KCMG Porsche, and No. 88 Abu-Dhabi Proton Racing entry were disallowed because the drivers were adjudged to have exceeded track limits. The ruling meant the Gulf Racing's No. 86 car moved from sixth to fourth in LMGTE Am. The No. 51 AF Corse entry, and Ford Chip Ganassi Team's No. 66 car, failed their post-qualifying checks when it was discovered that the vehicles were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> their engines with and without their fuel couplings engaged; they were allowed to start the race. Michael Christensen, one of two drivers of the No. 77 Dempsey Proton Porsche, failed to reach the 107% mark of the fastest qualifying time in LMGTE Pro and was prohibited from starting the event but allowed to participate {{in the rest of the}} race. The ruling meant the car's second driver Richard Lietz took over Christensen's starting duties.|$|E
5|$|Though {{hampered}} {{by the need to}} work inside his own end zone, Marcus Vick completed an 11-yard pass to tight end Jeff King for a first down. The play was the sole positive gain for the VT offense, however, and Virginia Tech was forced into its sixth punt of the game. The kick was a poor one, and traveled only 28yards before flying out of bounds. Thanks to the bad kick, Weatherford was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> his offense inside Virginia Tech territory, and took advantage of the situation. On the first play after the punt, Weatherford completed a 41-yard throw downfield to Willie Reid, who hauled in the ball at the Virginia Tech three-yard line to give the Seminoles a first and goal. After a failed quarterback sneak, however, Florida State was penalized 10yards for holding and Weatherford was sacked for a loss of threeyards on the next play. Although unable to cross the goal line for a touchdown, FSU did send in kicker Gary Cismesia for his second field goal attempt of the day. The kick, a 41-yarder, was good and gave Florida State a 203 lead with 4:23 remaining in the third quarter.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the direct}} {{command of the}} Earl of Forth, the Royalists laid siege to the city; Rupert had {{suggested}} a direct assault, but this proposal was not adopted due to fears of high casualties. By 11 August, the Royalist trenches were dug and the artillery prepared, despite Massie's attempts to disrupt work with musket fire. With this work done, {{there was no way}} out for the Parliamentarians; the only hope was to delay the Royalists long enough for a relief army to arrive. To this end, Massie ordered raids under the cover of darkness, with James Harcus, his second-in-command, leading a raid on the artillery trenches. In revenge the Royalists attacked the east of the city, but were driven off by cannon fire. 12 August saw more raids, this time during the day, which cost the Royalists 10 men and a supply depot, with no Parliamentarian losses. Despite this, the assaults did not disrupt Royalist preparations and by the evening they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> bombarding the town.|$|E
