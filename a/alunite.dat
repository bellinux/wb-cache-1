40|$|Thermogravimetry {{in tandem}} with mass {{spectrometry}} {{has been used to}} characterise the thermal decomposition of synthetic <b>alunites</b> of potassium, sodium and ammonium. Three mechanisms of decomposition are observed a) dehydration b) dehydroxylation c) desulphation. The thermal decomposition of the three <b>alunites</b> is different. For NH 4 -alunite, an additional process of de-ammoniation is observed which occurs simultaneously with dehydration. Dehydroxylation takes place in a series of four steps. De-sulphation occurs for K-alunite at 680 °C in a single step in comparison with Na and NH 4 <b>alunites</b> where de-sulphation is observed in a series of four steps. The temperature of desulphation is cation dependent. The thermal decomposition is not completed until around 800 °C...|$|R

5|$|In 2009, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} from the CRISM team reported on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals formed in the presence of water. Different types of clays (also called phyllosilicates) were found in many locations. The physilicates identified included aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, kaolinite, prehnite, and chlorite. Rocks containing carbonate were found around the Isidis basin. Carbonates belong to one class in which life could have developed. Areas around Valles Marineris were found to contain hydrated silica and hydrated sulfates. The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in Terra Meridiani and in Valles Marineris. Other minerals found on Mars were jarosite, <b>alunite,</b> hematite, opal, and gypsum. Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right pH and sufficient water to permit life to grow.|$|E
25|$|As a {{secondary}} mineral, turquoise forms by {{the action of}} percolating acidic aqueous solutions during the weathering and oxidation of preexisting minerals. For example, the copper may come from primary copper sulfides such as chalcopyrite or from the secondary carbonates malachite or azurite; the aluminium may derive from feldspar; and the phosphorus from apatite. Climate factors appear {{to play an important role}} as turquoise is typically found in arid regions, filling or encrusting cavities and fractures in typically highly altered volcanic rocks, often with associated limonite and other iron oxides. In the Southwestern United States turquoise is almost invariably associated with the weathering products of copper sulfide deposits in or around potassium-feldspar-bearing porphyritic intrusives. In some occurrences <b>alunite,</b> potassium aluminium sulfate, is a prominent secondary mineral. Typically turquoise mineralization is restricted to a relatively shallow depth of less than , although it does occur along deeper fracture zones where secondary solutions have greater penetration or the depth to the water table is greater.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} obtain alum from <b>alunite,</b> it is {{calcined}} and then exposed to the action of air for a considerable time. During this exposure it is kept continually moistened with water, so that it ultimately falls to a very fine powder. This powder is then lixiviated with hot water, the liquor decanted, and the alum allowed to crystallize. The alum schists employed {{in the manufacture of}} alum are mixtures of iron pyrite, aluminium silicate and various bituminous substances, and are found in upper Bavaria, Bohemia, Belgium, and Scotland. These are either roasted or exposed to the weathering action of the air. In the roasting process, sulfuric acid is formed and acts on the clay to form aluminium sulfate, a similar condition of affairs being produced during weathering. The mass is now systematically extracted with water, and a solution of aluminium sulfate of specific gravity 1.16 is prepared. This solution is allowed to stand for some time (in order that any calcium sulfate and basic ferric sulfate may separate), and is then evaporated until ferrous sulfate crystallizes on cooling; it is then drawn off and evaporated until it attains a specific gravity of 1.40. It is now allowed to stand for some time, decanted from any sediment, and finally mixed with the calculated quantity of potassium sulfate, well agitated, and the alum is thrown down as a finely divided precipitate of alum meal. If much iron should be present in the shale then it is preferable to use potassium chloride in place of potassium sulfate.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine the molecular structure of the mineral hinsdalite using vibrational spectroscopy. The mineral hinsdalite (Pb,Sr) Al 3 (PO 4,SO 4) 2 (OH) 6 is a hydroxy phosphate-sulphate mineral belonging to the beudantite subgroup of <b>alunites.</b> The mineral is interesting because it contains two oxyanions, phosphate and sulphate, which is unusual. The formation of hinsdalite offers a mechanism for the removal of phosphate from the environment. The mineral has been characterised by Raman spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy. The spectra are then related to the molecular structure of the mineral. Bands at various wavenumbers are assigned to the different vibrational modes of hinsdalite, which were then associated to the molecular structure of the mineral. Bands were primarily assigned to phosphate and sulphate stretching and bending modes. The Raman spectrum is characterised by an intense sharp band at 982 cm- 1 with a component band at 997 cm- 1 assigned to the ν 1 (PO 4) 3 - symmetric stretching modes. Two symmetric stretching modes for both phosphate and sulphate supported the concept of non-equivalent phosphate and sulphate units in the mineral structure.
