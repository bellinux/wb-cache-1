25|$|During the 1970s, Vanderbilt {{ventured into}} the fashion business, first with Glentex, {{licensing}} her name for a line of scarves. In 1976, Indian designer Mohan Murjani's Murjani Corporation, proposed launching a line of designer jeans carrying Vanderbilt's signature embroidered on the back pocket, {{as well as her}} swan logo. Her jeans were more tightly fitted than other jeans of that time. The logo eventually appeared on dresses and perfumes, while Vanderbilt also launched a line of blouses, sheets, shoes, leather goods, liqueurs, and accessories. Vanderbilt {{was one of the first}} designers to make public appearances, which was <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> for her because of her shyness.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Daedalus {{was designed}} by Izzy Medrano, {{who said that he}} imagined Daedalus as a brilliant architect gone mad, and that Daedalus, similar to Kratos, was a pawn of the gods. The character was originally intended to have long white hair, but was eventually rendered bald, [...] "as long hair is <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to manage." [...] Icarus was conceived as an [...] "old disgusting man" [...] and portrayed as an evil, although slightly comedic, character.|$|E
500|$|Known for her BAFTA award-winning {{work on the}} 2004 film Vera Drake, Jacqueline Durran {{was hired}} as the costume designer. She and Wright {{approached}} his film [...] "as <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to tackle" [...] because of their desire to distinguish it from the television adaptation. Due to Wright's dislike of the high waistline, Durran focused on later eighteenth century fashions that often included a corseted, natural waistline rather than an empire silhouette (which became popular after the 1790s). A generational divide was established: the older characters dress in mid-eighteenth century fashions while the young wear [...] "a sort of proto-Regency style of hair and dress". Mrs Bennet was of the older generation, and her dresses {{appeared to have been}} mended.|$|E

500|$|Mason {{has said}} he was nervous about filming Chris's coming out. Describing the scene, he said [...] "I did {{have to stand up}} in front a group of people and tell them , I was gay. That was a little intimidating". The actor felt that the storyline had been handled in a {{realistic}} manner and said that it shows that coming out is <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to do. Mason also spoke to a friend about his coming out experience to gain information about how long it took him to come out and how people reacted. The storyline follows Chris's struggle with his sexuality and depicts the reactions of his friends and family. It also deals with the issue of homophobia in sport. The Australian gay and lesbian newspaper, SX News said [...] "Chris is the captain of the school basketball team, but once word he's gay gets out to the other teams it turns nasty for him".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, saying, [...] "'Orison' rises above {{its origins in}} the depressing, hackneyed genre of serial-killer dramas. The episode combines a fast pace with a richly gloomy mood, and even serves to blur the all-too-sharp distinction between standalone X-Files stories and the series' 'mythology arc.'" [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and called the episode [...] "creepy, dark and wonderful". Rosell argued that the episode [...] "adds fuel to the fiery argument that it is , and not Mulder, that the real heart of the series was built on." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review, writing [...] " [...] was a journey filled with horror, mystery, and self-analysis. It {{was also one of}} the most exhilarating journeys the seventh season has produced thus far." [...] Furthermore, Kessenich defended Scully's actions at the end of the episode writing that [...] "what we saw at the end of 'Orison' was a human being pushed beyond the breaking point by a man [...] it doesn't make what she did right, but it certainly wasn't <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to understand." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B" [...] and felt that the episode, despite its faults, had elements that were particularly interesting. He noted that the titular chaplain was a [...] "potentially fascinating figure" [...] who was never explored to his full extent, and that the ending was effective in that it [...] "helps transform the episode’s climax into something more than a simple regurgitation". Finally, he positively compared the mood and thematic elements of the episode to Carter's other series Millennium.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Davidson {{has responded}} to accusations of {{prejudice}} by saying: [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing,</b> comedy, and I'm on a loser. If I cured Aids and fed Africa and ended Ebola and found that missing aeroplane I'd still be that horrible racist, sexist, homophobic comedian. By people, with respect, who haven't seen me. Or are judging me from the past." ...|$|E

He is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part."' – Alex Ferguson speaking about Beckham's marriage in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Neely, {{who started}} {{recording}} songs at age 14, drew musical inspiration from improvisational sessions {{between him and}} his friends as teenagers. Neely stated in the Huffington Post interview that over 50 songs had been planned for the second season throughout, though only 50 had been selected. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, Neely and Weidenfeld have stated their intentions on doing a musical episode (which they did, the third season's finale). Weidenfeld stated that producing one [...] "would be <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to write up front, but a Music Man style episode would just be incredible to do. And Brad could do it." ...|$|E

60|$|Philip saw her embarrassment, and, amused, turned Athelny's {{attention}} to something else. That was never <b>a</b> very <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to do.

2500|$|In {{the hours}} {{following}} the race, conspiracy theories emerged {{on social media}} around the circumstances concerning what happened when Rosberg lost the lead to Hamilton on lap 29. They suggested the incident {{was an act of}} revenge for the collision between the German driver and Hamilton at the Belgian Grand Prix two weeks prior. Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart felt the move was [...] "a bit too easy" [...] and appeared to indicate the error was done on purpose: [...] "I thought [...] could have least made an effort to get round the corner. I first thought 'that's wise', because he knew it wasn't <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to believe; the second time I thought: 'Hello, what's going on here?'" [...] Wolff denied the allegations that the mistake was deliberate, suggesting Rosberg was under pressure because of the Drivers' Championship battle but admitted it was not common for Rosberg to perform the same error twice: [...] "Only a paranoid mind could come up with such an idea." [...] Rosberg responded by stating Hamilton's fast pace prompted him to push hard and that while he could have successfully executed the corner, there was a large probability of flat-spotting one of his tyres and driving onto the run-off area was the safer choice. He stated he had heard about the theory but that there was [...] "no possible reason" [...] for him to purposely run off the track. Television pictures apparently showed Wolff smiling after moments after Rosberg's error with the team principal asserting that the broadcast was not live and stated the transmission of pit-to-car radio about Hamilton reducing his pace to conserve tyre life for a late race attack did not indicate the whole perception.|$|E

50|$|The Way of the Samurai is, {{morning after}} morning, the {{practice}} of death, considering {{whether it will be}} here or be there, imagining the most sightly way of dying, and putting one's mind firmly in death.

60|$|We set out, then, as per programme, {{and came}} upon the camp near {{the head of the}} valley.

6000|$|Another {{singular}} feature {{about the}} [...] "rabbit" [...] was the seeming impossibility for professionals to hold it.

60|$|It is <b>a</b> very <b>difficult</b> <b>thing,</b> as {{everyone}} knows, to step from one stone {{to another in}} a river, especially when the water flowing between runs swift and deep.

60|$|He {{would react}} like this; {{it is one}} of the most artistic strokes in Browning.

The truth about oneself is <b>a</b> very <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to express, and coarse speaking will seldom do it.|$|R
60|$|When we had amused {{ourselves}} a while about this, I said to him: 'Well, you shall go {{away from me}} no more; I'll go {{all over the world}} with you rather.'
