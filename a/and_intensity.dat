Continuing on this track, Christine gradually intensified and on September2, the storm attained its peak intensity just below hurricane-status while situated roughly 300mi (500km) east of Guadeloupe. At this time, a reconnaissance aircraft recorded sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). Shortly after Christine attained this intensity, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands.|$|E

To interpret the obtained time dependent components of facial expressions we have proposed a mathematical model of emotional stimuli assuming that dynamics of facial expressions is determined by emotional stimuli of different types <b>and</b> <b>intensities</b> <b>and</b> facial expression at the moment of the stimuli. Genetic programming has been used to find the locations, types <b>and</b> <b>intensities</b> of the emotional stimuli as well as the way the facial expressions react on them. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} a positive association between physical activity (PA) and health-related quality of life (HRQL). However, {{studies have suggested that}} this association depends both on the PA <b>intensity</b> <b>and</b> the domain of HRQL evaluated. This study aimed to explore the association between physical, mental and overall HRQL with recommended levels of PA. PA levels were divided into moderate <b>and</b> vigorous <b>intensity</b> leisure-time PA <b>and</b> total leisure-time PA. Methods: The study included 1001 adults, 582 women (46 +/- 17 years) and 419 men (43 +/- 16 years), residents in Rio Claro-SP, Brazil. All participants completed the SF- 36 questionnaire to assess HRQL and the long version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to assess level <b>and</b> <b>intensities</b> of leisure-time PA. Total leisure-time PA at moderate intensity was classified as: less than 9 min/week, 10 - 149 min/week, 150 - 299 min/week and 300 min/ week or more. Total leisure-time PA at vigorous intensity was classified as: less than 9 min/week, 10 to 74. 9 min/week, 75 - 149 min/week and 150 min/week or more. Multiple linear regression was performed in STATA version 12. 0. Results: Among women, moderate <b>intensity</b> <b>and</b> total leisure-time PA were associated with physical health. Among men, moderate <b>and</b> vigorous <b>intensity</b> <b>and</b> total leisure-time PA were associated with physical health and overall HRQL. Furthermore, moderate <b>intensity</b> <b>and</b> total leisure-time PA were associated with mental health in men. However, vigorous intensity PA was not associated with mental health for this group. Conclusion: The different domains of HRQL were associated with different levels <b>and</b> <b>intensities</b> of PA in leisure-time according to gender of adults. These findings indicate the complexity and importance of evaluating the HRQL stratified by gender and consider the different levels <b>and</b> <b>intensities</b> of PA...|$|R
