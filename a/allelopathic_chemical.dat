5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an <b>allelopathic</b> <b>chemical</b> called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E

50|$|The {{management}} of the species to increase its population is unclear. However, the work being done at FCTC is showing that disturbance is key. Prescribed fire opens up the understory and seems to promote a flush either {{the year of the}} burn or the year after, depending on conditions and seasonality of the burn. Other disturbance events that have promoted it on FCTC lands are large soil erosion events near an existing population, and in one instance a timber harvest. It has also become clear that this plant is not exclusively dependent on floodplains, their soil, their disturbance regime and the overstory particular to a floodplain. Indeed, the plant has been found to flourish under the black locusts (Robinia pseudoacacia) (illustrated by embedded map). Research since the map was developed has found extensive populations in many areas far from a floodplain but very much in a disturbance based system. Black locust as a species is also a pioneer and dependent upon disturbance in its early years. The tree emits an <b>allelopathic</b> <b>chemical</b> that impacts many plants and generally promotes a relatively barren understory. For reasons not yet understood, pale fumewort has taken to black locust understory quite well.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{connection}} between allelopathy and the ERH {{is the fact}} that concentrations of <b>allelopathic</b> <b>chemicals</b> were found to increase when diffuse knapweed was planted in North American soil as opposed to Eurasian soil. [...] This effect is probably due to the absence of unfavorable soil conditions or soil microorganisms that exist in its native environment.

50|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes.

Our study system, the interaction between Acacia cornigera and two Pseudomyrmex species (P. gracilis and P. ferrugineus), includes ant colonization patterns and plant behavior after colonization. Previous research on ant defensive roles had mentioned that P. ferrugineus was a good defensive system for Acacia plants, and that P. gracilis was a so-called parasite of the system.

Glasshouse trials comparing seedling emergence under cypress- and artificial-litter layers were undertaken. Cypress-pine litter did not have an inhibitory effect on the germination or growth of ground-cover species. In most cases, seedling emergence was facilitated by the application of cypress-pine litter due to its ability to increase the water holding capacity of the underlying soil.

40|$|The project {{completed}} at the Wichita State University Department of Biology. Presented at the 8 th Annual Capitol Graduate Research Summit, Topeka, KS, 2011 The introduction of non-native species {{can have a}} profoundly detrimental effect on native ecosystems composition. This is being seen in the tallgrass prairies of Kansas {{as a result of}} the introduction of Lespedeza cuneata (sericea). This plant is able to form dense monocultures that greatly reduce native species cover where it invades. One proposed explanation for this invasive success is that sericea produces allelopathic chemicals that suppress native species. We tested this hypothesis in a greenhouse experiment in which a native plant, Sorghastrum nutans (Indian grass), was grown with sericea and alone. Three different treatments were factored among the pots. Field soil with a history of either sericea or native plants was collected. This was done to determine if sericea alters the soil through microorganisms or through an accumulation of chemicals. In half of the pots, this soil was autoclaved to eliminate microorganisms. Microorganisms affect the nutrient acquisition and disease in plants, so an alteration in that community could affect growth. Additionally, an extract was made from mature sericea, and applied to half of the treatments. The extract may contain an <b>allelopathic</b> <b>chemical,</b> and if present, may alter biomass of native plants. After twelve weeks plants were collected, dried and biomass recorded. Preliminary analysis indicates that the soil history and microorganisms have an effect on Indian grass. This suggests that sericea may be able to change the soil microbial communities over time, leading to long-term negative effects on the native plants of Kansas...|$|E
40|$|Regularly-dispersed {{patterning}} in {{the landscape}} occurs globally, both {{in the form of}} vegetated patches or gaps of bare earth within a vegetated matrix. Most theories link these periodic patterns to various biotic factors including selective grazing, allelopathy, nests of social insects, and competitive interactions between plants ('self-organisation'). Fairy circles are perhaps the most archetypal of these patterns, taking the form of evenly-spaced, circular to elliptical barren patches 2 - 12 m in diameter. They occur in dense fields within sandy, species-poor grasslands in the Pro-Namib Desert. Fairy circles often display a well-vegetated peripheral ring of grasses and have been shown to retain higher levels of soil moisture compared to the surrounding matrix soils. They can persist {{in the landscape}} for decades, and show evidence of birth and senescence, when the bare disc becomes overgrown by grasses and fades back into the matrix. Since the 1970 's several hypotheses have been forwarded for their origin including; herbivory by the termite Hodotermes mossambicus (or the release of volatile chemicals from their nests), the excavation of grass roots by a widespread and common ant species, an <b>allelopathic</b> <b>chemical</b> released by Euphorbia damarana plants, geochemical gas seeps, plant self-organisation, and nest building activities of the Sand termite Psammotermes allocerus. A consensus has yet to be reached regarding the origin and nature of fairy circles, and the two theories currently receiving the most attention and debate are the Sand termite hypothesis and plant competition hypothesis. The latter proposes that short-range facilitation of plant growth occurs within the matrix and on the periphery of fairy circles, while long-range competition for resources (primarily water) by Stipagrostis roots inhibits plant growth on the bare disc thus generating the regular bare patches. The Sand termite hypothesis states that the termite P. allocerus creates and maintains a bare patch around their polycalic nests primarily through central-based foraging on grass roots and culms. This thesis aims to test the Sand termite hypothesis for fairy circle formation as well as expand on the ecology of fairy circles. Novel features relating to their ecology which are examined include: (1) various potential mechanisms for maintaining the circle's bare appearance (specifically examining seed banks and excavation of seedlings by ants), (2) changes in circle density and size in relation to environmental variables at a local scale (including soil properties and vegetation cover/type), (3) their ontogeny, lifespan and survival, (4) the high degree of spatial ordering seen in fairy circles, (5) soil properties on fairy circles compared to the surrounding matrix (including particle size, temperature, moisture, pH and electrical conductivity) and (6) the influence of fairy circles on nearby plant and insect communities.

40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} in forest {{ecosystems}} represent an important C pool. Litter fall {{is the largest}} source of organic material and nutrients for the organic and mineral layers in forest ecosystems. The chemical composition of plant litter has a large influence on soil microbial communities {{and is one of}} the main factors affecting litter decay rates and the dynamics of SOM. Introduction of alien species, in forest ecosystems, may have a potential allelopathic effect on other tree species and <b>allelopathic</b> <b>chemical</b> compounds produced by alien tree species might inhibit soil microbial activity with consequent effects on storage rates of SOM and ecosystem nutrient cycling. Until know little attention has been paid to this topic that is worthy of investigation because alien species are largely used for afforestation of poor soils or easily invade bare soils. 	Forest stands at Mount Vesuvius are a convenient study area to investigate C sequestration in soil. Chronosequences of tree plantation occur on volcanic substrate of know age; moreover different species of trees have been used for afforestation including the alien invasive species Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.). Thus it is possible to study carbon sequestration in the soil as related to the age of the stand and to type of tree cover. 	In the two coeval (36 yrs old) stands on lapillus of the last eruption of Vesuvius, with a different tree cover (Black locust and Corsican pine, Pinus nigra Arn. var. corsicana), litter fall (years 2006 – 2008) is higher in the Corsican pine than in the Black locust stand (P < 0. 05). Total Litter Fall over Basal area (TLF/BA) is 90. 7 Kg/m 2 for Black locust vs 210. 2 Kg/m 2 for Corsican pine and the higher litter fall amount of Corsican pine corresponds to the higher biomass. In the organic soil layers amounts of organic C are higher (P < 0. 05) in Corsican pine as compared to Black locust stand (g/m 2 = 2701. 9 vs 1636. 4), while in the mineral layers organic C amounts are lightly higher (but not statistically different) in Black locust than in Corsican pine soil (136 vs 116 g/m 2). 13 C CPMAS NMR data show that the aromaticity degree of humus is higher for Black locust than for Corsican pine (% Ar = 9. 54 vs 7. 08). 	In the Stone pine cronosequence, litter fall (2006 – 2008) increases gradually from the younger stand (36 yrs old) to the oldest one (96 yrs old) and is positively related to tree basal area (BA); Total Litter Fall over Basal Area (TLF/BA) also increases with stand age (123 to 145 Kg/m 2). Moreover chemical analyses of organic and mineral soil layers clearly indicate the accumulation of C with stand age (g/m 2 = 1053. 9 for 36 yrs old stand vs 2523. 5 for 66 yrs old one and vs 3065. 2 for 96 yrs old one). 	The results dealing with the black locust stand allow to conclude that Black locust litter: i) inhibit soil microorganisms activity, ii) produces a recalcitrant residue, rich of aromatic compounds, including 4 –hydroxyacetophenon (indentified by 1 H NMR), known for its allelopathic potential. This may lead to high accumulation of organic matter in the soil and thus to high C sequestration. 	The comparison of all pine stands shows that the trend of litter fall and C sequestration, increases from the younger to the older stand...|$|E

This review concentrates on plant-bacteria interactions that increase the degradation of hazardous organic compounds in soil. Plants and bacteria can form specific associations in which the plant provides the bacteria with a specific carbon source that induces the bacteria to reduce the phytotoxicity of the contaminated soil. Alternatively, plants and bacteria can form nonspecific associations in which normal plant processes stimulate the microbial community, which {{in the course of}} normal metabolic activity degrades contaminants in soil. Plants can provide carbon substrates and nutrients, as well as increase contaminant solubility. These biochemical mechanisms increase the degradative activity of bacteria associated with plant roots. In return, bacteria can augment the degradative capacity of plants or reduce the phytotoxicity of the contaminated soil. However, the specificity of the plant-bacteria interaction is dependent upon soil conditions, which can alter contaminant bioavailability, root exudate composition, and nutrient levels.

5000|$|A major ecophysiological {{advantage}} of lichens {{is that they}} are poikilohydric (poikilo- variable, hydric- relating to water), meaning that though they have little control over the status of their hydration, they can tolerate irregular and extended periods of severe desiccation. Like some mosses, liverworts, ferns, and a few [...] "resurrection plants", upon desiccation, lichens enter a metabolic suspension or stasis (known as cryptobiosis) in which the cells of the lichen symbionts are dehydrated to a degree that halts most biochemical activity. In this cryptobiotic state, lichens can survive wider extremes of temperature, radiation and drought in the harsh environments they often inhabit.Lichens do not have roots and do not need to tap continuous reservoirs of water like most higher plants, thus they can grow in locations impossible for most plants, such as bare rock, sterile soil or sand, and various artificial structures such as walls, roofs and monuments. Many lichens also grow as epiphytes (epi- on the surface, phyte- plant) on plants, particularly on the trunks and branches of trees. When growing on plants, lichens are not parasites; they do not consume any part of the plant nor poison it. Lichens produce <b>allelopathic</b> <b>chemicals</b> that inhibit the growth of mosses. Some ground-dwelling lichens, such as members of the subgenus Cladina (reindeer lichens), produce <b>allelopathic</b> <b>chemicals</b> that leach into the soil and inhibit the germination of seeds, spruce and other plants. Stability (that is, longevity) of their substrate is a major factor of lichen habitats. Most lichens grow on stable rock surfaces or the bark of old trees, but many others grow on soil and sand. In these latter cases, lichens are often an important part of soil stabilization; indeed, in some desert ecosystems, vascular (higher) plant seeds cannot become established except in places where lichen crusts stabilize the sand and help retain water.|$|R

After solidification, five pre-germinated radish seeds with radicals less than 2 mm in length were placed on each petri dish. Radish radicle lengths at 48 h were recorded. Significant differences were found among cover crops in both experiments. All cover crop extracts inhibited radicle elongation significantly more than distilled water, supporting previous research which noted allelopathic effects in cover crops...|$|R
