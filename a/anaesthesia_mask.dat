40|$|In {{an attempt}} to assess {{possible}} discomfort in rats subjected to orbital puncture while under diethyl-ether anaesthesia, their endocrine stress response was determined. Concentrations of corticosterone, adrenaline and noradrenaline were measured in plasma obtained via a jugular catheter from rats subjected to diethyl-ether anaesthesia with or without orbital puncture. No statistically {{significant differences were found}} between the punctured and non-punctured rats as to peak levels of plasma corticosterone and adrenaline as well as for the times required by the increased concentrations to return to baseline values. The rate by which the plasma noradrenaline level returned to baseline values was somewhat decreased by orbital puncture. Diethyl-ether anaesthesia alone produced a marked endocrine response when compared with handling and novelty stress associated with the induction of anaesthesia. It is concluded that diethyl-ether anaesthesia causes pronounced increases in the plasma levels of the selected stress hormones and that orbital puncture does not amplify this response. It is suggested that diethyl-ether <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>masks</b> any effects of orbital puncture. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In {{many cases}} the {{inflation}} of laryngeal masks is often performed only with regard to clinical impressions and without any objective measurements of the intracuff pressure. This often results in postoperative complications such as sore throat, dysphonia, dysphagia and even nerve palsy. The present study compared two alternative methods of controlling the intracuff pressure during laryngeal <b>mask</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Patients and methods: In this prospective, randomised, double-blind, controlled study 180 consecutive patients undergoing elective surgery under laryngeal <b>mask</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> were included. The primary endpoint was the incidence of sore throat. The patients were divided randomly into two groups. In the group “digital palpation” (n= 90) the intracuff pressure was controlled only by digital palpation of the pilot balloon. In the group “manometry” (n= 90) the intracuff pressure was measured directly by continuous manometry. Immediately {{before the start of}} the study, the entire staff of the anaesthesia department was trained in the digital palpation technique. Secondary endpoints were the severity and duration of pharyngolaryngeal symptoms, the quality of the airway, the impact of the professional experience of the anaesthetists as well as the number of attempts to place the laryngeal mask on the incidence of sore throat, dysphagia and dysphonia. Our null hypothesis was that both methods of controlling the intracuff pressure show comparable results with regard to postoperative complications. Alternatively, we tested the hypothesis, that despite the previous training programme, pharyngolaryngeal complications following laryngeal <b>mask</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> are more frequent using digital palpation to control the intracuff pressure than using continuous manometry. Results: While a total of 12 % (11 / 90) of patients of the manometry-group suffered from such symptoms as sore throat, dysphagia or dysphonia respectively, there were 37 % (33 / 90) affected patients in the palpation-group (p< 0. 001). No significant differences between both groups regarding the duration of symptoms and the severity of symptoms were seen. The incidence of pharyngolaryngeal complications was independent of the professional experience of the anaesthetists. In 159 patients the laryngeal mask was placed successfully at the first attempt. Thirty-two of these (20 %) suffered from sore throat. In 21 patients two or more attempts were necessary to place the laryngeal mask. Fourteen of these patients (67 %) suffered from pharyngolaryngeal symptoms (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: We conclude that neither many years of experience of the anaesthetist nor intensive training are sufficient to make the digital palpation technique to an equivalent method to the manometry in controlling the intracuff pressure during laryngeal <b>mask</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Therefore, this method should be applied compulsorily in all patients undergoing laryngeal <b>mask</b> <b>anaesthesia...</b>|$|R
40|$|Concentrations {{of acute}} phase {{proteins}} (CRP: C-reactive protein, albumin) change during surgery. We investigated the acute phase response to circumcision {{and the effects}} of anaesthesia on this response.

25|$|Face mask — In {{resuscitation}} and {{for minor}} procedures under <b>anaesthesia,</b> a face <b>mask</b> is often sufficient {{to achieve a}} seal against air leakage.

These are designed to provide a passage of air to the pharynx through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for non-invasive ventilation in conscious patients. A full face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration.|$|R
50|$|Schimmelbusch {{developed}} {{an updated version}} of the mask in 1895, in which the wire created a tower-like shape, which was covered in a waxed cloth in order to concentrate the anaesthetic vapour. However, the updated mask was not a success, and his original design, with modifications to allow gas channels remained in use in the German-speaking world into the 1950s. The continued use of the mask was due to a combination of factors; a number of influential surgeons spurned the use of tracheal intubation for <b>anaesthesia,</b> and the <b>mask</b> did not require as much training to use. As a consequence, anaesthesia was generally applied by relatively inexperienced doctors and nurses.|$|R
40|$|General {{anaesthesia}} for {{surgical procedures}} requiring prone position consists of induction and tracheal intubation in supine {{position on a}} trolley and then the patient is turned prone on the operation table and positioned carefully. Even though this approach is familiar to anaesthesiologists, it is time consuming and requires shift of manpower from other tasks to properly position the patient. Alternative to this technique is to ask the patient to position him/ herself in the prone position {{on the operating table}} and then inducing <b>anaesthesia</b> with laryngeal <b>mask</b> airway. The major advantages of laryngeal mask airway in prone position are easy reinsertion, a clear airway provided during the recovery phase from anaesthesia and less sequelae as compared to that commonly accompanying tracheal intubation and accidental tracheal extubation...|$|R

However, the incidence of hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation ± 93 %) was significantly greater during transfer in the acute infection group (p = 0. 001) and the recent infection group (p = 0. 02), as well as during recovery in the acute group (p = 0. 03) compared with asymptomatic children...|$|R
40|$|Background: Age-based {{formulas}} {{have been}} widely used to predict the appropriate size of the endotracheal tube (ETT) for intubation in paediatric age group. These formulas often fail to reliably predict the proper size of ETT. The objective of the study is to determine whether the tracheal internal diameter imaged by ultrasound is a better predictor of ETT size than age based formulas. Methods: The study included a total of 60 patients of ASA 1 and 2 aged between 2 and 15 years of either sex posted for elective surgery under general anaesthesia. After institutional ethical committee approval and written consent from the parents, anaesthesia was induced as per the protocol. The tracheal diameter was measured after induction of <b>anaesthesia,</b> during <b>mask</b> ventilation prior to intubation. A linear high frequency ultrasound probe (GE venue 40) was used to measure the tracheal diameter. The size of ETT was selected according to the measured tracheal diameter. The leak test and adequate oxygenation/ventilation were the objective tests used to validate the appropriateness of the ETT chosen. The ETT sizes determined by age based formulas and by the use of ultrasound were statistically compared with the appropriate ETT size used clinically for intubation. Results: The estimation of endotracheal tube size with the aid of ultrasound was found to be superior when compared with age based formulas. Ultrasound tube size determination correlated well with clinically used ETT size. Conclusions: Determination of endotracheal tube size by ultrasound is a good predictor of proper sized ETT in paediatric age group when compared with age based formulas.

The primary outcome measure was passive ankle dorsiflexion. METHOD: Forty-two ambulant children with spastic equinus, secondary to cerebral palsy (23 males and 19 females; mean age 3 y 6 mo, SD 13 mo; GMFCS levels I [n= 20], II [n= 19], III [n= 3]) were randomized to receive either 12 -monthly or 4 -monthly BoNT-A injections to the calf, over a 26 -month period. Twenty-one children had spastic hemiplegia, 21 children had spastic diplegia. A fixed 6 U/kg dose of Botox was {{injected into the}} gastrocnemius muscle of both limbs in children with diplegia and the gastrocsoleus of the affected limb in children with hemiplegia, under <b>mask</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> RESULTS: Forty-two children entered the trial with 21 participants randomized to each group.

40|$|Background and objective: There are {{concerns}} over the intra-cuff pressure of the laryngeal mask and laryngopharyngeal morbidity. In a randomized study, the authors compared cuff-pressure changes in the LMA-Classic(R) and the new disposable Soft Seal(R) laryngeal mask during nitrous oxide anaesthesia. Methods: Two-hundred adult patients {{were randomly assigned to}} a size 4 laryngeal mask in two equal-sized groups for airway management: (a) the re-usable LMA-Classic or (b) the new disposable Soft Seal(R) laryngeal <b>mask.</b> <b>Anaesthesia</b> was administered with fentanyl, propofol, nitrous oxide, 02 and sevoflurane. The cuff pressures, adjusted to 45 mmHg at insertion, were monitored continuously {{until the end of the}} operation without any further attempt to reduce cuff pressure. On removal of the laryngeal mask, any blood at all was considered positive. Patients were requested to report any sore throat at 2 and 24 h postoperatively. Results: During nitrous oxide anaesthesia, cuff pressures increased in the LMA-Classic(R) group from 45 to 100. 3 mmHg and from 45 to 46. 8 mmHg in the Soft Seal(R) laryngeal mask group (P < 0. 001). The incidence of sore throat was significantly higher at 2 h postoperatively when using the LMA-Classic although there was no difference at 24 h following the operation. Macroscopic blood was only seen on four occasions in the LMA-Classic(R) group (nor significant). Conclusions: During nitrous oxide anaesthesia, cuff pressure increases in the LMA-Classic(R) mask were significantly higher than those of the Soft Seal(R) laryngeal mask. Trauma to patients, as assessed by the incidence of sore throat in the early postoperative period was significantly higher in the LMA-Classic(R) group.

40|$|AIM: The aims of {{this study}} were to (1) {{determine}} whether an instrumented measure will reduce measurement error to less than 5 degrees in children with cerebral palsy (CP), (2) determine agreement and reliability of this instrumented measure in both conscious and anaesthetized participants, and (3) compare the method with previously reported measures. METHOD: Thirty-four ambulant children (15 males, 19 females), aged 3 to 9 years, with spastic CP were studied in a tertiary-care paediatric hospital (21 with hemiplegia, 11 with diplegia, and two with quadriplegia). The majority of children functioned at Gross Motor Function Classification System level I (n= 11) or II (n= 18), with five children at level III. Ankle dorsiflexion at 50 % bodyweight was photographed and measured. Each child was measured when conscious and when under <b>mask</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> by two experienced assessors. RESULTS: The standard error of measurement (SEM) ranged from 3. 9 degrees (anaesthetized; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 3. 3 - 4. 0 degrees) to 6. 7 degrees (conscious; 95 % CI 5. 3 - 8. 0 degrees). This compared favourably with previously reported dorsiflexion measures (SEM range 6. 5 - 7. 8 degrees) in conscious children with CP. Intrarater reliability was good in both conditions (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: range 0. 95 [anaesthetized; 95 % CI 0. 92 - 0. 98] to 0. 86 [conscious; 95 % CI 0. 76 - 0. 95]).

40|$|Background Airway {{management}} {{is of utmost}} importance during delivery of general anaesthesia. Traditionally, laryngoscopy and endotracheal tube (ETT) insertion has been the mainstay in providing adequate airway management and delivering <b>anaesthesia.</b> The laryngeal <b>mask</b> airway (LMA) offers a much less invasive way of maintaining the airway as it does not pass through the glottis but is placed over the glottis. It {{does not require the}} use of the laryngoscope. Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway insertion are noxious stimuli which provoke a transient but marked sympathetic response manifesting as hypertension and tachycardia. In susceptible patients particularly those with systemic hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and intracranial aneurysm, even these transient changes can result in potentially deleterious effects like left ventricular failure, arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia, cerebral haemorrhage and rupture of cerebral aneurysm. Objective To determine the haemodynamic response elicited by laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation and compare it with that elicited by laryngeal mask insertion in ASA I and ASA II patients, undergoing elective surgeries at Muhimbili national Hospital (MNH) and Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute (MOI) in 2011. Methods A hospital based prospective randomized comparative study was conducted to determine the haemodynamic response elicited by laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation and compare it with that elicited by laryngeal mask insertion in ASA I and ASA II patients, undergoing elective surgeries at MNH and MOI. After induction of anaesthesia either an ETT or LMA was inserted. Evaluations included measurement of blood pressure and heart rates before insertion, after insertion of device, 1 minute, 3 minutes and 5 minutes after insertion. Measuments were taken from the Drager infinity gamma XL monitor. Time and ease of insertion was also noted. Results There was an increase in HR, SBP and DBP seen after laryngoscopy and ETT insertion as well as after laryngeal mask insertion. The change in haemodynamic parameters after laryngoscopy and ETT insertion were significantly greater than those elicited by LMA insertion (p< 0. 0001). The increase took about 5 minutes to return to pre insertion values in the ETT group, while it took about 3 minutes for the same values to return to pre insertion values in the LMA group. It took a significantly shorter time to insert an LMA (12. 63 sec) as compared to time taken to insert an ETT (22. 76 sec). Insertion of an LMA was rated easy in 84 % of the patients while it was rated easy in 60 % of the ETT patients. Conclusion The haemodynamic changes elicited by LMA insertion are less and short lived compared to those elicited by laryngoscopy and ETT insertion. It takes a shorter time and is much easier to insert an LMA as compared to laryngoscopy and ETT insertion. These changes might be insignificant in a normotensive patient, but could be harmful in a patient with cerebrovascular or cardiovascular abnormalities. The use of an LMA is recommended in these groups of patients...|$|R
