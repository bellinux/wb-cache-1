40|$|Background: Treatment success among HIV+ persons {{under an}} {{antiretroviral}} regimen strongly rely on individual factors. Objective: To test {{the variables of}} a psychological model {{and the influence of}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>use</b> in the prediction of medication-adherence behaviors. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 124 HIV+ persons recruited in an outpatient clinic in the state of Lara, Venezuela, who completed a self-administered questionnaire measuring psychological variables and medication-adherence behaviors, as well as an index of <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>use.</b> Moment-product correlation <b>and</b> structural equation modeling were applied for data analyses. Results: Current behavioral competencies showed a direct effect on medication-adherence behaviors, mediating the indirect effect of low <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>use.</b> The structural equation modeling demonstrated a good fit to the sample data: χ 2 / gl = 1. 42, GFI = 0. 99, AGFI = 0. 94, NFI = 0. 98, CFI = 0. 99, FD = 0. 02 [FDMI = 1. 13], PNCP = 0. 01 [PNCPMI = 1. 08], RMSEA = 0. 05, RMSSR = 0. 04. Conclusion: Behavioral competencies <b>and</b> low <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>use</b> were significant predictors of medication-adherence behaviors. Further research direction, including national wide of HIV+ persons from Venezuela and the development of interdisciplinary interventions that promote and sustain medication-adherence behaviors are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} modifiable {{risk factors for}} stroke are {{high blood pressure and}} atrial fibrillation although the size of the effect is small with 833 people have to be treated for 1 year to prevent one stroke.

Alcohol use could predispose to ischemic stroke, and intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage via multiple mechanisms (for example via hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rebound thrombocytosis and platelet aggregation and clotting disturbances). Drugs, most commonly amphetamines and cocaine, can induce stroke through damage to the blood vessels in the brain and acute hypertension.|$|E

25|$|Stressful working {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} three types of strains: Behavioral (e.g., absenteeism or poor performance), physical (e.g., headaches or coronary heart disease), and psychological (e.g., anxiety or depressed mood). Physical symptoms that may occur because of occupational stress include fatigue, headache, upset stomach, muscular aches and pains, weight gain or loss, chronic mild illness, and sleep disturbances. Psychological and behavioral problems that may develop include anxiety, irritability, <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> feeling powerless and low morale. The spectrum of effects caused by occupational stress includes absenteeism, poor decision making, lack of creativity, accidents, organizational breakdown or even sabotage. If exposure to stressors in the workplace is prolonged, then chronic health problems can occur including stroke. An examination was of physical and psychological effects of workplace stress was conducted {{with a sample of}} 552 female blue collar employees of a microelectronics facility. It was found that job-related conflicts were associated with depressive symptoms, severe headaches, fatigue, rashes, and other multiple symptoms. Studies among the Japanese population specifically showed a more than 2-fold increase in the risk of total stroke among men with job strain (combination of high job demand and low job control). Those in blue-collar or manual labor jobs are more likely to develop heart disease compared to those in white-collar jobs. Along with the risk of stroke, stress can raise the risk of high blood pressure, immune system dysfunction, coronary artery disease. Prolonged occupational stress can lead to occupational burnout. Occupational stress can also disrupt relationships.|$|E

500|$|Since their movement's {{emergence}} {{early in}} the 20th century, Pentecostals saw themselves as [...] "peculiar people", {{and one of the}} components of this identity were particular prohibitions on behavior. Prohibitions on drug use, gambling, social dancing, consuming alcohol, smoking, attending theaters, bowling, swimming in public pools and beaches, owning television sets, and restrictions on feminine attire and fashion helped distinguish Pentecostals from the larger society. Starting in the 1950s, attitudes in the Assemblies of God on many of these activities underwent dramatic change. The most change probably occurred over views on women's attire, with the former stance against wearing make-up and jewelry giving way to the acceptance of popular fashion. Most of these [...] "holiness standards" [...] are no longer adhered to; however, some are still held to, such as proscriptions on smoking, <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

[...] He described Paul as [...] "very serious, straight up and down and a really solid rock singer" [...] who was known for his jumps and acrobatics on stage, and John as carefree, charismatic, a talented pop music writer, and a natural leader of both the band and their audience. [...] Paul reported that the 1980s was an vibrant time for local music in Sydney, and that the group gained additional exposure by performing on TV shows like Simon Townsend and Hey, Hey it's Saturday.

[...] Launched in 2007, DukeEngage provides full funding for select Duke undergraduates who wish to pursue an immersive summer of service in partnership with a U.S. or international community. As of summer 2013, more than 2,400 Duke students had volunteered through DukeEngage in 75 nations on six continents. Duke students have created more than 30 service organizations in Durham and the surrounding area. Examples include a weeklong camp for children of cancer patients (Camp Kesem) and a group that promotes awareness about sexual health, rape prevention, <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> and eating disorders (Healthy Devils). The Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership, started by the Office of Community Affairs in 1996, attempts to address major concerns of local residents and schools by leveraging university resources. Another community project, [...] "Scholarship with a Civic Mission," [...] is a joint program between the Hart Leadership Program and the Kenan Institute for Ethics. Another program includes Project CHILD, a tutoring program involving 80 first-year volunteers; and an after-school program for at-risk students in Durham that was started with $2.25 million grant from the Kellogg Foundation in 2002. Two prominent civic engagement pre-orientation programs also exist for incoming freshmen: Project CHANGE and Project BUILD. Project CHANGE is a free weeklong program co-sponsored by the Kenan Institute for Ethics and the Duke Women's Center with the focus on ethical leadership and social change in the Durham community; students are challenged {{in a variety of ways}} and work closely with local non-profits. Project BUILD is a freshman volunteering group that dedicates 3,300 hours of service to a variety of projects such as schools, Habitat for Humanity, food banks, substance rehabilitation centers, homeless shelters. Some courses at Duke incorporate service as part of the curriculum to augment material learned in class such as in psychology or education courses (known as service learning courses).|$|E

40|$|<b>Alcohol</b> <b>and</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> have {{adverse health}} effects and also {{influence}} health {{as a result of}} intentional and unintentional accidents. International emergency room studies show that substance use and injuries are related. Despite this, emergency room studies on <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> in the Netherlands do not provide recent and complete data. Therefore, the focus of this thesis will be twofold. First, methodological aspects of assessing substance use among emergency room populations are studied. Second, this study provides recent data on substance use prevalence rates and patient characteristics among emergency room populations in the Netherlands. Data were collected in four different emergency rooms in different regions in the Netherlands; including two university hospitals and two general hospitals. This thesis concludes that the main methodological issues involved in emergency room studies are the characteristics of the <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> illicit <b>drug!</b> <b>use</b> measures, <b>and</b> sample selection bias. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>and</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> prevalence rates <b>and</b> patient characteristics in the present studies are comparable to international findings, with variations between the different regions in the Netherlands.
