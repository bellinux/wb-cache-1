Relations between aggressive thoughts <b>and</b> <b>behaviors,</b> as well as withdrawal thoughts <b>and</b> <b>behaviors,</b> <b>and</b> levels of the other partner's trust and commitment to the relationship were tested.

40|$|Abstract To {{take full}} {{advantage}} of the flexibility of a modular robot system, users must be able to create and verify new configurations <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> quickly. We present a design framework that facilitates rapid creation of new configurations <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> through composition of existing ones, and tools to verify configurations <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> as they are being created. New configurations are created by com-bining existing sub-configurations, for example combining four legs and a body to create a walking robot. Behaviors are associated with each configuration, so that when sub-configurations are composed, their associated behaviors are immediately available for composition as well. We introduce a new motion description language (Series-Parallel Action Graphs) that facilitates the rapid creation of complex behav-iors by composition of simpler behaviors. We provide tools that automatically verify configurations <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> during the design process, allowing the user to iden-tify problems early and iterate quickly. In addition to verification, users can evaluate their configurations <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> in a physics-based simulator. ...|$|R

In Wave 1, participants were 507 adolescents (249 boys and 258 girls) aged from 14 to 15 years (M = 14. 76; SD = 0. 63). Three years later (Wave 2), the same adolescents participated again in the study (M = 17. 88 years; SD = 0. 57).

Additional evidence of gender differences in environmental attitudes <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> was also supported across age (Study 1) and across 14 countries (Study 2). As a single variable, the effect of gender on proenvironmental behavior was consistently stronger than on environmental attitudes. Explanations for gen-der differences in environmentalism were examined in Study 3. It was found that compared to males, females had higher levels of socialization to be other oriented and socially responsible. Implications for theory, social action, and policy are discussed.
