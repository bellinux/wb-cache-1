5|$|Cross-country ski marathons—races with {{distances}} {{greater than}} 40 kilometers—have two cup series, the Ski Classics, {{which started in}} 2011, and the Worldloppet. Skiers race in classic or free-style (skating) events, depending on {{the rules of the}} race. Notable ski marathons, include the Vasaloppet in Sweden, Birkebeineren in Norway, the Engadin Skimarathon in Switzerland, the American Birkebeiner, the Tour of <b>Anchorage</b> in <b>Anchorage,</b> Alaska, and the Boreal Loppet, held in Forestville, Quebec, Canada.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} ever {{recorded in the}} United States struck <b>Anchorage</b> and southern Alaska, cutting communications to the outside world. The quake was felt in Fairbanks, and it took 40 minutes for communications to be re-established with the Associated Press office in Seattle. When the connection was restored, the News-Miner sent the first reports of the earthquake to the outside world. The quake also destroyed {{the offices of the}} <b>Anchorage</b> Times, the leading newspaper in that city. The News-Miner offered its press facilities to the Times, and the two papers shared a masthead as <b>Anchorage</b> recovered from the tremor.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge is}} one of two {{installations}} of a new cable-stayed cradle system that eliminates <b>anchorages</b> in the pylon by carrying the stays from <b>anchorages</b> in the bridge deck, through the pylon and back to <b>anchorages</b> in the deck. The cradle system provides many benefits during construction and over the 100+ year service life of the bridge. Each strand acts independently, allowing for the selective removal, inspection and replacement of the strands.|$|R

Using this data analysis as input a stochastic simulation model is constructed in MATLAB to assess occupancy and evaluate capacity in these <b>anchorages.</b> With the contructed simulation model the current anchoring situation in the <b>anchorages</b> in the offshore approach of the port of Rotterdam is modelled correctly and accurately, and furthermore the model is generic and hence can be used by many other ports as well.

5|$|Charles Darwin {{had been}} told that the Beagle was {{expected}} to sail about the end of September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to <b>anchorage,</b> ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its <b>anchorage</b> in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anchorage's</b> largest {{economic}} sectors include transportation, military, municipal, {{state and federal}} government, tourism, corporate headquarters (including regional headquarters for multinational corporations) and resource extraction. Large portions of the local economy depend on <b>Anchorage's</b> geographical location and surrounding natural resources. <b>Anchorage's</b> economy traditionally has seen steady growth, though not quite as rapid as many places in the lower 48 states. With the notable exception of a real estate-related crash in the mid-to-late 1980s, which saw the failure of numerous financial institutions, it does not experience as much pain during economic downturns.|$|R

50|$|A self-anchored {{suspension}} bridge is a {{suspension bridge}} {{in which the}} main cables attach {{to the ends of}} the deck, rather than to the ground via large <b>anchorages.</b> The design is well-suited for construction atop elevated piers, or in areas of unstable soils where <b>anchorages</b> would be difficult to construct.|$|R
30|$|This is an {{important}} conclusion as C-FRP plain <b>anchorages</b> are simpler to realize in situ, but international and national guidelines and code about C-FRP reinforcement, in case of complex load scheme (different from simple supported beam) do not give detailed information about how to calculate and realize C-FRP <b>anchorages</b> on cracked concrete.|$|R

5|$|The {{stretch of}} water known as Carrick Roads {{at the mouth}} of the River Fal was an {{important}} <b>anchorage</b> serving shipping arriving from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. A small gun tower, called the Little Dennis Blockhouse, was built in 1539 overlooking the entrance, and plans were made to protect the <b>anchorage</b> further with five additional castles. In the event, only two of these were constructed, Pendennis and St Mawes Castle, positioned on each side of Carrick Roads and able to provide overlapping fire across the water. John Killigrew, a prominent member of the local Cornish gentry, probably oversaw the construction of Pendennis; it was built on his land and he was appointed as its first captain. Pendennis Castle cost £5,614 to construct.|$|E
