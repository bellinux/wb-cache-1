5|$|Players can use {{a variety}} of methods to {{approach}} missions. For instance, players can utilize stealth to evade enemies and complete objectives without being noticed, or they also have the option to assault enemies with firearms and vehicles. The player-character is equipped with <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> <b>camera,</b> which allows him to mark and highlight all visible enemies, animals, and loots. Players are also able to ride on elephants, which serve as tank-like offensive weapons. Players can throw bait towards enemies, which attracts nearby wildlife that is hostile to both the player and enemies. Players can also hunt and skin animals.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, <b>a</b> number of <b>digital</b> {{forensic}} techniques {{have been developed}} to authenticate digital signals. One important set of forensic techniques operates by estimating signal processing com-ponents of <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> <b>camera’s</b> signal processing pipeline, then using these estimates to perform forensic tasks such as camera identifica-tion or forgery detection. However, because these techniques are capable of estimating a camera’s internal signal processing compo-nents, these forensic techniques can be used for reverse engineer-ing. In this paper, we propose integrating an anti-forensic module into <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> <b>camera’s</b> processing pipeline to protect against foren-sic reverse engineering. Our proposed technique operates by remov-ing linear dependencies amongst an output images interpolated color values and by disrupting the color sampling grid. Experimental re-sults show that our proposed technique can be effectively used to protect against the forensic reverse engineering of key components of <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> <b>camera’s</b> processing pipeline...|$|R

25|$|On {{photographs}} taken using <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> <b>camera,</b> very small highlights may frequently {{appear to have}} chromatic aberration where in fact the effect is because the highlight image {{is too small to}} stimulate all three color pixels, and so is recorded with an incorrect color.

25|$|Under {{the right}} side of the {{instrument}} panel is an ITT Cannon D-subminiature plug providing RS-232 serial communication, into which a computer can be plugged into to download engine monitoring information. The software to run this is included on a CD-ROM that comes with the plane. This has been upgraded to an EDI card (engine Data Information). This card is a memory card much like in <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> <b>camera,</b> and records all engine data from 0 hours, until the 2000 hour TBO and can be read with a card reader to diagnose problems and observe flight characteristics in real time.|$|E

A study in 2012 found that, in this random-access use, some Class 2 cards achieved a write speed of 1.38MB/s, while all cards tested of Class 6 or greater (and some of lower Classes; lower Class does not necessarily mean better small-file performance), including those from major manufacturers, were over 100 times slower. In 2014, a blogger measured a 300-fold performance difference on small writes; this time, the best card in this category was a class 4 card.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton's Coppley Apparel Group {{is doing}} {{something}} rare in the Canadian clothing industry - adding jobs. The company plans to expand its employment by almost 200 jobs - about 30 per cent - starting with 50 additional jobs this year in 2007. Coppley's growth burst will bring its workforce to about 750 people, {{the majority of them}} in Hamilton. The new jobs follow exploding sales growth as the company uses computer-aided custom tailoring of suits that give struggling retailers a much-needed cash-flow boost. Coppley, which has been a fixture in downtown Hamilton for more than 150 years, pioneered a method of using a computer, a grid and <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> <b>camera</b> to do the work of a master tailor, producing made-to-measure suits in as few as seven days - work that used to take six weeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{content of}} photos tends to {{outweigh}} their quality {{when it comes}} to news value. On February 18, 2004, The New York Times published on their front page a photo of AT CEO John Zeglis which was taken with a camera phone. Content remains the most important element of photojournalism, but the ability to extend deadlines with rapid gathering and editing of images has brought significant changes. As recently as 15 years ago, nearly 30 minutes were needed to scan and transmit a single color photograph from a remote location to a news office for printing. Now, equipped with <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> <b>camera,</b> a mobile phone and a laptop computer, a photojournalist can send a high-quality image in minutes, even seconds after an event occurs. Camera phones and portable satellite links increasingly allow for the mobile transmission of images from almost any point on the earth.|$|E
25|$|It {{refers to}} {{determining}} the opinions or sentiments expressed on different features or aspects of entities, e.g., {{of a cell}} phone, <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> <b>camera,</b> or a bank. A feature or aspect is an attribute or component of an entity, e.g., the screen of a cell phone, the service for a restaurant, or the picture quality of a camera. The advantage of feature-based sentiment analysis is the possibility to capture nuances about objects of interest. Different features can generate different sentiment responses, for example a hotel can have a convenient location, but mediocre food. This problem involves several sub-problems, e.g., identifying relevant entities, extracting their features/aspects, and determining whether an opinion expressed on each feature/aspect is positive, negative or neutral. The automatic identification of features can be performed with syntactic methods, with topic modeling, or with deep learning. More detailed discussions about this level of sentiment analysis {{can be found in}} Liu's work.|$|E
