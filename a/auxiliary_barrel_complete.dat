Previous two-stage launchers have been limited in ultimate performance by incomplete barrel collapse behind the projectile. The cylindrical impact technique explosively collapses a steel tube concentric with and surrounding {{the barrel of the}} launcher. The impact of the tube on the barrel produces extremely high stresses which cause the barrel to collapse.

25|$|A much milder acid than tartaric and malic, {{lactic acid}} is often {{associated}} with “milky” flavors in wine and is the primary acid of yogurt and sauerkraut. It is produced during winemaking by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which includes three genera: Oenococcus, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus. These bacteria convert both sugar and malic acid into lactic acid, the latter through MLF. This process can be beneficial for some wines, adding complexity and softening the harshness of malic acidity, but it can generate off flavors and turbidity in others. Some strains of LAB can produce biogenic amines, such as histamine, tyramine and putrescine, which may be a cause of red wine headaches in some wine drinkers. Winemakers wishing to control or prevent MLF can use sulfur dioxide to stun the bacteria. Racking the wine quickly off its lees will also help control the bacteria, since lees are a vital food source for them. The winemakers must also be very careful of what wine barrels and winemaking equipment to which the wine is exposed, because of the bacteria's ability to deeply embed themselves within wood fibers. A wine <b>barrel</b> that has <b>completed</b> one successful malolactic fermentation will almost always induce MLF in every wine stored in it from then on.|$|R

40|$|HisH–hisF is a multidomain {{globular}} protein complex; hisH is a class I glutamine amidotransferase that hydrolyzes glutamine to form ammonia, and hisF is a (β/α) 8 <b>barrel</b> cyclase that <b>completes</b> the ring formation of imidizole glycerol phosphate synthase. Together, hisH and hisF form a glutamine amidotransferase that carries out the fifth {{step of the}} histidine biosynthetic pathway. Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that the (β/α) 8 barrel participates in a novel function: to channel ammonia from the active site of hisH to the active site of hisF. The present study presents a series of molecular dynamic simulations that investigate the channeling function of hisF. This article reconstructs potentials of mean force for the conduction of ammonia through the channel, and the entrance of ammonia through the strictly conserved channel gate, in both a closed and a hypothetical open conformation. The resulting energy landscape within the channel supports the idea that ammonia does indeed pass through the barrel, interacting with conserved hydrophilic residues along the way. The proposed open conformation, which involves an alternate rotamer state of one of the gate residues, presents only an ≈ 2. 5 -kcal energy barrier to ammonia entry. Another alternate open-gate conformation, which may play a role in non-nitrogen-fixing organisms, is deduced through bioinformatics...|$|R
40|$|Background:The loop {{colostomy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular techniques used as a protective maneuver for a distal anastomosis and/or temporary fecal diversion. We are introducing the use of a full thickness skin bridge under the large bowel instead of a glass rod which alleviates problems such as protrusion of the large bowel, retraction of the bowel into the abdomen after removing the rod and hindering proper application of a colostomy bag over the stoma. Methods:Seventeen patients needing double <b>barrel</b> colostomy for <b>complete</b> diversion of fecal material were selected using loop colostomy with skin bridge. Three patients had Fournier's gangrene and 14 had penetrating rectal injury. Omega loop colostomy with a full thickness skin bridge was performed for fecal diversion.  Results: All of the 17 patients had gas passing and full passage of fecal material within 3 days postoperatively. No case of skin necrosis and stitch abscess was encountered. No parastomal hernia or large prolapse was noted until healing was completed and patients were discharged and after at least 8 weeks and in Fournier's gangrene somewhat longer, the loop colostomy was closed without the need for formal laparotomy and without any case of anastomotic leak. Conclusion:In this study we confirmed that diverting loop colostomy using a skin bridge is a safe, rapid and easy to manage colostomy technique which gives complete diversion similar to double barrel colostomy without the need of performing a laparotomy for closure of the colostomy...|$|R
