40|$|Summary: A novel {{method of}} obtaining {{accurate}} home addresses from out-patients was introduced as a routine procedure in 6 chest clinics of Madras City, following highly satisfactory results under study conditions. In this method, the patient is given a card (the <b>Address</b> <b>card),</b> and asked to get his exact address entered on it by any knowledgeable person of his choice such as the landlord or a neighbour. An assessment of the system was undertaken after {{it had been in}} operation for about 8 months. A complete and legible address was available for 82 % of 3956 patients, the range in the 6 clinics being 74 % to 91 %. The main causes for failure were: not giving <b>Address</b> <b>card</b> to patient (7 %), patient not reattending the clinic (6 %), and patient reattending but not returning the <b>Address</b> <b>card</b> (3 %). Corrective measures have now been introduced, and a re-assessment will be undertaken in due course. In the tuberculosis programme in India, as in many other developing countries, the pro-cedure most commonly employed to retrieve patients who fail to attend the out-patient clinic on the due date is to post a reminde...|$|E

40|$|Non-technical summary This paper {{provides}} experimental {{tests of}} alternative methods to encourage response in surveys that interview the same persons or households repeatedly over time. Using the British Household Panel Survey for 2007 we carried out an experiment aimed at 1) testing different methods for {{getting people to}} respond although they move house (between-wave contact experiment) and 2) testing the effectiveness of tailoring the content of betweenwave respondent report mailings in order to stimulate interest, loyalty and cooperation (tailored material experiment). In particular, in the between-wave contact experiment three alternative strategies were compared: 1. asking all sample members to confirm their address details and providing a freepost Address Confirmation card 2. asking only those whose details have changed to inform us of their new address and providing a freepost Change of <b>Address</b> <b>card</b> 3. asking only those whose details have changed to inform us of the details an...|$|E
40|$|A {{system has}} been {{developed}} to identify, locate and-. evaluate learning materials for use-in an external degree program in management at Syracuse University.

These elements are: 1) a Vendcr. <b>Address</b> <b>Card</b> File; 2) a Vertical File of Current Catilogs, which identifies materials; 3) a McBee Keysort Card File, used to select materials by subject area; 4) the McBee Keysort Card File and Evaluation Forms, employed to recommend materials for acquisition; and 5) the Acquired Materials File and Materials Recommended fcr Purchase or Rental.

40|$|Improving {{global health}} and {{agricultural}} development {{have been identified}} as two of the most important objectives in fighting global poverty. However, the two approaches come at development from different perspectives and can actually undermine each other in practice. Successful management of the competing demands of health and agriculture through organizations and technologies is crucial to advancing sustainable development. The turn toward local procurement of agricultural products in the administration of global food aid is evidence of attempts to bring these approaches together at the global scale, but has not delivered the promised benefits at the local level. This article presents a case study of a small Kenyan community based organization (CBO), Community Action for Rural Development (CARD), as it has attempted to negotiate between nutrition and agricultural development in global and local networks.
