50|$|<b>Alphamethadol</b> (INN), or α-methadol, {{also known}} as alfametadol, is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. It is an isomer of dimepheptanol (methadol), the other being betamethadol (β-methadol). <b>Alphamethadol</b> is composed of two isomers itself, L-α-methadol, and D-α-methadol. The former compound, L-α-methadol, is an important active metabolite of levacetylmethadol (LAAM), an opioid substitute drug that is used clinically. Both of alphamethadol's isomers bind to and activate the μ-opioid receptor and are active as opioid analgesics, similarly to those of alphacetylmethadol (α-acetylmethadol).|$|E
50|$|Both in US Controlled Substances Act 1970 Schedule I, the two isomers {{both have}} annual {{manufacturing}} quotas of 2 grammes and the ACSCNs of 9605 for <b>alphamethadol</b> and 9609 for betamethadol.|$|E
50|$|Betamethadol (INN), or β-methadol, {{also known}} as betametadol, is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. It is an isomer of dimepheptanol (methadol), the other being <b>alphamethadol</b> (α-methadol). Betamethadol is composed of two isomers itself, L-β-methadol, and D-β-methadol. Based on structure-activity relationships it can be inferred that both isomers {{are likely to be}} active as opioid analgesics, similarly to those of betacetylmethadol (β-acetylmethadol).|$|E
50|$|<b>Alphamethadol</b> is {{considered}} a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2017). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.|$|E
50|$|Dimepheptanol is {{a mixture}} of two isomers, <b>alphamethadol</b> (α-methadol) and {{betamethadol}} (β-methadol). These are also available separately, and this drug has three separate entries in many national and international lists of illegal drugs, which refer to the racemic mixture dimepheptanol, and the two optical isomers. Each of these isomers is itself a mixture of two isomers, and so there are in fact four isomers of dimepheptanol in total; L-α-methadol, D-α-methadol, L-β-methadol and D-β-methadol.|$|E
