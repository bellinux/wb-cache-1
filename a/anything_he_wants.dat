5|$|When Tracy {{causes a}} stir {{at a public}} event, Jack assures him that as a movie star, he can do <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> except for dog fighting. Jack finds Tracy disobeying his order, but Tracy shouts that Jack is not his dad. Jack and Tracy meet with an NBC shrink, and Jack role-plays Tracy's father, Tracy, and Tracy's mom, among several other people from Tracy's childhood, {{conveying}} the message that even though Tracy's parents may have divorced, they still loved him. This comforts Tracy, and affirms that while he loves his family, they are crazy, {{and he needs to}} stay away from them. Tracy hugs Jack, and tells him that he is the only family he needs.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, the Evil Queen mourns {{the death}} of her husband, Snow White's father, {{although}} she herself is responsible for his death. Snow (Goodwin) and the Queen seemingly comfort each other over the loss. The Queen consults her magic mirror (Esposito) to ask how she can kill Snow, who is beloved by the people but a threat to her bid for the throne. She says that the king's knights will not kill his daughter, and the mirror tells her that she needs a huntsman. As Graham saw in his flashbacks, the Huntsman (Dornan) and his brother wolf seem to enjoy living a peaceful life in the woods. The Huntsman kills only for himself to live, and has no compassion for humans, who do not understand the wild. As the Huntsman and his wolf enter a tavern, the other patrons begin harassing him, prompting him to successfully defend himself. His performance is viewed in the magic mirror by the Queen, who is greatly impressed. She summons the Huntsman to offer him <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> on the condition that he brings her Snow's heart. He agrees to this deal, in return asking for the protection of all the wolves in the Enchanted Forest.|$|E
25|$|A {{free flow}} helmet {{supplies}} a continuous flow of {{air to the}} diver, and he breathes this as it flows past. Work of breathing is minimal, but flow rate must be high if the diver works hard, and this is noisy, affecting communications and requiring hearing protection to avoid damage to the ears. This type of helmet is popular where divers {{have to work hard}} in relatively shallow water for long periods. It is also useful when diving in contaminated environments, where the helmet is sealed onto a dry suit, and the entire system is kept at a slight positive pressure by adjusting the back-pressure of the exhaust valve, to ensure that there is no leakage into the helmet. This type of helmet is often large in volume, and as it is attached to the suit, it does not move with the head. The diver must move his body to face <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to see. For this reason the faceplate is large and there is often an upper window or side windows to improve the field of vision.|$|E
5000|$|In a Keyboard Magazine interview, Ray Charles {{was asked}} who his {{favorite}} pianist was. [...] "Art Tatum could play <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to," [...] Charles replied, [...] "...and Peter Nero also plays his buns off!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Allmine (portrayed by Bert Lloyd) - A man {{who took}} Daniel's clock {{claiming}} he owned it (along with <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> hence his name). He returned in several other episodes having reformed into a nicer character and running a museum of his collection.|$|R

25|$|When it is {{discovered}} that Richie Novak (Billy Miller), recent but former love interest of Babe, needs {{a bone marrow}} transplant, she goes {{on a mission to}} save his life. She secretly discovers that JR is the perfect bone marrow match for him. Aware that the two are enemies, she makes a deal with JR on February 19, 2008 after informing him that he is a bone marrow match for Richie. The deal {{comes in the form of}} strip poker. If Babe wins, JR will save Richie's life. If JR wins, Babe will give JR <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> regards to her. The two play the game at Babe's place, where Babe loses. Babe naked, and JR half naked, Babe grabs a robe just as JR surprises her by revealing that he already knew of his bone marrow status before she told him, and that he already planned to donate to Richie. He says he cannot let a man die without reason. Babe is touched by JR's words, and the two flirt. They soon embrace and make love, unaware that Richie has also just discovered that JR is a bone marrow match and has sent thugs to capture JR in order to take his bone marrow any way viable.|$|E
25|$|JR begins {{drinking}} {{again and}} slips into depression. He is, however, {{able to recover}} from the relapse and reconcile with Babe. Months later, he and Babe are closer again, and are more about raising their son together while not being romantically intertwined with each other. But during a snowday with Babe and Little Adam, JR suggests to Babe that she keep the idea of them as lovers open for consideration. Having enjoyed her recent time with JR, Babe accepts his request. Still perplexed by Richie, she talks with him at times, her concern more directed at {{the fact that he has}} leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. His sister, Annie, is thought to be the best candidate to be his donor, and Babe is determined to convince her to save him. But her efforts are revealed hopeless when test results show that Annie is not a good donor match for Richie after all. The revelation comes that someone else in Pine Valley is the perfect bone marrow match for Richie. With the help of her mother, Babe discovers that JR is the match. Feeling that he will not donate the bone marrow on his own due to his hate for Richie, she decides to entice JR during a runway where she wears a sexy red dress. Once she gets his attention, she propositions him with a game of strip poker. If she wins, he will have to save Richie's life. If JR wins, he can have <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> in regards to her. The deal is made, and JR and Babe play for the prize at Babe's home. Both half naked by the time the game nears an end, it is JR who wins. But he surprises Babe with the news that he already knew he was a match for Richie, and that he was already going to help him. Babe is intrigued by this new, softer side of JR, and JR mentions to Babe how they both want each other. They embrace, and the two make love.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Beckinsale {{starred in}} the legal thriller The Trials of Cate McCall {{opposite}} Nick Nolte and James Cromwell. The film received negative reviews and was released as a Lifetime movie. She next appeared in the little-seen psychological thriller Stonehearst Asylum, loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story. A lukewarm critical reception greeted the film upon its DVD release; Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times said Beckinsale was [...] "emoting as if an Oscar nomination depended on it" [...] while Dennis Harvey of Variety found her performance [...] "overwrought." [...] Also in 2014, she provided the voice for Queen Ayrenn, a character in The Elder Scrolls Online video game. In 2015, she {{starred in the}} psychological thriller The Face of an Angel alongside Daniel Brühl. The film, directed by Michael Winterbottom, {{was inspired by the}} case of Meredith Kercher. Jesse Hassenger of The A.V. Club felt her [...] "charismatic" [...] performance was wasted. Also that year, she starred alongside Simon Pegg in the poorly received British comedy Absolutely Anything, as an author agency employee and the love interest of a man (Pegg) chosen by four aliens to do <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants.</b> Tom Huddleston of Time Out said her character [...] "is never really developed—which is perhaps a blessing, because her cut-glass-posh performance is almost as grating as Pegg’s." ...|$|E
5000|$|Vatsal Sheth portrays Shaurya Goenka, {{the main}} male lead, a rich, womanizing heir of Goenka family. Being under the {{influence}} of his family, <b>he</b> can get <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> and is not used to hear the word [...] "no". He is the rapist of Payal and ex-fiance of Durga.|$|R

50|$|Another local {{story is}} that Sir Wolstan {{allegedly}} appointed his butler as headmaster of the Dixie Grammar School to prove to people that <b>he</b> could do <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to, and nobody could stop him. This story probably has its origin in well-documented conflicts between the 4th Baronet and the School.|$|R
500|$|Crookedstar's Promise was {{released}} on 5 July 2011. It {{takes place at the}} same time as Bluestar's Prophecy and details the life of Crookedstar, initially Stormkit. As a kit, Stormkit falls into the river after he sneaks out of camp and attempts to chase ThunderClan medicine cat Goosefeather away from Sunningrocks, a part of RiverClan territory (at the time). This leads him to break his jaw on a rock. [...] Rainflower, Stormkit's mother, rejects Stormkit due to his disfigured appearance and demands that RiverClan leader Hailstar perform a renaming ceremony to rename Stormkit to Crookedkit. Feeling rejected, Crookedkit is visited in a dream by Mapleshade, a Dark Forest cat who allows Crookedkit to believe that she is from StarClan. She tells him that she can give him <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> as long as he is faithful to his Clan and puts all other things aside. Crookedkit quickly accepts this promise, believing it not to be a difficult promise, as he was already loyal to his Clan, and believes that Mapleshade can help him become leader. Mapleshade then uses Crookedkit's promise to seemingly bring about the deaths of Crookedkit's loved ones. When Crookedjaw is chasing away a dog, the dog knocks his mother, Rainflower, into a river, and she hits her head on rocks. Mapleshade urges Crookedjaw to focus on the dog instead of bringing his mother to the medicine cat, and she dies. Crookedjaw then becomes deputy upon his father Shellheart's retirement; shortly after, Shellheart dies of a lump in his stomach. Not long after, Hailstar loses his last life while fighting rats in a barn: although Mapleshade urges him to not protect Hailstar so he can become leader, Crookedjaw ignores her, having discovered that she is actually from the Dark Forest. Nonetheless, Hailstar is killed. Despite his insistence that she stay away from him, Mapleshade continues to haunt Crookedstar: his mate, Willowbreeze, dies of a respiratory infection days after giving birth to his three kits, and two of the kits die as well. When Crookedstar confronts Mapleshade, she reveals that she had once been the mate of Crookedstar's great-grandfather. Mapleshade had been a ThunderClan cat, while her mate had been from RiverClan: Mapleshade is rejected by her Clan for taking a forbidden mate, then loses the kits in the river when she attempts to bring them to RiverClan. Her mate blames her for letting the kits drown in the river, and RiverClan, too, rejects Mapleshade. As a result, Mapleshade vows revenge on her mates descendants, one of whom is Crookedstar. When Crookedstar finally reveals his promise and his belief that it caused the deaths of his loved ones, to his medicine cat Brambleberry, she argues that the deaths were not in fact Mapleshade's fault. Following the conclusion of the novel, Oakheart is killed, then in the manga feature, Silverstream, Crookedstar's only remaining kit, dies after giving birth to Graystripe of ThunderClan's kits. Mapleshade asserts that these deaths were her doing as well, but Crookedstar tells Mapleshade that she has failed to punish him, as his loved ones live on in StarClan, while she has no one. Finally, Crookedstar dies as well. A sad ending, but it has to fit in with the rest of the series.|$|E

Afterwards, Homer, imitating Zorro, frightens Snake away by {{challenging}} him to a duel by slapping {{him with}} a glove when he insults Marge; he then uses his dueling glove to get <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> from people. When a gun-toting Southern colonel at the Kwik-E-Mart actually [...] "accepts" [...] Homer's challenge, Homer finds himself bound to a duel at dawn the following day.|$|E
2500|$|Skye McCole Bartusiak as Susan Martin [...] The younger {{daughter}} and child among Benjamin's seven children, {{she has a}} problem with speaking, which may be a post-traumatic reaction to the death of their mother; only later on does she finally open up. Her feelings towards her father change radically as the film progresses, and after Benjamin leaves from the furlough to rejoin his militia, in an extremely emotional scene, she seemingly forgives him and tells him she'll say <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to make him stay, to which Benjamin can only promise to return, which Susan accepts.|$|E

5000|$|Tank Tankuro (Tanku tankurō) is a 1934 manga {{written and}} drawn by Gajo Sakamoto.

2500|$|However, the {{occasional}} episode would deviate from this formula, usually {{ending with the}} demise of the character. In one notable case, [...] "The Tale of the Dark Music," [...] the unseen monster offers the lead character <b>anything</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> in exchange for humans as food (which could still be interpreted as a happy ending for the lead character). Another, more extreme example, is seen in [...] "The Tale of Vampire Town," [...] where the lead character, a goth character who is obsessed with vampires, abandons the dark clothing and such {{by the end of the}} episode, only to be turned into a vampire himself. Arguably the darkest example is found in [...] "The Tale of the Pinball Wizard," [...] where the protagonist finds himself trapped in a giant, lethal pinball game, and believes he must complete the game to escape. He is nearly killed several times, and after he barely manages to win, the game simply restarts. The story ends with the character realizing that he is doomed to repeat the game until it kills him, as a punishment from his boss for playing the pinball game on the job despite explicit order not to.|$|E
