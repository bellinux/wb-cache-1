5|$|Irwin {{developed}} and patented a football scoreboard, {{which was in}} use in the Ivy League by the 1890s. The large scoreboard featured a miniature representation of <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>field,</b> and the ball moved along the board to report each play. By 1915, Irwin's scoreboards were featured {{at each end of}} the field for the Army-Navy game at the Polo Grounds.|$|E

50|$|As a {{multi-purpose}} field, {{there are}} overlapping permanent markings for American football, football and lacrosse on Terry Fox Field. In order to accommodate Simon Fraser Clan's transition from CIS (playing Canadian football) to NCAA (playing American <b>football),</b> Terry Fox <b>Field</b> was re-turfed in 2011, with markings for <b>a</b> Canadian <b>football</b> <b>field</b> replaced with markings for <b>an</b> American <b>football</b> <b>field.</b>|$|R
5|$|When the Americans arrived, the British {{made every}} effort to include them in the athletics. Space was allotted on the sports fields to provide <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>field</b> and a {{baseball}} diamond. In short order, the division developed a baseball league that played 17 games during the summer of 1918. Texas won the division championship, but lost to a visiting team from American naval headquarters in London. Football games occurred throughout the fall.|$|E
5|$|The Mission {{site had}} been under study for {{conservation}} since 2002. The three main buildings on the site were eventually gazetted for conservation in 2006, and hence the site was inappropriate for acquisition. Although the appellant had argued that <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>field</b> on the Mission site should have been acquired instead of the temple property, the three main buildings were functionally integrated and acquisition of part of the Mission site {{would have resulted in}} a plot of state land that was highly irregular in shape. In any case, the appellant's argument did not relate to proper land use planning.|$|E

5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is an homage to Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, one subplot of which {{involves}} the corruption and downfall of a union leader during a strike. The body of the union president is seen buried under <b>a</b> <b>football</b> <b>field,</b> a homage to the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa and his alleged burial at New Jersey's Giants Stadium. Mr. Burns' outfit in the flashback to his childhood is based on Buster Brown. Homer's imagination of a life of organized crime is based on Don Fanucci's first appearance in The Godfather Part II, accepting donuts rather than a necklace and an orange.|$|E

A goal cannot be scored from a stroke-in or goal throw, but unlike football, a goal cannot be scored directly from a stroke-off or corner stroke. All free strokes are “direct” and allow a goal to be scored without another player touching the ball.|$|E
