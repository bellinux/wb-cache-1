40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{integrated}} modelling framework that links management action to supply chain processes and then to competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach - Using survey responses about supply chain management in the Australian beef processing industry, regression analysis was used to develop a model simultaneously explaining the links from management action to supply chain processes and on to competitive advantage. Findings - A relatively simple regression model was established that should be widely applicable in <b>agri-food</b> processing <b>industries.</b> In the context of our example industry, the results suggest that there is a strong link from some supply chain practices to competitive advantage, with trust and information quality being important drivers of the process. Research limitations/implications - Being based on a survey approach, a limitation is that that the results show managers&# 039; perceived influences on supply chain performance, not the influences observed by the researchers. Practical implications - The regression method provides an easy way of summarising the links between supply chain practices and competitive advantage. This method may be generally applicable across <b>agri-food</b> <b>industries,</b> particularly those with many small and medium-size food enterprises. Originality/value - This research provides a new method of integrating various aspects of supply chain management and competitive advantage. The method has the great advantage of parsimony...|$|R

Due to the limited theoretical treatment of agri-food niche marketing strategy, the paper will apply marketing concepts from the general management literature (e. g., Porter; Linneman and Stanton) to <b>agri-food</b> <b>industries.</b> The first objective of the paper is to introduce the three elements of niche marketing strategies and show how these elements can be used to form a strategy identification matrix. The matrix is intended to be used by agribusiness decision makers to assist in the development of niche marketing strategies. The second objective is to provide examples of successful niche marketing strategies that have appeared in the literature related to agricultural markets. More than forty such examples have been identified and collected. These case studies will be analyzed, and their relationship to the niche strategy matrix will be examined. Marketing,...|$|R

5000|$|Tackling {{class and}} racial inequalities in the <b>agri-foods</b> <b>industry.</b> There {{is a form}} of {{structural}} racism in the United States, as one study found “there were 30% fewer supermarkets in low-income areas than in higher-income areas, and these low-income areas had 55% less grocery store square footage than their wealthier income counterparts. The study also found that the levels of unmet food demand in these communities were as high as 70%”. [...] Without an accessible availability of cheap, healthy foods, low-income communities show high levels of diabetes and heart problems. Food First attempts to counter this structural racism by providing information and analysis, helping spread awareness and debate, and by helping create a national coalition of urban communities of color for food security. By studying international economic development and U.S. inequalities and development, Food First is taking a holistic approach that aims to change the way that we view the relationship between access to food and economic development.|$|R

40|$|The Nova Scotian <b>agri-food</b> <b>industry</b> {{has been}} declining in {{relative}} economic significance in recent years. Commodity-based agri-food production in the province is not generally competitive due to the economics of size, market power, and high input costs. There are many less obvious benefits and costs associated with agri-food production beyond direct economic impacts. These benefits and costs are not taken into consideration by the traditional market. As a result, there is no incentive for producers to increase beneficial agri-food practices or to decrease harmful practices.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the intra-industry nature of agri-food trade between Hungary and the European Union, following the Association Agreement signed in 1991. A slight growth in intra-industry trade (IIT) is indicated by the Grubel-Lloyd index. However, it is not uniform by product group or EU member state or over time, reflecting different patterns of bilateral integration and an economic restructuring process that is far from complete. Marginal IIT appears to be low, but assumes greater significance when the index is broadened to include vertical as well as horizontal IIT. Accordingly, the structure of the change in agri-food trade between Hungary and the EU during the period is shown to be predominantly either intra 9 ̆ 6 industry of a vertical nature or inter-industry. Both are believed to incur adjustment costs that are higher than with horizontal IIT, but the dominance of vertical IIT suggests that the <b>agri-food</b> <b>industries</b> of Hungary and the EU may be developing in a complementary manner, involving somewhat lower adjustment costs than may have been feared...|$|R

Finally, the paper submits empirical evidence from an exploratory case study in the <b>agri-food</b> <b>industry,</b> at the grower-processor interface, and information regarding the way the concept is actually applied in small medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is presented. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employed case study research by conducting in-depth interviews in the two companies. Findings - Supply chain collaboration concept is of significant importance for the <b>agri-food</b> <b>industry</b> however, some constraints arise due to the nature of industry's products, and the specific structure of the sector. Subsequently, collaboration in the supply chain is often limited to operational issues and to logistics-related activities.
