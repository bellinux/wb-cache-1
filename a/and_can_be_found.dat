Actor Alfred Molina was approached to portray Capone, but Molina was forced to turn the role down due to scheduling conflicts with Frida (2002).|$|E
5|$|During {{the day the}} crossback stingaree {{is usually}} {{inactive}} <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> partially or completely buried in sand on the sea floor.

5|$|The Australian ringneck {{is active}} {{during the day}} <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in {{eucalypt}} woodlands and eucalypt-lined watercourses. The species is gregarious and depending on the conditions can be resident or nomadic. In trials of growing hybrid eucalypt trees in dry environments parrots, especially the Port Lincoln parrot, caused severe damage to the crowns of the younger trees during the research period between 2000–3.|$|E
5|$|The {{reintroduction}} effort off the Oregon coast was not successful. However, reintroductions in 1969 and 1970 off the Washington coast {{were very}} successful and sea otters have been expanding their range since. They have now entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> almost as far east as Pillar Point. Individuals {{have even been}} seen in the San Juan Islands and northern Puget Sound.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{interest}} in Gebelien {{started in the}} early 18th century and was included in Benoît de Maillet's Description de l'Egypte. The site includes the remains from a temple to the deity Hathor {{with a number of}} cartouches on mud bricks and a royal stela from the 2nd Dynasty and 3rd Dynasty. Later period finds include 400 Demotic and Greek ostraca from a 2nd–1st century BC mercenary garrison.

The full book with the actor's handwritten notations has been digitized. The other promptbook is also for Richard III, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in the Harvard Theatre Collection.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{position}} more than 2,000 {{miles from the}} nearest continental landmass, the island of Hawaii {{is one of the most}} geographically isolated landmasses on Earth; this in turn has strongly influenced its ecology. The majority of the species present on the island are endemic to it <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> nowhere else on Earth, the result of an isolated evolutionary lineage sheltered from external biotic influence; this makes its ecosystem vulnerable both to invasive species and human development, and an estimated third of the island's natural flora and fauna has already gone extinct.|$|E

5|$|Catherine {{was buried}} {{according}} to her wishes, but her tombstone was moved from the floor to a wall of Ara Coeli during works on {{the interior of the}} church in 1590. The original epitaph was destroyed at that time, but the Roman calligrapher Giovanni Battista Palatino had recorded it in 1545 and published two years later. It was uniquely bilingual and digraphic, written both in Latin language and script and in Bosnian language and Cyrillic. Only the Latin epitaph was restored, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> on her tombstone today.|$|E
5|$|Cookie {{cutting and}} decorating reached its {{cultural}} zenith during the boomer years with Christmas cookie cutouts of reindeer, trees, stars, and bells providing sustenance {{for kids and}} dads.

Red plastic cutters replaced tin cutters {{during the war years}} when metal was scarce <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> today at garage sales and flea markets.|$|E
5|$|Crinipellis zonata is saprobic, {{living on}} the debris or roots of hardwoods; it {{contains}} wood-decaying enzymes that can break down the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene. The mushrooms grow individually or in small clusters, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> between August and September. In North America, it is distributed east of the Rocky Mountains, and has been recorded as far west as Indiana and Texas. In Europe, it has been collected in Portugal.

5|$|Earwigs are {{abundant}} <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> throughout the Americas and Eurasia. The common earwig was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but {{tends to be}} more common in the southern and southwestern parts of the United States. The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed earwig (Doru aculeatum), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, other families can be found in North America, including Forficulidae (Doru and Forficula being found there), Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae.|$|E
5|$|Francium-223, {{the only}} {{naturally}} occurring isotope of francium, {{is the product}} of the alpha decay of actinium-227 <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in trace amounts in uranium minerals. In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1018 uranium atoms. It has been calculated that there is at most 30g of francium in the earth's crust at any time, due to its extremely short half-life of 22 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus in {{the wide}} sense, i.e. {{including}} probably several species, is found in Europe, the Black sea region in northeastern Turkey, and eastern and central North America east of Minnesota. It has been accidentally introduced into Australasia, where it is found under introduced and native trees. It is found {{on the floor in}} deciduous woodland, particularly under beech (Betula), <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> throughout summer and autumn and into early winter. It is relatively common, though not as common as the similar species L. vellereus. L. piperatus is found solitarily or in scattered groups. It is sometimes found growing together with Russula cyanoxantha.|$|E
