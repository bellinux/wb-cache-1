5|$|Arsenal used a {{total of}} 28 players during the 1996–97 season and there were 12 {{different}} goalscorers. There were also five squad members who {{did not make a}} first-team appearance in the campaign. Bould <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> featured in 40 matches – the most of any Arsenal player in the campaign; Winterburn started in all 38 league matches. Parlour made the most appearances as a substitute with 15.|$|E
5|$|Big Wapwallopen Creek {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{flooding}} in Rice Township <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> Township. It is also a primary flooding source in Conyngham Township, Dorrance Township, Fairview Township, Hollenback Township, and Nescopeck Township. However, in Conyngham Township, a 100 year flood of the creek would only inundate a small and undeveloped area.|$|E
5|$|Coxon and Laker came to {{the crease}} {{and put on a}} 41-run stand for the eighth wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Coxon hit a catch back to Johnson, ending his first Test innings for 19, and Laker was caught behind from the same bowler, having already been dropped twice in the slips. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 207/9 with Bedser on six <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> eight, having just avoided the follow on.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd toured {{extensively}} across America and Europe in 1970. In 1971, Pink Floyd took {{second place}} in a reader's poll, in Melody Maker, {{and for the first}} time were making a profit. Mason <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> became fathers and bought homes in London while Gilmour, still single, moved to a 19th-century farm in Essex. Waters installed a home recording studio at his house in Islington in a converted toolshed at the back of his garden.|$|E
5|$|As noon {{drew near}} with no sight of either Huger or Magruder, who were {{supposed}} to be manning the Confederate right flank, Lee replaced these two forces with the smaller units of Brig. Gens. Armistead <b>and</b> <b>Wright,</b> two of Huger's brigades that had reached the battlefield some time earlier. Huger and his other two brigades (under Brig. Gens. Ransom and Mahone) were still too far north of the scene. Despite the mishaps and disunity, Malvern Hill would be the first time during the Seven Days Battles that Lee managed to concentrate his force.|$|E
5|$|By September 1963, Waters and Mason {{had lost}} {{interest}} in their studies and moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic. Waters, Mason <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe. They usually called themselves Sigma6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths. Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played on any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided an occasional vocal accompaniment. In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom {{in the basement of}} Regent Street Polytechnic.|$|E

5|$|Following {{creative}} tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, {{followed by}} Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright rejoined {{them as a}} session musician and, later, a band member. The three produced two more albums—A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured through 1994. After nearly two decades of acrimony, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason reunited with Waters in 2005 to perform as Pink Floyd in London {{as part of the}} global awareness event Live 8; Gilmour and Waters later stated they had no plans to reunite as a band again. Barrett died in 2006, <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> in 2008. The final Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was recorded without Waters and based almost entirely on unreleased material.|$|E
5|$|For {{several years}} Pink Floyd had busied {{themselves}} with personal pursuits, such as filming and {{competing in the}} La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event. In January 1993, they began {{working on a new}} album, returning to Britannia Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> worked collaboratively, improvising material. After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to begin creating songs. Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where from February to May 1993, they worked on about 25 ideas.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd had stabilised with a line-up of Barrett, Waters, Mason <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> by mid-1965, {{and after}} {{frequent}} gigging that year became regulars on the underground live circuit in London. While Barrett was the dominant member, writing most material, singing most lead vocals and playing lead guitar, Wright played a supportive role, playing keyboards and singing, with occasional lead, and writing his own material. As {{the most qualified}} musician, Wright was responsible for tuning guitars, and would often tune Waters' bass for him in concert. Later on, he had a Strobotuner to tune guitars silently during gigs. In the band's early days, before acquiring a full-time road crew, Wright was responsible for unloading the gear {{at the end of}} each gig.|$|E

5|$|Roger Waters met Nick Mason {{while they}} were both {{studying}} architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street. They first played music together in a group formed by Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe with Noble's sister Sheilagh. Richard Wright, a fellow architecture student, joined later that year, and the group became a sextet named Sigma6. Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> rhythm guitar (since there was rarely an available keyboard). The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom {{in the basement of}} the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by the Searchers and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman.|$|E
5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E
5|$|The Green Bay Packers {{had seven}} {{different}} players each contribute a sack, and Randy Wright's 190 yards passing {{made him the}} second player in Packers history to throw for 3,000 yards in a season. The crowd cheered the news that an Indianapolis Colts win moved the Buccaneers into first place {{for the rights to}} the first overall draft pick, and pelted Buccaneer players with lemons. Ron Holmes's sack of Wright was the Buccaneers' first since Oct. 12, and Ivory Sully recorded the first blocked punt in Buccaneers (regular-season) history. Both teams went to their second-string quarterbacks in the second half, but Steve Young returned to the game after Steve DeBerg suffered a concussion, <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> was reinserted after the Buccaneers threatened to start a comeback.|$|E

5|$|The University of Dayton <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> State University both host NCAA {{basketball}}. The University of Dayton Arena {{has hosted}} more {{games in the}} NCAA men's basketball tournament over its history than any other venue. UD Arena is also {{the site of the}} First Round games of the NCAA Tournament. In 2012, eight teams competed for the final four spots in the NCAA Basketball Tournament. Wright State University's NCAA men's basketball is the Wright State Raiders and the University of Dayton's NCAA men's basketball team is the Dayton Flyers.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to tour {{in support of}} the album was made before it was even complete. Early rehearsals were chaotic; Mason <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> were completely out of practice, and realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge. Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters, and threatened to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs (Mason, separated from his wife, used his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral). Some promoters were offended by Waters' threat, and several months later 60,000 tickets went on sale in Toronto, selling out within hours.|$|E
5|$|Wright did not {{consider}} the fellowship a formal school, instead viewing it as a benevolent educational institution. He also worked to ensure G.I. Bill eligibility for returning World War II veterans. The town of Wyoming, Wisconsin <b>and</b> <b>Wright</b> became embroiled in a legal dispute over his claim of tax-exemption. A trial judge agreed with the town, stating that since apprentices did much of Wright's work, it was not solely a benevolent institution. Wright fought {{the case to the}} Wisconsin Supreme Court. When Wright lost the case there in 1954, he threatened to abandon the estate. However, he was persuaded to stay after some friends raised $800,000 to cover the back taxes at a benefit dinner.|$|E
