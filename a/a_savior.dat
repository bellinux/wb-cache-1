5|$|Gnostics read John but {{interpreted}} {{it differently}} from the way non-Gnostics did. Gnosticism taught that salvation came from gnosis, secret knowledge, and Gnostics did not see Jesus as <b>a</b> <b>savior</b> but a revealer of knowledge. Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.|$|E
5|$|Legends {{regarding}} Vithoba usually {{focus on}} his devotee Pundalik or on Vithoba's role as <b>a</b> <b>savior</b> to the poet-saints of the Varkari faith. As discussed in the devotional works section above, the Pundalik legend appears in the Sanskrit scriptures Skanda Purana and Padma Purana. It is also documented in Marathi texts: Panduranga-Mahatmya by a Brahmin called Sridhara; another work {{of the same name}} written by Prahlada Maharaj; and also in the abhangas of various poet-saints.|$|E

5|$|Educating the Disfranchised and Disinherited is a 1999 {{biography}} of American General Samuel Chapman Armstrong and his associated normal school for freedmen, Hampton Institute, written by Robert Francis Engs {{and published by}} the University of Tennessee Press. The first full {{biography of}} its kind, the book portrays Armstrong as a complex politician and administrator in the postbellum period who balanced the needs of opposed parties surrounding the Virginia school: its African American students, Southern white neighbors, and Northern philanthropist funders. Previous works presented Armstrong in a polarized fashion, as either <b>a</b> <b>savior</b> or handicap for freedmen. The book emphasizes Armstrong's upbringing as a missionary in Hawaii {{in the development of}} his educational philosophy.|$|E

5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} shows Deep Blue as a voice {{coming from}} a blue light, to whom Kisshu gives progress reports, and a shadowed version of his true form is seen when Quiche brings him some mew aqua in episode twenty-six. His death is changed in the anime to come {{at the hands of}} Mew Ichigo rather than Masaya, though Masaya aids her by taking over the body. To keep the true identity of Deep Blue a secret, his voice actor's name is shown only as a question mark until his identity is revealed in episode forty-nine; after which the credits are changed to list Megumi Ogata (who also voices Masaya and the Blue Knight). Deep Blue {{is one of the few}} characters whose name remains unchanged in the Mew Mew Power dub. The anime slightly modified his role from that of <b>a</b> <b>savior</b> for the aliens to a destructive force that wants to do nothing but destroy the Earth which causes the aliens to turn against him.|$|E

25|$|During the pre-earth life, God the Father {{presented}} {{a plan to}} have <b>a</b> <b>Savior</b> {{make it possible for}} mankind to be saved. The purpose of an earth life was to give men the opportunity to demonstrate obedience to the commandments of God while outside of his presence. This is the central test of the evolution or eternal progression of man to godhood. Jesus Christ stepped forward as the chosen Savior. However, Lucifer, one of the spirits, proposed a rival plan whereby every soul would be saved, he would receive God's glory, and human agency would be eliminated. When God rejected that plan, the War in Heaven ensued, resulting in Lucifer and one-third part of the spirits being cast out and denied ever receiving physical bodies. Lucifer became Satan, or the devil.|$|E
25|$|The Luke and Matthew {{accounts}} {{of the birth of}} Jesus have a number of points in common; both have Jesus being born in Bethlehem, in Judea, to a virgin mother. In the Luke account Joseph and Mary travel from their home in Nazareth for the census to Bethlehem, where Jesus is born and laid in a manger. Angels proclaim him <b>a</b> <b>savior</b> for all people, and shepherds come to adore him; the family then returns to Nazareth. In Matthew, The Magi follow a star to Bethlehem, where the family are living, to bring gifts to Jesus, born the King of the Jews. King Herod massacres all males under two years old in Bethlehem in order to kill Jesus, but Jesus's family flees to Egypt and later settles in Nazareth. Over the centuries, biblical scholars have attempted to reconcile these contradictions, while modern scholarship mostly views them as legendary. Generally, they consider the issue of historicity as secondary, given that gospels were primarily written as theological documents rather than chronological timelines.|$|E
25|$|While lost in thought, {{he notices}} a parade {{in the street}} and falls in with it. He notices that Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus' disciples, is leading the parade, and many of the temple priests and Roman {{soldiers}} are marching together. They go to the olive grove of Gethsemane, and he sees Jesus walking out to meet the crowd. Understanding the betrayal, Ben-Hur is spotted by a priest who tries to take him into custody; he breaks away and flees. When morning comes, Ben-Hur learns that the Jewish priests have tried Jesus before Pilate. Although originally acquitted, Jesus has been sentenced to crucifixion at the crowd's demand. Ben-Hur is shocked at how his supporters have deserted Christ in his time of need. They head to Calvary, and Ben-Hur resigns himself to watch the crucifixion of Jesus. The sky darkens. Ben-Hur offers Jesus wine vinegar to return Jesus' favor to him, and soon after that Jesus utters his last cry. Judah and his friends commit their lives to Jesus, realizing He was not an earthly king, but a heavenly King and <b>a</b> <b>Savior</b> of mankind.|$|E
