500|$|Another myth {{concerns}} Saul Bass, {{the graphic}} designer who created {{many of the}} title sequences of Hitchcock's films and storyboarded some of Psychos scenes, claiming he had directed the shower scene. This was refuted by several figures associated with the film, including Leigh, who stated: [...] "absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I've ever given. I've said it to his face in front of other people... I was in that shower for seven days, and, believe me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera {{for every one of}} those seventy-odd shots." [...] Hilton A. Green, the assistant director, also refutes Bass' claim: [...] "There is not a shot in that movie that I didn't roll the camera for. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you I never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass." [...] Roger Ebert, a longtime admirer of Hitchcock's work, summarily dismissed the rumor, stating, [...] "It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock's would let someone else direct such a scene." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jofre's second Panorama {{programme}} on paroxetine, [...] "Emails {{from the}} edge" [...] (11 May 2003) {{focused on the}} 67,000 calls and 1,400 e-mails the BBC received, after the first programme, from people taking the drug. They reported withdrawal symptoms, as well as acts of violence and self-harm that they believed were attributable to paroxetine. During this programme, Benbow told Jofre: [...] "We have been asked by the regulatory authorities to provide all our information related to suicides <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you the data that we provide to them clearly shows no link between Seroxat and {{an increased risk of}} suicide—no link." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2007, Plame {{addressed}} the question while testifying before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: [...] "I did not recommend him. I did not suggest him. There was no nepotism involved. I {{did not have}} the authority.... It's been borne out in the testimony during the Libby trial, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you that it just doesn't square with the facts." [...] She described that in February 2002, while discussing an inquiry from the office of Vice President Cheney about the alleged Iraqi uranium purchases, a colleague who knew of her husband's diplomatic background and previous work with the CIA suggested sending him, and that she agreed to facilitate the discussion between her husband and her superiors despite her own ambivalence about the idea.|$|E
2500|$|Essentially, the key {{components}} to Parker's pedal setup is a Holy Grail reverb into a Blues Driver into a Carbon Copy delay into a Dyna Comp into a Small Stone phaser into a Fuzz Face {{and then into}} a Diamond Vibrato (vibrato added during Lonerism-era). The reverb into a fuzz and phasers set to a slow rate are the hallmarks of Parker's guitar sound, which has influenced many modern psychedelic rock bands to have a similar setup, which Parker says [...] "it’s the most flattering {{thing in the world}} to hear a band ripping you off. I know some people get pissed off by it, but if I ever hear an artist <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> they’re using a phaser pedal the way I do, it’s a massive compliment. It makes you feel like you’re making an impression, having an impact on people, which is really humbling, flattering".|$|E
