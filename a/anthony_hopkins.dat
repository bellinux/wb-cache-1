5000|$|Divide and Rule {{is divided}} into seven chapters, each dealing with a {{different}} part of Africa. They are arranged chronology, starting with the occupation of Tunisia and Egypt, 1881-1882, and ending with the partition of Morocco 1905-1912. Wesseling primarily pays attention to the empire builders rather than to their subjects: 'the decisions and reflections of Europeans take the central place in this book' (p, 18). The author explains the partition of Africa in terms of a complex, multi-faceted causality. As for the wider impact of European colonization on Africa, Wesseling differs from earlier authors such as Allan McPhee (The Economic Revolution in British West Africa repr. 1971, with a preface by <b>Anthony</b> G. <b>Hopkins,</b> a leading economic historian). As Wesseling sees it, 'in the economic and social fields, colonisation did not create anything essentially new, but merely occasioned an acceleration of a social and economic modernisation process which had already begun' (p. 460) [...] It is an interpretation with which Gann strongly disagrees, but which is shared by such major African historians as J.E.A. Ajayi, who stresses the episodic character of European colonialism in African history. By contrast, Wesseling stresses the political impact of western conquest on Africa: 'the partition of Africa entailed for the existing African states the loss of their sovereignty.' Africans regained their sovereignty as a result of decolonization, but it was not the pre-colonial kingdoms and commonwealths that were restored - the new African rulers took over, for the most part, the frontiers created by the western conquerors.|$|R
5|$|Between 1979 and 1982, Merrick's {{life story}} {{became the basis}} of several works of {{dramatic}} art; these {{were based on the}} accounts of Treves and Montagu.

The character based on Merrick was played by Philip Anglim, and later by David Bowie and Mark Hamill. In 1980, a film The Elephant Man, directed by David Lynch, was released; it received eight Academy Award nominations. Merrick was played by John Hurt and Frederick Treves by <b>Anthony</b> <b>Hopkins.</b> In 1982, US television network ABC broadcast an adaptation of Pomerance's play, starring Anglim.|$|E

Despite negativity from critics, the film earned $83.5 million worldwide.

5|$|Despite {{the legal}} action, {{pre-production}} towards Bond 17 still progressed, with some early details unveiled at the Cannes Film Festival {{which took place}} in May 1990. However, delays occurred because of the ongoing legal action with MGM/UA and, in an August 1993 interview, Dalton revealed that Michael France was involved in writing a script for the next Bond film, with <b>Anthony</b> <b>Hopkins</b> as a potential villain, adding that Hopkins had been in discussions with Eon for a number of weeks.

5|$|Drama in {{the early}} 20th century thrived, but the country failed to produce a Welsh National Theatre company.
