40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparison}} between the Mexico City Convention and the Rome Convention concerning the Conventions’ scope of application, how the applicable law to a contract is determined, and how the applicable law is affected by mandatory rules and public policy. The two Conventions deal {{with the question of}} which country’s law is to apply to a contract with international connections. The Conventions do in several situations lead to the same outcome <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> the <b>applicable</b> law is concerned. The reason for this is partly that the Mexico City Convention is based on the Rome Convention. However, there are also differences. One difference between the Conventions is the structure used. The wording of the Rome Convention is more detailed than the wording used in the Mexico City Convention. Another difference that exists concerns the characteristic performance test which is not used in the Mexico City Convention. Moreover, the Mexico City Convention is the more recent one of them, something that is notable in certain provisions since another and more modern approach is chosen.

40|$|Being of {{importance}} for turbulent and thermal mixing and consequently for thermal striping and thermal fatigue problems in nuclear power plants, the turbulent isothermal and thermal mixing phenomena have been investigated in two different testcase scenarios. First testcase scenario as proposed by ETHZ, Prasser et al. [18] comprises of turbulent mixing of two water streams of equal temperature in a T-junction of 50 mm pipes in the horizontal plane and thereby excluding any buoyancy effects. The second testcase {{is based on the}} Vattenfall test facility in the Älvkarleby laboratory and has been proposed by Westin et al. [16], where water of 15 K temperature difference mixes in a T-junction in vertical plane, provoking thermal striping phenomena. ANSYS CFX 11. 0 with Reynolds averaging based (U) RANS turbulence models (SST, BSL RSM) as well as with scale-resolving SAS-SST turbulence model has been applied to both test cases. The CFD simulations have been carried out in accordance with Best Practice Guidelines <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> they were <b>applicable.</b> Results have been compared to wire-mesh sensor, LDV and thermocouple measurements. While the turbulent mixing in the ETHZ testcase could be reproduced in good quantitative agreement with data, the results of the LES-like simulations were not yet fully satisfying in terms of the obtained accuracy in comparison to the detailed measurement data, also the transient thermal striping phenomena and large-scale turbulence structure development was well reproduced in the simulations...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the global}} {{financial}} crises, Australia has experienced continuous high-speed growth in housing prices in recent years. Its housing market can be separated into two major segments: single-detached houses and medium-density apartments. This study seeks to examine the price trends of these two segments and explain their differential movements. Based on the Real Estate Institute Victoria (REIV) member agencies survey since the early 1990 s, we found that house prices grew faster than apartment prices in Melbourne. In particular, the price gap between houses and apartments was much larger in central Melbourne than in the outer areas. To explain this, we borrow Clapp et al. 's (2012) real option idea and postulate that the gap reflects the redevelopment potential of the houses. We verify this by testing if the gap is smaller for suburbs with stronger redevelopment restrictions (e. g. due to zoning constraints). <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>applicable,</b> other factors such as socio-economic characteristics are also considered. While this study contributes {{to a better understanding}} of differential housing price movements, we are aware that the test is delimited by the use of median price indices, which may not hold quality constant.

40|$|Delirium is a neurobehavioural {{disturbance}} {{that frequently}} develops {{particularly in the}} intensive care unit (ICU) population. It was first described more than half a century ago, where it was already discovered as a state that might come along with serious complications such as prolonged ICU and hospital stay, reduced quality of life and increased mortality. However, in most cases, there is still lack of proof for causal relationship. Its presence frequently remains unrecognised due to suggested predominance of the hypoactive form. Furthermore, in the general ICU population, it has been shown that the duration of delirium is associated with worse long-term cognitive function. Due to the multifactorial origin of delirium, we have several but no incontestable treatment options. Nonetheless, delirium bears a high burden for patient, family members and the medical care team. The Basel ProDex Study targets improvement of hyperactive and mixed delirium therapy in critically ill patients. We will focus on reducing the duration and severity of delirium by implementing dexmedetomidine into the treatment plan. Dexmedetomidine compared with other sedatives shows fewer side effects representing a better risk profile for delirium treatment in general. This could further contribute to higher patient safety. The aim of the BaProDex Trial is to assess the superiority of dexmedetomidine to propofol for treatment of hyperactive and mixed delirium in the ICU. We hypothesise that dexmedetomidine, compared with propofol administered at night, shortens both the duration and severity of delirium.; The Basel ProDex Study is an investigator-initiated, one-institutional, two-centre randomised controlled clinical trial for the treatment of delirium with dexmedetomidine versus propofol in 316 critically ill patients suffering from hyperactive and mixed delirium. The primary outcome measure is delirium duration in hours. Secondary outcomes include delirium-free days at day 28, death at day 28, delirium severity, amount of ventilator days, amount of rescue sedation with haloperidol, length of ICU and hospital stay, and pharmaceutical economic analysis of the treatments. Sample size was estimated to be able to show the superiority of dexmedetomidine compared with propofol regarding the duration of delirium in hours. The trial will be externally monitored according to good clinical practice (GCP) requirements. There are no interim analyses planned for this trial.; This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization- Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) or Europäische Norm International Organization for Standardization (ISO EN 14155; <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>applicable)</b> as well as all national legal and regulatory requirements. Only the study team will have access to trial specific data. Anonymisation will be achieved by a unique patient identification code.

40|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} Grass has changed drastically {{over the last}} decade. Up to the mid-sixties, judgments like 'immoral' and 'obscene' were the norm in assessments of Grass's work. Reviews after 1965, however, emphasised the ethical content of Grass's literary output. This volte-face retrospectively also changed attitudes to Die Blechtrommel and Hunde-jahre. The impulse to reinterpret Grass in this new light came from the writer's extra-literary activities. This study attempts to demonstrate that Grass's political commitment {{is rooted in the}} work itself. It explores by textual analysis how this ethical awareness is condensed in Grass's imagery. A close investigation of the choice and use of imagery reveals that commitment in his works is by no means static. The theoretical framework of the study is Sartre's definition of littirature engagle, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> it is <b>applicable</b> to the work of Grass. The first chapter concludes {{that it is necessary to}} distinguish between 'implicit' and 'explicit' commitment, between Engagement and Tendenz. The second chapter examines the relationship between politics and literature in Grass's extra-literary work, that is his political essays on the one hand and his essays on literature on the other,contrasting Grass's practice of commitment with Sartre's theory. Chapter three focuses on the role of the drum in Die Blechtrommel, establishing its moral premises with particular reference to its relationship to politics, religion, love and art. The themes of politics and religion are followed up in chapter four, from which it emerges that Grass has intensified his commitment by limiting it to more tangible aspects of society. In chapter five Hundejahre is discussed as the last novel of a trilogy, The metamorphosis of the scarecrow and dog images is scrutinised, together with their cultural extensions in the figures of Weininger and Heidegger, and it is argued that the novel exhibits the first traces of Tendenz in its functional use of imagery. Die Plebejer proben den Aufstand is considered in chapter six as the turning point in Grass's oeuvre. The interpretation tries to show that, although deeply ambiguous, in the final analysis the tragedy is a literary equivalent of Grass's political position. This ambiguity and depth is lacking in ortlich betaubt and chapter seven posits that the novel is not so much an equivalent but more a literary version of Grass's election speeches. The final chapter reviews the political imagery in the whole of Grass's work, and interprets the titles as guidelines to Grass's evolution from Engagement to Tendenz. <p...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} twenty fragments {{that belonged}} to an antiphonary written between 1100 - 1220 and analyses musical aspects of their content. The codicological and palaeographical analysis confirms that the fragments {{belong to the same}} antiphonary. Circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly points to the Benedictine abbey of St Paul in Utrecht as place of their origin. The musicological analysis addresses the following questions: 1. 	Is it possible to distinguish common recurrent melodic and graphical characteristics of the plainchant of the Office as notated in the fragments and in NL-Uu U 406 (an antiphonary the chapter of St Mary, Utrecht, written between 1120 and 1150 according to my analysis) ? 2. 	Comparing these characteristics with other contemporary antiphonaries, is it possible to detect a ‘Utrecht style’? As to the first question, the sources appear to be highly similar. The texts that occur in both sources are identical except for a few minor differences. On a general level, the analysis confirms previous observations by De Loos that the diastematic neumes (with neumes on a staff) of both sources belong to the Utrecht-Trier-Stavelot family. The fragments seem to be the oldest known diastematic representatives of this family. One of the characteristics of the Utrecht-Stavelot-Trier notation is the precise registration of microtonal intervals, as described by Ike de Loos and by Manuel Pedro Ferreira. I present and evaluate the discourse about the existence of microtonal intervals in pre-Guidonian times in extenso. The affirmation of their existence is the basis for further analysis in the present study. Supposing the occurrence of microtonal intervals, the fragments, like the other manuscripts belonging to the Utrecht-Stavelot-Trier family, perhaps can be interpreted as remaining traces of a clash between a pre-Guidonian performance culture and a diastematic notation based upon a diatonic framework. For answering the second question, I refer to Apel’s categorisation of musical style elements <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>applicable</b> in this context: liturgical category, genre, form, tonality and notation. For the methodology of the comparison I draw on Kate Helsen’s PhD dissertation (Regensburg University, 2008). Helsen analyses the formulaic structure of the great responsories of Matins (responsoria prolixa). I compare eight great responsories that occur in both Utrecht sources on the one hand with the same responsories in the manuscript F-Pn lat. 12044, an early twelfth-century antiphonary with diastematic notation written in the Benedictine abbey of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France) on the other hand. The outcome confirms that the musical and notational relations between both Utrecht sources are very strong, much stronger than their relation with F-Pn lat. 12044. If a Utrecht style existed, the notation of microtonal intervals is a clearly distinct trait, as the notation in F-Pn lat. 12044 does not apply special neumes for microtonal intervals (which {{does not necessarily mean that}} those intervals were not sung). De Loos’s conclusion for the manuscripts of the Utrecht-Stavelot-Trier group is that the microtonal intervals were applied as ‘colouring elements’, ornamentation, without a structural function, which would assume a fixed step in the modal system. Based upon a small sample, my interpretation is different. It seems that the neumes, representing microtonal intervals predominantly occur at the end of phrases. In other words, the position of a microtonal interval rather than the modal system as assumed by De Loos seems to be the structuring element. Its function than is to be interpreted as mnemonic in a formulaic musical context...|$|E
