40|$|A case of {{corrosive}} linear {{gastric ulcer}} on the antrum developing {{in the short}} axial direction caused by ingestion of domestic <b>acidic</b> <b>detergent</b> is reported. The patient was a 49 -year-old woman without any psychiatric diseases, but had been suffering from a depressive state since her father died in June of 1998. On June 19, 1999, she was admitted to Oyodo Municipal Hospital as an emergency because she had ingested about 50 ml of a domestic <b>acidic</b> <b>detergent</b> with the intention to commit suicide. Gastrointestinal fiberscopy(GIF) on admission revealed severe erosions in the entire stomach but few abnormal findings in the esophagus. We initiated fasting therapy and intravenous high calory infusion therapy, and began to inject antibiotics and H 2 blockers. GIF on the 11 th day after admission showed severe redness from the lower part to the antrum of the stomach and a long linear ulcer on the short axis direction of the greater curve on the antrum, but no abnormal findings in the esophagus and the duodenum. GIF on the 18 th day after admission indicated improvement in the long linear ulcer on the antrum, and the patient was discharged on July 13...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this project}} was to {{optimize}} the clean-in-place program for a fluid bed dryer used after drying wet ferrous granules, with focus on shortening the total time used for the program. This clean-in-place program has two critical objectives; removing a hard to clean iron residue on the inside surface of the fluid bed dryer by using an <b>acidic</b> <b>detergent</b> and thereafter removing the <b>acidic</b> <b>detergent</b> by rinsing steps. Methods: The optimization was performed by down scaling the current clean-in-place program to laboratory scale, then varying the parameters volume and time by applying the statistical model Central Composite Circumscribe and use experimental design optimization to {{determine the influence of}} the parameters on the effect of cleanliness. Cleanliness in laboratory scale was assessed by visual inspection and UV/Vis spectroscopy. The cleanliness in production was determined by visual inspection, an iron test kit and a pH-meter. The results from the laboratory scale optimization lead to a new clean-in-place program that was evaluated twice in production after drying of ferrous batches. Results and conclusions: The hard to clean iron residue could be recreated in laboratory scale. The optimization in laboratory scale showed that the parameter water was the most significant parameter for removal of the iron residue. The new clean-in-place program evaluated in production was 40 % (approx. 110 min) shorter than the current clean-in-place program. The results of cleanliness varied after the new clean-in-place program had been used in production, not all hard to clean areas tested had approved results. Further optimization is needed to be able to clean after varying amount of granules in left in the fluid bed dryer after production ended. An interesting side results was that two steps dedicated to rinse out the detergent could be removed. This fact can lead to that even more rinsing steps can be excluded in the future clean-in-place programs...|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly <b>acidic</b> <b>detergents</b> such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{structure}} of the major plant polysacchanides contributing to dietary fiber, their organization within the plant cell wall, and {{the problems associated with}} their analysis are briefly reviewed. Alkaline, <b>acidic,</b> and <b>detergent</b> fractionation methods are described and considered in relation to their specificity. The analysis of pectin, often ignored as a component of dietary fiber, is examined in detail. The sohubility of pectins from a number of common plant foods was determined, indicating that a considerable portion of pectin polyuronide is host to many of the commonly used analytical procedures. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 31 : S 77 -S 8 h, 1978. Plant cell walls are an organized mixture of polysaccharides-pectin, hemicellulose (xyhans, gahactoglucomannan, glucan), and cellulose-plus lignin and glycoprotein. Apart from pectin, the cell wall polysaccha-rides are insoluble in mild solvents without pretreatment; they are digested to only a lim-ited extent by monogastric animals but ar...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV, genus Cypovirus) is {{a unique}} {{member of the family}} Reoviridae which lacks the outer {{protective}} shells that exist in all other members, yet exhibits unusual stability. We have analyzed the effects of different <b>acidic,</b> basic, <b>detergent,</b> and urea treatments on CPV capsids. The integrity of the CPV capsids was unaffected under high-pH conditions that disrupted the orthoreovirus inner core, consistent with its ability to maintain structural integrity in extremely alkaline environments during infection. However, it was sensitive to low pH, detergents, and urea, similarly to other viruses in this family. The three-dimensional structure comparisons by electron cryomicroscopy of the intact empty CPV capsid with the “spikeless” capsid whose turrets were removed by chemical treatments revealed the interaction footprint of the turret on the capsid shell. The observed structural changes associated with the removal of the turret suggest critical structural roles of the turret in maintaining capsid integrity in addition to its enzymatic activities...|$|R
40|$|Background: The WNR {{channel of}} the XN-Series {{automated}} hematology analyzer (Sysmex) counts {{white blood cells}} (WBCs) and simultaneously performs a differential counting of basophils and nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs). The detection process involves exposing the cells to WNR-specific reagents containing an <b>acidic</b> <b>detergent</b> and a fluorescent dye and measuring {{the intensity of the}} forward scattered light (FSC) and side fluorescence light (SFL). Method: We treated isolated peripheral WBCs and NRBCs with specific reagents and assessed the morphological changes in NRBCs and each leukocyte type using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: The results from a flow cytometer (FCM) showed that, after exposure to the reagents, basophils appeared on the highest FSC and SFL areas compared to other leukocytes on the WNR scattergram. Owing to the hemolysis of reticulocytes and erythrocytes, NRBCs that survived the reagent treatment could be distinguished by their lower intensity than those of the other leukocytes on the WNR scattergram. We investigated the significance {{of the relationship between the}} TEM and FCM results after the reagent treatment. Conclusion: We confirmed that the WNR channel differentiates the blood cells on the WNR scattergram based on differences in the amount of residual cytoplasm and nucleic acids.

40|$|To {{confirm that}} Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} chaperonin 10 (Cpn 10) is secreted outside the live bacillus, infected macrophages were examined by electron microscopy. This {{revealed that the}} mycobacterial protein accumulates both in {{the wall of the}} bacterium and in the matrix of the phagosomes in which ingested mycobacteria survive within infected macrophages. To understand the structural implications underlying this secretion, a structural study of M. tuberculosis Cpn 10 was performed under conditions that are generally believed to mimic the membrane environment. It was found that in buffer-organic solvent mixtures, the mycobacterial protein forms two main species, namely, a partially helical monomer that prevails in dilute solutions at room temperature and a dimer that folds into a beta-sheet-dominated structure and prevails in either concentrated protein solutions at room temperature or in dilute solutions at low temperature. A partially helical monomer was also found and was completely associated with negatively charged detergents in a micelle-bound state. Remarkably, zwitterionic lipids had no effect on the protein structure. By using N- and C-truncated forms of the protein, the C- and N-terminal sequences were identified as possessing an amphiphilic helical character and as selectively associating with <b>acidic</b> <b>detergent</b> micelles. When the study was extended to other chaperonins, it was found that human Cpn 10 is also monomeric and partially helical in dilute organic solvent-buffer mixtures. In contrast, Escherichia coli Cpn 10 is mostly dimeric and predominately beta-sheet in both dilute and concentrated solutions. Interestingly, human Cpn 10 also crosses biological membranes, whereas the E. coli homologue is strictly cytosolic. These results suggest that dissociation to partially helical monomers and interaction with acidic lipids may be two important steps in the mechanism of secretion of M. tuberculosis Cpn 10 to the external environment...|$|E
40|$|In {{the milk}} industry, the {{production}} {{must be stopped}} daily in order to clean the process equipment from deposits that are formed at the inside surface when the products are heat treated. This leads reduced production time since no products can be treated when the equipment are being cleaned. The heat treatment of milk products is necessary {{to ensure that the}} product is safe to consume. When heat treating the milk, certain compounds in the milk become unstable and form a deposit called fouling inside the heating equipment. This fouling layer reduces the heat transfer from the heat equipment to the product that is supposed to be heat treated. In order to remove the fouling deposit cleaning with first alkaline and then <b>acidic</b> <b>detergent</b> are used. It can take up to a few hours before the equipment is cleaned depending on the degree of fouling. The aim of this master’s thesis is to develop a laboratory method for measuring cleaning efficiency of UHT fouling by using cleaning detergents at different temperatures and concentrations. The method was created by looking on how a Cleaning-In-Place process is performed and imitates these steps at a laboratory level, by performing experiments on storage, drying, size and separation of fouling. The cleaning method was evaluated according to repeatability and ability to distinguish cleaning effects of the different cleaning liquids. A cleaning method for dissolution of UHT fouling was achieved where it was possible to detect trends of degree of dissolved fouling when different temperature and concentration of cleaning liquids were used in the sodium hydroxide step. The repeatability of the cleaning method was sufficient to be able to detect the cleaning trends. The cleaning effect trials showed that higher temperature and concentration leads to more fouling dissolved. It was also seen that with higher concentration of alkaline detergent a lower temperature could be used to achieve a similar cleaning compared to lower concentration of alkaline detergent...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the resistance change in conductive polypyrrole-coated PET fabrics under the AS 2001. 4. 15 – 1994 laundering test conditions. The effects of individual detergent {{components of a}} standard detergent, including auxiliary chemicals, at four different temperatures were studied. When the coated fabric was washed under the AS 2001. 4. 15 - 1994 conditions, the ECE reference detergent and pure soap flakes (sodium sterate) both decreased the conductivity of the coating at a rate exponentially proportional to the laundering temperature. Detergent types had an influence over the rate of degradation; pH conditions had a large influence on the rate of polymer deterioration with the <b>acidic</b> nonionic <b>detergent</b> giving rise to significantly improved laundering conditions. The auxiliary chemicals, sodium carbonate and sodium perborate were seen to cause large degradation of polymers during laundering.

40|$|Exopolysaccharides {{interfere}} with the isolation and characterization of plasmid DNA from gram-negative bacteria. To repress capsular polysaccharide production, bacteria were cultured in medium containing bismuth nitrate and sodium salicylate. Rapid removal of other contaminating bacterial surface components was achieved by mild <b>acidic</b> zwitterionic <b>detergent</b> extraction. After treatment, bacterial cells were more readily lysed in alkaline detergents. The resulting plasmid preparations contained virtually no capsular polysaccharide and relatively small quantities of lipopolysaccharide and protein, yet they produced yields of nucleic acids {{similar to those of}} conventional plasmid preparations. Conventional preparations from encapsulated organisms were largely insoluble and appeared as smears following agarose gel electrophoresis, with indefinite plasmid banding. Plasmids prepared by the new method were highly soluble in conventional buffers and exhibited high-resolution plasmid banding patterns in agarose gels. Plasmids as large as 180 kbp could be isolated and visualized, without apparent nicking, and were readily digested by restriction endonuclease enzymes. The method proved effective with encapsulated or mucoid strains of KiebsieUla pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter anitratus, SalnoneUla typhimurium, and Enterobacter species. The complete method for plasmid isolation was not suitable forPseudomonas aeruginosa because ofthe inhibitory effects ofbismuth. Thus, removal ofcontaminating bacterial surface structures enabled the rapid isolation and characterization of plasmids from mucoid clinica...|$|R
40|$|BacA is {{an inner}} {{membrane}} protein associated with maintenance of chronic infections in several diverse host-pathogen interactions. To understand {{the function of}} the bacA gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Rv 1819 c), we insertionally inactivated this gene and analyzed the resulting mutant for a variety of phenotypes. BacA deficiency in M. tuberculosis did not affect sensitivity to <b>detergents,</b> <b>acidic</b> pH, and zinc, indicating that there was no global compromise in membrane integrity, and a comprehensive evaluation of the major lipid constituents of the cell envelope failed to reveal any significant differences. Infection of mice with this mutant revealed no impact on establishment of infection but a profound effect on maintenance of extended chronic infection and ultimate outcome. As in alphaproteobacteria, deletion of BacA in M. tuberculosis led to increased bleomycin resistance, and heterologous expression of the M. tuberculosis BacA homolog in Escherichia coli conferred sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides. These results suggest a striking conservation of function for BacA-related proteins in transport of a critical molecule that determines the outcome of the host-pathogen interaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand {{of food and}} the rising concerns about climate change and energy security pushes Sorghum bicolor {{to the top of}} global agendas. The main attraction is its ability to provide food and animal feed as well as renewable energy products, and industrial commodities. The species comprises grain and sweet sorghum types. Sweet sorghum has major advantages compared to other sugar and biomass crops. Firstly, sorghum is a species showing extensive genetic variation, including drought and heat tolerant genotypes, which enable the usage of marginal land that is not suitable for cultivating other crops. Secondly, competition between the use of land for food or for energy is less because the grains can be used for food or feed while stems can be used for biofuel production. In the current study, field trials and related genetic analysis were carried out to identify major chromosomal regions that are linked to biofuel-related traits. An experimental population of 213 RILs from a cross between grain sorghum (M 71) and sweet sorghum (SS 79) was planted in 5 environments in Germany in the vegetation periods 2007 and 2008. This population segregates for alleles controlling biomass yield, juice content, sugar content, fibre content, and many other traits. The approach to identify these chromosomal regions was (1) to phenotype the RIL population for the mentioned traits, (2) to construct a genetic map from the RILs, and (3) to correlate the phenotypic data and genetic map informations. The phenotypic data was analysed for individual location and environments (years*location) using mixed model from SAS® 9. 1 version. Genotypes were treated as fixed effects while all other components were treated as random effects. Regarding, sugar-related traits, we analysed brix, glucose content, sucrose content, and sugar content, measured stem diameter, stem juice weight, plant height and fresh panicle weight, and counted the days to anthesis and the number of tillers per plant. We partitioned the variance components as genetic, location, year, genetic x location, genetic x year, location x year, genetic x location x year, and harvest date. The results showed that although location contributed highly to the phenotype in terms of percentage, it was not a significant source of variance. The interaction between genotypes and environment was observed in most traits except for stem juice weight, fresh panicle weight and glucose content. Genetic variance contributed small but significant to the phenotypic variance. And thus the heritability estimates were moderate to high in all traits except stem juice weight (H 2 = 0. 18). Pearson correlation estimates showed that these traits were significantly correlated with each other. Flowering dates correlated with all the traits while number of tillers only positively correlated with stem juice weight, and negatively correlated with sugar content and flowering dates. In fibre-related traits, we quantified fibre content traits (<b>acidic</b> <b>detergent</b> fibre, <b>acidic</b> <b>detergent</b> lignin, neutral detergent fibre, cellulose, hemicelluloses), and measured related agronomic traits (fresh leaf mass, stripped stalk mass, dry stalk mass, fresh biomass and dry biomass). We partitioned our variance components as genetic, environment, harvest date and genotype x environment. Genetic variance was significant in all traits except for dry biomass while environment was not significant for all traits. There was a significant genotype x environment interaction in all traits except hemicelluloses. Dry stalk mass, dry biomass and hemicelluloses had low heritability estimates of <= 0. 24. Pearson correlation estimates showed that fibre content traits significantly and positively correlated with each other as well as agronomic traits, while there were negative correlations among agronomic and fibre content traits. A total of 213 RILs were used to construct the genetic linkage map using 157 markers, i. e. simple sequence repeats (SSR), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSR). The linkage map was compared to other sorghum published maps and linkage groups were assigned according to the recent sorghum nomenclature. The phenotypic data of each trait was averaged to obtain the combined environmental means to detect QTLs. Composite interval mapping (CIM) of the PLABQTL software was used for analysis. The model AA was used to estimate additive x additive QTL interaction, and the command environ was used to estimate significant QTL in each environment and to detect QTL x environmental interaction. CIM detected a few additive QTLs per trait across the 10 sorghum chromosomes. The additive QTLs co-localized and showed clusters on some chromosome, where the most prominent clusters were observed on chromosomes 1, 2, 6, and 7. QTLs showing multiple effects were observed on all chromosomes except chromosome 5 and 10 and most of these pleiotropic QTLs showed the contribution of the positive allele in each trait. For example, a QTL on SBI- 06, position 14, showed the allele contribution of M 71 (high cellulose and compact panicle parent) for cellulose and fresh panicle weight, along with the allele contribution of SS 79 (high sucrose and biomass parent) for sucrose and fresh biomass. However, QTLs that showed pleiotropic effect also exhibited QTL x environment interaction. Most of the QTLs detected for agronomic biomass (i. e. stripped stalk mass, fresh leaf mass and fresh biomass) interacted significantly with the environment. Additive x additive interaction was detected in 14 out of 20 traits studied totalling 41 digenic pairs. This indicates the abundance of digenic epistasis across the genome. However, failure to detect QTL x QTL interaction can never be interpreted as being absent but can be attributed to QTL x environment interaction, sampling error or accuracy of statistic methods. Among other characteristics, stem sugar components and lignocellulosic biomass are the important characteristics of Sorghum bicolor to determine it as one of the major bionergy crops. There is limited literature on sugar and fibre related traits in sorghum at the moment, and this study among other few, serves as one of the base investigations on the topic. The phenotypic variation of the lines, the moderate to high heritability of the desired traits, the significant correlation and pleiotropic QTLs to the positive direction identified, the additive stable QTLs and their interactions detected suggest that {{it will be possible to}} develop improved lines and hybrids by breeding and to ultimately enhance the sorghum plant as a bioenergy crop. Die steigende Nachfrage nach Nahrungsmitteln und regenerativen Energieträgern sowie die Sorge um den fortschreitenden Klimawandel machen Sorghum zu einer hochinteressanten landwirtschaftlichen Pflanze. Seine hauptsächlichen Vorzüge liegen in seiner gleichzeitigen Verwendbarkeit als Nahrungs- und Futtermittel, als Energieträger und als Rohstofflieferant für industrielle Erzeugnisse. Die Art Sorghum umfaßt sowohl Korn- als auch Zuckertypen, wobei sich Zuckersorghum sich gegenüber anderen Zucker- und Biomassekulturen durch einige wesentliche Eigenschaften auszeichnet: Erstens zeigt Sorghum eine enorme genetische Variabilität, die sogar dürre- und hitzetolerate Genotypen umfaßt. Zweitens verringert die gleichzeitige Nutzung des Sorghums für Nahrungs- und Futtermittelgewinnung aus dem Korn und Biokraftstoff aus den Stängeln den Wettbewerb um die Landnutzung durch verschiedene Pflanzen für unterschiedliche Zwecke. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden Feldversuche und genetische Analysen mit dem Ziel durchgeführt, hautverantwortliche chromosomale Regionen zu identifizieren, die mit Eigenschaften gekoppelt sind, welche die Eignung zur Gewinnung von Biokraftstoff beeinflussen. Eine Versuchspopulation von 213 RILs (rekombinante Inzuchtlinien) aus einer Kreuzung zwischen Kornsorghum (M 71) und Zuckersorghum (SS 79) wurde in fünf Umwelten in Deutschland während der Vegetationsperioden 2007 und 2008 gepflanzt. Diese Population spaltet in Allele, die den Biomasseertrag, den Saftgehalt, den Zuckergehalt, den Fasergehalt, sowie viele weitere Eigenschaften kontrollieren. Der Ansatz, diese chromosomalen Regionen zu identifizieren, umfaßte (1) die Phänotypisierung der RIL-Population für die genannten Merkmale, (2) die Erstellung einer genetische Karte der RIL-Linien und (3) die Korrelation der phänotyosichen Daten mit den genotypischen Daten. Die phänotypischen Daten wurden für einzelne Standorte und Umwelten mit SAS® Version 9. 1 im gemischten Model (mixed model) analysiert. Die Genotypen wurden dabei als fixe Effekte betrachtet, während die übrigen Komponenten als zufällige Effekte behandelt wurden. In Hinblick auf zuckerrelevante Eigenschaften analysierten wir den Brix, den Sucrose- und Glucosegehalt, den Zuckergehalt, den Stängeldurchmesser, die Stängelsaftmenge, die Pflanzenhöhe, das Frischgewicht der Rispen, die Zeitspanne bis zur Blüte und die Anzahl der Triebe pro Pflanze. Die Varianz-Komponenten unterteilten wir in Genotyp, Standort, Jahr, Genotyp x Standort, Standort x Jahr, Genotyp x Standort x Jahr und Erntedaten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, daß der Standort trotz seines großen Einflusses auf den Phänotyp keine signifikante Quelle für die Varianz ist. Mit Ausnahme von Stängelsaftmenge, Frischgewicht der Rispe und Glucosegehalt wurden Wechselwirkungen zwischen Genotyp und Umwelt für alle Merkmale beobachtet. Die genetische Varianz beinflußt die phänotypische Varianz zwar wenig, jedoch signifikant. Die geschätzten Heritabilitäten waren daher mittel bis hoch in allen Merkmalen mit Ausnahme der Stängelsaftmenge (H 2 = 0. 18). Pearsons Korrelationsschätzungen zeigen, daß diese Merkmale auch untereinander signifikant korreliert sind. So korrelieren die Blütedaten mit allen Merkmalen. Die Anzahl der Stängel pro Pflanze ist dagegen zwar positiv mit der Stängelsaftmenge korreliert, aber negativ mit dem Zuckergehalt und Blütedaten. Bezüglich der Fasermerkmale wurden Fasergehalte, wie Säure-detergenfaser, Neutral-detergenzfaser, Säure-detergenzlignin, Zellulose und Hemizellulose und pflanzenbauliche Merkmale, wie Blattfrischmasse, Geschälte-Stängel-Masse, Stängeltrockenmasse, Gesamtfrischbio¬masse, Gesamttrockenbiomasse bestimmt. Die Varianz-Komponenten unterteilten wir in Genotyp, Umwelt, Erntezeitpunkt, Genotyp x Umwelt. Die genetische Varianz ist signifikant in allen Merkmalen mit Ausnahme der Gesamttrockenbiomasse. Die Umwelt ist hingegen in keinem der Merkmale signifikant. Die Genotyp-Umwelt-Wechselwirkung ist für alle Merkmale außer Hemizellulose signifikant. Stängeltrockenmasse, Gesamttrockenbiomasse und Hemizellulose weisen niedrige Heritabilitätsschätzungen von <= 0. 24 auf. Pearsons Korrelationsschätzungen zeigen, daß sowohl jeweils Fasergehaltmerkmale als auch pflanzenbauliche Merkmale signifikant und positiv untereinander korreliert sind. Zwischen diesen Merkmalsgruppen werden allerdings negative Korrelationen beobachtet. Eine genetische Kopplungskarte wurde aus den genotypischen Daten von 213 RILs und 157 Markern, wie simple sequence repeats (SSR), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSR) erstellt. Diese Karte wurde mit anderen publizierten Sorghum-Karten verglichen und die Kopplungsgruppen entsprechend der aktuellen Sorghum-Nomenklatur bezeichnet. Die phänotypischen Daten wurden gemittelt, um mittels der kombinierten Umweltdaten QTLs zu detektieren. Die QTL-Analyse wurde mit der Software PLABQTL unter Nutzung der Composite interval mapping  Methode (CIM) durchgeführt. Additive x additive QTL-Wechselwirkungen wurden mit dem Model AA geschätzt. Der Befehl environ wurde angewandt, um signifikante QTLs in jeder Umwelt zu ermitteln und QTL-Umwelt-Wechselwirkungen zu ermitteln. Es konnten einige additive QTLs pro Merkmal in den 10 Sorghumchromosomen detektiert werden. Die additiven QTL ko-lokalisieren und bilden auf einigen Chromosomen Cluster. Die bedeutensten Cluster finden sich auf den Chromosomen 1, 2, 6 und 7. Pleitrope QTLs konnten auf allen Chromosomen außer Chromosom 5 und 10 beobachtet werden. Die meisten von ihnen beeinflussen das jeweils positive Allel der betroffenen Merkmale. Zum Bespiel zeigt ein QTL auf SBI- 06, Position 14, den allelischen Einfluß des Elters M 71 (Hoch-Zellulose und kompakte Rispe) auf Zellulose und Rispenfrischmasse, sowie den allelischen Einfluß des Elters SS 79 (Hoch-Sucrose, Hoch-Biomasse) auf Sucrose und Gesamtfrischbiomasse. QTLs mit pleitropen Effekten zeigen darüberhinaus QTL-Umwelt-Wechselwirkungen. Die meisten ermittelten QTL für pflanzenbauliche Merkmale (z. B. Geschälte-Stängel-Masse, Blattfrischmasse, Gesamtfrischbiomasse) zeigen signifikante Wechselwirkungen mit der Umwelt. In 14 von 20 untersuchten Merkmalen wurden Additive x Additive Wechselwirkungen beobachtet, insgesamt sind es 41 digenische Paare. Dies verdeutlicht die Verbreitung digenischer Epistasie über das Genom. Dessenungeachtet darf eine nicht nachgewiesene QTL-QTL-Wechselwirkung nicht ignoriert werden. Sie kann auch der Genauigkeit oder Fehlerhaftigkeit der statistischen Methoden und Probennahme, oder aber einer möglichen QTL-Umwelt-Wechselwirkung zugeschreiben werden. Neben anderen Charakteristika sind Stängelzuckerkomponenten und Lignozellulose-Biomasse diejenigen Merkmale von Sorghum bicolor, die zur seiner Bedeutung als Bioenergieträger beitragen. Gegenwärtig ist nur wenig zu Zucker- und Fasermerkmalen in Sorghum publiziert. Die vorliegende Arbeit dient neben anderen wenigen der Grundlagenforschung auf diesem Gebiet. Die phänotypische Varianz der Linien, die mittlere bis hohe Heritabilität der gewünschten Merkmale, die signifikante Korrelation, sowie pleitrope QTL bezüglich der positiven Allele zusammen mit stabilen QTLs und ihren Wechselwirkungen lassen erwarten, daß die Entwicklung verbesserter Linien und Hybriden durch Züchtung möglich ist, wodurch Sorhum als Bioenergiepflanze gestärkt wird...|$|E
40|$|A novel generic {{approach}} for stress profiling {{was applied to}} Listeria monocytogenes strain F 2365. This food-borne pathogen was exposed to gradients of five different stresses of increasing intensity, typically ranging from moderate to lethal conditions. The stress factors included heat, <b>acidic</b> pH, a <b>detergent</b> disinfectant, an oxidant, and hyperosmotic conditions. In addition to CFU counts and lag time, five different molecular viability parameters were measured by fluorescence-based assays, including membrane integrity, membrane potential, esterase activity, redox activity, and intracellular pH stability. The last was measured by our recently invented real-time viability assay. Exposure to all stresses resulted in clear dose-response relationships for all viability parameters {{with the exception of}} hyperosmotic conditions. A statistical analysis showed strong correlations for (i) the growth parameters plate counts and lag times, (ii) the enzyme-associated functions redox and esterase activity, and (iii) the membrane-associated pH stability and membrane integrity. Results indicated a pronounced difference in the susceptibilities of the measured parameters depending on the stress factor applied. However, at relatively high stress intensities, all of the viability parameters became affected independent of the stress factor. Applications of the approach presented here include studies on the mechanism of action of unknown compounds with biocidal activity and a comparative analysis of the severities of the impact of stress conditions of interest. It appears that a meaningful evaluation of the impact of mild stress conditions can be obtained only through measurement of multiple viability parameters. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology...|$|R
