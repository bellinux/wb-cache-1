2500|$|From a New York Times {{interview}} in 1942: [...] "When the war started... {{felt that it}} was up to me to do something, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know is show business. I went around during the last war and I saw that the boys needed something besides chow and drills. I knew the same was true today, so I told the people in Washington that I would go anywhere and do an act for the Army." [...] Shortly after the war began, he wrote a letter to Steven Early, press secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, volunteering [...] "to head a committee for the entertainment of soldiers and said that he [...] "would work without pay... would gladly assist in the organization to be set up for this purpose". A few weeks later, he received his first tour schedule from the newly formed United Services Organization (USO), [...] "the group his letter to Early had helped create".|$|E

6000|$|... "Some lifetimes," [...] said Mr. Chalk, gloomily. [...] "I’m fifty-one next year, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{ever had}} {{happen to me}} was seeing a man stop a runaway horse and cart." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a cul-de-sac; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> {{to do was}} to {{turn back}} boldly and get out of it.|$|R

6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} it over for some time," [...] resumed Mr. Kybird; [...] "twisting it {{and turning it}} all ways, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can see for {{it is for you}} to be married on the strict q.t. Of course, if you don't like--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that is {{certainly}} puzzling," [...] returned Ajo. [...] "And he's a brave little man, too, fearless of danger and reckless in exposing himself to shot and shell. Indeed, our Maurie {{is something of a}} mystery <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> fully understand is his objection to Clarette's society." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Joe was at last free, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> reproach him for {{is going}} away {{without a word}} to me or any of his friends. I heard, indirectly, of his working {{his way through a}} {{technical}} school, for he was always crazy about mechanics, and then he went to New York and I lost all further trace of him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "As {{to their}} quarrels, I know nothing. Ramdass has often told {{me as much}} as he knew of these matters, but it all {{seemed to me to be}} confusion; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could {{understand}} was that they were always intriguing against each other, instead of putting all their forces in the field, and fighting it out fairly, and so deciding who was to be the chief lord of the Mahrattas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, you foolish boy, it isn't {{the least}} bit in the world necessary. This has been, all through, a comedy of errors. Tragedy enough intermixed; but still a comedy of errors. There never was really any reason on earth why either of us shouldn't have married the other. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> now regret myself is that I didn't do as I first threatened, and marry you outright, just to show my {{confidence}} in you and Guy, {{at the time when}} everybody else had turned most against you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I am glad it is over. At first I {{was very}} much interested; in fact, I was {{intensely}} interested all along, {{and should have been}} for however long it had continued. But, at the same time, I could do nothing else, and one does not want to spend one's whole life as a detective. At last it came about almost by chance, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have to congratulate myself upon is that my idea of the sort of place he would have taken was exactly borne out by fact." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, of course. This is a Republic, you know. The people elect {{all their}} {{officers}} from the King down. Every man and every woman is a voter. The Boolooroo tells them whom to vote for, and if they don't obey, they are severely punished. It's a fine system of government, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> object to is electing the Boolooroo for only three hundred years. It ought to be for life. My successor has already been elected, but he can't reign {{for a hundred years}} to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, my lord,' she replied, with {{rather an}} awkward air, 'as to the Frog, she stands before you. Let {{me tell you}} my story; {{it is not a}} long one. I know neither my country nor my parents, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can say for certain is that I am called Serpentine. The fairies, who have taken care of me ever since I was born, wished me to be in ignorance as to my family, but they have looked after my education, and have {{bestowed}} on me endless kindness. I have always lived in seclusion, and {{for the last two years}} I have wished for nothing better. I had a mirror'--here shyness and embarrassment choked her words--but regaining her self-control, she added, 'You know that fairies insist on being obeyed without questioning. It was they who changed the little house you saw before you into the fountain for which you are now asking, and, having turned me into a frog, they ordered me to say to the first person who came to the fountain exactly what I repeated to you. But, my lord, when you stood before me, it was agony to my heart, filled as it was with thoughts of you, to appear to your eyes under so monstrous a form. However, there was no help for it, and, painful as it was, I had to submit. I desired your success with all my soul, not only for your own sake, but also for my own, because I could not get back my proper shape till you had become master of the beautiful bird, though I am quite ignorant as to your reason for seeking it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|After puberty, a {{child may}} as well be told the simple and {{necessary}} facts of sex. As things stand, the parent may as well do it. But briefly, coldly, and with as cold a dismissal as possible.--"Look here, you're not a child any more; you know it, don't you? You're going to be a man. And you know what that means. It means you're going to marry a woman later on, and get children. You know it, and I know it. But in the meantime, leave yourself alone. I know you'll have a lot of bother with yourself, and your feelings. I know what is happening to you. And I know you get excited about it. But you needn't. Other men have all gone through it. So don't you go creeping off by yourself and doing things on the sly. It won't do you any good.--I know what you'll do, because we've all been through it. I know the thing will keep coming on you at night. But remember that I know. Remember. And remember that I want you to leave yourself alone. I know what it is, I tell you. I've been through it all myself. You've got to go through these years, before you find a woman you want to marry, and whom you can marry. I went through them myself, and got myself worked up a good deal more than was good for me.--Try to contain yourself. Always try to contain yourself, and be a man. That's the only thing. Always try and be manly, and quiet in yourself. Remember I know what it is. I've been the same, in the same state that you are in. And probably I've behaved more foolishly and perniciously than ever you will. So come to me if anything really bothers you. And don't feel sly and secret. I do know just what you've got and what you haven't. I've been as bad and perhaps worse than you. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want of you is to be manly. Try and be manly, and quiet in yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|BUT {{the trout}} was so displeased with {{the taste of}} the macintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> it {{swallowed}} was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes.|$|R

Soon my heart no longer provided food for my mind, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> felt in my existence was a deep ennui." ...|$|E

So he said, Come on, you can come up with {{something}} else. I wracked my brain, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could come up with was Nixon face was hidden within curtain folds. That one really set the tone for what the cleverness of the fold-ins has to be. It couldnt just be bringing someone from the left to kiss someone on the right." ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1976, Bowie began disavowing his {{allegedly}} pro-Fascist comments {{and said that}} he was misunderstood. In an interview that year in the Daily Express, he explained that while performing in his various characters, [...] "I'm Pierrot. I'm Everyman. What I'm doing is theatre, and only theatre... What you see on stage isn't sinister. It's pure clown. I'm using myself as a canvas and trying to paint the truth of our time on it. The white face, the baggy pants - they're Pierrot, the eternal clown putting over the great sadness." [...] In 1977 (after retiring the Duke), Bowie stated that [...] "I have made my two or three glib, theatrical observations on English society <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can now counter with is to state that I am NOT a Fascist".|$|E
