5|$|The {{definition}} of a prion-like domain arises {{from the study of}} fungal prions. In yeast, prionogenic proteins have a portable prion domain that is both necessary and sufficient for self-templating and protein aggregation. This has been shown by attaching the prion domain to a reporter protein, which then aggregates like a known prion. Similarly, removing the prion domain from a fungal prion protein inhibits prionogenesis. This modular view of prion behaviour has led to the hypothesis that similar prion domains are present in animal proteins, in addition to PrP. These fungal prion domains have several characteristic sequence features. They are typically enriched in <b>asparagine,</b> glutamine, tyrosine and glycine residues, with an <b>asparagine</b> bias being particularly conducive to the aggregative property of prions. Historically, prionogenesis has been seen as independent of sequence and only dependent on relative residue content. However, this {{has been shown to be}} false, with the spacing of prolines and charged residues having been shown to be critical in amyloid formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} amino acids were {{discovered}} in the early 19th century. In 1806, French chemists Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet isolated a compound in asparagus that was subsequently named <b>asparagine,</b> the first amino acid to be discovered. Cystine was discovered in 1810, although its monomer, cysteine, remained undiscovered until 1884. Glycine and leucine {{were discovered in}} 1820. The last of the 20 common amino acids to be discovered was threonine in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, who also determined the essential amino acids and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth.|$|E
5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses <b>asparagine</b> as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E

The pKa of proline,threonine and <b>asparagines</b> were found graphically by extrapolations to be 10. 54, 10. 31 and 9. 39 respectively. The overall stability constant of the corresponding nickel (II) complexes were also determined by potentiometric titration in aqueous solution.

40|$|A {{series of}} emissive N-t-butyloxycarbonyl benzyl ester <b>asparagines</b> bearing {{benzothiazole}} and benzimidazole units {{at the side}} chain, functionalised with electron donor or acceptor groups, were evaluated as novel amino acid based fluorimetric chemosensors for transition metal cations such as Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Co 2 + and Ni 2 +. Selective removal of the protecting groups at the N- and C-terminals {{was carried out in}} order to assess the influence of the presence of blocking groups on the overall coordination ability. The results indicate that there is a strong interaction through the donor N, O and S atoms at the side chain of the various <b>asparagines,</b> with high selectivity towards Cu 2 + in a 1 : 1 complex stoichiometry. Association constants and detection limits for Cu 2 + were calculated. The photophysical and metal ion sensing properties of these <b>asparagines</b> suggest that they can be suitable for incorporation into peptidic chemosensor frameworks.

5|$|During winter, <b>asparagine</b> is metabolised immediately, {{but other}} nutrients, {{especially}} phosphates and glutamine, {{are removed from}} the xylem sap and stored in mature stem, bark and leaf tissues for release back into the xylem just before shoot growth begins in mid summer. This is also {{the time when the}} oldest leaves senesce and die, returning nutrients to the plant at the time when they are needed most. When glutamine eventually reaches the leaves, it is broken down and used to synthesise protein and non-amide amino acids such as aspartate, threonine, serine, glutamate, glycine, alanine and cystine. Together with sucrose and other solutes, these are then circulated in the phloem. The phloem sap of B.prionotes is unusual in having an extremely low ratio of potassium to sodium cations, and very low concentrations of phosphate and amino acids compared to chloride and sulfate anions. The low levels of potassium and phosphate reflect the extremely low availability of these minerals in the soil. The unusually high levels of sodium and chloride—at concentrations usually only seen under saline conditions—may be due to the necessity of maintaining turgor pressure; that is, with so little potassium and phosphate available, and that needed in the building of new tissue, B.prionotes is forced to circulate whatever other ions are available in order to maintain turgor.|$|E
25|$|A seventh {{catalytic}} type of proteolytic enzymes, <b>asparagine</b> peptide lyase, {{was described}} in 2011. Its proteolytic mechanism is unusual since, rather than hydrolysis, it performs an elimination reaction. During this reaction, the catalytic <b>asparagine</b> forms a cyclic chemical structure that cleaves itself at <b>asparagine</b> residues in proteins under the right conditions. Given its fundamentally different mechanism, its inclusion as a peptidase may be debatable.|$|E
25|$|They {{all have}} four {{potential}} N-glycosylation sites. These occur at <b>asparagine</b> (Asn) amino acid numbers 96, 135, 155, and 192 in humans and at similar amino acid numbers in other species. All these sites are occupied by covalently attached oligosaccharide side-chains in the predominant form of human antithrombin, α-antithrombin, {{resulting in a}} molecular weight for this form of antithrombin of 58,200. The potential glycosylation site at <b>asparagine</b> 135 is not occupied in a minor form (around 10%) of antithrombin, β-antithrombin (see Figure 1).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{therapeutic}} value of DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents {{is dependent upon}} their ability to induce tumor cell apoptosis while sparing most normal tissues. Here, we show that {{a component of the}} apoptotic response to these agents in several different types of tumor cells is the deamidation of two <b>asparagines</b> in the unstructured loop of Bcl-xL, and we demonstrate that deamidation of these <b>asparagines</b> imports susceptibility to apoptosis by disrupting the ability of Bcl-xL to block the proapoptotic activity of BH 3 domain-only proteins. Conversely, Bcl-xL deamidation is actively suppressed in fibroblasts, and suppression of deamidation is an essential component of their resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that the regulation of Bcl-xL deamidation has a critical role in the tumor-specific activity of DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents...|$|R

The polyamine {{is connected to the}} <b>asparagine's</b> α-carboxyl group. The amino group of this aminoacid is linked to 2,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid.|$|R
25|$|Another {{key event}} {{that takes place}} in the ER is N-linked glycosylation. In this process, polypeptides that have a unique stretch of 3 amino acids (<b>asparagine</b> - X - serine/threonine, where X {{represents}} any amino acid except proline) are modified with a complex sugar moiety on the amide group of <b>asparagine.</b> Other types of glycosylations include S-linked (via cysteine residues), C-linked (via tryptophan) and O-linked (via serine or threonine). By far, N-linked glycosylation is the most abundant post-translational modification found in eukaryotic cells.|$|E
25|$|The FOXP2 gene {{is highly}} conserved in mammals. Human gene differs from {{non-human}} primates by {{the substitution of}} two amino acids, threonine to <b>asparagine</b> substitution at position 303 (T303N) and <b>asparagine</b> to serine substitution at position 325 (N325S). In mice it {{differs from that of}} humans by three substitutions, and in zebra finch by seven amino acids. One of the two amino acid difference between human and chimps also arose independently in carnivores and bats. Similar FOXP2 proteins can be found in songbirds, fish, and reptiles such as alligators.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} SNPs in the protein's coding {{sequence}} which change CCDC142's amino acid composition. One SNP {{with a high}} prevalence rate in the population (1.8%) is notable for its change in chemistry, with a tyrosine to an <b>asparagine</b> shift at amino acid 548.|$|E
5000|$|In such {{rings the}} {{polypeptide}} has the conformation of beta sheet or of type II polyproline helix (PPII). A number of glutamines and <b>asparagines</b> help bind short peptides (with the PPII conformation) {{in the groove}} of class II MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) proteins [...] by forming these motifs. Another amide ring occurs at {{the interior of the}} variable domains of some Immunoglobulin G antibodies and assists in linking the two beta-sheets.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{unconventional}} translational and posttranslational mechanisms {{contribute to the}} production of antigenic peptides, thereby increasing the diversity of the peptide repertoire presented by MHC class I molecules. Here, we describe a class I-restricted peptide that combines several posttranslational modifications. It is derived from tyrosinase and recognized by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from a melanoma patient. This unusual antigenic peptide is made of two noncontiguous tyrosinase fragments that are spliced together in the reverse order. In addition, it contains two aspartate residues that replace the <b>asparagines</b> encoded in the tyrosinase sequence. We confirmed that this peptide is naturally presented at the surface of melanoma cells, and we showed that its processing sequentially requires translation of tyrosinase into the endoplasmic reticulum and its retrotranslocation into the cytosol, where deglycosylation of the two <b>asparagines</b> by peptide-N-glycanase turns them into aspartates by deamidation. This process is followed by cleavage and splicing of the appropriate fragments by the standard proteasome and additional transport of the resulting peptide into the endoplasmic reticulum through the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) ...|$|R
40|$|A peptide {{designed}} {{to form a}} homo-oligomeric transmembrane helical bundle was reconstituted into lipid bilayers and studied by using 2 H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) with magic angle spinning {{to confirm that the}} helical interface corresponds to the interface intended in the design. The peptide belongs to a family of model peptides derived from a membrane-solubilized version of the water-soluble coiled-coil GCN 4 -P 1. The variant studied here contains two <b>asparagines</b> thought to engage in interhelical hydrogen bonding critical to the formation of a stable trimer. For the NMR studies, three different peptides were synthesized, each with one of three consecutive leucines in the transmembrane region deuterium labeled. Prior to NMR data collection, polarized infrared spectroscopy was used to establish that the peptides were reconstituted in lipid bilayers in a transmembrane helical conformation. The 2 H NMR line shapes of the three different peptides are consistent with a trimer structure formed by the designed peptide that is stabilized by inter-helical hydrogen bonding of <b>asparagines</b> at positions 7 and 14...|$|R

25|$|The rare Webb (Wb) antigen (~1/1000 donors), {{originally}} {{described in}} 1963 in Australia, {{is the result}} of an alteration in glycosylation of glycophorin C: an A to G transition at nucleotide 23 results in an <b>asparagine</b> residue instead of the normal serine residue with the resultant loss of glycoslation.

40|$|Molecular chaperones {{regulate}} essential {{steps in}} the propagation of yeast prions. Yeast prions possess domains enriched in glutamines and <b>asparagines</b> that act as templates to drive the assembly of native proteins into beta-sheet-rich, amyloid-like fibrils. Several recent studies highlight a significant and complex function for Hsp 40 co-chaperones in propagation of prion elements in yeast. Hsp 40 co-chaperones bind non-native polypeptides and transfer these clients to Hsp 70 s for refolding or degradation. How Hsp 40 co-chaperones bind amyloid-like prion conformers that are enriched in hydrophilic residues such as glutamines and <b>asparagines</b> is a significant question in the field. Interestingly, selective recognition of amyloid-like conformers by distinct Hsp 40 s appears to confer opposing actions on prion assembly. For example, the Type I Hsp 40 Ydj 1 and Type II Hsp 40 Sis 1 bind different regions within the prion protein Rnq 1 and function respectively to inhibit or promote [RNQ+] prion assembly. Thus, substrate selectivity enables distinct Hsp 40 s to act at unique steps in prion propagation...|$|R

25|$|Isocitrate binds {{within the}} active site to a conserved {{sequence}} of about eight amino acids through hydrogen bonds. These acids include (may vary in residue but with similar properties) tyrosine, serine, <b>asparagine,</b> arginine, arginine, arginine, tyrosine, and lysine.

25|$|In mammals, 20% to 40% of {{proteins}} contain repeating sequences of amino acids encoded by short sequence repeats. Most {{of the short}} sequence repeats within protein-coding portions of the genome have a repeating unit of three nucleotides, since that length will not cause frame-shifts when mutating. Each trinucleotide repeating sequence is transcribed into a repeating series of the same amino acid. In yeasts, the most common repeated amino acids are glutamine, glutamic acid, <b>asparagine,</b> aspartic acid and serine.|$|E

Tandem repeats in the first intron of the <b>Asparagine</b> synthetase gene are linked to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. A repeat polymorphism in the fourth intron of the NOS3 gene is linked to hypertension in a Tunisian population. Reduced repeat lengths in the EGFR gene are linked with osteosarcomas.|$|E
30|$|Compared to {{the other}} alleles, AP 1 was the most {{frequently}} detected allele in the common wild rice accessions in this study, and the frequency reached 33.3  % in O. rufipogon. This result implied that AP 1 was likely the original allele in O. rufipogon. Based on the protein sequence, we deduced that both AP 3 and AP 8 might originate from AP 1 because {{there was only one}} variant site between AP 1 and AP 3 /AP 8. Interestingly, there was only one amino acid difference between AP 8 and AP 9, which substituted lysine 537 in AP 8 and for <b>asparagines</b> 537 in AP 9. Because <b>asparagines</b> 537 was not detected in O. rufipogon, we proposed that AP 9 was directly mutated from AP 8 in the cultivars. AP 3 might further differentiate into other alleles, such as AP 4, AP 5 and AP 14. However, it was still difficult for us to deduce the original ancestor of the other rare alleles in the rice accessions because of the limited wild rice accession samples investigated in this study. More wild rice accessions in the Oryza genus need to be analyzed to elucidate the detailed evolutionary pattern of the GN 1 A alleles.|$|R

Hydrogen bonding between the chains makes the structure of lignocellulosic biomass very rigid and recalcitrant (Yamada et al. 2013). Thermostable cellulases are characterized by hydrophobic protein core and polarity at the surface; compact structure with lesser internal voids; higher content of proline and lesser content of <b>asparagines,</b> glutamine, methionine and cysteine; increased level of H-bonding, isoelectric points and salt bridges (Taylor and Vaisman 2010; Li et al. 2011).|$|R

The sidechain carboxamide of glutamines and <b>asparagines</b> also appear in this spectra in this experiment.

25|$|The {{result of}} {{glycosyl}} transfer {{can be a}} carbohydrate, glycoside, oligosaccharide, or a polysaccharide. Some glycosyltransferases catalyse transfer to inorganic phosphate or water. Glycosyl transfer can also occur to protein residues, usually to tyrosine, serine, or threonine to give O-linked glycoproteins, or to <b>asparagine</b> to give N-linked glycoproteins. Mannosyl groups may be transferred to tryptophan to generate C-mannosyl tryptophan, which is relatively abundant in eukaryotes. Transferases may also use lipids as an acceptor, forming glycolipids, and even use lipid-linked sugar phosphate donors, such as dolichol phosphates.|$|E

40|$|RATIONALE Diseases {{including}} {{cancer and}} congenital disorders of glycosylation {{have been associated}} with changes in the site-specific extent of protein glycosylation. Saliva can be non-invasively sampled and is rich in glycoproteins, giving it {{the potential to be a}} useful biofluid for the discovery and detection of disease biomarkers associated with changes in glycosylation. METHODS Saliva was collected from healthy individuals and glycoproteins were enriched using phenylboronic acid based glycoprotein enrichment resin. Proteins were deglycosylated with peptide-N-glycosidase F and digested with AspN or trypsin. Desalted peptides and deglycosylated peptides were separated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography and detected with on-line electrospray ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a 5600 TripleTof instrument. Site-specific glycosylation occupancy was semi-quantitatively determined from the abundance of deglycosylated and nonglycosylated versions of each given peptide. RESULTS Glycoprotein enrichment identified 67 independent glycosylation sites from 24 unique proteins, a 3. 9 -fold increase in the number of glycosylation sites identified. Enrichment of glycoproteins rather than glycopeptides allowed detection of both deglycosylated and nonglycosylated versions of each peptide, and thereby robust measurement of site-specific occupancy at 21 <b>asparagines.</b> Healthy individuals showed limited biological variability in occupancy, with partially modified sites having characteristics consistent with inefficient glycosylation by oligosaccharyltransferase. Inclusion of negative controls without enzymatic deglycosylation controlled for spontaneous chemical deamidation, and identified <b>asparagines</b> previously incorrectly annotated as glycosylated.
