50|$|Interspecies and intraspecies {{differences}} in responses to light pulses (i.e. difference in PRC)Regardless {{of whether they}} {{belong to the same}} species or not, rodents with longer period (τ) have larger <b>advance</b> <b>zone</b> in their PRC, because they need to have phase delays more often in order to entrain to local time (24hr). The opposite is true for rodents with shorter period (τ). Its implication on real life is that most diurnal organisms, including humans, have periods longer than 24 hours; they therefore tend to have a larger <b>advance</b> <b>zone</b> in their PRC. Nocturnal animals, on the other hand, often have periods shorter than 24hr; they thus have a larger delay zone.|$|R
40|$|Abstract About 15 % of the {{legally blind}} {{completely}} lack light perception. Most {{of these individuals}} have abnormally phased circadian rhythms and many free-run. Light treatment {{is not an option}} for them. However, melatonin treatment can be highly effective. Adaily dose of 0. 5 mg of melatonin usually results in entrain-ment. It has been suggested that treatment in individuals with circadian periods> 24 h should be initiated on the <b>advance</b> <b>zone</b> of the melatonin phase response curve, which was based on findings in which melatonin initiated on the delay zone were less likely to result in entrainment, even though treatment continued across all circadian phases. In the present study, 7 totally blind people started low-dose melatonin treatment (0. 5 mg; 1 person was given 0. 05 mg) on the delay zone. All entrained as circadian phase free-ran and the <b>advance</b> <b>zone</b> of the melatonin phase response curve coincided with the time of melatonin adminis-tration. These results are consistent with studies in other mammals. It does not appear that low-dose melatonin treatment needs to be initiated on the <b>advance</b> <b>zone</b> to induce eventual entrainment in blind people with free-running rhythms> 24 h. Therefore, it is not essential that circadian phase be ascertained before starting low-dose melatonin treatment of blind people...|$|R

40|$|Under the {{conditions}} normally used for detritylation in oligonucleotide synthesis, the haloacetic acid binds strongly to the oligonucleotide. Acetonitrile also forms a complex with the deblocking acid, {{in competition with}} the oligonucleotide, and drastically slows detritylation. Incomplete removal of acetonitrile during the deblock step may slow the kinetics enough to result in incomplete detritylation of the oligonucleotide. Acid binding to the growing oligonucleotide causes striking chromatographic effects {{in the presence of}} high oligonucleotide mass densities. In packed-bed column reactors, at low linear velocities, the acid binding almost completely depletes free acid from the deblocking solution. This results in an <b>advancing</b> <b>zone</b> within which the oligonucleotide is saturated with acid.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Infection {{courts for}} {{microorganisms}} invading white fir heartwood {{were determined to}} be primarily branches and basal wounds. Of 11 hymenomycetes isolated from infected trees, only four: Echinodontiurn tinctorium, Phellinus chrysoloma, Pholiota adiposa, and Hericium abietis were of major significance in terms of frequency of infection and damage caused. Two or more hyrnenomycetous fungi were commonly isolated from a single decay column. Where this occurred decay was more extensive than that caused by a single hymenomycete. Hericium abietis was a common associate of F. tinctorium and other hymenomycetes. Decay columns in white fir were typically cylindrical in shape and had three distinct zones of discoloration and deterioration. These included advanced, incipient and early decay. The progression of decay stages horizontally across the grain and vertically at the lower and upper ends of columns was from the <b>advanced</b> <b>zone</b> at the center through incipient to early decay to sound wood. Results of cultural isolation of microorganisms from the decay zones indicated that a succession of microorganisms occurs as decay progresses in white fir heartwood. Bacteria were the primary organisms isolated from the early decay zone. A consistent microflora of bacteria and fungi was isolated from the incipient and advanced stages of decay. Bacteria apparently are the initial colonizers of heartwood followed by the fungi. The hymenomycetous fungi responsible for causing 173 of the 513 decay columns were either unidentifiable in culture or in most cases they were not isolated. These decay columns were small, the causal fungi appeared to have died or become inactive. Limiting factors {{are thought to be}} competition by other microorganisms or unfavorable air or moisture conditions accompanying healing of infection courts. Non-hymenomycetes identified included: Phialophora fastigiata and Phialophora spp., Cladosporium herbarum, Gliocladium roseum, and Rhinocladiella atrovirens. No successional pattern was detected among those identified. Most bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. A few Bacillus species were found. Species of nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated from decay in 31 white fir trees distributed among 16 areas. Evidence of N 2 - fixation by these bacteria was initially obtained by acetylene reduction then confirmed by use of 15 N 2 and by total nitrogen analyses. Bacteria fixing N 2 were associated with the major decay fungi during all stages of attack on the white firs. High populations (1 O^ 5 to 10 ^ 6 /ml expressed sap) of N 2 -fixing bacteria were associated with the early and incipient stages of decay caused by P. chrysoloma and H. abietis, but not E tinctorium Population data are considered preliminary because of the limited sample. Many of these bacteria were identified as typical or atypical isolates of Enterobacter agglomerans, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae and Kiebsiella pneurnoniae. Identifications based on phenotypic properties were confirmed by percent guanine plus cytosine base composition analyses of selected isolates. Phenotypic properties of many N 2 -fixing bacteria did not conform with published descriptions. Since most differences were negative responses none of the aberrant strains were considered new species. Two methods were developed for estimating defect in standing white fir trees in southwestern Oregon (1) Defect percentages of gross merchantable volumes (Scribner and International board-foot and cubic-foot) are tabulated by d. b. h and age. Then constant defect percentages are added for various indicators. Multiple regression equations used to derive the indicator defect percentage tables are given. (2) Average length deductions below and above various indicators are given along with flat percentage factors for hidden defect. The first method was considered to be the most accurate and objective. Statistical analysis indicated that the first method can be used to estimate defect in white fir in three cover types in which this species occurs in southwestern Oregon...|$|E

40|$|This paper elaborates and visualizes {{processes}} {{recorded in}} a recent regional and multi-site study of elevational treeline dynamics during the period 1915 to 2007 in the Swedish Scandes. The purpose is to give a concrete face of the landscape transformation which {{is associated with the}} recorded treeline shifts. The main focus is on stand-level structure of past and present treelines and the <b>advance</b> <b>zones,</b> where climate change elicited responses by Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris. All species shifted their treelines upslope by a maximum of c. 200 m in elevation. Most sites, however, manifested changes of smaller magnitudes. This relates to topoclimatic constraints which decouple treeline performance from the macroclimate. The general character of sites which support large and small treeline shifts, respectively, are outlined. The spacing, age structure, growth rates of the tree <b>advance</b> <b>zones</b> are accounted for each of the concerned species. In temporal and spatial detail, the different tree species responded individualistically according to their specific ecologies. Current spread of young seedlings and saplings to increasingly higher elevations in the alpine tundra is particularly highlighted as it may represent the forefront of future treeline advance. It is argued that the current evolution of the treeline ecotone represents a fundamental, although not necessarily entirely unique, reversal of the long-term (Holocene) trend of neoglacial treeline descent...|$|R
