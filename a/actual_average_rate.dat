Since, packets can arrive at any lower rate, this is an upper bound, rather than a fixed value, so it could at best be called the maximum for the average rate. Also, during the time the maximum burstiness occurs, packets can arrive with smaller intervals and thus {{a higher rate than}} this. So, for any period less than infinity, the <b>actual</b> <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> can be (but isn’t necessarily) greater than this and the average interval can be (but isn’t necessarily) less than the emission interval. Hence, because of this ambiguity, the term emission interval is used hereafter.

40|$|We {{employ the}} EU KLEMS {{database}} {{to estimate the}} real rate of return to capital in 14 countries (11 in the EU, three outside the EU) in 10 branches of the market economy plus the market economy as a whole. Our measure of capital is an aggregate over seven types of asset: three ICT assets (computers, communications equipment, and software) and four non-ICT assets (machinery and equipment, nonresidential structures, transport equipment, and other). The real rate of return in the market economy does not vary very much across countries, {{with the exception of}} Spain where it is exceptionally high and in Italy where it is exceptionally low. The real rate appears to be trendless in most countries. Within each country however, the rate varies widely across the 10 branches, often being implausibly high or low. We also estimate the growth of capital services by two different methods: ex-post and exante, and the contribution of capital to output growth by three methods: ex-post, ex-ante and hybrid. Our implementation of the ex-ante method uses an estimate of the required rate of return for each country instead of the <b>actual,</b> <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> of return to calculate user costs and also employs the expected growth of asset prices rather than the actual growth. These estimates are derived from exactly the same data as for the ex-post method, ie without any extraneous data being employed. For estimating the contribution of capital to output growth, the ex-ante method uses ex-ante profit as the weight, while both the ex-post and the hybrid method use ex-post profit. We find that the three methods produce very similar results at the market economy level. But differences are much larger at the branch level, particularly between the ex-post and ex-ante methods.

40|$|Purpose – Some {{members of}} Congress in the USA have {{expressed}} serious concern that endowment spending rates of major American universities are too low. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to derive optimal spending rates and compare them with actual rates to determine if this concern is warranted. Design/methodology/approach – A Cobb-Douglas utility function is used to represent the trade-off between current spending and endowment (which allows more future spending). Maximization of this function subject to relevant constraints yields a formula for the optimal endowment spending rate, which takes the form of a difference equation. The steady-state solution to this difference equation is explored, along with the nature of convergence to the steady-state. Relevant data are obtained from American universities with endowments over $ 500 million in 2007 to determine the optimal spending rates implied by the theory. These optimal rates are then compared with <b>actual</b> <b>average</b> spending <b>rates.</b> Findings – <b>Actual</b> <b>average</b> spending <b>rates</b> are just below 5 per cent, which is well below the optimal rates of 7 - 8 per cent implied by the theory. Practical implications – The results provide some support for regulations mandating minimum <b>average</b> spending <b>rates</b> from university endowments over time. Originality/value – This paper is the first to model this problem using a theoretical framework that closely parallels the actual trade-off considered by university investment managers, and it is the first to compare actual and theoretically optimal rates of endowment spending.

This apparent decrease in sediment deposition {{has been attributed to}} completeness of the sedimentary record; the effect arises because of incorporation of longer hiatuses in deposition as averaging time is increased.

Using the two-dimensional model as the more accurate one we compared both models by studying {{the influence of the}} design and operating variables on the conditions in the hot spot of the reactor. The effects were studied on an analytical basis, and a relation is derived that describes the radial temperature profile in the hot spot of the reactor. In the first section we present the model equations and discuss the results obtained from a numerical evaluation. In the second section we compare mean and maximum radial temperatures and reaction rates in case a single exothermic reaction is carried out. We conclude that—for reactors operating in the steady state—in the hot spot the one-dimensional model predicts the proper temperature when it is compared with the average temperature calculated by the two-dimensional model, although large differences may arise between maximum and mean radial temperature. A new method is presented to obtain the maximum radial temperature in the hot spot directly from the results of the one-dimensional model.

Next, we show that whenever the government chooses the optimum provision for the publicly provided good the tax revenue function has a negatively-sloped part with respect to tax rates except for one case. Last, we consider Brazilian data - PNAD - from 1976 to 2008 to test our theoretical implications.

40|$|Subsidence {{caused by}} {{extraction}} of hydrocarbons and solution salt mining is a sensitive {{issue in the}} Netherlands. An extensive legal, technical and organisational framework is in place to ensure a high probability that such subsidence will stay within predefined limits. The key question is: how much subsidence is acceptable and at which rate? And: {{how can it be}} reliably assured that (future) subsidence will stay within these limits? To address the issue for the Wadden Sea area, the concept of ‘effective subsidence capacity’ is used. To determine the ‘effective subsidence capacity’, the maximum volumetric rate of relative sea-level rise, that can be accommodated in the long term, without environmental harm, is established first. The volume of sediment that can be transported and deposited by nature into the tidal basin where the subsidence is expected, ultimately determines this ‘limit of acceptable average subsidence rate’. The capability of the tidal basins to ‘capture’ sediment over the lunar cycle period of 18. 6 years is the overall rate-determining step. Effective subsidence capacity is then the maximum <b>average</b> subsidence <b>rate</b> available for planning of human activities. It is obtained by subtracting the subsidence volume rate ‘consumed’ by natural relative subsidence in the area (sealevel rise plus natural shallow compaction) from the total long-term acceptable subsidence volume rate limit. In the operational procedure for mining companies, six-years-average expectation values of subsidence rates are used to calculate the maximum allowable production rates. This is done under the provision that production will be reduced or halted if the expected or actual subsidence rate (natural + man induced) is likely to exceed the limit of acceptable subsidence. Monitoring and management schemes ensure that predicted (6 -year <b>average)</b> and <b>actual</b> (18. 6 -year <b>average)</b> subsidence <b>rates</b> stay within the limit of acceptable subsidence rate and that no damage is caused to the protected nature. A GPS based early warning system is used for early detection of unexpected behaviour. In support of SSM (State Supervision of Mines, the government regulator), TNO-AGE (an independent government advisory group) applies an independent Bayesian statistical analysis of all data, as they become available, to calculate the probability of scenario’s under which future subsidence will exceed the defined limits. It is external to the operator’s annual measurement and control loop and ensures that preventive actions can be taken in time in case such scenarios emerge. Regular communication keeps the authorities and the general public informed {{on the use of the}} effective subsidence capacity to demonstrate that the <b>actual</b> <b>average</b> subsidence <b>rate</b> stays strictly within the defined bounds and that, from a scientific point of view, there is no reasonable doubt that damage to the tidal system will not occur now or in the future...|$|R

By making a comparative analysis, we find that many of the peculiarities are model-wide problems. ^ In the third essay, we analyze a central bank 2 ̆ 7 s optimal monetary policy rules using a simple open-economy model with an endogenous exchange risk premium. One notable feature of the model as well as a major departure from previous theoretical literature is that a balance of payments equation, which highlights the relationship between the current account and capital account, is used as an important linkage between the domestic economy {{and the rest of the}} world. In particular, this balance of payments equation under our model framework implies an endogenous exchange risk premium. Hence, the model overcomes the drawbacks of assuming an exogenous autoregressive exchange risk premium or assuming uncovered interest parity (UIP), which in general does not hold according to considerable empirical evidence. More importantly, the persistence of the endogenous risk premium shown in our model matches previous findings about risk premium patterns. ...|$|R
