5|$|Quagmire {{returns home}} from a holiday in Florida and comes to the Griffins' house to tell Peter that he has smuggled some {{fireworks}} into Quahog by hiding them in his anus. Peter tells him that fireworks aren't illegal in Quahog, so he didn't need to hide them and could have just brought them in normally, but Quagmire doesn't see <b>any</b> <b>fun</b> in doing that. Later on, the Griffins and Quagmire start {{to play with the}} fireworks. Peter attaches ten M-80s together and shows Quagmire, but they explode, detaching all the fingers from his right hand. With Joe's help, Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them reattached to his hand. The next day, Peter celebrates getting his fingers reattached by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire, and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes. Peter is behind on his work at the brewery, as he is unable to type due to his hand injury, and Angela threatens him with the prospect of being fired if he fails to catch up, so he asks Lois to help him. When Lois agrees to help Peter catch up with his work, Peter attempts to seduce her numerous times. Later at the brewery, after a final attempt to seduce Lois in his office, she gives in and they have sex in front of their co-worker Opie, who runs away screaming. In the end, Peter is caught up with his work and enjoys having Lois help out and have sex with him.|$|E
500|$|Strategy Informer {{felt the}} game had updated and {{improved}} upon the original, noting better controls, more forgiving health bars and save points, and more engaging mission goals. The reviewer criticised the poor translations and perceived bordeline ethnic stereotypes in the enemy characters. Overall the reviewer {{was impressed by}} the game, saying [...] "in the end CF3 far exceeded my expectations". Metro had some praise for the graphics but complained of a lack of <b>any</b> <b>fun</b> and poor camera, controls and level design. The reviewer called the translated dialogue worse than that of Zero Wing. Greece's PC Master praised the game as enjoyable and while somewhat repetitive, a successful update of the Cannon Fodder series. Czech website Games.cz criticised the game as a failure, with poor graphics, music, sound effects and immature, unimpressive humour, saying the game would only be worth buying at a lower price.|$|E
500|$|She {{was educated}} at Monk's Walk School, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Dixon's parents split up when Dixon was four and Dixon's father moved away, {{resulting}} in Dixon later describing her family life as [...] "very dysfunctional". Between {{the ages of}} eight and ten, Dixon witnessed her mother suffer domestic violence from her partner; she only spoke publicly about the issue 21 years later, in 2010. Dixon created a documentary for the BBC, Don't Hit My Mum, regarding the issue of domestic abuse from a child's perspective, and remarked upon her own childhood: [...] "When I think about that time, I don't remember living in harmony, I don't remember <b>any</b> <b>fun</b> times, I suppose because the negativity has clouded it. The negative times and the scary times have blocked anything that was good... I believe that every child {{has the right to}} grow up in an environment where they feel secure and fearless going into the world, and I didn't really feel that".|$|E

500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know I {{would not have been}} back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't <b>any</b> <b>fun,</b> and I got tired of working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.|$|E
500|$|Developers {{originally}} intended for players to be permanently {{out of a}} race when falling far off a track, however they {{came to realize that}} it was not fun for players [...] "to be forced to go slow or suffer an instant defeat." [...] An attempt was made to give three [...] "strikes" [...] to a rider. [...] Once the rider fell for the third time they were out of the race. [...] However once implemented developers noticed that the number of racers remaining {{at the end of the}} race was too random to be deemed <b>any</b> <b>fun.</b> [...] In the end the decision was made to simply respawn the character on the track. The PC version was ported in large part by John Olsen, who worked on the port as his first task at SingleTrac. [...] The PC version also features 3Dfx hardware acceleration, which allows for higher resolution gameplay and visual enhancements such as reflective water. [...] Axiom Design created the user interface shell for the game, which has a comic book-inspired feel. The music for Jet Moto was produced by Big Idea Music Productions.|$|E
500|$|Hawks's {{first film}} The Road to Glory {{was based on}} a 35-page {{treatment}} that Hawks wrote and is one of only two Hawks works that are lost films. The film starred May McAvoy as a young woman who is gradually going blind and tries to spare the two men in her life from the burden of her illness. The two men are her boyfriend Rockliffe Fellowes and her father Ford Sterling, with Leslie Fenton playing the greedy rich man whom she agrees to live with in order to get away from her father and lover. The film contained religious iconography and messages that would never again be seen in a Hawks film. It was shot from December 1925 to January 1926 and premiered in April. It received good reviews from film critics. In later interviews, Hawks said, [...] "It didn't have <b>any</b> <b>fun</b> in it. It was pretty bad. I don't think anybody enjoyed it except a few critics." [...] Hawks was dissatisfied with the film after being certain that dramatic films would establish his reputation, but realized what he had done wrong when Sol Wurtzel told Hawks, [...] "Look, you've shown you can make a picture, but for God's sake, go out and make entertainment." ...|$|E

[...] and finishing with, [...] "What you're left with is a band that alternates between sounding {{like a bunch of}} unified rockers and a group that's just not having <b>any</b> <b>fun.</b> It's a solid effort, but in the end, should it have been such hard work?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Maggie Lee of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "a visual dazzler and a {{dramatic}} non-starter." [...] Elizabeth Kerr of The Hollywood Reporter called the film [...] "a thrill ride {{in need of}} a few more thrills." [...] Norl Murray of the Los Angeles Times remarked that [...] "while Bigelow's version featured charismatic lead performances and ample pop, Core's cast mumbles slowly and sparingly at one another until it's time to jump off something." [...] The A.V. Clubs Ignatiy Vishnevetsky said: [...] "Boldly reimagining Kathryn Bigelow’s cult favorite as a movie where absolutely nobody seems to be having <b>any</b> <b>fun,</b> the new Point Break drops the original’s Zen-like balance of macho mysticism and camp in favor of dour humorlessness." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1994, Farrar called Tony Margherita to {{tell him}} that the band was {{breaking}} up, saying that he was not having <b>any</b> <b>fun</b> in the band anymore and was not getting along with Tweedy. Tweedy was enraged that Farrar decided to break up the band without notifying him, and this led to a series of harsh verbal exchanges. Farrar and Tweedy agreed to a final Uncle Tupelo tour, but the concerts were marred by the two not participating in each other's songs. The band decided to play Tweedy's [...] "The Long Cut" [...] on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, which further distanced Farrar and Tweedy. Farrar began to assemble a new band named Son Volt with Mike Heidorn, bassist Jim Boquist, and his brother Dave Boquist. At the same time, Jeff Tweedy formed Wilco with Stirratt, Johnston, and Coomer.|$|E
2500|$|It {{takes over}} one hour for Marinol to reach full {{systemic}} effect, compared to seconds or minutes for smoked or vaporized cannabis. Some people accustomed to inhaling just enough cannabis smoke to manage symptoms have complained of too-intense intoxication from Marinol's predetermined dosages. Many people using Marinol {{have said that}} Marinol produces a more acute psychedelic effect than cannabis, {{and it has been}} speculated that this disparity {{can be explained by the}} moderating effect of the many non-THC cannabinoids present in cannabis. For that reason, alternative THC-containing medications based on botanical extracts of the cannabis plant such as nabiximols are being developed. Mark Kleiman, director of the Drug Policy Analysis Program at UCLA's School of Public Affairs said of Marinol, [...] "It wasn't <b>any</b> <b>fun</b> and made the user feel bad, so it could be approved without any fear that it would penetrate the recreational market, and then used as a club with which to beat back the advocates of whole cannabis as a medicine." [...] Mr. Kleiman's opinion notwithstanding, clinical trials comparing the use of cannabis extracts with Marinol in the treatment of cancer cachexia have demonstrated equal efficacy and well-being among subjects in the two treatment arms. United States federal law currently registers dronabinol as a Schedule III controlled substance, but all other cannabinoids remain Schedule I, except synthetics like nabilone.|$|E
2500|$|PlayStation Official Magazine {{gave the}} game an above-average 7 out of 10, complimenting the core {{shooting}} and production values, but criticizing its repetitive nature: [...] "A Star Wars-themed 3D shooter with some optional bounty hunting. Good fun, but it promised more." [...] IGN awarded the GameCube {{version of the}} game 8.3 out of 10, and the PS2 version 8.2. Praising the graphics, sound, length and level designs, they criticized {{the implementation of the}} bounty hunting system; [...] "The whole process is pretty clunky, and there should have been a way to streamline this to make it more fluid - especially in the heat of a battle when your mark is mixed in with four or five other opponents. It works the way it is for sure, but it certainly could have been fixed to be more intuitive than it currently is." [...] In the end, however, they found the game {{to be one of the}} better Star Wars tie-in games; [...] "Star Wars Bounty Hunter is a solid, if not technically challenged third-person action/adventure. Successfully combining our favorite aspects of the Star Wars universe with a clever stage design and a fantastic presentation, LucasArts has done a great job in suppressing the myth that games based on the Skywalker universe aren't <b>any</b> <b>fun.</b> A definite recommendation for Star Wars fans, Bounty Hunter isn't necessarily built for everyone, but for those of you out there who just can't get enough of this stuff, it's one of your better choices for this or any holiday season." ...|$|E
