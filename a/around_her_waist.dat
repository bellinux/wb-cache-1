5|$|Parvati has a well-developed, round bosom and {{a narrow}} {{feminine}} waist embellished with various haras (religious bracelets) and other ornaments, made of diamonds and other gems. She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the male {{part of the}} icon. The torso, hip and pelvis of the female is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves. Though the male private parts may be depicted, the female genitalia are never depicted and the loins are always draped. She wears a multi-coloured or white silken garment down to her ankle and one or three girdles <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> The left half wears an anklet and her foot is painted red with henna. The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight, resting on a lotus pedestal. In contrast to the Shiva half, the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle, parrot-green or dark in colour. She may be draped in a sari covering her torso and legs.|$|E

25|$|Beginning on 11 February 1858, a 14-year-old peasant {{girl named}} Bernadette Soubirous {{claimed to have}} {{experienced}} a series of apparitions of a girl dressed in white and with a blue belt <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> who eventually introduced herself as the Immaculate Conception, a name by which the Virgin Mary was known.|$|E
25|$|Soubirous {{described}} {{that the}} apparition as {{dressed in a}} flowing white robe, with a blue sash <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> This was the uniform of a religious group called the Children of Mary, which, on account of her poverty, Soubirous was not permitted to join (although she was admitted after the apparitions). Her Aunt Bernarde was a long-time member.|$|E
25|$|The Saga of Eric the Red further relates {{that around}} her neck she wore a {{necklace}} of glass pearls, and on her head she wore a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white cat skin. <b>Around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> she wore a belt of amadou from which hung a large pouch, where she hid the tools that she used during the seiðr. On her feet she wore shoes of calfskin and the shoelaces had brass knobs in the ends, and on her hands she wore gloves of cat skin, which were white and fluffy inside.|$|E

25|$|Dann was {{prevented}} from leaving the area by car because {{the roads were}} closed for a funeral cortege. She decided to drive her car backwards down the nearby street, but the road dead-ended into a private drive. Abandoning her car, she removed her bloodstained shorts and tied a blue garbage bag <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> With her two remaining guns {{she made her way}} through the woods and came upon the house of the Andrew family. Dann entered the house and met a mother and her twenty-year-old son, who were in the kitchen. She claimed she was raped and had shot the rapist in the struggle.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} on the Born This Way Ball and [...] tours; in the latter she dressed up in a polka-dotted rubber outfit with tentacles growing out <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> and her head. Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described her look as [...] "she had an inflatable rubber order of fried calamari growing out of her spine", while Adam Carlson from Billboard said that the outfit made Gaga look like a [...] "dancing Ursula from The Little Mermaid". In 2017, the song was added to the setlist of the Joanne World Tour. The performance ends with a choreographed attack on Gaga by her dancers.|$|E
500|$|In the 1996 game Valentine wears {{a police}} uniform {{consisting}} of combat boots, tactical pants, a tight-fitting blue shirt, shoulder pads and a beret. She {{was not used}} in the 1998 sequel, Resident Evil 2, because the production team felt the game would be more frightening with new characters, but she returned as the sole protagonist of the 1999 title, [...] In that game, she wears a blue tube top, black miniskirt, knee-high boots, and white sweater wrapped <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> The reason given by Capcom for her informal clothing is that she had just resigned from her professional duties before escaping a city overrun by zombies.|$|E
60|$|She {{walked with}} a Southern girl's undulating languor to the door, opened it, then charged {{suddenly}} upon Octavia Dean, twirled her round in a wild waltz and bore her away; appearing a moment after on the playground demurely walking with <b>her</b> arm <b>around</b> <b>her</b> companion's <b>waist</b> in an ostentatious confidence at once lofty, exclusive, and exasperating to the smaller children.|$|R
5000|$|Like both Pipa Jing and Daji, Zhiji Jing is one {{of three}} specters under Nu Wa. In appearance, Zhiji Jing wore a large red robe, a silk sash <b>around</b> <b>her</b> slim <b>waist,</b> and small red linen shoes. She also possessed {{beautiful}} eyes like that of an autumn lake. Once Daji headed to the tomb of the Yellow Emperor to retrieve Zhiji Jing - along with her other fox cohorts - Zhiji Jing would be shown for the first time.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a moment}} of silence. The drone of a bumble-bee near by seemed to make the silence swim drowsily in their ears; far off they heard the faint beat of a woodpecker. The {{suggestion}} of their kneeling figures in this magic mirror was vague, unreasoning, yet for the moment none the less irresistible. His arm instinctively crept <b>around</b> <b>her</b> little <b>waist</b> as he whispered,--he scarce knew what he said,--"Perhaps here is the treasure I am seeking." ...|$|R

[...] In the video, a [...] "smiley" [...] Gomez is seen in a black crop top and shorts with a flannel shirt <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> and is shown singing the song with her friends in a dark room.

Within the first 24 hours of being released, the video had garnered over a million views.|$|E
500|$|On April 21, 1913, Phagan {{was laid}} off due to a {{shortage}} of brass sheet metal. Around noon on April 26, {{she went to the}} factory to claim her pay of $1.20. The next day, shortly before 3:00a.m., the factory's night watchman, Newt Lee, went to the factory basement to use the toilet. After leaving the toilet, Lee discovered Phagan's body {{in the rear of the}} basement near an incinerator and called the police. Her dress was up <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> and a strip from her petticoat had been torn off and wrapped around her neck. Her face was blackened and scratched, and her head was bruised and battered. A [...] strip of [...] wrapping cord was tied into a loop around her neck, buried [...] deep, showing that she had been strangled. Her underwear was still around her hips, but stained with blood and torn open. Her skin was covered with ashes and dirt from the floor, initially making it appear to responding officers that she and her assailant had struggled in the basement.|$|E
500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall. I just sat there and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account. On 17 March 2014, the music video was released via Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube, and was made available for consumption on the iTunes Store the next day.|$|E

'That horrid old Miss Catherine has been here again, I'm sure, for I saw her going out of the shop just now, and she's been saying something or other spiteful, as she always does, to vex my dearie.

50|$|Carved {{in white}} sandstone, the almost nude {{figure of the}} yakshi figure is shown {{clasping}} onto {{the branches of a}} tree with her arms, with her right leg wrapped around its trunk. She is weighed down with ornate jewellery <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck, <b>waist</b> and ankles. The sculpture also acted as an architectural bracket, supporting a long sandstone beam that once ran above the yakshi's head. The Shalabhanjika Yakshi thus served two purposes: as a fertility symbol associated with the vitality of the fruit-bearing tree and as a structural element supporting the whole configuration of the gateway.|$|R

2500|$|Shajar al-Durr {{claimed that}} Aybak died {{suddenly}} {{during the night}} but his Mamluks (Mu'iziyya), led by Qutuz, did not believe her and the servants involved confessed under torture. Shajar al-Durr and the servants were arrested and Aybak's Mamluks (the Mu'iziyya Mamluks) wanted to kill her, but the Salihyya Mamluks protected {{her and she was}} taken to the Red Tower where she stayed. The son of Aybak, the 15-year-old al-Mansur Ali, was installed by the Mu'ziyyah Mamluks as the new Sultan. Shajar al-Durr was stripped and beaten to death with clogs by the bondmaids of al-Mansur Ali and his mother. [...] Her naked body was found lying outside the Citadel. According to the historian Ibn Iyas, Shajar al- Durr was dragged from her feet and thrown from the top naked, with a cloth <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> She stayed in the moat for three days, unburied, until one night a mob came and took off the cloth <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> because it was silk with pearls and had a smell of musk. The servants {{who were involved in the}} killing of Aybak were executed.|$|E
2500|$|Dancer David Atkins was {{originally}} cast as Billy Kwan. However, during rehearsals Weir {{began to feel}} that the relationship between his character and Mel Gibson's was not working so he decided to recast. Several actors auditioned, including Bob Balaban and Wallace Shawn, when Weir saw a photo of Linda Hunt. He asked for her to audition and decided to cast her. To accomplish the role during production, Hunt shortened [...] "her hair and dye it black wore padding <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> shaved her eyebrows, and carried something in her shirt pocket." [...] In her 1986 interview with Bomb magazine, Hunt remarked that Billy Kwan [...] "is supra-personal [...] layers of sexual ambiguity" ...|$|E

In subsequent visitations she heard the lady speak to her, saying Que soy era Immaculada Concepciou (I am the Immaculate Conception), and asking that a chapel be built there. At first ridiculed, questioned, and belittled by Church officials and other contemporaries, Soubirous insisted on her vision. Eventually the Church believed {{her and she was}} canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1933.|$|E
60|$|Mabel Holmes turned weakly {{toward her}} sister, as though all the fatigue of her great journey had {{suddenly}} descended on her.

Uncongenial as the two had been, Jason Jones was her father--her only {{remaining}} parent--and the suddenness of his death shocked and horrified the girl.

2500|$|Consuelo Vanderbilt {{was largely}} {{dominated}} by her mother, who {{was determined that}} her daughter {{would make a great}} marriage like that of her famous namesake. In her autobiography, Consuelo Vanderbilt described how she was required to wear a steel rod, which ran down her spine and fastened <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> and over her shoulders, to improve her posture. She was educated entirely at home by governesses and tutors and learned foreign languages at an early age. Her mother was a strict disciplinarian and whipped her with a riding crop for minor infractions. When, as a teenager, Consuelo objected to the clothing her mother had selected for her, Alva told her that [...] "I do the thinking, you do as you are told." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the ninth}} season finale, [...] "Till Death Do Us Part", a bomb is planted by {{domestic}} terrorist Harper Dearing.

[...] and eloping instead of dealing with all the fuss. Later, when the Navy Yard is seconds from exploding, Ziva refuses to leave the building without Tony. The bomb goes off while they {{are still in the}} elevator; Ziva and Tony fall to the ground, with Tony's arm <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> and their free hands clasped tightly as the elevator appears to crash.|$|E
2500|$|Linda and Noor {{were sitting}} on a {{two-seater}} couch with Charlotte sitting on the arm, when Noor started touching Linda in a sexual way.

Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their mother looked on but didn't participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times.

5000|$|The next morning, a {{televised}} 20-minute farewell {{speech to the}} White House staff {{took place in the}} East Room, during which the President read from Theodore Roosevelts biography and praised his own parents. The First Lady could hardly contain her tears; she was most upset about the cameras, because they recorded her anguish, as they had during the 1960 election defeat. The Nixons walked onto the Executive Mansions South Lawn with Vice President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford to Marine One.

I remember that the other day, when we passed the shanty of that Pike County family on the slope, there were three women at the door, and one of them said something that made poor little Kearney turn white and pink alternately, and dance with suppressed rage. I suppose the old lady--M'Corkle, that's her name--would like to have a share of our cavaliers for her Euphemy and Mamie. I dare say it's only right; I would lend them the cherub occasionally, and you might let them have Mr. Munroe twice a week." ...|$|R
