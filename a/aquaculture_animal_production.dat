40|$|Detrimental host-pathogen {{interactions}} are a normal phenomenon in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production,</b> {{and have been}} counteracted by prophylactic use of antibiotics. Especially, the youngest life stages of cultivated aquatic animals are susceptible to pathogen invasion, resulting in disease and mortality. To establish a more sustainable aquatic food production, {{there is a need}} for new microbial management strategies that focus on 'join them' and not the traditional 'beat them' approaches. We argue that ecological theory could serve as a foundation for developing sustainable microbial management methods that prevent pathogenic disease in larviculture. Management of the water microbiota in aquaculture systems according to ecological selection principles has been shown to decrease opportunistic pathogen pressure and to result in an improved performance of the cultured animals. We hypothesize that manipulation of the biodiversity of the gut microbiota can increase the host's resistance against pathogenic invasion and infection. However, substantial barriers need to be overcome before active management of the intestinal microbiota can effectively be applied in larviculture...|$|E
40|$|Sewage {{and other}} forms of wastewaters (<b>aquaculture,</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production)</b> have {{traditionally}} been considered an undesirable product of society that must be disposed of in the most expeditious way. To protect the environment and public health, US regulations, require the treatment of wastewater to remove its organic composition and disinfection to kill its pathogenic (bacteria, protozoans, and viruses) content before it can be discharged into the environment (rivers, lakes, oceans) or reclaimed for beneficial uses. Historically, chlorine has been the disinfectant of choice. However, continued use of chlorine is now being discouraged for two reasons. First, use, transportation and storage of chlorine are hazardous activities and have resulted in many accidents. Second, use of chlorine {{has been shown to be}} detrimental to the health of people and aquatic organisms because of the formation of chlorine by-products which are toxic or are carcinogenic. As a result, there has been search for an alternative disinfectant. A critical regional water problem is to find a disinfectant which is not only effective but safe for people who handle the system and safe for the environment. A relatively new disinfectant process which does not have the above problems associated with chlorine i...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of skeletal anomalies {{could be used}} as an indicator of the "quality" of rearing conditions as these anomalies are thought to result from the inability of homeostatic mechanisms to compensate for environmentally-induced stress and/or altered genetic factors. Identification of rearing conditions that lower the rate of anomalies can be an important step toward profitable aquaculture as malformed market-size fish have to be discarded, thus reducing fish farmers' profits. In this study, the occurrence of skeletal anomalies in adult rainbow trout grown under intensive and organic conditions was monitored. As organic <b>aquaculture</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> is in its early stages, organic broodstock is not available in sufficient quantities. Non-organic juveniles could, therefore, be used for on-growing purposes in organic aquaculture production cycle. Thus, the adult fish analysed in this study experienced intensive conditions during juvenile rearing. Significant differences in the pattern of anomalies were detected between organically and intensively-ongrown specimens, although the occurrence of severe, commercially important anomalies, affecting 2 - 12. 5 % of individuals, was comparable in the two systems. Thus, organic aquaculture needs to be improved in order to significantly reduce the {{incidence of}} severe anomalies in rainbow trout...|$|E

40|$|Forages are {{essential}} for the successful operation of <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> systems. This is more relevant to ruminants which are heavily dependant upon forages for their health and production in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. While forages are an economical source of nutrients for <b>animal</b> <b>production,</b> they also help conserve the soil integrity, water supply and air quality. Although the role of these forages for <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> could vary depending upon the regional preferences for the animal and forage species, climate and resources, their importance {{in the success of}} ruminant production is acknowledged. However with the increasing global human population and urbanisation, the sustainability of forage based <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> systems is sometimes questioned due to the interrelationship between <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> and the environment. It is therefore vital to examine the suitability of these systems for their place in the future to supply quality food which is safe for human consumption and available at a competitive price to the growing human population. Grassland and forage crops are recognised for their contribution to the environment, recreation and efficiency of meat and milk production,. To maintain sustainability, it is crucial that such farming systems remain profitable and environmentally friendly while producing nutritious foods of high economical value. Thus, it is pertinent to improve the nutritive value of grasses and other forage plants in order to enhance <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> to obtain quality food. It is also vital to develop new forages which are efficiently utilised and wasted less by involving efficient animals. A combination of forage legumes, fresh or conserved grasses, crop residues and other feeds could help develop an <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> system which is economically efficient, beneficial and viable. Also, it is crucial to use efficient animals, improved forage conservation methods, better manure handling, and minimum fertilisers to maximise <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> without damaging the environment. The sensible use of supplements and herbal additives as the desirable alternatives to the conventional growth promoters could also help optimise the ruminant production. This paper examines the opportunities and obstacles which may affect the development of more desirable and sustainable <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> systems for the future...|$|R
