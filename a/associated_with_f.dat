Even more vines and {{understory}} trees {{are associated with}} this species, such as eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis), strawberry bush (Euonymus americanus), Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Herbs associated with the species include the prostrate ticktrefoil (Desmodium rotundifolium), Christmas fern (Polystichum acrostichoides) and ebony spleenwort (Asplenium platyneuron). The canopy of trees {{that are associated with}} this species are important for its survival, though if the canopy becomes too dense the plant may not flower as well. When the plants do flower, they contain large nectaries, which aid in pollination.|$|E
50|$|This Impromptu {{contains}} interesting hemiola effects (where two bars {{of three}} beats seem to become three bars of two beats), brilliant passagework {{as well as}} cross modulations that take this piece to keys not traditionally <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>F</b> minor, such as A-flat minor (for instance, in bar 111), C-flat major (as in bar 142), and A major (bar 165). It is written roughly in Rondo form and contains a coda that further heightens the drama in this already intense piece. The work is the most technically demanding of the Impromptus, employing {{a wide variety of}} keyboard writing, including scale runs (at times in unison), arpeggios, broken chords, quick passages in thirds, and trills. Extreme harmonic and rhythmic effects, combined with demonically charming melodies, make this a dazzling and fascinating display of keyboard facility.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effects of inhaled Mg alone and <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>F</b> {{in the treatment of}} bronchial hyperresponsiveness. 43 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups and exposed to inhaled NaCl 0. 9 %, MeCh, MgSO 4 and MgF 2. Pulmonary changes were assessed by means of functional tests and quantitative histological examination of lungs and trachea. Results revealed that delivery of inhaled Mg <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>F</b> led to a significant decrease of total lung resistance better than inhaled Mg alone (p< 0. 05). Histological examinations illustrated that inhaled Mg <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>F</b> markedly suppressed muscular hypertrophy (p= 0. 034) and bronchoconstriction (p= 0. 006) in MeCh treated rats better than inhaled Mg alone. No histological changes were found in the trachea. This study showed that inhaled Mg <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>F</b> attenuated the main principle of the central components of changes in MeCh provoked experimental asthma better than inhaled Mg alone, potentially providing a new therapeutic approach against asthma...|$|E
