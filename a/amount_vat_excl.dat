40|$|OBJECTIVE. : HIV-infected {{patients}} receiving antiretroviral treatment frequently accumulate fat at the abdominal level. It is unknown whether T-cell activation and immune phenotypes {{are associated with}} fat accumulation. Thus, {{the aim of the}} study was to search for an association between the presence of clinical lipodystrophy (LD), visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue <b>amount</b> (<b>VAT</b> and SAT) and peripheral T-cell immune phenotypes. DESIGN. : Cross-sectional study including 87 HIV-infected ART-treated, virologically-suppressed and immune-reconstituted patients. METHODS. : The patients were evaluated for clinical LD, VAT, SAT, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and coronary calcium score (CAC> 10). T-cell activation (CD 8 /CD 38), differentiation (CD 4 /CD 8 /CCR 7 /CD 45 RA) and expression/activation of the IL 7 /IL- 7 R system (CD 4 /CD 8 /CD 127; IL- 7; CD 4 /CD 8 /pStat- 5) were assessed by cytometry. RESULTS. : In multivariable analyses CD 8 +T-cell activation (CD 38 +) was associated with lipoatrophy and central fat accumulation (respectively: ß= 5. 63; p= 0. 005; and: ß= 4. 19; p= 0. 020). This was also the case for IL- 7 R expressing CD 8 +T-cells (CD 127 +) : respectively for lipoatrophy ß= 12. 8; p= 0. 003 and central fat accumulation ß= 9. 45; p= 0. 016. CD 8 +T-cell activation was also associated with VAT/TAT (ß= 0. 01; p= 0. 002) and SAT/VAT ratios (ß= - 0. 014; p= 0. 015). As expected, VAT/TAT was an independent risk factor for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, r= 0. 364, p= 0. 028) and cardiovascular risk (CAC, r= 0. 406, p= 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS. : CD 8 +T-cell activation was associated with lipodystrophy and the relative <b>amount</b> of <b>VAT</b> in ART-controlled, virologically-suppressed, HIV-infected patients.

40|$|Obesity is {{a complex}} multifactorial {{phenotype}} that influences several metabolic pathways. Yet, {{few studies have examined}} the relations of different body fat compartments to urinary and serum metabolites. Anthropometric phenotypes (visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), the ratio between VAT and SAT (VSR), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC)) and urinary and serum metabolite concentrations measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were measured in a population-based sample of 228 healthy adults. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models, corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate, were used to associate anthropometric phenotypes with metabolites. We adjusted for potential confounding variables: age, sex, smoking, physical activity, menopausal status, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary glucose, and fasting status. In a fully adjusted logistic regression model dichotomized for the absence or presence of quantifiable metabolite <b>amounts,</b> <b>VAT,</b> BMI and WC were inversely related to urinary choline (ß = - 0. 18, p = 2. 73 * 10 - 3), glycolic acid (ß = - 0. 20, 0. 02), and guanidinoacetic acid (ß = - 0. 12, p = 0. 04), and positively related to ethanolamine (ß = 0. 18, p = 0. 02) and dimethylamine (ß = 0. 32, p = 0. 02). BMI and WC were additionally inversely related to urinary glutamine and lactic acid. Moreover, WC was inversely associated with the detection of serine.

With the use of a micro-simulation model we also estimate the impact of changing the VAT rate on certain groups of items and the associated change in revenue. We also consider how the imposition of a flat rate across all goods and services would affect households in different categories. The Irish Government has recently announced that it proposes to increase the standard rate of VAT to 22 % in 2013 and to 23 % in 2014. We examine the distributional implications of such increases.

Obesity is a well-recognized risk factor for thrombotic cardiovascular complications including ischemic stroke, {{and it has been}} linked with increased plasma vWF. We evaluated whether elevated plasma levels of vWF associate with areas of visceral (VAT), pericardial (PAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) compartments in patients with acute/subacute stroke. A total of 69 patients with stroke of suspected cardiogenic etiology were examined. The plasma level of vWF antigen (vWF-ag) was measured both in the acute phase and in the chronic phase three months after stroke. The areas of VAT and/or PAT were assessed with computed tomography. As expected, in stroke patients, the levels of plasma vWF-ag were significantly higher than in the national reference population both in the acute and in the chronic phase. The level of vWF-ag in the chronic phase correlated with the <b>amounts</b> of <b>VAT</b> and PAT, but not with subcutaneous adipose tissue.

This study investigated which factors {{are responsible for the}} synergistic effect of adipokine and oleic acid- (OA-) induced proliferation of human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Adipocyte-conditioned medium (CM) from human adipocytes induces proliferation of VSMC in correlation to its vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) content. CM increases VEGF-receptor (VEGF-R) 1 and 2 expression and VEGF secretion of VSMC, while OA only stimulates VEGF secretion. VEGF neutralization abrogates CM- and OA-induced proliferation and considerably reduces proliferation induced by CM and OA in combination. VEGF release is higher from visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of obese subjects compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and VAT from lean controls. Furthermore, VEGF release from VAT correlates with its proliferative effect. Perivascular adipose tissue (PAT) from type 2 diabetic patients releases significantly higher amounts of VEGF and induces stronger proliferation of VSMC as compared to SAT and SAT/PAT of nondiabetics. In conclusion, VEGF is mediating CM-induced proliferation of VSMC. As this adipokine is released in high <b>amounts</b> from <b>VAT</b> of obese patients and PAT of diabetic patients, VEGF might link adipose tissue inflammation to increased VSMC proliferation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract There {{are likely}} many {{scenarios}} and pathways {{that can lead}} to metabolic syndrome. This paper reviews mechanisms by which the accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) may contribute to the metabolic syndrome, and explores the paradigm of a critical VAT threshold (CVATT). Exceeding the CVATT may result in a number of metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance to glucose uptake by cells. Metabolic profiles of patients with visceral obesity may substantially improve after only modest weight loss. This could reflect a significant reduction in the <b>amount</b> of <b>VAT</b> relative to peripheral or subcutaneous fat depots, thereby maintaining VAT below the CVATT. The CVATT may be unique for each individual. This may help explain the phenomena of apparently lean individuals with metabolic syndrome, the so-called metabolically normal weight (MONW), as well as the obese with normal metabolic profiles, i. e., metabolically normal obese (MNO), and those who are "fit and fat. " The concept of CVATT may have implications for prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome, which may include controlling dietary carbohydrates. The identification of the CVATT is admittedly difficult and its anatomical boundaries are not well-defined. Thus, the CVATT {{will continue to be a}} work in progress. </p...|$|R

In this study, we investigated the role of the IL- 33 /ST 2 pathway in high-fat diet (HFD) -induced obesity using ST 2 -defi cient (ST 2 -/-) and wild type BALB/c mice. Th e deletion of ST 2 enhanced systemic and visceral adi-pose tissue (VAT) infl ammation; ST 2 -/- mice that were fed a HFD for 18 weeks had experienced a signifi cantly increased weight gain and had a higher <b>amount</b> of total <b>VAT.</b> More classically activated M 1 macrophages and markedly fewe...|$|R
