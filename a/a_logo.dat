Meanwhile, tension persisted between Nhek Bun Chhay and Ranariddh, which erupted into a public spat, as Ranariddh threatened to expelled Nhek Bun Chhay who in turn, accused the party president of holding a grudge against him. Subsequently, on 3 February 2016, Nhek Bun Chhay announced that he was quitting the party, and went on to form his new party, the Khmer National United Party (KNUP).

5|$|US131 and its {{predecessors}} bears several memorial designations {{in addition to}} the Sidney Ouwinga Memorial Bypass near Cadillac. One of the oldest is the Mackinaw Trail, named after a former Indian trail that ran from Saginaw to Mackinaw City and Sault Ste. Marie. By 1915, the name was transferred to the roadway that was later numbered US131. The Mackinaw Trail Association was formed that year to promote an all-weather highway between Grand Rapids and Mackinaw City, using <b>a</b> <b>logo</b> incorporating a trout for the road. The name was to be officially applied to the highway in 1929, but the State Senate did not agree to the proposal. The official endorsement of the name came in 1959, after the opening of the Mackinac Bridge revitalized the idea.|$|E
5|$|During the {{original}} era the Panthers {{did not have}} <b>a</b> <b>logo,</b> instead using stylised lettering {{on the front of}} their shirts. The club's current logo was adopted in 2003 and is the fifth to be used since the Panthers were reformed. The first was used between 1980 and 1994 and was the silhouette of a Panthers' head in a red circle. The second logo, adopted in 1994, was similar to the first but used a more detailed Panthers' head. The third logo, introduced in 1998, featured a keyhole shaped like the head of a cat with a Panther reaching through it. The fourth logo was adopted following the move to the National Ice Centre and was similar to the logo of German side Augsburger Panther. The stylised lettering used during {{the original}} era was used again on special shirts made to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the club in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Hull City's first shirt badge {{mirrored}} the familiar three crowns civic emblem of Kingston-upon-Hull, which was {{displayed on the}} sky blue shirts worn in the 1935–36 season. Following that season, the team went without wearing a badge until 1947, when the club crest depicted a tiger's head in an orange-shaded badge. This was worn up until 1957, when it was changed to just the tiger's head. This was worn for three years, when the shirt again featured no emblem. Then, in 1971, the club returned to showing the tiger's head on the shirt. This was used for four years, until the club's initials of HCAFC were shown for four years. After this, <b>a</b> <b>logo</b> with the tiger's head with the club's name underneath was used from 1979 until 1998. The next logo, which remains the club's current logo, features the tiger's head in an amber shield with the club's name, along with the club's nickname, The Tigers.|$|E

As in the United States Flag Code, no other flags must be placed higher than the Bhutanese flag, the flag cannot be used as a cover or drape (with some exceptions) and the flag must not touch the ground. Other provisions include prohibitions on including the design in other objects or in <b>a</b> <b>logo.</b> Exceptionally, the flag may be used to drape coffins, but only those of high-ranking state officials such as ministers or military personnel.|$|E

40|$|Sonic logos are {{increasingly}} {{being used as a}} way of sonic branding in marketing activities. Scholars have acknowledged the benefits of sonic logos, such as communicating brand attributes to consumers. However, studies about consumers’ attitudes towards sonic logos are scarce. This paper examined consumers’ attitudes towards sonic logos, particularly how cognitive and affective elements correlated with such attitudes, whether such attitudes had correlations with consumers’ attitudes towards the associated brands of sonic logos, and whether such attitudes had relationships with consumers’ purchase intentions towards the associated brands of sonic <b>logos.</b> Through <b>a</b> PowerPoint-assisted questionnaire, data were collected from 78 Chinese students who were from the University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China. With the help of SPSS, it was found that consumers’ attitudes towards sonic logos were close to positive; both cognitive elements (a consumer’s perception of attractiveness of <b>a</b> sonic <b>logo,</b> <b>a</b> consumer’s perception of uniqueness of <b>a</b> sonic <b>logo,</b> <b>a</b> consumer’s perception of fitness for its brand of <b>a</b> sonic <b>logo)</b> and affective elements (a consumer’s perception of emotionality of <b>a</b> sonic <b>logo,</b> <b>a</b> consumer’s perception of activation of emotional memories of <b>a</b> sonic <b>logo,</b> <b>a</b> consumer’s perception of pleasure of <b>a</b> sonic <b>logo)</b> had positive relationships with consumers’ attitudes towards it; and a consumer’ attitude towards the sonic logo had positive relationships with her/his attitude towards the associated brand of the sonic logo and with her/his purchase intention towards the associated brand of the sonic logo. These findings not only could contribute to understanding that how sonic logos were perceived in consumers’ minds, but also to some extent could help marketing practitioners make better decisions about whether to implement sonic logos or not and how to design good sonic logos...|$|R
