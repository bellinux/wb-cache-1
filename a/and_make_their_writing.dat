500|$|The Classical Prose Movement was spurred {{in large}} part by the {{writings}} of Tang authors Liu Zongyuan (773–819) and Han Yu (768–824).

This paper uses a critical realist theory of reflexivity {{to argue that the}} teaching and assessment of writing must account for the different ways that students manage <b>and</b> <b>make</b> decisions in <b>their</b> <b>writing.</b> Data from linguistically and culturally diverse primary students in Australia are used to illustrate how four distinct reflexive modalities constitute the ways in which students approach writing. The paper offers a new approach to assessing writing for and of learning that considers writers as reflexive and agentic in different ways. It posits the importance of making visible and explicit the context and reflexive decision-making as writers shape a product for a purpose and audience. 15 page(s...|$|R
