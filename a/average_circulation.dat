5|$|Odense is {{the centre}} for media {{activity}} on Funen, and {{the hub of}} the regional network. Its principal newspaper is Fyens Stiftstidende, a daily broadsheet owned by Den Fynske Bladfond and published by Fyens Stiftstidende A/S, which was established on 3 January 1772. Until 1841 the newspaper was known as Kongelig Priviligerede Odense Adresse-Contoirs Efterretninger, and on 13 April 1993 the newspaper changed its 221-year-old tradition as a midday newspaper, to a morning paper. In 2013, it had an <b>average</b> <b>circulation</b> of 47,738, down from some 60,500 in 2005. The editor in chief, Per Westergård, chairs the board of the Centre for Journalism at the University of Southern Denmark, one of the two university journalism departments in Denmark. Denmark's largest university press, the University Press of Southern Denmark, is also based in Odense. It was founded in 1966 as Odense University Press (Odense Universitetsforlag), and its authors are mainly academics from the University of Southern Denmark.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} copies distributed, either on an average day or on {{particular}} days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation {{and is one of}} the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the {{number of copies}} distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the Alliance for Audited Media maintains historical and current data on <b>average</b> <b>circulation</b> of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the event, the editor, Gökşin Sipahioğlu, {{called the}} owner, Mithat Perin, asking for {{permission}} for a second run. The weather was bad, so Perin declined thinking the prints would not get sold. The newspaper's main dealer, Fuat Büke, soon called and offered to pay for the run in advance. By the time Perin went to inspect the Tan Press, 180,000 copies had already been printed. Sensing something fishy, Perin tore up the paper and stopped the run. The prototype was still intact however, and the workers secretly resumed printing after Perin left. They had eventually printed 300,000 copies (on paper stocked in advance), of which 296,000 were sold. This was far above the newspaper's <b>average</b> <b>circulation</b> of 30,000–40,000 (by comparison, the best-selling Hürriyet sold 70–80 thousand copies). Perin was arrested the next day. Gökşin Sipahioğlu later alleged the NSS had pressured him to do it, while Perin says Sipahioğlu himself was an agent. Perin's innocence, however, was cast into doubt after intrepid journalist Uğur Mumcu published an excerpt from a 1962 letter between Perin and the undersecretary of the NSS, Fuat Doğu, stating that in his 25 years of journalism, he had acted in full knowledge of the NSS and had not refrained from doing anything.|$|E

By 2007, the <b>average</b> <b>circulation</b> was approximately 38,000 copies, with half coming from subscriptions rather than store sales. It was well received by critics, who praised its mix of manga series and the inclusion of articles on Japanese culture, though some critics found the early issues boring and poorly written. In May 2009, Viz announced that it was discontinuing the magazine; the July 2009 issue was the last released. Fans were disappointed at the sudden news. Industry experts felt its loss would leave female comic fans without a magazine of their own, but praised Viz for its choice to continue using the [...] "Shojo Beat" [...] imprint and branding for its shōjo manga and anime releases.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} various ozone density {{reductions}} of the zonally <b>averaged</b> <b>circulation</b> are evaluated with a numerical quasi-geostrophic model. If the ozone perturbations {{are confined to}} the polar regions and are minuscule on a global basis as was characteristic of the August 1972 solar proton event, then the calculations indicate a negligible effect on the mean circulation. For global ozone perturbations by predicted halocarbon pollution, about 10 % reduction in the zonal jet strength and less than a 5 % change in global mean stratospheric temperature are calculated. Large, uniform ozone reductions (above 50 %) produce significant effects on the mean circulation: a substantial collapse of the stratosphere due to cooler temperatures, and a weak polar night jet. The reflection and transmission of quasi-stationary planetary waves in the middle atmosphere are computed to be insensitive to solar activity as extreme as the August 1972 solar proton event. It thus seems improbable that planetary waves are a viable mechanism for solar-weather interactions that involve perturbations of the zonally <b>averaged</b> <b>circulation</b> by ozone density reductions...|$|R
