5|$|After a brief {{memorial}} for Qwark on the Phoenix, Ratchet goes {{to assist}} Ranger forces battling a Tyhrranoid invasion {{in the city}} of Metropolis. Unveiling his newly completed Biobliterator, Nefarious uses it to turn both Metropolis's citizens and his Tyhrranoid soldiers into robots. Making yet another escape, he orders Klunk to kill Ratchet. After besting the clone, Ratchet and Clank are reunited and vow to stop Nefarious. While searching the remains of the Leviathan, they find evidence that Qwark faked his death. A secret message hidden on board the Phoenix reveals the location of a secret hideout, where Qwark, overcome with cowardice, refuses to fight any longer. After fighting off an attack on the Phoenix, the duo intercept the Biobliterator and Clank destroys it with an ion cannon. However, Sasha informs them that a second, more advanced, Biobliterator is being prepped for launch at Nefarious's main command center on planet Mylon, Ratchet and Clank locate Nefarious and defeat him, but he activates the Biobliterator, which transforms into a giant, heavily armed robot. Before he can crush the two, a reinvigorated Qwark flies in to distract him, giving the duo <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> destroy the Biobliterator. Nefarious's teleporter malfunctions, stranding him and his butler Lawrence on a distant asteroid. With Nefarious defeated, the Q-Force and their allies attend a private screening of the latest Secret Agent Clank holofilm.|$|E
5|$|The mercenaries pursue Zangurak to Lazulis Island. Lowell is fatally {{injured by}} a Gurak warrior. Zael finds Calista with Zangurak, who has used her Arganan {{blood and the}} Gurak half of the Outsider to anoint his right arm. After the group defeats Zangurak, he rips off his right arm and sends it to use the full power of the Outsider to revive him. However, Dagran kills Zangurak's arm so he can use the Arganan blood and Outsider half on it for himself. He reveals that he murdered Asthar because he learned that Asthar had {{commanded}} the Lazulis knights who killed his family. He has been collaborating with Zangurak with {{the ultimate goal of}} using the Outsider to remake the world so the mercenaries have a better life. Finding he is still not powerful enough to defeat the group, Dagran tries to absorb the Lazulis half of the Outsider into the center of his body, giving Zael <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> kill him. Dagran reconciles with the group before dying, then his spirit uses the Outsider's energy to resurrect Lowell. Zael and Calista reunite the two halves of the Outsider, which leaves the planet after explaining that its true purpose is to collect scattered energy in outer space and use it to create life on new worlds. Humans and Gurak begin coexisting, sharing their technology and using Lazulis as a neutral land where the two races freely interact. Therius decides to train new knights in the empire while leaving Lazulis in Zael's care, Zael and Calista are married in her ancient family home, the mercenaries hold a funeral for Dagran, and Zael is finally made a knight by Calista.|$|E

25|$|Pope Urban VIII, who {{had been}} under attack by Spanish {{cardinals}} for being too tolerant of heretics, and who had also encouraged Galileo to publish The Dialogue, would have been compromised had his enemies among the Cardinal Inquisitors been given <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> comment on his support of a publication containing Eucharistic heresies.|$|E
25|$|Lyra, Iorek, and Roger {{travel to}} Svalbard, where Asriel has {{continued}} his Dust research in exile. He tells Lyra that the Church believes Dust {{is the basis}} of sin, and plans to visit the other universes and destroy its source. He severs Roger from his dæmon, killing him and releasing enough energy to create <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> a parallel universe. Lyra determines to stop Asriel and follows him through the opening.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} ways for <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> setup <b>to</b> be arranged. A common one is as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|Between the Xtoloc {{temple and}} the Osario are several aligned {{structure}}s: The Platform of Venus (which {{is similar in}} design {{to the structure of}} the same name next to El Castillo), the Platform of the Tombs, and a small, round structure that is unnamed. These three structures were constructed in a row extending from the Osario. Beyond them the Osario platform terminates in a wall, which contains <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> a sacbe that runs several hundred feet to the Xtoloc temple.|$|E
25|$|Beyond that, to {{the rear}} of the Rotunda is a {{rough-hewn}} chapel containing <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> a chamber cut from the rock, from which several kokh-tombs radiate. Although this space was discovered recently, and contains no identifying marks, many Christians believe it to be the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and it is where the Syriac Orthodox celebrate their Liturgy on Sundays. To the right of the Sepulchre on the northwestern edge of the Rotunda is the Chapel of the Apparition, which is reserved for Roman Catholic use.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1945, Schellenberg instigated further {{meetings}} with Count Bernadotte as <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> the western powers. He personally went to Stockholm in April 1945 to arrange the meetings for Himmler. Both Himmler and Schellenberg continued {{to believe that the}} Jews interned in concentration camps represented a bargaining chip for the Nazi leadership, one they could use to derive concessions from the Western allies. To foster goodwill for their negotiations, Schellenberg—with Himmler's consent—organised the transport of 1,700 Jews out of German controlled territory to Switzerland and Sweden. Hitler found out and put a stop to further evacuations.|$|E

25|$|Another Spanish party, captained by Antonio Velázquez in the caravel Santa Catalina, {{explored}} to {{the lower}} Chesapeake Bay region of Virginia in mid-1561 under the orders of Ángel de Villafañe. During this voyage, two Kiskiack or Paspahegh youths, including Don Luis were taken back to Spain. In 1566, an expedition sent from Spanish Florida by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés reached the Delmarva Peninsula. The expedition consisted of two Dominican friars, thirty soldiers and Don Luis, in a failed effort {{to set up a}} Spanish colony in the Chesapeake, believing it to be <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> the fabled Northwest Passage.|$|E
25|$|Lenin was {{eventually}} convinced—by this famine, the Kronstadt rebellion, large scale peasant uprisings {{such as the}} Tambov Rebellion, {{and the failure of}} a German general strike—to reverse his policy at home and abroad. He decreed the New Economic Policy on March 15, 1921. The famine also helped produce <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> the West: Lenin allowed relief organizations to bring aid this time. War relief was no longer required in Western Europe, and the ARA had an organization set up in Poland, relieving the Polish famine which had begun in the winter of 1919–20. Some peasants resorted to cannibalism.|$|E
25|$|The tomb is {{accessed}} via {{a pedestal}} with five steps. On the northern {{side of the}} podium (the lowest of three levels in the monument), there is <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> the funeral chamber that is closed with a stone slab. The other sides are decorated with fake windows and four Aeolic pilasters. The second level {{is made up of}} a temple-like colonnade (naiskos); the columns on each side are Ionic. The third level is the most richly decorated of all: in addition to pilasters similar to those on the lowest level, it is capped with a pyramid. Some elements of carved stone have also survived.|$|E

25|$|Sagebiel {{planned a}} square encircled by {{buildings}} of similar heights {{except for the}} taller buildings at the airport entrance, and a promenade and series of waterfalls cascading down from the National Monument for the Liberation Wars on the Kreuzberg hill opposite, but his plan was not realised; in the late 1930s the area was a grassy half-circle. The square was given the name Platz der Luftbrücke on 25 June 1949 by Ernst Reuter, the then mayor, and landscaped with a sunken lawn, trees, flowers and a low hedge with <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> frame the monument. This landscaping has changed several times since the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{perceived}} that McClellan {{was no longer}} a threat to him on the Peninsula, so he felt no compulsion to keep all of his forces in direct defense of Richmond. This allowed him to relocate Jackson to Gordonsville to block Pope and protect the railroad. Lee had larger plans in mind. Since the Union Army was split between McClellan and Pope and they were widely separated, Lee saw <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> destroy Pope before returning his attention to McClellan. Believing that Ambrose Burnside's troops from North Carolina were being shipped to reinforce Pope, and wanting to take immediate action before those troops were in position, Lee committed Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to join Jackson with 12,000 men, while distracting McClellan to keep him immobilized.|$|E
25|$|Grant ordered Hancock {{to cross}} the Po River and attack the Confederates' left flank, driving them back toward Burnside's {{position}} near the Ni River, {{while the rest of}} his command, in the center, watched for <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> attack there as well. Hancock's II Corps advanced across the Po, but he delayed his attack until the morning. This error was fatal to Grant's plan. That night, Lee moved two divisions of Jubal Early's corps from Spotsylvania Court House into position against Hancock. On the morning of May 10, Grant ordered Hancock to withdraw north of the Po, leaving a single division in place to occupy the Confederates in that sector, while the rest of his army was to attack at 5 p.m. across the entire Confederate line. At 2 p.m., Jubal Early decided to attack the division, which retreated across the Po without being captured, destroying the bridges behind them.|$|E

This arch frames <b>a</b> {{single window}} <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> each floor, with <b>an</b> arched <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> the second floor, and segmental arches {{to the lower}} floors. The ground floor window opening also has security bars and an expressed keystone, and all windows have been replaced with metal framed casements to the upper two floors and sash frames to the ground floor.|$|R
25|$|On the Union left, Burnside's IX Corps {{approached}} on the Fredericksburg Road from Alrich, led by Brig. Gen. Orlando B. Willcox's division, {{but they}} were delayed by Fitzhugh Lee's cavalrymen. When they reached close enough to observe that the Confederates were at Spotsylvania Court House, Burnside became concerned {{that he was too}} far in advance of Meade's force and ordered his men to begin entrenching. At this same time, Hancock was reporting from the right flank that Early's men had pulled back from his front. Grant absorbed these two observations and concluded that the Confederates were shifting their men from west to east, opening an opportunity for an attack. He ordered Hancock to cross the Po and attack the Confederates' left flank, driving them back toward Burnside's position near the Ni River, while the rest of his command, in the center, watched for <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> attack there as well.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{visited the}} White House in 1975 and {{discussed}} naval preparedness issues with President Gerald Ford.

[...] McCain also participated in a January 1978 traveling [...] "Panama Canal Truth Squad", led by Senator Paul Laxalt, that sought Senate rejection of the Panama Canal Treaty; McCain felt that the eventual ceding of the canal to Panamanian control would endanger U.S. security and provide <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> the Soviets in the region.|$|E
500|$|After film {{director}} John Badham learned that Ross {{was going to}} play the part of Dorothy, he decided not to direct the film, and Cohen replaced him with Sidney Lumet. Of his decision not to direct The Wiz, John Badham recalled telling Cohen that he thought Ross was [...] "a wonderful singer. She's a terrific actress and a great dancer, but she's not this character. She's not the little six-year-old girl Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz." [...] Though 20th Century Fox had financially backed the stage musical, they ended up exercising their first refusal rights to the film production, which gave Universal <b>an</b> <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> finance the film. Initially, Universal was so excited about the film's prospects that they did not set a budget for production.|$|E
