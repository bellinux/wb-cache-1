5|$|The score {{established}} Herrmann as {{an important}} new composer of film soundtracks and eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as '"radio scoring", musical cues typically 5–15 seconds in length that bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response. The breakfast montage sequence begins with <b>a</b> <b>graceful</b> waltz theme and gets darker with each variation on that theme as {{the passage of time}} leads to the hardening of Kane's personality and the breakdown of his first marriage.|$|E

In this paper, we study the super gracefulness of complete graph, the disjoint union of certain star graphs, the complete tripartite graphs K(1, 1,n), and certain families of trees. We also present four methods of constructing new super graceful graphs. In particular, all trees of order at most 7 are super graceful. We conjecture that all trees are super graceful...|$|R
5|$|All Hallows Church is {{the oldest}} {{existing}} building in Wellingborough and dates from c.1160. The manor of Wellingborough belonged to Crowland Abbey Lincolnshire, from Saxon times and the monks probably built the original church. The earliest {{part of the building}} is the Norman doorway opening in from the later south porch. The church was enlarged with the addition of more side chapels {{and by the end of}} the 13th century had assumed more or less its present plan. The west tower, crowned with <b>a</b> <b>graceful</b> broach spire rising to , was completed about 1270, after which the chancel was rebuilt and given the east window twenty years later. The church was restored in 1861 by Edmund Francis Law. The 20th-century Church of St Mary was built by Ninian Comper.|$|E
5|$|Brian Charles Booth (born 19 October 1933) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who played in 29 Tests from 1961 to 1966, and 93 {{first-class}} matches for New South Wales. He captained Australia for two Tests during the 196566 Ashes series while regular captain Bob Simpson was absent due to illness and injury. Booth was <b>a</b> <b>graceful</b> right-handed middle order batsman at No. 4 or 5, and occasionally bowled right arm medium pace or off spin. He had an inclination to use his feet to charge spin bowlers. Booth {{was known for his}} sportsmanship on the field and often invoked Christianity while discussing ethics and sport.|$|E
5|$|David Gower is an English former cricketer who batted with <b>a</b> <b>graceful</b> {{style as}} part of the top order for the England cricket team for over a decade. He scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on 18 {{occasions}} in Test cricket, and 7 times in One Day International (ODI) matches. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1979 for his performances the previous year, which included being the youngest batsman to score a century for England since Peter May in 1951. He was appointed to the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1992 for services to sports, and in 2009 was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Prior to her infestation, Kerrigan is {{described}} as being <b>a</b> <b>graceful</b> and deadly woman, exceedingly agile and athletic, possessing jade-green eyes and brilliant red hair usually worn as a ponytail. The novel Queen of Blades describes her facial features as being too strong to be classified as beautiful, but instead as striking and completely fitting for her personality. Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal cloaking device, but when off-duty, she {{is described}} as wearing a soft work shirt, worn cotton pants with a dusty leather jacket, and high leather boots. Even then, it is uncommon for Kerrigan to be unarmed: she is always equipped {{with at least a}} combat knife.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} of the IAe-27a and Tank's redesign of the Ta 183, Juan Ignacio San Martín, {{the director of the}} Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II. The fuselage of Tank's design was further adapted to use the IAe-27a's undercarriage. The shoulder-mounted, negative-incidence wings were swept back 40°, an even greater sweep angle than that of the Ta 183, and given a small amount of anhedral. Comparable to the Ta 183's engine placement, the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit, near the center of gravity with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the tail section. The airframe featured <b>a</b> <b>graceful,</b> 50° swept-back T-shaped empennage and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble-type canopy, faired into the dorsal fuselage. Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated. Fuel capacity was initially 1,250 l (275 Imp. gal.) internally and 800 l (176 Imp. gal.) in the wings. Armament was planned to include four 20mm cannon, a pair mounted in a staggered, near-ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly set back from the jet intake.|$|E
5|$|The long-ship, the key {{to their}} success, was <b>a</b> <b>graceful,</b> long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow draft hull {{designed}} for speed. This shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one metre deep and permitted beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages. Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around. In the Gàidhealtachd they were eventually succeeded by the Birlinn, highland galley and lymphad, which, in ascending order of size, and which replaced the steering-board with a stern-rudder from the late twelfth century. Forces of ships were raised through obligations of a ship-levy through the system of ouncelands and pennylands, which have been argued to {{date back to the}} muster system of Dál Riata, but were probably introduced by Scandinavian settlers. Later evidence suggests that the supply of ships for war became linked to military feudal obligations. Viking naval power was disrupted by conflicts between the Scandinavian kingdoms, but entered a period of resurgence in the 13th century when Norwegian kings began to build some of the largest ships seen in Northern European waters, until Haakon Haakonson's ill-fated expedition in 1263 left the Scottish crown the most significant power in the region.|$|E

In this paper the concept of fuzzy graceful labelling is applied to complete bipartite graphs. Also we discussed the edge and vertex gracefulness of some complete bipartite graphs...|$|R
