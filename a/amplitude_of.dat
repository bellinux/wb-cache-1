40|$|Habituation of {{responses}} to chemosensory signals has been explored in many ways. Strong habituation and adaptation processes can be observed at the various levels of processing. For example, with repeated exposure, <b>amplitudes</b> <b>of</b> chemosensory event-related potentials (ERP) decrease over time. However, long-term habituation has not been investigated so far and investigations of differences in habituation between trigeminal and olfactory ERPs are very rare. The present study investigated habituation {{over a period of}} approximately 80 min for two olfactory and one trigeminal stimulus, respectively. Habituation was examined analyzing the N 1 and P 2 <b>amplitudes</b> and latencies <b>of</b> chemosensory ERPs and intensity ratings. It was shown that <b>amplitudes</b> <b>of</b> both components - and intensity ratings - decreased from the first to the last block. Concerning ERP latencies no effects of habituation were seen. <b>Amplitudes</b> <b>of</b> trigeminal ERPs diminished faster than <b>amplitudes</b> <b>of</b> olfactory ERPs, indicating that the habituation of trigeminal ERPs is stronger than habituation <b>of</b> olfactory ERPs. <b>Amplitudes</b> <b>of</b> trigeminal ERPs were generally higher than <b>amplitudes</b> <b>of</b> olfactory ERPs, as it has been shown in various studies before.
