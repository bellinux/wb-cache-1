5|$|Edward's {{difficulties}} were {{exacerbated by}} prolonged problems in English agriculture, {{part of a}} wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the Great Famine. It began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a very cold winter and heavy rains the following spring that killed many sheep and cattle. The bad weather continued, almost unabated, into 1321, resulting {{in a string of}} bad harvests. Revenues from the exports of wool plummeted <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of food rose, despite attempts by Edward II's government to control prices. Edward called for hoarders to release food, and tried to encourage both internal trade and the importation of grain, but with little success. The requisitioning of provisions for the royal court during the famine years only added to tensions.|$|E

5|$|Following the California {{gold rush}} {{that began in}} 1849 and the Australian gold rush that began in 1851, a larger amount of gold was put into {{commerce}} than could be easily absorbed by the normal channels. This resulted in {{a decrease in the}} value of gold and an increase in the relative value of silver. As a result, silver coins rapidly disappeared from circulation due either to hoarding or melting. In response, Congress authorized the Mint to reduce the quantity of silver in all denominations except the three-cent piece and silver dollar. Beginning in the 1860s, silver production rose <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> decreased. During this time, silver coins largely disappeared from circulation and were replaced by copper and paper currency.|$|E

5|$|The Fourth Crusade {{resulted}} in the disruption of Byzantine manufacturing and the commercial dominance of the Western Europeans in the eastern Mediterranean, events that amounted to an economic catastrophe for the Empire. The Palaiologoi tried to revive the economy, but the late Byzantine state would not gain full control of either the foreign or domestic economic forces. Gradually, it also lost its influence on the modalities of trade <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> mechanisms, and its control over the outflow of precious metals and, according to some scholars, even over the minting of coins.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} of the monument proceeded quickly after Congress had provided sufficient funding. In four years, it was completed, with the 100-ounce (2.83kg) aluminum apex/lightning-rod being put in place on December 6, 1884. The apex was the largest single piece of aluminum cast at the time, when aluminum commanded a price comparable to silver. Two years later, the Hall–Héroult process made aluminum easier to produce <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of aluminum plummeted, making the once-valuable apex more ordinary, though it still provided a lustrous, non-rusting apex {{that served as the}} original lightning rod. The monument opened to the public on October 9, 1888.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} the character Maude Flanders, who had previously been voiced by cast member Maggie Roswell. This kill-off was the result of Roswell leaving The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with the Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs the show. Since 1994, she had been flying between her Denver home and Los Angeles twice a week to record episodes of The Simpsons. She eventually grew tired of this, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of plane tickets was constantly increasing. As a result, she asked Fox for a pay raise from $2,000 per episode to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit.|$|E
5|$|The first dish {{known to}} have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of {{seasoned}} fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Prior to the Second World War, fried chicken was often very expensive and was only enjoyed on special occasions. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, however, fried chicken has been mass-produced <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of the dish has gone down significantly.|$|E

5|$|At the start, {{there were}} {{one or two}} daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, and the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced {{as if they were the}} length of the road, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to operate with a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nearly}} three decades since passage of the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the annual demand for silver bullion rose {{steadily}} from roughly 11 million ounces (1933) to 110 million ounces (1962). The Acts of 1939 and 1946 established floor prices for silver of 71 cents and 90.5 cents (respectively) per ounce. Predicated by an anticipated shortage of silver bullion, Public Law 88-36 (PL88-36) was enacted on 4 June 1963 which repealed the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, and the Acts of 6 July 1939 and 31 July 1946, while providing specific instruction regarding the disposition of silver held as reserves against issued certificates <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> at which silver may be sold. It also amended the Federal Reserve Act to authorize the issue of lower denomination notes (i.e., $1 and $2), allowing for the gradual retirement (or swapping out process) of $1 silver certificates and releasing silver bullion from reserve. In repealing the earlier laws, PL88-36 also repealed {{the authority of the}} Secretary of the Treasury to control the issue of silver certificates. By issuing Executive Order 11110, President John F. Kennedy was able to continue the Secretary’s authority. While retaining their status as legal tender, the silver certificate had effectively been retired from use.|$|E
5|$|Stocks were {{increased}} by animals transferred from other zoos {{that had been}} forced to close. Initially the zoo was given favourable food rationing quotas, but certain foods became unavailable <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of others increased dramatically. Bananas were impossible to obtain and the supply of fish was problematic. As a result, the keepers were forced to experiment. The sealions became casualties of the food shortage when their keepers attempted to feed them strips of beef soaked in cod liver oil. Although they seemed to thrive on this diet, their digestive systems were unable to cope with the unusual food, and they eventually died of stomach ulcers. The lions' new diet was green-coloured horsemeat, and the monkeys were fed on boiled potatoes. The birds-of-paradise (lack of millet), and the penguins (lack of fish), were unable to adapt to their make-do diet and also succumbed. Vegetables were not in short supply however, as the garden staff grew lettuce, cabbage and carrots in the kitchen gardens.|$|E

5|$|After Myanmar's {{government}} {{failed to}} respond to the devastating effects of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, officials responded more quickly to the floods and the effects from Komen. Relief supplies were airdropped to marooned villages, assisting the Rohingya people in Rakhine. The government allocated US$1.2million toward supplying farmers with rice paddy seeds to regrow damaged crops. About half of the damaged crop was replanted by November 2015, and in most areas, the grounds remained fertile for future growing. Local businesses donated K2.06billion toward buying supplies, and businessman Aung Ko Win donated US$3.6million. The Myanmar Red Cross, which was already responding to the ongoing flooding, provided additional supplies and assisted with evacuations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted in these efforts by providing rice and blankets. Volunteers distributed sleeping mats, mosquito nets, medical supplies, and tarps. Various United Nations agencies assisted the residents in displaced camps that were affected further by Komen. Within a month of the storm, the World Food Programme had provided meals to over 450,000people. Food and oil prices rose in the weeks after the floods, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of rice reached record levels in the country in August and September 2015. The cost gradually declined after the next rice harvest. To help unemployed farm workers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation financed a program to pay storm victims to rebuild damaged embankments and restore clean water access. An assessment by the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Myanmar government found that women and children were the worst affected group during and after the disaster, due to the stresses of the damaged houses, and insufficient food and assistance in the subsequent months.|$|E
5|$|Titanic had a {{total of}} 20 lifeboats, {{comprising}} 16wooden boats on davits, 8 {{on either side of}} the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck. On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178– barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost. Titanic had been designed to accommodate up to 68lifeboats– enough for everyone on board– <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of an extra 32lifeboats would only have been some , a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on Titanic. In an emergency, lifeboats at the time were intended to be used to transfer passengers off the distressed ship and onto a nearby vessel. It was therefore commonplace for liners to have far fewer lifeboats than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and of the 39British liners of the time of over , 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board. The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.|$|E
