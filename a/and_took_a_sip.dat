50|$|Still at home, Robert shaves in {{a rather}} awkward fashion. He then finds out he's late for work and eats a spoonful of instant coffee and one of sugar, <b>and</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of cream <b>and</b> one of water, and finally shakes himself up before leaving his flat. Meanwhile Perry <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> bus to Sloane Square, where a sarcastic bus {{conductor}} proceeds to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> slice off a pound bill since Dave just had 15 pence instead of the 16p the conductor charged him, disbelieving the fact that Perry {{was in fact a}} comedian.|$|R

5000|$|Life <b>takes</b> on <b>a</b> surreal {{effect as}} the whole of Britain reacts {{to the effects of}} the {{spillage}} by talking and doing everything extremely fast [...] - [...] a cricket Test Match between England <b>and</b> Australia <b>takes</b> only minutes to play, instead of days; a Royal car goes by very rapidly, carrying the Queen; and the British Prime Minister sounds like a cartoon chipmunk as he rushes through his speech in Parliament. The sleeping newsreader wakes up <b>and</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of water [...] - [...] followed by more sips [...] - [...] and, getting faster and faster with his speech, he finally jumps up and pounds his chest with his fists (like King Kong), before rushing off.|$|R

The alcohol has {{overtaken}} Joe and he is hostile to Liam, who needs his help. As Liam witnesses members of the gang coming towards the premises, Liam realises that Joe has passed out and he kisses Joe on his forehead. Joe suddenly snaps awake and realises that Liam has taken his own life by hanging himself. The film concludes with Liam's funeral.|$|R

60|$|Mr Bickersdyke spoke well. He had a penetrating, if harsh, voice, and he {{said what}} he had to say forcibly. Little by little the {{audience}} came under his spell.

50|$|Eventually, Bacterio {{works his}} final ploy by sneaking {{back into the}} T.I.A. {{headquarters}} in disguise and playing his jokes on Mortadelo, Filemon, and El Super themselves, but {{in the course of}} that action he gets knocked on the head and comes back to his senses. Relieved that their ordeal is over, Mortadelo <b>and</b> Filemon <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of cognac to ease their nerves, but the bottle they drink from actually contains the rest of Bacterio's elixir. As a result, they turn into villainous pranksters as well, and El Super and Bacterio end up as their first victims, rolling {{to the edge of a}} ravine inside a thoroughly sealed and disabled car.|$|R
5000|$|A {{group of}} people are {{clustered}} around a table for a typical lunch that will include several courses and a clear, fiery drink. The host pours the ice-cold liquid into frosty, conical glasses with long stems. He raises his glass, {{at which point the}} diners turn to one another and make eye contact, making certain not to leave anyone out. “Skål!” calls out the host, <b>and</b> everyone <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip.</b> Again there is eye contact, and then the glasses are set on the table, not to be lifted again until the host raises his. The liquid is aquavit. The ritual is virtually the same throughout Scandinavia.|$|R

The chief next took a good pull at the cup and emptied it; after which he presented it to his companions, who helped themselves at pleasure; and the dance and monotonous music became more furious and noisy the longer the cup went round.|$|E
60|$|Julien {{turned his}} head half unwillingly. The girl was leaning across the table, her eyes fixed steadfastly upon his. Her lips were parted, her eyebrows were {{slightly}} raised, as though in question. She had been holding a menu before her face to shield her from the casual observer, but the moment Julien {{turned his head}} she lowered it. He inclined his head slowly. A curious expression of relief took the place of that appearance of strained anxiety. Her face became natural once more. She laid down the menu <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of wine from her glass. Kendricks looked across at Julien and raised his glass to his lips.|$|E

Otherwise, blood as you are at cricket, you'll have a rotten time here. There are some things you simply can't do; {{and one of them is}} bunking a thing when you're put down for it. It doesn't matter who it is puts you down. If he's captain, you've got to obey him. That's discipline, that 'ere is. The speaker then paused, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of water from the carafe which stood at his elbow. Cheers from the audience, and a voice 'Hear! Hear!'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Console {{versions}} of the game eschew most of the traditional methods of control, making minimal use of the face buttons on the controller, instead using the twin analog sticks for almost all player actions. The left stick controls movement of the character, whilst the right is used for context-sensitive actions. For instance, when Lucas, one of the protagonists, approaches his table at the diner in the opening scene, pressing the stick in one direction may cause him to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> seat, another makes him examine his bill, and a third lets him pick up his drink <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip.</b> The available options are displayed with simple diagrams {{at the top of}} the screen. More complex motions, such as climbing a fence or spinning a yo-yo [...] "around the world" [...] fashion, require controller motions designed to replicate the actual action being undertaken by the character. During the tutorial of the game, David Cage instructs the player to move the thumb-stick slowly when opening a door, to maximize immersion, making it clear the prevalent use of thumb-sticks in the game was intended to increase immersion. On the rare occasions in which the face buttons are used, the buttons never directly control character actions; rather, the buttons are used to interact with menus and the user interface, such as changing between characters, navigating menus in computer systems, and displaying the [...] "mental health" [...] of the character. In the Microsoft Windows version of the game, control is via the keyboard and mouse, with key movements and mouse gestures used in conjunction in lieu of analog control sticks, although Microsoft Windows gamepads with analog sticks are also supported.|$|R
5000|$|Cutty Sark {{makes an}} {{appearance}} in many novels by Haruki Murakami, most notably The Wind Up Bird Chronicle, 1Q84, and Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage. It is a character's favourite {{drink in the}} 1978 novel The Human Factor by Graham Greene. In Charles Bukowski's novel Women, there is a scene where the protagonist Henry Chinaski fights over a bottle of Cutty Sark with his girlfriend. Eventually the bottle is broken <b>and</b> he <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> from what's left at the bottom. Also Cutty Sark is one time favourite drink of Clive Cussler's hero Dirk Pitt and also of Clive Cussler who is featured as a bit part character in most of his novels. A bottle of Cutty Sark vintage 1985 is mentioned to be worth a fortune in science fiction novel Lies, Inc. by Philip K. Dick. In Yukio Mishima's 1971 novel [...] "The Decay of the Angel", Cutty Sark is the whiskey of choice for Honda, the main character.|$|R
5000|$|On May 14, Cutter buys Natalie a {{drink from}} a {{bartender}} that he hired at Shelter named Nikki (Jenni [...] "JWoww" [...] Farley), who made the drink and named it after her boss Cutter (who she occasionally sleeps with). Cutter <b>and</b> Natalie <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of the drink, but both doesn't like {{the taste of the}} drink that Nikki made. Cutter then tells his boss Blair that he's auditioning a singer named Dusky (Jessie Malakouti) to perform at Shelter. Despite making an initial bad impression by asking Rama for a drink even though she's underage, Dusky impresses Blair, Natalie, Rama, and the patrons at the club with her performance, and Blair hires her on the spot. Cutter also finds out that Nikki didn't serve his singer a drink despite being underage. Nikki then tells Cutter that even though she sometimes has casual sex with him, she doesn't appreciate him bringing other girls with him {{right in front of her}} because it makes her feel jealous.|$|R
60|$|Then a cow caribou {{came out}} of the woods onto the grassy point above me to drink. First she wandered all over the point, making it look {{afterwards}} as if a herd had passed. Then she took a sip of water by a rock, crossed to my side of the point, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> there; then {{to the end of the}} point, and another sip; then back to the first place. A nibble of grass, and she waded far out from shore to sip there; then back, with a nod to a lily pad, and a sip nearer the brook. Finally she meandered a long way up the shore out of sight, and when I picked up the paddle to go, she came back again. Truly a Wandergeist of the woods, like the plover of the coast, who never knows what he wants, nor why he circles about so, nor where he is going next.|$|E

Thof Squire Dickon “—this was a common misnomer with Benjamin—” is a nice gentleman, and as good a man to sail with as heart could wish, yet I shall tel the squire, d’ye see, in plain English, and that’s my native tongue, that if-so-be he is thinking of putting any Johnny Raw over my head, why, I shall resign. I began forrard, Mistress Prettybones, and worked my way aft, like a man. I was six months aboard a Garnsey lugger, hauling in the slack of the lee-sheet and coiling up rigging. From that I went a few trips in a fore-and-after, in the same trade, which, after all, was but a blind kind of sailing in the dark, where a man larns but little, excepting how to steer by the stars. Well, then, d’ye see, I larnt how a topmast should be slushed, and how a topgallant-sail was to be becketted; and then I did small jobs in the cabin, such as mixing the skipper’s grog. ‘Twas there I got my taste, which, you must have often seen, is excel lent. Well, here’s better acquaintance to us.” Remarkable nodded a return to the compliment, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of the beverage before her; for, provided it was well sweetened, she had no objection to a small potation now and then, After this observance of courtesy between the worthy couple, the dialogue proceeded.|$|E

[...] "It was right in the middle of our conversation about the medication he had taken that he poured a glass of water <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> from it. The water was unboiled.

5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Dave Meyers and premiered on June 20, 2009 in the United Kingdom on 4music at 11:00am. Tony Kanal of No Doubt, also the co-writer and the producer of the song, appears in a cameo, playing a piano. The video <b>takes</b> place in <b>a</b> barren lot that is later shown to be what's left of a house that is still burning. There are 'evil clowns' throughout the area who are picking though the rubble and playing the instruments as the band. The video begins as it pans {{low to the ground}} showing an [...] "Elvis" [...] grave briefly. Pink emerges from an old empty pool and begins to sing the first verse. She proceeds to kick over a toilet and picks up a framed photo. She throws it behind her. She passes a toaster and now it shows that she is in a burning fun house. She dances past a few 'evil clowns'. It shows more of the burning remains of the building. She picks up a stick and throws it down. Then an 'evil clown' turns around and the camera has a close up of its face. She counts down from 9. (She quickly shows her middle finger on '5' but on most versions of the video that is blurred out.) She moves to <b>a</b> table <b>and</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of some red liquid but becomes disgusted and throws it down. She jumps onto a mattress attached to a chain which two 'evil clowns' are pulling. She gets off the mattress and climbs onto the burning fun house. It shows four 'evil clowns' (Two are miming with each other, one is playing the guitar and the last is just standing on its own.) She goes over to the guitar playing clown and dances with it. She proceeds to count down from 9 again. She climbs through a doggie door to find Tony Kanal playing the piano. Pink moves to a motorcycle and puts on sunglasses and a leather jacket. In the background a voice is counting down from 9. At one she rides away on the motorcycle as the house explodes. It then shows her riding her motorcycle on a road as the song ends.|$|R
5000|$|The next {{visualization}} has Nikhil {{drunk and}} sorting out CDs in the bedroom, {{as he calls}} out to Radhika to join him. Nikhil then starts off asking Radhika if she knows what [...] "Supari" [...] is. When she responds saying it is money given {{to get rid of}} someone, Nikhil starts playing out a mock situation where he gives supari to get Krish maimed. He enacts a complete scene where the goons castrate Krish and place his genitals in a glass jar, in this case, the glass of champagne Nikhil is drinking acts as the prop <b>and</b> Nikhil directly <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> out of it after he has finished his little act. Radhika is visibly disgusted and walks out of the bedroom.|$|R
60|$|So, {{the young}} lady sat down with Mr. John Dounce, in a little red box with <b>a</b> green curtain, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> small <b>sip</b> of the brandy-and-water, and a small look at Mr. John Dounce, and then turned her head away, and went through various other serio-pantomimic fascinations, which {{forcibly}} reminded Mr. John Dounce of {{the first time he}} courted his first wife, and which made him feel more affectionate than ever; in pursuance of which affection, and actuated by which feeling, Mr. John Dounce sounded {{the young lady}} on her matrimonial engagements, when the young lady denied having formed any such engagements at all—she couldn’t abear the men, they were such deceivers; thereupon Mr. John Dounce inquired whether this sweeping condemnation was meant to include other than very young men; on which the young lady blushed deeply—at least she turned away her head, and said Mr. John Dounce had made her blush, so of course she did blush—and Mr. John Dounce was a long time drinking the brandy-and-water; and, at last, John Dounce went home to bed, and dreamed of his first wife, and his second wife, and the young lady, and partridges, and oysters, and brandy-and-water, and disinterested attachments.|$|R
50|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Menzel's health problems {{appeared in the}} quarter-finals of the French Championships, when he played against Bunny Austin, No. 2-ranked {{player in the world}} that time. He was leading 2-1 in sets but, while changing sides, he made a mistake <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> from his opponent's glass. To his unpleasant surprise, it was a gin instead of water. Vision problems and hallucinations immediately followed and Menzel lost the match. He did not pay too much attention to it until the Davis Cup final a few weeks later, when he played a crucial match of the whole series against von Cramm. The famous German already had two match points in the fourth set, but Menzel managed to avert the threat and won the set 7-5 to tie the match at 2-2. After Menzel won {{the first game of the}} fifth set and von Cramm continued to suffer, he received a strange offer at his home bench while changing sides. 'It will strengthen you' said President of the Czech Tennis Association and handed Menzel a glass of champagne! Menzel still managed to nearly win the second game of the fifth set, but once he started to see blurry sidelines, he knew that it was over. He lost the final set 1-6.|$|E

Not too hot, not too sweet, not too weak, not too strong, not too much milk, and not a drop spilled in the saucer. A most amazing cove, Jeeves. So dashed competent in every respect. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I mean to say, take just one small instance. Every other valet I've ever had used to barge into my room in the morning while I was still asleep, causing much misery; but Jeeves seems to know when I'm awake by a sort of telepathy. He always floats in with the cup exactly two minutes after I come to life. Makes a deuce {{of a lot of}} difference to a fellow's day.|$|R
5000|$|Tom {{manages to}} clear his ears out {{and is able to}} hear the sounds of the jungle. Soon after, Jerry pokes his head out of a gun's barrel and taunts Tom. Tom tries to grab Jerry, but his owner {{immediately}} yells to him [...] "DON'T TOUCH MY GUNS!!!", which scares Tom off of the basket and onto the elephant's buckle. To make matters worse, Jerry unbuckles the belt, causing Tom to fall off. Later, the owner manages as he falls off. Tom's owner, blaming Tom for the act, angrily traps him in the overturned basket and the elephant walks off without them. The two attempt {{to get back on the}} elephant, but fail, and just as the owner prepares to punch Tom, they are both interrupted by the thunderous roar of a lion. Frightened, the owner reaches back for Tom to hand him a gun for self defense as Tom searches the basket. Jerry hands him with a thermos and he gives it to Tom's owner. As the hunter fights the lion, Jerry puts his hat over his chest in mourning sarcastically, sobbing. After defeating the lion, the scratched-up <b>and</b> irritated owner <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of coffee from the thermos and counts all the way to ten before clobbering Tom over his head with a thermos.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on 29 April 2013, directed by Chris Marrs Piliero. It features a gothic theme, being set in a 'spooky, dark, [...] "Addams Family"-esque high school'. The video features product placement from Sony and Mini. Mika uses a Sony Xperia Z to text an invitation for a dinner party to his popular classmates who are bullying him. This is interlaced with scenes of the two brewing a potion in a witch's cauldron and scenes of them falling victim to bullying. Mika and Grande return to Mika's mansion in his talking car, a 2013 Mini Cooper. At the dinner party, the bullies consume their drinks drugged with the potion, and turn to stone. They are then ruthlessly smashed into pieces by Mika and Grande, with the former using a candlestick and the latter using a food tray. However, the video ends with a twist: [...] as Mika and Grande have a toast <b>and</b> the former <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> from his drink, the video flashes back to when the two were children and Mika is seen kicking down Grande's castle made of wooden blocks. As Grande glares coldly at him, Mika subsequently turns to stone as well. The video then ends with Grande sipping her drink as she smirks evilly at the camera. The gothic theme of the video and its vengeful nature, {{as well as the}} costume worn by Mika as he and Grande are shown 'cooking', is generally considered reminiscent of the aesthetic and plot of the Stephen Sondheim musical Sweeney Todd, tying back to the musical theatre roots of the song established in modifying a song from Wicked.|$|R
