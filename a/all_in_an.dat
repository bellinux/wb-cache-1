When playing the kulintang, the Maguindanao and Maranao would always sit on chairs while for the Tausug/Suluk and other groups that who play the kulintangan, they would commonly sit on the floor. Modern techniques include twirling the beaters, juggling them in midair, changing {{the arrangement of the}} gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding very rapid fire strokes <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to show off a player's grace and virtuosity.|$|E

The film was met with mixed critical reviews before its theatrical release, although it has since gained a cult following. Its initial popularity inaugurated {{the beginning of the}} Alien Nation media franchise.

25|$|Only two C90As {{were built}} in 1992, the Model C90B {{followed}} that year with airframe improvements, four-bladed propellers, and propeller synchrophasing, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to reduce cabin noise. This model also had PT6A-21s; the first production C90B was fitted with the 10,000th PT6 engine delivered to Beechcraft. In 1994 a cheaper version was introduced as the C90SE (Special Edition), with three-bladed propellers, standardised interior and mechanical instruments instead of the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) fitted to the C90B. A total of 456 C90Bs and C90SEs were delivered by the time production of these models ended in late 2005.|$|E
25|$|His {{foundational}} work on {{algebraic geometry}} is {{at a higher}} level of abstraction than all prior versions. He adapted the use of non-closed generic points, which led to the theory of schemes. He also pioneered the systematic use of nilpotents. As 'functions' these can take only the value 0, but they carry infinitesimal information, in purely algebraic settings. His theory of schemes has become established as the best universal foundation for this field, because of its expressiveness as well as technical depth. In that setting one can use birational geometry, techniques from number theory, Galois theory and commutative algebra, and close analogues of the methods of algebraic topology, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> integrated way.|$|E

Although uncertainty over whether executions in the United States would be put on hold during {{the period in which}} the United States Supreme Court considers the constitutionality of lethal injection initially arose after the court agreed to hear Baze, no executions took place during the period between when the court agreed to hear the case and when its ruling was announced, {{with the exception of one}} lethal injection in Texas hours after the court made its announcement.|$|E
500|$|Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear {{began to}} pitch The Rocketeer in 1986 {{to the major}} film studios but were turned down. [...] "This was 1986, long before Batman or Dick Tracy or {{anything}} similar", Stevens explained. [...] "In those days, no studio was interested at <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> expensive comic book movie. We got there about three years too early for our own good!" [...] Walt Disney Studios eventually accepted The Rocketeer because they believed the film had toyetic potential and appeal for merchandising. The Rocketeer was set to be released through the studio's Touchstone Pictures label; Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear all signed a contract which would permit {{them to make a}} trilogy of Rocketeer films. However, Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg switched the film to a Walt Disney Pictures release. According to Stevens, [...] "immediately, Betty and anything else 'adult' went right out with the bathwater. They really tried to shoehorn it into a kiddie property so they could sell toys. All they really wanted {{at the end of the}} day, was the name".|$|E
500|$|Following {{his death}} in 1959, his widow Dorothy Brown, who was a noted New Orleans philanthropist, renovated the {{property}} for a more modern look, including a wide arched canopy in the front. [...] In the early 1960s, the Mississippi Gulf Coast was emerging as a prime alternative to Florida as a southern vacation destination, and the Broadwater Beach Resort was considered the pacesetter for the area. [...] In 1963, Dorothy Brown spent $3 million to build a marina and a heliport. The Broadwater Resort Marina plan was especially ambitious, involving hosting up to 150 sail and powerboats, and offering shore-to-ship maid service and room service to those docked, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to capture blue-water game fishing business. When the marina opened in 1965, it was considered state of the art. In 1968, she built the Broadwater Beach Sun Course on land originally owned by Jefferson Davis, and thus added golf as a prime attraction for visitors; by 1974 a Sea Course was also present. During the 1960s, a men's store was present in the hotel. [...] For entertainment, the hotel featured musicians from New Orleans and elsewhere. [...] From the 1950s on, operational control of the hotel and resort rested with Leigh MacConnell, {{one of the few}} women to rise {{to the top of the}} local hotel industry in that era. [...] In the 1960s the Broadwater Beach Resort found its glory years. Hosting movie stars, leading politicians, and top business figures, as well as people on vacation, it became the Gulf Coast's flagship resort. [...] During this decade, the iconic and colorfully lit Broadwater Beach Resort front sign was added.|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, King {{states that}} its present {{position}} {{was a response}} of Hindu intellectuals to centuries of Christian polemic aimed at establishing [...] "Hindu inferiority complex" [...] during the colonial rule of the Indian subcontinent. The [...] "humanistic, inclusivist" [...] formulation, now called Neo-Vedanta, attempted {{to respond to this}} colonial stereotyping of [...] "Indian culture was backward, superstitious and inferior to the West", states King. Advaita Vedanta was projected as the central philosophy of Hinduism, and Neo-Vedanta subsumed and incorporated Buddhist ideas thereby making the Buddha a part of the Vedanta tradition, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to reposition the history of Indian culture. Thus, states King, neo-Vedanta developed as a reaction to western Orientalism and Perennialism.

2500|$|Although Pearl {{had long}} {{dominated}} the Texas market over Lone Star, {{that did not}} stop the rivalry between the two. [...] Each brewery was intent on being known as the brewery of Texas. [...] Competition in the community was fierce, with both companies doing all they could {{to be associated with}} any large event. [...] In the 1950s and '60s the competition was at its highest. [...] For San Antonio's week-long festival called Fiesta, each company would sponsor as many floats and events as possible in an attempt to get their name out the most in the public eye. [...] During the annual San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo, Lone Star and Pearl would get into bidding wars over the blue ribbon winner of each show-animal category. [...] The two breweries would drive the prices up sometimes triple the animal's worth, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt to best their rival.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, the Stromberg-Voisinet {{firm was}} the first company to sell an {{electric}} stringed instrument and amplifier package. However, musicians found that the amps had an [...] "unsatisfactory tone and volume, [...] dependability problems", so the product did not sell well. Even though the Stromberg-Voisinet amp did not sell well, it still launched a new idea: a portable electric instrument amp with a speaker, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> easily transported wooden cabinet. In 1929, Vega electrics launched a portable banjo amplifier. In 1932, Electro String Instruments and amplifier (this {{is not the same}} company as Stromberg Electro Instruments) introduced a guitar amp with [...] "high output" [...] and a [...] "string driven magnetic pickup". Electro set out the standard template for combo amps: a wooden cabinet with the electronic amplifier mounted inside, and a convenient carrying handle to facilitate transporting the cabinet. 1n 1933, Vivi-Tone amp set-ups were used for live performances and radio shows. In 1934, Rickenbacker launched a similar combo amp that added metal corner protectors to keep the corners in good condition during transportation.|$|E

2500|$|Printing Plans, Elevations, Sections and Details of the Alhambra {{had been}} a {{significant}} financial strain for Jones, but the publication had gained Jones a huge profile due to its pioneering standards of chromolithography. After, and possibly during, the long gestation period for Alhambra, Jones used his printing press to enter the lucrative market for illustrated and illuminated gift books which were becoming increasingly popular with the Victorian middle class. Jones designed both secular and religious books (collaborating most notably with the publishers Day & Son and Longman & Co.) and developed innovative new binding techniques using materials such as embossed leather, papier-mâché and terracotta – <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attempt {{to do justice to}} the luxurious contents, much of which could trace its aesthetic lineage back to sumptuous medieval illuminated manuscripts and religious bindings. [...] Apart from these books, Jones's most significant (and most widely consumed) printing output was through his long-standing relationship with the firm of De La Rue. From the mid-1840s until the end of his life, some 30 years later, Jones designed an astonishing variety of products for De La Rue including playing cards, menus, biscuit-tin wrappers, postage stamps, chessboards, endpapers, scrap albums and diaries.|$|E

That year, they signed with Blue Thumb Records and released {{the first of two}} albums with them, the first of which, Outta Season, included their modest hit cover of [...] "I've Been Loving You Too Long" [...] (a song originally sung and written by Otis Redding). The second Blue Thumb release, The Hunter, followed in 1969, and included their modest hit cover of the Albert King hit as well as an original composition titled [...] "Bold Soul Sister". Tina's rendition of [...] "The Hunter" [...] led to the singer receiving her first solo Grammy nomination in 1970. Prior to the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, Ike had lived a teetotal, drug and alcohol free life.
