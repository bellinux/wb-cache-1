5|$|In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse– now art {{director}} of the Sèvres national porcelain factory– offered Rodin a part-time position as <b>a</b> <b>designer.</b> The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted.

5|$|On 14 February 1881, Rowland Plumbe was {{appointed}} Consulting Architect to the Artizans Company, {{with a brief}} to prepare a third estate.

She took her inspiration from a book on waterfalls of the Columbia River Gorge, which was given to her by Ira Keller at the design studio. It was built by the Schrader Construction Company for $512,000.|$|E

5|$|The Emeco 1006 (pronounced ten-oh-six), {{also known}} as the Navy chair, is an {{aluminum}} chair manufactured by Emeco. The 1006 was originally built for Navy warships during World War II, but later became <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> chair used in high-end restaurants and by interior designers. In the 1990s, the company began creating designer versions of the 1006 chair, such as the stackable Hudson chair and the 111 Navy Chair made from recycled plastic. Emeco also makes stools, tables, and other furniture. As of 2012, more than one million Emeco 1006 chairs have been produced.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>designer</b> named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, {{claiming}} {{he developed the}} Solid State system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, allowing him to hack her cyberbrain. The Puppeteer reveals that he was spread across several egos until a collective consciousness emerged and developed into a Solid State, allowing him {{to move into the}} society beyond as the vanishing mediator. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a cybernetic body and built the Solid State after he was hired by Munei. Kusanagi does not reveal that the Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the Puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be written off as a scandal.|$|E
5|$|Although Fox {{insisted on}} {{maintaining}} CinemaScope for a time, some actors disliked the system. For Fox's 1965 production Von Ryan's Express, Frank Sinatra reputedly demanded that Auto Panatar lenses be used. Such pressures led Fox to completely abandon CinemaScope for Auto Panatars that year; Von Ryan's Express was the studio's first picture with Panavision lenses. To meet the extraordinary demand for Panavision projection lenses, Gottschalk had Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lenses retrofitted into Panavision housings {{with a new}} astigmatic attachment, improving them greatly. This was revealed many years after Gottschalk's death; a lead designer from Bausch & Lomb, who had {{been involved with the}} original CinemaScope project, came to work as <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> for Panavision and—after opening some of the older lenses—figured out the secret.|$|E

5|$|Development of Invisible War {{began at}} series creator Ion Storm {{following}} {{the success of}} the original Deus Ex. Most of the original game's development team returned to develop Invisible War, eager to both tell a new story and refine the original gameplay. There were also relative newcomers who had worked on the original game's PlayStation 2 (PS2) port. Harvey Smith, who worked as lead designer for the original game, was chosen by the original director and series creator Warren Spector to direct the game; Spector instead took on a supervisory role for both Invisible War and other projects within the company. While Smith was tempted to act as both director and designer, he saw that it would be too much work, so brought on Ricardo Bare as lead designer. Bare had been involved in the later development of Deus Ex, and despite his lack of experience as <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> was given the role when more qualified staff members were unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Following on {{from the}} site selection, the Scottish Office {{announced}} that an international competition would be held to find <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> for a new building to house the Parliament. A design committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Dewar, and was tasked with choosing from a shortlist of designs. Proposals were submitted from internationally renowned architects such as Rafael Viñoly, Michael Wilford and Richard Meier. Twelve designs were selected in March 1998, which were whittled down to five by the following May. The five final designs were put on public display throughout Scotland in June 1998. Feedback from the public displays showed that the designs of the Spanish architect Enric Miralles were amongst the most popular. The design team took account of public opinion on the designs and invited all five shortlisted entrants to make presentations on their proposed designs before announcing a winner.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had hoped}} that being the author of an ongoing comic strip would improve his job prospects, for {{at the time he}} was {{beginning}} to develop a reputation as <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> of postcards, stationary, and advertisements. Rather than representing an example of a comic as the medium would come to be understood in the following decade, The Adventures of Totor consisted of square boxes containing illustrations with the captions written separately underneath, as was the style found in French comic creator Christophe's works La Famille Fenouillard (The Fenouillard Family) and Sapeur Camembert (Sapper Camembert). Initially using four boxes per page, as the series progressed this was increased to six and then eight, with each page ending on a cliffhanger.|$|E

5|$|Ida Marcia Camelhor {{was born}} on 31 October 1882 in Kovno, Russia to Mary (née Dember) and Louis Camelhor (also noted as Lieb Kamelhorn). She was the only {{surviving}} child {{of a family of}} eight. Before her first birthday, her parents immigrated to New York and then when she was around ten years old, they moved to Providence, Rhode Island. She attended public grammar school and high school and, at sixteen years old, went to work as a bookkeeper for Archibald Silverman. Archibald, also an immigrant, had begun his career as <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> of costume jewelry. Together with his brother, Charles, he established the Silverman Brothers jewelry company in Providence in 1897. After two years of working in the jewelry business, Camelhor agreed to marry her boss; they wed in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the actual}} {{software}} development work on the game was done at Artoon, with Takuya Matsumoto serving as director and Manabu Kusonoki responsible for the game's world view. Matsumoto previously worked as <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> on , while Kusonoki {{is known for his}} work at Sega, including the world of Panzer Dragoon. Near the end of November 2005, roughly a year before the title was released in Japan, Artoon's Naoto Ohshima indicated that the game was around 40% complete. He also pointed out that Artoon had previously been known primarily for action titles, so that responsibility for Blue Dragon was originally somewhat frightening. Following this, a relative lack of media information for most of 2006 resulted in speculation that the title would be delayed until 2007, but Microsoft's Takashi Sensui confirmed in August 2006 that the game would indeed see a year-end 2006 release. Blue Dragon was eventually released on three full DVD discs, making it the first Xbox 360 game to span multiple discs.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} when Tetsuya Mizuguchi asked Masahiro Sakurai {{to make a}} falling block puzzle. Believing that the genre had not evolved since Tetris Attack (1995), Sakurai {{came up with the}} idea of having the blocks fall and shooting back up. The game's prototype was created in three days by <b>a</b> <b>designer,</b> a programmer, and a graphic artist. It was inspired by the TV series 24, the film The Matrix, and the Missile Command game. According to Mizuguchi, 24 camera work and the beginning of The Matrix (with dripping, green computer code) were the basis of the puzzle-game concept. In a Famitsu interview, Sakurai said that the opening CG video explaining its backstory was added to provide a sense of the game's world.|$|E
