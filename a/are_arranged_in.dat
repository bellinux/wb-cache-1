5|$|A shell {{galaxy is}} a type of {{elliptical}} galaxy where the stars in the galaxy's halo <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.|$|E

5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> {{a way that makes}} them complicated to analyze.

5|$|Because the cuticle layers <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> rows, with a {{cylindrical}} curve, {{the amount}} of the second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E

The macrobasidia are club shaped, measuring 38–57 by 8–14µm, {{and can be}} one- two-, three- or four-spored. The ratio of macrobasidia length to macrospore length is usually less than five to one. Clamp connections are present on the hyphae of several tissues of the mushroom. The hyphae of the gills (the lamellar trama) <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>in</b> a parallel fashion.|$|E
