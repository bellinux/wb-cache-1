5|$|It now {{dawned on}} the Privy Council {{that it had}} made <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake.</b> Led by the Earl of Arundel and the Earl of Pembroke, on 19 July the Council {{publicly}} proclaimed Mary as queen; Jane's nine-day reign came to an end. The proclamation triggered wild rejoicing throughout London. Stranded in Cambridge, Northumberland proclaimed Mary himself—as he had been commanded to do by {{a letter from the}} Council. William Paget and the Earl of Arundel rode to Framlingham to beg Mary's pardon, and Arundel arrested Northumberland on 24 July. Northumberland was beheaded on 22 August, shortly after renouncing Protestantism. His recantation dismayed his daughter-in-law, Jane, who followed him to the scaffold on 12 February 1554, after her father's involvement in Wyatt's rebellion.|$|E
25|$|When Ulysses was {{stationed}} on the West coast of California at Fort Humboldt in 1854 {{he had at}} that point been away from his wife and family two years. Longing to return home, and also prompted by rumors of excessive drinking, Ulysses tendered his resignation. Shocked by the news, Jesse intervened, feeling Ulysses was making <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake,</b> and urged Congressmen Andrew Ellison, and old friend of Jesse's, to get the War Department to order Grant home on recruitment duty instead, or otherwise grant him a six-month leave. Ellison presented the request to Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, but the request was denied. This {{would prove to be}} one more example of Jesse's involvement with his son's affairs.|$|E
500|$|Later, {{there were}} {{plans for a}} further scene, showing Rick, Renault and a {{detachment}} of Free French soldiers on a ship, to incorporate the Allies' 1942 invasion of North Africa. It proved too difficult to get Claude Rains for the shoot, and the scene was finally abandoned after David O. Selznick judged [...] "it would be <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake</b> to change the ending." ...|$|E

500|$|Jimmy Burns, {{reviewing}} {{the book for}} the Financial Times, speculated that it was plausible that [...] "MI6's senior management realised they had made <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake</b> in recruiting someone who thought that espionage was just one big adventure." [...] He concluded, however, that the book [...] "left me with {{the feeling that the}} spooks in Whitehall could have avoided a great deal of adverse publicity by agreeing to Tomlinson's original proposal: an employment tribunal held in camera." ...|$|E
500|$|Stone {{supported}} the amendment. [...] She had expected, however, that progressive forces would {{push for the}} enfranchisment of African Americans and women {{at the same time}} and was distressed when they did not.

[...] "O Abby", she wrote, [...] "it is <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake</b> you are all making... There is no other name given by which this country can be saved, but that of woman." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1900, Pierola {{intended}} {{to return to}} politics, this time running for the Mayorship of Lima. This was widely seen as <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> political <b>mistake,</b> since he was defeated by an independent coalition led by Agustín Elguera. He ran again for the presidency in 1904, but withdrew before the election took place. His influence in politics faded away and he made another political mistake by supporting his brothers Carlos, Isaías and Amadeo {{in their attempt to}} overthrown President Augusto B. Leguía.|$|R
500|$|Of {{his time}} in the Army, Gore later stated, [...] "I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform." [...] He also later stated that his {{experience}} in Vietnam didn't change my conclusions about the war being <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake,</b> but it struck me that opponents to the war, including myself, really did {{not take into account the}} fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for.|$|E
500|$|Streep's {{first feature}} film role came {{opposite}} Jane Fonda in the 1977 film Julia, {{in which she}} had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress: [...] "I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene I shot with Jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene. I thought, I've made <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake,</b> no more movies. I hate this business". However, Streep cites Fonda as having a lasting influence on her as an actress, and has credited her as [...] "open probably more doors than I probably even know about".|$|E
500|$|Human Rights Watch {{condemned}} the attack. [...] "The Bahraini army has done what the Egyptian army {{did not do}} and exactly what the United States and its other partners urged it not to do -- it has opened fire on its own people," [...] its Washington director said.

[...] "This is <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake</b> and they will pay a heavy price for it.

40|$|This {{letter is}} about a {{principal}} weakness of the published article by Li et al. in 2014.

50|$|A {{few years}} earlier, on July 23, 1983, at Dorval Airport in Montreal, the ground crew of Canada World Airways struggles to convert gallons into liters and pounds into kilograms, {{as they prepare}} to refuel a brand-new Boeing 767 bound for Edmonton. This is the first {{aircraft}} in the fleet to use the metric system and {{they are about to}} make <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> conversion <b>mistake.</b> Meanwhile, Beth Pearson (Mariette Hartley) drives her husband, Captain Robert Pearson (William Devane), to the airport, unusually anxious about hosting her in-laws later that day.

6000|$|At 2.20 P.M. on September 2, we left Porto da Lenha, {{and passed}} Mashel's Creek, on whose right bank is {{the village of}} Makatalla; the charts call it Foomou, and {{transfer}} it to the left. Here we enter upon the riverine archipelago. The great stream before one, now divides into three parallel branches, separated by long narrow islands and islets, banks and shallows. The northernmost channel in our maps, [...] "Maxwell River," [...] is known to Europeans and natives as Noangwa; Mamballa or the central line is called by the moderns Nshibúl, and the southern is dubbed by the hydrographer, [...] "Rio Konio," [...] <b>a</b> truly <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake</b> for Sonho. <b>As</b> a rule, the Noangwa, though infested during the rains by cruel mosquitoes, is preferred for the ascent, and the central for dropping down stream.

Prior to the estate and Anka reaching an agreement, Sa-Fire’s manager, Sal Abbatiello, stated that he was contemplating filing a lawsuit on behalf of his client, commenting [...] "This is <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake</b> [...] I’m pretty sure Paul Anka has a big case. I don’t know if Sa-Fire has any legal right as the artist. I’ll have to contact my lawyers. But, hopefully. They’re advertising this movie everywhere."

500|$|The new {{publisher}} scrapped Vanderbilt's editorial policy, {{and began}} a campaign against vice. The Los Angeles police chief, James E. Davis, had a hands-off policy {{when it came to}} vice and organized crime. Most local reporters valued the perks given to them by the police, and did nothing to push the issue. [...] After Boddy began a crusade against crime and corruption, he weathered harassment by police and politicians, circulation rose, and the paper was soon showing a profit. Boddy also streamlined operations and stabilized the paper's management. During the first six years of Boddy's ownership, the Daily News maintained a conservative editorial policy. By 1932, Boddy had dropped the word [...] "Illustrated" [...] from the name of the paper. He was a personal supporter of Herbert Hoover's bid for reelection. Los Angeles newspaper owners met and decided that, with all newspaper owners supporting Hoover, one paper had to support Democratic candidate and New York governor Franklin Roosevelt, and Boddy and the Daily News volunteered for the job. The day after the election, which saw Roosevelt elected, Boddy turned to his city editor and said of the voters: [...] "They have made <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake.</b> I helped them do it.
