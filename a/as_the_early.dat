5|$|Both sexes drum, {{although}} the male does {{so much more}} often, mostly from mid-January until the young are fledged. The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10â€“16strikes per second, typically in one-second bursts, although repeated frequently. As late <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> twentieth century {{it was thought that}} the drumming might be a vocalisation, and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.|$|E
5|$|Horse rings, {{often made}} of iron or brass, are {{remnants}} from the 1800s, when horses, and horse-drawn vehicles, provided the primary mode of transportation. In 1978, The Register-Guard {{suggested that the}} rings might only be as old <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1900s. The rings allowed residents to tether their horses to sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|MSU's (private, non-Morrill Act) {{endowment}} {{started in}} 1916 when the Engineering Building burned down. Automobile magnate R.E.

Messers Run was surveyed once by the environmental services branch of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. This survey was carried out by Young in November 1990.|$|E
5|$|The early {{development}} of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between {{those that were}} anthropogenic and those that were natural wild kinds. Formal botanical nomenclature and classification evolved from the simple binomial system of folk taxonomy {{and it was not}} until the mid-19th century that the nomenclatural path of cultigens began to diverge from mainstream plant taxonomy.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, {{the members of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, as {{a result}} of both {{production}} peaks in some nations and political instability in others, the world's supply of petroleum tightened leading to an energy crisis during the 1970s and early 1980s. Petroleum prices rose dramatically, greatly benefiting Texas, particularly as compared {{to other parts of the}} U.S. that faced recession during this time. A new economic boom emerged which, though not as transformative <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1900s, pushed the population of Texas to the point that, by the end of the century, Texas was the second most populous state in the nation. Some sources, in fact, use the phrase Texas oil boom to refer to this later period rather than the earlier period that followed Spindletop.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Adventures was {{initially}} published in bedsheet format, {{the same size}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> sf magazines such as Amazing, perhaps {{in order to attract}} fans who were nostalgic for the larger format. It started as a bimonthly, but in January 1940 began a monthly schedule. Sales were weaker than for Amazing, however, and with the June issue the schedule reverted to bimonthly. The size was also reduced to a standard pulp format, since that was cheaper to produce. Sales did not improve, and Ziff-Davis planned to make the October issue the last one. That issue carried Robert Moore Williams' Jongor of Lost Land, and had a cover by J. Allen St. John; the combination proved to be so popular that October sales were twice the August figures. This convinced Ziff-Davis that the magazine was viable, and it was restarted in January 1941as a bimonthly at first, but switching to monthly again in May of that year.|$|E
5|$|Halmahera {{island in}} the north of Molucca {{archipelago}} has been formed by the movement of three tectonic plates resulting in two intersecting mountain ranges, which form four rocky peninsulas separated by three deep bays. A volcanic arc stretches from north to south in the west side of Halmahera, some of which are volcanic islands, for instance, Gamalama and Tidore. Gamalama's island name is Ternate and it has been the centre for spice trading since the Portuguese Empire opened a fort in 1512. Due to its location as the centre for spice trading during the Age of Discovery, historical records of volcanic eruptions in Halmahera have been available as far back <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 16th century.|$|E

5|$|If truly a gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known {{geographic}} {{range of the}} group {{to another part of}} Gondwana, the African mainland. The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment of the significance of TNM02067 difficult. It may well be older than the oldest previously known gondwanathere, the Campanian Gondwanatherium. It also has implications for the hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Kerry Packer {{established}} the rival World Series Cricket (WSC) competition. It introduced {{many of the}} now commonplace features of One Day International cricket, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from {{the players on the}} pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England {{and other parts of the}} world, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.|$|E
5|$|La Blanca is a Maya {{archaeological site}} in the {{municipality}} of Melchor de Mencos in the northern PetÃ©n Department of Guatemala.

5|$|Most ALF vapor cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have {{absorption}} lines and resonance in the desired spectra. Common vapor cell materials are sodium, potassium and caesium. Note that non-metallic vapors such as neon may be used. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> quantum counters used solid state metal ions in crystals, {{it is conceivable that}} such a medium could be used in the ALFs of today. This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity.|$|E
5|$|My Kind of Christmas {{received}} generally mixed {{to negative}} reviews from music critics, who criticized its musical style, {{as well as}} Aguilera's vocal delivery. The album peaked at number 28 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having sold 1,015,000 copies there. Aguilera appeared on several television shows, such <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Early</b> Show and The David Letterman Show, to promote the album, and also performed a special concert for ABC, which was released on DVD in June 2001, as My Reflection.|$|E
5|$|Paraguay is a {{landlocked}} country and {{for much of}} its history it was difficult of access, except by sailing from the Atlantic up the River ParanÃ¡ and hence the River Paraguay (see map) <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Spanish explorers had done. There were other means of ingress, but they would have required an invading force to be resupplied through difficult and hostile country. So the command of the river was key {{to the security of}} Paraguay, who feared and distrusted its two much larger neighbours Brazil and Argentina.|$|E
