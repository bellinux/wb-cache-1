40|$|The {{development}} of several novel oil burner applications based on low pressure air atomization is described. The atomizer used is a prefilming, <b>airblast</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{of the type}} commonly used in gas turbine combustion. The air pressure used can be as low as 1, 300 Pa and such pressure can be easily achieved with a fan. Advantages over conventional, pressure-atomized nozzles include ability to operate at low input rates without very small passages and much lower fuel pressure requirements. The {{development of}} three specific applications is presented. The first two are domestic heating burners covering a capacity range 10 to 26 kW. The third application presented {{involves the use of}} this burner in an oil-fired thermophotovoltaic power generator system. Here the design firing rate is 2. 9 kW and the system produces 500 watts of electric power...|$|E
40|$|A well {{integrated}} experimental/analytical {{investigation was}} conducted to provide benchmark quality relevant to a prefilming type airblast fuel nozzle and its interaction with the combustor dome air swirler. The experimental investigation included a systematic study of both single-phase flows that involved single and twin co-axial jets with and without swirl. A two-component Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) was used to document the interaction of single and co-axial air jets with glass beads that simulate nonevaporating spray and simultaneously avoid the complexities associated with fuel atomization processes and attendant issues about the specification of relevant boundary conditions. The interaction of jets with methanol spray produced by practical <b>airblast</b> <b>nozzle</b> was also documented in the spatial domain of practical interest. Model assessment activities included the use of three turbulence models (k-epsilon, algebraic second moment (ASM), and differential second moment (DSM)) for the carrier phase, deterministic or stochastic Lagrangian treatment of the dispersed phase, and advanced numerical schemes. Although qualitatively good comparison with data was obtained {{for most of the}} cases investigated, the model deficiencies in regard to modeled dissipation rate transport equation, single length scale, pressure-strain correlation, and other critical closure issues need to be resolved before one can achieve the degree of accuracy required to analytically design combustion systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{considered}} characteristics of sprays under {{a variety of}} conditions. Control of these sprays is important as the spray details can control both rocket combustion stability and efficiency. Under the present study Imperial College considered the following: (1) Measurement of the size and rate of spread of the sprays produced by single coaxial <b>airblast</b> <b>nozzles</b> with axial gaseous stream. The local size, velocity, and flux characteristics {{for a wide range of}} gas and liquid flowrates were measured, and the results were correlated with the conditions of the spray at the nozzle exit. (2) Examination of the effect of the geometry of single coaxial airblast atomizers on spray characteristics. The gas and liquid tube diameters were varied over a range of values, the liquid tube recess was varied, and the shape of the exit of the gaseous jet was varied from straight to converging. (3) Quantification of the effect of swirl in the gaseous stream on the spray characteristics produced by single coaxial <b>airblast</b> <b>nozzles.</b> (4) Quantification of the effect of reatomization by impingement of the spray on a flat disc positioned around 200 mm from the nozzle exit. This models spray impingement on the turbopump dome during the startup process of the preburner of the SSME. (5) Study of the interaction between multiple sprays without and with swirl in their gaseous stream. The spray characteristics of single nozzles were compared with that of three identical nozzles with their axis at a small distance from each other. This study simulates the sprays in the preburner of the SSME, where there are around 260 elements on the faceplate of the combustion chamber.

40|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of multiphase flows, they are often studied with numerical simulations. These simulations must be validated with experimental results. This paper introduces a new approach to initialize the continuous phase of gas-liquid flows generated by <b>airblast</b> <b>nozzles</b> for microlubrication applications with a recently modified commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FINE™/Open. Microlubrication is a technology used in metal machining where the coolant flow rate is lower than with conventional flood cooling. In this paper, single-phase gas and two-phase liquid-gas flows are studied. The continuous phase is simulated using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with a k-ε turbulence model and the dispersed phase is simulated using a Lagrangian method. To validate these simulations, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle dynamics analysis (PDA) measurements have been performed. This study illustrates the possibility of performing complex two-phase simulations with the help of single-phase studies to initialize the continuous phase of the flow (i. e. the gas). The single-phase flow also helps in estimating the magnitudes of the droplet velocities. Copyright © 2013 by ASME. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The driving {{mechanism}} of pulsations in gas turbine combustors {{depends on a}} complex interaction between flow field, chemistry, heat release and acoustics. In aeroengines with <b>airblast</b> <b>nozzles,</b> {{the response of the}} fuel, in terms of liquid fuel flux, atomization and evaporation to a fluctuating aerodynamical and thermochemical environment needs to be considered as well. The objective of this work was to investigate the response of the heat release and the liquid fuel distribution to forced periodic modulations of the primary air flow through a diffusion type burner using airblast atomizers. A second focus was on the investigation of the pressure effect and the influence of the nozzle exit geometry on fuel placement and its interaction with the heat release region. The spatial distribution of spray density and heat release at three different modulation frequencies was studied using simultaneous phase-resolved OH chemiluminescence for heat release visualization, and planar Mie scattering of kerosene in two <b>airblast</b> <b>nozzles</b> with different exit geometries. Experiments were performed for a variety of pressures, preheat temperatures, AFR values and modulation frequencies. The purpose of these experiments was to study the potential effect of the prefilmer on the impedance of the system, and its dependence on operating parameters. For one set of operating conditions, the dependence of the phase shift between plenum and combustor pressures on modulation frequency was studied as well. It was observed that the exit geometry of the nozzle has a considerable effect on the flame shape and fuel distribution, but also on the modulation depth of the response to forcing of the air flow. Superposition of fuel and heat release distributions shows that the expanding and contracting fuel spray cone during a period of the air flow modulation drives the region of the heat release, by establishing favourable flammability conditions at varying locations during the oscillation. Instantaneous and phase-averaged images of spray and heat release distribution were recorded at eight phase angles with 45 ° separation, to cover a full period of the oscillation. Within this phase resolution, no phase shift between spatially integrated fuel flux and heat release could be observed. If there is a changing impedance of the fuel flow caused by a potential storage effect on the prefilmer, it is too small to cause a phase shift variation with forcing frequency within the phase resolution of this experiment. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{modified}} version of the KIVA-II code was used to obtain a multidimensional numerical solution for the turbulent two-phase chemically reacting flows inside a staged turbine combustor (STC). The STC under consideration is equipped with an advanced <b>airblast</b> fuel <b>nozzle</b> and encompasses a fuel nozzle (FN), a rich-burn (RB) zone, a converging connecting pipe, a quick-quench (QQ) zone, a diverging connecting pipe, and a lean-combustion (LC) zone. The STC was divided into two subsystems, namely, FN/RB zone and QQ/LC zones, and the numerical solutions were obtained separately for each subsystem. Preliminary data characterize the major features of the flow and temperature fields inside the STC. Information on velocity, temperature, and some critical species in the FN/RB zone is presented. In the QQ/LC zones, formation of the co- and counter-rotating bulk flow and the sandwiched-ring-shaped temperature field can be clearly seen. The calculations of the mass-weighted standard deviation and the pattern factor of temperature indicated that the mixing performance of the STC is very promising...|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} {{experimental}} results of model <b>airblast</b> atomization <b>nozzles</b> {{closely related to}} practical use are presented. They were investigated within {{a wide range of}} load for the model fluids water/air. for this the nozzle construction as well as the operation parameters were varied. The air passage, the distribution of air, the air-water ratios and the counterpressure at the nozzle outlet are essential influential parameters investigated. The spray images were visually assessed. Velocity, size and distribution of the droplets were measured by means of phase doppler anemometer (PDA) and taken into account in the assessment of the nozzle. The measurements were conducted under atmosphaeric as well as under raised pressure at the nozzle outlet. For the measurement with PDA through optical windows rinsing air was applied in some experiments, a fluid coating on the glass surface in others. (orig.)
