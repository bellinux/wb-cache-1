5|$|Seven {{years later}} the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: plundered the English {{as far as the}} river Tees, and he seized a {{multitude}} of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said.</b> Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.|$|E
5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E
500|$|... "In {{that country}} [...] {{and by all}} Ind [...] be great plenty of cockodrills, that is a manner of a long serpent, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> before. And in the night they dwell in the water, and on the day upon the land, in rocks and in caves. And they eat no meat in all the winter, but they lie as in a dream, as do the serpents. These serpents slay men, and they eat them weeping; and when they eat they move the over jaw, and not the nether jaw, {{and they have no}} tongue." ...|$|E
60|$|At length, having got room to speak, I {{told him}} that, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> before, <b>I</b> could deny him {{but one thing}} in the world; I was very sorry he should propose that thing only that I could not grant.|$|R
60|$|Circumstances {{had shown}} {{me the way}} that I must take, and the folly of going forth a {{fugitive}} outcast at my mother's bidding. I was Lord of Mondolfo, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> and they should know and feel it from this hour--all of them, not excepting my mother.|$|R
60|$|He {{put them}} up <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> and stood there in a sheepish manner with no idea of {{anything}} further. It {{seemed to me that}} if I could make him angry he would do better, so I knocked off his hat, which was black and hard, of the kind which is called billy-cock.|$|R
500|$|Mr. Pound has shaken {{the dust}} of London from his feet with not too {{emphatic}} a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.... has been an exhilarating influence for culture in England; he has left his mark upon {{more than one of}} the arts, upon literature, music, poetry and sculpture, and quite a number of men and movements owe their initiation to his self-sacrificing stimulus... With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> is not unusual... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.|$|E
2500|$|Antonioni {{wrote that}} the film was [...] "expressed through images in which I hope to show not the birth of an {{erroneous}} sentiment, but rather {{the way in which}} we go astray in our sentiments. Because <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> our moral values are old. Our myths and conventions are old. And everyone knows that they are indeed old and outmoded. Yet we respect them." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Henry Wickham Steed, Herzl was {{initially}} [...] "fanatically {{devoted to the}} propagation of Jewish-German 'Liberal' assimilationist doctrine". However, Herzl came to reject his early ideas regarding Jewish emancipation and assimilation and {{to believe that the}} Jews must remove themselves from Europe. Herzl grew to believe that antisemitism could not be defeated or cured, only avoided, and {{that the only way to}} avoid it was the establishment of a Jewish state. In June, 1895, he wrote in his diary: [...] "In Paris, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> I achieved a freer attitude toward anti-semitism... Above all, I recognized the emptiness and futility of trying to 'combat' anti-semitism." [...] Herzl's editors of Neue Freie Presse refused any publication of his Zionist political activities. A mental clash gripped Herzl, between the craving for literary success and a desire to act as a public figure. Around this time, Herzl started writing pamphlets about 'A Jewish State'. Herzl claimed that these pamphlets resulted in the establishment of the Zionist Movement, and they did play a large role in the movement's rise and success. His testimony before the British Royal Commission reflected his fundamental, romantic liberal view on life as the 'Problem of the Jews'.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, sir, I don't think so. Two {{of the men}} {{sat here}} talking with feyther till past eleven o'clock, but they thought that I was in bed, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> goodnight and <b>had</b> gone into my room an hour before, and I did not see any one about in the village <b>as</b> <b>I</b> came back over the moor behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, mamma, I know,' said Mysie, meekly. 'I recollected <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> it; {{and told}} him, and {{he kissed me}} and promised he would never tell anyone, and made Fly promise that she never would. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been so miserable about it ever since, mamma; I tried to write it in a letter, but I am afraid you didn't half understand.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} site of {{the town}} was then located {{near the mouth of}} the Subangdaku River. It was then a satellite territory under the domain of Seilani, which comprises the areas from Sogod to the island of Panaon. Around 1544, due to unfavorable winds, a Spanish expedition headed by Ruy López de Villalobos arrived at the eastern town of Abuyog, Leyte where an aged inhabitant informed Garcia de Escalante Alvarado, the chronicler of the expedition, on the presence of trading posts found in the archipelago:"I asked him , whether there was a big town anywhere on the island of Abuyo [...] and he said yes, {{on the other side of}} the island to the north-west [...] there was a big town called Sugut whither Chinese junks come every year and where there are resident Chinese who have a house for their merchandise. He said that what they buy there is gold and slaves..." [...] On September 6, 1571, Leyte was established as an encomienda with Tandaya as the command post of the Spanish colony in the island. An encomienda was not actually a piece of land, but a favor from the Spanish monarch under which the Spaniard, or the encomendero, receiving the favor was given the right to collect tributes or taxes from the inhabitants of an area assigned to him. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the first Governador-General of the Philippines, assigned Juan de Trujillo as the first encomendero of Tandaya. Miguel de Loarca, one of the first Spanish conquistadores to arrive in the Philippines and conducted one of the earliest census in the country, affirmed that Sogod was already drafted to the encomienda system in 1582. However, the town was pronounced as Tugud or Tugut:"Island of Baybay. About three (3) leagues [...] farther east lies the island of Baybay, or Leyte, as it is also called. It is a large and well-provisioned island, although the people dress in medriñaque [...] Leyte is thickly settled; it may have a population of fourteen or fifteen thousand (14,000-15,000) Indians, ten thousand of whom pay tribute because that has been a people hard to conquer. There are twelve (12) encomenderos; but his Majesty owns none of the Indians. This island is about eighty (80) leagues in circumference, and fifteen (15) or sixteen (16) wide. Its principal settlements and rivers are Vaybay, Yodmuc, Leyte, Cavigava, Barugo, Maraguincay , Palos, Abuyo, Dulaque, Longos, Bito [...] , Cabalian, Calamocan [...] and Tugud. This island possesses neither mines nor gold-placers; the only cloth it produces is medriñaque, which, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> before, resembles calico, and is made from a kind of wild banana." ...|$|E
60|$|Than hers, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> {{there is}} in history no sadder story.|$|E

60|$|He went, however, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> before <b>said,</b> {{and troubled}} {{the people of}} Dunmore no longer, nor shall he again trouble us.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{with much}} difficulty, {{he gave his}} consent; and as he was not {{therefore}} admitted to transportation in court, and on his petition, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was, so he found himself under a difficulty to avoid embarking himself <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> he might <b>have</b> done; his great friend, who was his intercessor for the favour of that grant, having given security for him that he should transport himself, and not return within the term.|$|R
60|$|We {{crossed a}} walk to {{the other part of}} the academy, where, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> already <b>said,</b> the {{projectors}} in speculative learning resided.|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> {{the three}} {{brothers}} were orphans, their parents having died several years before.|$|E
60|$|His lordship's pale, dreamy eyes had, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> a {{habit of}} observing things, and his wits were tolerably acute.|$|E
60|$|Blood did {{not look}} up from his task. There was not the need. He knew the voice, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "The sole aim of {{the arts}} of scene-designing, costuming, lighting, is, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> already <b>said,</b> to enhance the natural powers of the actor." ...|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not answer}} that. She sat quite still looking in front of her. [...] "WHY have you gone over?" [...] she asked {{abruptly}} <b>as</b> though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, sir. I mustn't demean {{me to say}} <b>as</b> {{anything}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> wasn't rubbish {{when you}} said as it was-- But for all that, I've got to go." ...|$|R
60|$|The deck, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> {{was at a}} very stiff cant. His Excellency sat down, slid to leeward, and {{was asleep}} again.|$|E
60|$|But for awhile, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> that darkness, solitude, {{and silence}} {{were to be}} sought in the grot, not in the grove.|$|E
60|$|The priests, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> before, were {{accounted}} necromancers: {{the appearance}} of two of our three visitors might have justified the conceit.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> am, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> a {{cautious}} man, indeed a timid one, and this suggestion frightened me. It {{seemed to me}} that to undertake such a journey would be to go to certain death, and putting other considerations aside, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a son to support, I could not afford to die just then.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I had no {{difficulty}} {{in finding out}} the direction of that letter. It was addressed Mr. Thomas Pigeon, Post Office, R-, Northamptonshire, to be left till called for. Off I started directly for R-; I said the same at the Post Office there, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> at B-; and again I waited three days before anybody came. At last another chap on horseback came. [...] "Any letters for Mr. Thomas Pigeon?" [...] "Where do you come from?" [...] "New Inn, near R-." [...] He got the letter, and away HE went at a canter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{the young}} gentlemen whom the young ladies here usually meet in society are all {{at work in}} the cities?" [...] the Altrurian asked him, rather needlessly, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already <b>said</b> so.|$|R
60|$|But for a while, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> that darkness, solitude, {{and silence}} {{were to be}} sought in the grot, not in the grove.|$|E

6000|$|... 'It is <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thought,' <b>said</b> the horse-dealer. 'He {{has come}} through Umballa at least, {{and there he}} has written a letter to me, having learned in the bazar that I was here.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2- Given {{the current}} circumstances, I expect the {{government}} to take all measures to restore people’s confidence. Otherwise, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> already <b>said,</b> a government not respecting people’s vote has no religious or political legitimacy.|$|R
