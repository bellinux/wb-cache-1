Woodford was the first Immediate Past Master of the lodge, and as such convened the lodge for much of its first two years, during the frequent absences of Charles Warren, the master. Just before his death, towards the end of 1887, he passed on a set of coded papers which resulted in the establishment of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.|$|E

5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change. Temperatures have increased {{in the last century}} while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. These changes have impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme weather events, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} climactic eruptions {{released}} vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America, falling many hundreds of miles away.

5|$|Emergency {{medicine}} is a specialty that was first {{developed in the}} United States in the 1960s.

In addition, Duyệt opposed Emperor Minh Mạng's ascension and defended Christian missionaries and converts from the emperor's isolationist and Confucian policies.

Diversion of water for irrigation often reduces the river to a small stream by the time it reaches its mouth.
