The approach is based on determination of a consensus relation which is in "nearest distance " from all initial rankings shaped by multiple sensors of each network node. Statistically and probabilistically based analytical models useful for assuring network performance and providing reasonable number values n – k and m are proposed and discussed, where n – k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> packets transmitted to the sink; n <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the network sensor nodes; k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dropped packets due to a congestion; and m <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> node sensors (or rankings) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{frame of}} {{reference}} with respect to studies of the visual system refers to perceived reference axes. In the rod and frame illusion, there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that can influence one's {{frame of reference}}. Past {{research has found that}} one reason people experience the rod and frame illusion is due to visual-vestibular interactions. For instance, when a participant is viewing the rod and frame task while physically tilted, the participant acts as though they are tilted opposite of the orientation of the frame. This suggests that the illusion, in part, is due to the person compensating for their perceived vertical in the direction that is opposite of the frame. Other evidence proposed by researchers that is consistent with this is that, when participants are put on their sides to view the rod and frame task, they rely on their vision when their vestibular and proprioceptive senses are incongruent with those of their visual senses. These findings suggest that the rod and frame illusion is processed in a type of hierarchy, where visual input is at the top, then vestibular cues, and finally proprioceptive cues. In 2010, Lipshits found that, along with this hierarchy of processing, proprioceptive information, as opposed to gravity, is used by the body to determine which way is vertical. Lipshits says that, when we are not able to use vision to determine which way is vertical, we use other cues based on the axis of our head and body.|$|E
