5|$|Euler {{was one of}} {{the most}} eminent mathematicians of the 18th century and is held to be one of the {{greatest}} in history. He is also widely considered to be the most prolific mathematician of all time. His collected works fill 60 to 80 quarto volumes, more than <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> the field. He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most of his}} contemporaries, Mani Ratnam did not assist <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> film-making {{prior to}} {{entering}} the industry. He is credited with revolutionizing the Tamil film industry and is referred for bringing new dimension to the South Asian cinema. A majority of his films are characterized by a string of socio-political themes. Because of his idea of combining art and commercial elements, most of his films garnered both critical acclaim and commercial success. Nayagan, Bombay and Iruvar were inspired from real-life incidents, while Thalapathi and Raavan were based on Indian epics.|$|E
5|$|The Survivor Series in November 2003 also {{marked the}} first time Lesnar met Goldberg from the Raw brand. After Lesnar claimed in a {{backstage}} interview that he could beat <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> the world, Goldberg interrupted the interview and introduced himself to Lesnar, shaking hands with him before leaving with a staredown. Lesnar followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly. In the storyline, Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for legitimately injuring his neck during a previous match between the two in 2002 which left Holly in need of neck surgery and out of action for a year. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004, Lesnar defeated Holly to retain the WWE Championship. Later in the Royal Rumble match, Lesnar attacked Goldberg and attacked him with an F-5, enabling Kurt Angle to eliminate him.|$|E

25|$|Samasyā (Hindi: समस्या, meaning Difficulty): This canto, a soliloquy by Aṣṭāvakra in his mother's womb, {{deals with}} the notion of Samasyā or a difficulty. The canto is replete with pathos (Karuṇa Rasa), heroism (Vīra Rasa) and optimism. In the first 30 verses, various metaphors are painted for difficulty, which is {{universal}} and extremely powerful. Faith in God and determined action are the ways {{to get out of a}} difficulty, and Aṣṭāvakra is resolute that he will get out of his predicament too. In verses 61 to 82, the real nature of the Ātman (Self), without beginning and end, without birth and death, and beyond mortal difficulties is presented, according to the poet's philosophy of Viśiṣṭādvaita. Aṣṭāvakra then tells Kahola about his (Kahola's) imminent repentance, and that he is determined intent to live the life of a disabled. He requests his father not to curse <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> future, and the canto ends with optimistic prophesies by Aṣṭāvakra that the curse of his father is a blessing in disguise for the disabled of the world, as Aṣṭāvakra will be their role model.|$|E

According to Sheriff J. Austin Daniel, an autopsy showed Gore was beaten to death as well as shot in the face.

500|$|Doc Kuhn is {{possibly}} the greatest ball {{player on the}} squad, due to his miraculous fielding around short this season. Starting with the opening college games he went for six straight games without an error, finally putting Tot McCullough off the bag with a wide heave that broke the run. The Michigan and Ohio coaches were loud in their praises for Kuhn {{as one of the}} greatest fielding shortstops they had seen in some time. His hitting this season has been hard and timely, including a homer, four triples, and three doubles. He hits in streaks, however, and this alone will keep the phenomenal Vandy star out of a major berth in the near future. Kuhn, Embry and McCullough stand out head and shoulders above <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> their respective lines that has visited here in recent years.|$|E
500|$|Bure's playing style {{reflected}} the speed, skill and puck possession that was prominent in Soviet Union hockey programs. The most prevalent {{aspects of his}} game were his skating speed, agility, and acceleration, which earned him his nickname the [...] "Russian Rocket". He {{was able to use}} his quickness to separate himself from defenders, to retrieve pucks before the opposition could in all zones of the ice, and to skate the length of the ice on many occasions. In a 1993 poll of NHL coaches conducted by hockey writer Bob McKenzie, Bure was named the league's best skater with eight of twenty-one votes, twice as many votes as any other player. One coach noted: [...] "Bure has the best combination of speed, agility and balance ... He can also use change of speed better than <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> the league right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{was fascinated}} by the Zeus debate, {{especially}} the way that scientists were lined up on diametrically opposed positions for or against the system. He commented to Wiesner, [...] "I don’t understand. Scientists are supposed to be rational people. How can there be such differences on a technical issue?" [...] His fascination grew and he eventually compiled a mass of material on Zeus which took up one corner of a room where he spent hundreds of hours becoming an expert on the topic. In one meeting with Edward Teller, Kennedy demonstrated that he knew more about the Zeus and ABMs than Teller. Teller then expended considerable effort to bring himself up to the same level of knowledge. Wiesner would later note that the pressure to make a decision built up until [...] "Kennedy came to feel that the only thing <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> the country was concerned about was Nike-Zeus." ...|$|E

500|$|Rangel {{endorsed}} Koch {{for re-election}} in 1981, but by 1983 his relations with the mayor had broken down: [...] "I don't know <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> politics that I dislike enough that I would recommend that he {{sit down with the}} mayor." [...] By 1984, Rangel was the most influential black politician in New York State. [...] His position on Ways and Means allowed him to bring federal monies to the state and city for transit projects, industrial development, Medicare needs, low-income housing, and shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel was one of the city's most recognizable politicians, and there was speculation that he would run for mayor in 1985, but Rangel preferred to remain in the House, with the goal of eventually becoming Ways and Means chairman and in the best possible case even House Speaker. [...] Indeed, Rangel never showed any interest in a different political job other than being the Congressman from Harlem.|$|E

500|$|In 1896, Taft became {{dean and}} Professor of Property at his alma mater, the Cincinnati Law School, a post that {{required}} him to prepare and give two hour-long lectures each week. He was devoted to his law school, and was deeply committed to legal education, introducing the case system to the curriculum. [...] As a federal judge, Taft could not involve himself with politics, but followed it closely, remaining a Republican supporter. He watched with some disbelief as the campaign of Ohio Governor William McKinley developed in 1894 and 1895, writing [...] "I cannot find <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> Washington who wants him". By March 1896, Taft realized that McKinley would likely be nominated, and was lukewarm in his support. He landed solidly in McKinley's camp after former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan in July stampeded the 1896 Democratic National Convention with his Cross of Gold speech. Bryan, both in that address and in his campaign, strongly advocated free silver, a policy that Taft saw as economic radicalism. Taft feared that people would hoard gold {{in anticipation of a}} Bryan victory, but he could do nothing but worry. McKinley was elected; when a place on the Supreme Court opened in 1898, the only one under McKinley, the president named Joseph McKenna.|$|E

I don't know <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> the world working in film, and that's what we work in here even though it appears on television, who has the voice Darin has. He is one in many million."

You know, when people talk about The Twilight Zone, they say 'Remember [...] "Eye of the Beholder"?' Or [...] "Trouble With Tribbles" [...] on the original [...] 'Jose Chung' is going to be one of those episodes that is immediately revered." [...] Assistant director Tom Braidwood appreciated Charles Nelson Reilly's presence, saying that he captivated virtually everyone and gave everyone a lift, nicknaming everyone on the crew.

500|$|While {{the designs}} of Homer's new art friends were not based on <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> particular, the [...] "German guy" [...] was drawn to hold his {{cigarette}} in a [...] "European way" [...] by animation director Jim Reardon. When visiting the Springfield museum, Homer and Marge see a painting showing Akbar and Jeff, two characters from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's comic strip Life in Hell. The painting's frame was also signed by Groening himself in real life. The painting next to Groening's was drawn by Scully's friend Tom Gagnon, who is an artist. Some of the paintings in the episode's second act were also drawn by friends of Dean Moore. At one point in Homer's dream, the Vitruvian Man appears and attacks him. According to Groening, there were [...] "some controversy" [...] {{over whether or not}} the Vitruvian Man would be in nude or not, as he is in the original painting. In the episode, he is wearing a jockstrap. At the end of the episode, Springfield is flooded with water, and Marge is seen painting a picture on the Simpsons' roof. Her painting was drawn by staff animator Amy Clese, who drew it as a recreation of a painting by J. M. W. Turner, an English Romantic painter. According to Dean Moore, the painting was [...] "pretty difficult" [...] to animate, as it was drawn with a lot of washes and gradients.
