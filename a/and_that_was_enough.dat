25|$|September {{began with}} an {{impressive}} pitching duel between Clayton Kershaw and Roy Oswalt. Kershaw struck out 11 batters but allowed two solo home runs <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> to do him in. Oswalt took a no-hitter into the sixth inning as the Phillies closed out the series with a 5–1 victory. The rival San Francisco Giants came to Dodger Stadium for the next series. Chad Billingsley welcomed them to town by throwing a two-hitter for eight innings and hitting a two-run single for the decisive runs in the Dodgers 4–2 victory. In the second game, Ted Lilly pitched a one-hitter through six innings and Jay Gibbons hit a three-run homer to stake the Dodgers to a 4–0 lead. However, the bullpen imploded again and Jonathan Broxton blew his sixth save of the season when Juan Uribe hit a two-run homer off him for a 5–4 Giants win.|$|E
500|$|Alex Rees from Cosmopolitan {{felt that}} the video {{contained}} [...] "uncomfortable footage", but added that the [...] "emotionally unsettling" [...] images were able {{to reflect on the}} actual reality of what happens on college campuses. Claire Hodgson from the same publication described the clip as a [...] "beautifully shot, brilliantly acted short film", which [...] "really does not hold back when it comes to portraying the real horror of sexual assault in the most graphic way possible". Emily Shire from The Daily Beast was positive about the clip, calling it: [...] "both chilling and beautiful. The overall effect is as much, if not more, a credit to acclaimed director Catherine Hardwicke. The brutality of these snapshot scenes are remarkably moving in the scariest and most sickening way possible". However, Shire was disappointed with one aspect of the PSA – that the victims are supported by their friends and close-ones <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> to cope through the trauma. Instead Shire wanted to see the legal ramifications of such traumatic incidents, with the victims going to the police. Shire concluded the review saying: [...] "Gaga and Hardwicke deserve props for creating such a powerful, visceral, and aesthetically striking PSA. They've brought a tremendous amount of attention to rape and sexual assault. Yet, attention alone is inadequate balm for the victims of rape." [...] Conversely, Dan Solomon of Fast Company believed the video to be an [...] "important statement" [...] from Gaga and believed that it would direct further attention to The Hunting Ground.|$|E
2500|$|Cetshwayo {{was unable}} to comply with Frere's {{ultimatum}} – {{even if he had}} wanted to; Frere ordered Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand, and so the Anglo-Zulu War began. On 11 January 1879, British troops crossed the Tugela River; fourteen days later the disaster of Isandlwana was reported, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for the House of Commons to demand that Frere be recalled. Beaconsfield supported him, however, and in a strange compromise he was censured but asked to stay on. Frere had severely underestimated the Zulus, whom he had characterized as [...] "a bunch of savages armed with sticks." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1886, Pratt's wife Sarah Pratt {{claimed in}} an {{interview}} that, while in Nauvoo, Illinois, Joseph Smith was attracted to her and intended to make her [...] "one of his spiritual wives" [...] while Pratt was in England on missionary service. To Smith's proposal, Sarah replied, [...] "Am I called upon to break the marriage covenant ... to my lawful husband! I never will. I care not for the blessings of Jacob, and I believe in NO SUCH revelations, neither will I consent under any circumstances. I have one good husband, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> for me." [...] She issued an ultimatum to Smith: [...] "Joseph, if you ever attempt any thing of the kind with me again, I will tell Mr. Pratt on his return home.

2500|$|Thus the {{characteristic}} property of space, that of having three dimensions, {{is only a}} property of our distribution board, a property residing, so to speak, in the human intelligence.
