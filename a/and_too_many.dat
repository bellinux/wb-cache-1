Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so.

5|$|The Serre {{spectral}} sequence {{was used}} by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously. He used the fact that taking the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the homotopy groups down by 1, so the nth homotopy group of a space X is the first homotopy group of its (n−1)-fold repeated loop space, which {{is equal to the}} first homology group of the (n−1)-fold loop space by the Hurewicz theorem. This reduces the calculation of homotopy groups of X to the calculation of homology groups of its repeated loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence relates the homology of a space to that of its loop space, so can sometimes be used to calculate the homology of loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence tends to have many non-zero differentials, which are hard to control, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> ambiguities appear for higher homotopy groups. Consequently, it has been superseded by more powerful spectral sequences with fewer non-zero differentials, which give more information.|$|E

The party was so disorganized that it was led for seven years (and through two provincial elections) by an interim leader, W.E.N.

25|$|In general The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a {{considerable}} achievement for a first-off author. The country-house-party murder is a stereotype in the detective-story genre, which Christie makes no great use of. Not her sort of occasion, at least later in life, and perhaps not really her class. The family party is much more in her line, {{and this is what}} we have here. This is one of the few Christies anchored in time and space: we are in Essex, during the First World War. The family is kept together under one roof by the exigencies of war and of a matriarch demanding rather than tyrannical – not one of her later splendid monsters, but a sympathetic and lightly shaded characterisation. If the lifestyle of the family still seems to us lavish, even wasteful, nevertheless we have the half sense that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the Edwardian summer, that the era of country-house living has entered its final phase. Christie takes advantage of this end-of-an-era feeling in several ways: while she uses the full range of servants and their testimony, a sense of decline, of break-up is evident; feudal attitudes exist, but they crack easily. The marriage of the matriarch with a mysterious nobody is the central out-of-joint event in an intricate web of subtle changes. The family is lightly but effectively characterised, and on the outskirts of the story are the villagers, the small businessmen, and the surrounding farmers – the nucleus of Mayhem Parva. It is, too, a very clever story, with clues and red herrings falling thick and fast. We are entering the age when plans of the house were an indispensable aid to the aspirant solver of detective stories, and when cleverness was more important than suspense. But here we come to a problem that Agatha Christie has not yet solved, for cleverness over the long length easily becomes exhausting, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> clues tend to cancel each other out, as far as reader interest is concerned. These were problems which Conan Doyle never satisfactorily overcame, but which Christie would.".|$|E

McDonnell noted that Rod Serling's [...] "El Moe" [...] was least {{like a typical}} Twilight Zone story, and that Williams's [...] "Ants" [...] belonged to the Alfred Hitchcock Presents {{universe}} rather than The Twilight Zone. On Ain't It Cool News, Adam Balm identified [...] Wu's [...] "On the Road" [...] as [...] "the best entry in the collection".

500|$|Richard Keller of TV Squad gave [...] "Stewie Kills Lois" [...] a {{much more}} {{negative}} review.

He stated that he did not find the episode funny, but rather disjointed, with little story <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> cutaway gags and flashbacks. In his review of [...] "Lois Kills Stewie", Keller gave {{a much more}} positive review. He did mention {{that the end of the}} episode was somewhat predictable, as they had killed Cleveland and Stewie. He commented positively to some of the jokes of the episode, and in the overall he mentioned he liked the two episodes, but he was not so keen of the ending of the episode.|$|E
500|$|TriStar Pictures {{wanted to}} produce another film {{starring}} Wilder and Pryor, and Wilder {{agreed to do}} See No Evil, Hear No Evil only if he were allowed to rewrite the script. The studio agreed, and See No Evil, Hear No Evil premiered on May 1989 to mostly negative reviews. Many critics praised Wilder and Pryor, as well as Kevin Spacey's performance, but they mostly agreed that the script was terrible. Roger Ebert called it [...] "a real dud"; the Deseret Morning News described the film as [...] "stupid", with an [...] "idiotic script" [...] that had a [...] "contrived story" [...] <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> [...] "juvenile gags", while Vincent Canby called it [...] "by far the most successful co-starring vehicle for Mr. Pryor and Mr. Wilder", also acknowledging that [...] "this is not elegant movie making, {{and not all of}} the gags are equally clever".|$|E

500|$|The {{graphics}} received mixed reviews. Lewis {{called them}} [...] "more {{interesting than the}} first game, but marginally so", and Meuller called them [...] "dated", with environments seeming [...] "bland and drab, and the enemies [...] generic". The GameTrailers reviewer praised the character animations, but cited the environments as bland and felt that there were too few FMVs <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> game engine-driven cutscenes, which he described as [...] "awful". Parkin criticized the game's graphic capacities, commenting that players would [...] "stop watching the main screen instead fixing upon the little map in the corner to guide your character towards hostile red dots that only materialize polygonal just seconds before you lock swords.", while Jarvis said {{that it had not}} improved from the previous game and called the colors [...] "very murky, drab and dark". 1UP said that the graphics [...] " [...] hold up to the visual quality of Cavia's other titles like [...] ".|$|E
500|$|James Caldwell, {{also of the}} Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, {{reviewed}} the show. He felt differently from both Keller and Kapur, as he stated that Bound for Glory overall was a [...] "bad PPV."

[...] He called the NWA World Tag Team Championship match [...] "ridiculous" [...] and the TNA X Division Champion number-one contender the [...] "worst Ultimate X match in TNA history."

500|$|Ain't Life Grand was {{released}} on October 20, 2000 through Koch with [...] "Mean Bone" [...] released as the first single. The album did not sell {{as well as its}} predecessor, and critical reception to it was mixed. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Tony Scherman stated that [...] "Slash's playing is as flashily incendiary as ever, but the songs and arrangements recycle hard-rock cliches worthier of Ratt than of a bona fide guitar god". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted that [...] "great guitarists need great bands, and the Snakepit dudes are barely functional backup peons". Steve Huey of Allmusic noted that [...] "the new Snakepit does kick up a lot of noise as the album rushes by, and the strong chemistry between the members is immediately obvious". However, he stated that songwriting was the main problem, and that [...] "it never rises above the level of solid, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> tracks are by-the-numbers hard rock at best (and pedestrian at worst)". The band were dropped by Koch two months following the album's release.|$|E

500|$|At first, the {{producers}} {{were looking for}} a [...] "quintessentially American person" [...] {{to play the role of}} House. Bryan Singer in particular felt there was no way he was going to hire a non-American actor for the role. At the time of the casting session, actor Hugh Laurie was in Namibia filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix. He assembled an audition tape in a hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light, and apologized for its appearance (which Singer compared to a [...] "bin Laden video"). Laurie improvised, using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was very impressed by his performance and commented on how well the [...] "American actor" [...] was able to grasp the character. Singer was not aware that Laurie was English, due to his convincing American accent. Laurie credits the accent to [...] "a misspent youth [...] too much TV <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> movies". Although locally better-known actors such as Denis Leary, David Cross, Rob Morrow, and Patrick Dempsey were considered for the part, Shore, Jacobs, and Attanasio were as impressed as Singer and cast Laurie as House.|$|E
500|$|The {{third season}} was {{nominated}} for five Teen Choice Awards and won four of them, including [...] "Choice Drama/Action Adventure Show" [...] and [...] "Choice Actor: Drama/Action Adventure", which Adam Brody won {{for the third consecutive}} year. IGN faulted a season which, in their opinion, had [...] "far too much time <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> episodes spent with the less than beloved character Johnny". IGN also noted that [...] "Kirsten and Sandy both suffered from unsatisfying stories", and that the departure of character Caleb Nichol had been a mistake [...] "as he had been a great character to bounce off both of the elder Cohens". In September 2007, Schwartz admitted in an interview for New York that the show [...] "went down the wrong road" [...] with Johnny. The season did, however, receive some praise. The new character Taylor Townsend was stated as being [...] "played to perfection by Autumn Reeser" [...] and her character was described as [...] "one of the greatest elements of The O.C." [...] Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk described the storylines as [...] "very intelligent and also incorporate a great deal of humor to keep your interest".|$|E
500|$|Reviews for the Xbox 360 {{version of}} Crash: Mind over Mutant were mixed. Christopher Ewen of GameZone praised the series' {{transition}} into a free-roaming gameplay environment, but {{felt that the}} game was too easy. Matt Casamassina of IGN found the game to be [...] "exactly like its predecessor: a mildly enjoyable beat 'em up romp that's sure to satisfy younger players, but won't provide much that seasoned players haven't already experienced before". Andy Eddy of TeamXbox praised the game's strong voice acting, but noted the uninspired gameplay, which was [...] "not very consistent in its fun generation." [...] Justin Calvert of GameSpot claimed that the game [...] "has too much backtracking <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> camera problems to make it recommendable". Official Xbox Magazine concluded that [...] "there's very little about Mind over Mutant that makes it worth your $50 or the four hours it takes to complete." [...] Dan Pearson of Eurogamer criticized the game's fixed camera, extensive backtracking, useless mission log and dated concepts. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer proclaimed that the game's [...] "unpredictable framerates, extensive backtracking, and the guarantee of one death caused by faulty camera positioning for every platforming segment" [...] made it [...] "a mess of a game, and a new low point for the once-loved marsupial." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Calusari" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews, with critics citing {{inconsistencies in}} the plot as the main detractions. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a [...] "B–" [...] rating, calling it [...] "an Exorcist/Omen rip-off, but a classy one". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave it a [...] "C+", writing that it was [...] "an episode {{with a lot of}} great and spooky moments", but [...] "a messy, chaotic story that could have been much better developed, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> things that happen [...] just because the writers thought it would be cool if they happened". However, while he was [...] "not sure everything hangs together" [...] and he wished for more backstory, VanDerWerff did praise some [...] "really great moments", particularly the opening teaser. John Keegan from Critical Myth, while calling the episode [...] "a mixed bag", awarded it a 7 out of 10. He praised the entry's [...] "fascinating implications [...] the mythology hidden within the events depicted", and noted that it was [...] "well directed and acted". Despite this, he was more critical of the episode's plot and wrote that there were [...] "clear logical flaws [...] and the subject matter can be disturbing. This is an episode that falls heavily to subjective interpretation." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a largely negative review and rated it one-and-a-half stars out of five. The two called it a [...] "pale retread of The Exorcist" [...] and noted that many of the episode's elements, like the chicken-sacrificing grandmother and the Calusari members, were [...] "tremendously crass". Shearman and Pearson, however, did enjoy the episode's dialogue, praising one scene in particular where the spirit of Michael torments his mother by asking to be taken to the amusement park and ride the train that killed his younger brother. Regardless, however, the duo concluded that [...] "there's something stale and pointless at [...] heart." [...] The plot for [...] "The Calusari" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Garth Nix.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times said, [...] " [...] overstuffed with plot lines, set {{pieces and}} villains, {{although}} stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone {{do their best}} to give the movie heart." [...] Tim Robey of The Telegraph said, [...] "Marc Webb's Spider-Man sequel is overstuffed with high-voltage villains, but the sparks between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone save the day". Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy said, [...] "Peter's past, present and future all intertwine in a sequel that offers bang for your buck. That said you can't help [...] feel the franchise bean counters at work here thanks to all the ominous foreshadowing and unresolved character arcs. Too many cooks and all that...". Kim Newman of Empire scored the film three out of five stars, saying: [...] "A few too-broad gags aside — and even these are in the funky spirit of '60s Marvel — this is a satisfying second issue with thrills, heartbreak, gasps, and a perfectly judged slingshot ending." [...] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "The eponymous hero hits his super-heroic stride here, as does Andrew Garfield in the role, especially when Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker learns there's always some fine print in a contract with this many benefits. The plot gets itself tangled up in multiple villain strands, but in the main, this installment is emotionally weightier and more satisfying than its predecessor." [...] Guy Lodge of Variety said, [...] "Redundancy remains a problem, but this overlong superhero sequel gets by on sound, fury and star chemistry." [...] Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, stating that [...] "It's about 20 minutes too long and it's overstuffed with too many characters <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> subplots, but there's enough good stuff in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to warrant optimism about the next chapter of the franchise." [...] A negative review came from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, giving the film two stars out of four, he said: [...] "Things go wrong quickly with Amazing 2. Am I the only one who hates the word Amazing to describe a movie that isn't? Just asking." [...] IGN reviewer Daniel Krupa gave 6.9/10 and wrote, [...] "Amazing Spider-Man 2 gets a lot right, yet there’s a constant awkwardness to the machinery of its plot; you can almost hear the cogs turning. However, what’s worse is that at times it becomes overtly patronising: there are flashing screens and computer voice-overs constantly telling you what something is or what something is doing, just in case the people in the back rows aren’t paying attention, which feels at odds with the film’s emotional intelligence.|$|E
500|$|The Telegraph {{granted the}} film a maximum score of five stars, stating {{that it is}} [...] "a superhero film without a superhero," [...] {{comparing}} it with The Godfather Part II and praising Hardy's performance {{as well as the}} film's intricate plot and narrative.

[...] The Playlists Todd Gilchrist wrote [...] "A cinematic, cultural and personal triumph, The Dark Knight Rises is emotionally inspiring, aesthetically significant and critically important for America itself – as a mirror of both sober reflection and resilient hope." [...] IGN gave it a 9 out of 10, noting similarities in tone and theme to Batman Begins over the trilogy's second installment The Dark Knight, but also describing Bane as [...] "that bit less interesting to watch" [...] than Ledger's Joker, despite praising his [...] "menacing voice" [...] and [...] "body language-driven performance". The Guardian scored the film four out of five stars, calling it a film of [...] "granite, monolithic intensity", yet also calling it a [...] "hammy, portentous affair". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon writes [...] "if The Dark Knight Rises is a fascist film, it's a great fascist film, and arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, stating [...] "the film begins slowly with a murky plot <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> new characters, but builds to a sensational climax." [...] Film critic Richard Roeper gave the film an [...] "A", calling it [...] "a majestic, gorgeous, brutal and richly satisfying epic", and citing the final scenes of the picture as [...] "the best five minutes of any film this year." [...] The London Film Review gave the film a B and said [...] "Nolan's film is a reminder that superheroes aren't merely a frivolous distraction, but an embodiment of our best selves." [...] The film was crowned by Forbes as the best modern comic book superhero adaption on screen, outranking both its main summer blockbuster competitor, Marvel's The Avengers, and the trilogy's previous installment The Dark Knight.
