2500|$|Almost {{two and a}} {{half years}} after the incident, the RCMP issued an apology to Dziekański's mother, Zofia Cisowski.

2500|$|Meanwhile, when Breitwieser's {{mother had}} heard of her son's arrest from Kleinklauss, who {{had been able to}} evade authorities, she {{proceeded}} to destroy many of the works by cutting or carving them up, leaving the remains of the frames in the trash {{over a period of several}} weeks and forcing the shredded paintings down her garbage disposal unit. Other artifacts, such as vases, jewelry, pottery, and statuettes, were simply thrown into the nearby Rhone-Rhine Canal, where some were later recovered through dredging. She claimed that she destroyed the paintings out of anger <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>son,</b> but police believe it was to destroy incriminating evidence against him. [...] She apparently had no inkling of the large monetary value of the works she destroyed. [...] Police found nothing besides the cord of the stolen antique bugle when they first searched her home, and she took seven months to admit to destroying the artwork, after some pieces had washed up on the shore of the Rhine. [...] A Swiss police officer said, [...] "ever have so many old masters been destroyed at the same time." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{painting}} {{depicts the}} birth of Marie de' Medici's first son, Louis XIII. Rubens designed the scene around the theme of political peace. The birth of the first male heir brings {{a sense of security}} to the royal family that they will continue to rule. In those times an heir was of the utmost importance, especially if Henry wanted to showcase his masculinity and discontinue with the pattern of the royal reproductive failure. The word dauphin is French for dolphin, a term associated with princely royalty. Henry's promiscuity made difficult the production of a legitimate heir, and rumors circulated to the extent that Henry's court artists began to employ strategies to convince the country otherwise. One of these strategies was to personify Marie as Juno or Minerva. By representing Marie as Juno, implying Henry as Jupiter, the king is seen domesticated by marriage. The queen's personification as Minerva would facilitate Henry's military prowess and her own. As a Flemish painter Rubens includes a dog in the painting, alluding to fidelity in marriage. In addition to the idea of political peace Rubens also includes the personification of Justice, Astraea. The return of Astraea to earth is symbolic of the embodiment of continuing Justice with {{the birth of}} the future king. Louis is nursed by Themis, the goddess of divine order, referring to Louis XIII birthright to one day become king. The baby is quite close to a serpent, which is a representation of Health. [...] Rubens incorporates the traditional allegory of the cornucopia, which symbolizes abundance, to enhance the meaning of the painting by including the heads of Marie de' Medici's children who have yet to be born among the fruit. While Marie gazes adoringly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>son,</b> Fecundity presses the cornucopia to her arm, representing the complete and bountiful family to come.|$|E
