50|$|The band rehearsed and {{warmed up}} for the tour in Dublin in August 1991. Joined onstage by guitarist Eric Schermerhorn, <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> {{presented}} songs from the <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> album and the <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> II album, augmented with cover versions of songs from the Pixies, Neil Young and The Moody Blues.|$|R

5000|$|A live version {{recorded}} {{during the}} 1991 <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> tour {{was released on}} the live album <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> Live: Oy Vey, Baby in 1992.|$|R
50|$|Albums with no {{appearance}} {{included the}} cover album Pin Ups (1973), Never Let Me Down (1987), the albums produced {{with the band}} <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> (<b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> (1989) and <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> II (1991)), and Black Tie White Noise (1993). Aladdin Sane (1973) also made no concert appearance in the video, although songs from the album appeared on the tour.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> {{performed}} at the theatre during their It's My Life Tour on December 12, 1991, which was recorded and became part of their live album, <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> Live: Oy Vey, Baby.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> Tour of David Bowie's band <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> {{commenced}} on 14 June 1989, {{following a}} performance of [...] "Heaven's in Here" [...] at the International Music Awards in New York City on 31 May 1989. The tour comprised 12 performances in six countries (USA, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, France, United Kingdom) in venues with a capacity of 2,000 or less. Joined onstage by Kevin Armstrong, <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> performed the entirety of their <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> album {{with the exception of}} [...] "Video Crime," [...] augmented with cover version of songs from Bob Dylan and Johnny Kidd & The Pirates.|$|R
5000|$|Sales joined David Bowie, Reeves Gabrels and Hunt Sales in <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> in 1988. The New York Times {{said of the}} band's first album, [...] "Tin Machine {{sounds as}} if it was made by people working together, not by a {{producer}} with a computer." [...] On November 23, 1991, <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> appeared on Saturday Night Live, which was hosted by then child actor Macaulay Culkin. <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> recorded three albums and did two tours before it broke up in 1992. Bowie later stated that his memories of Tony and Hunt Sales' contribution to Lust for Life led him to invite them to join <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "One Shot" [...] is {{the second}} track from the album <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> II by <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine.</b> It was {{released}} as the third single from the album, making it their seventh single overall. It is the last single released by the band.|$|R
5000|$|Like a few Bowie {{songs from}} the 1990s, this piece was {{originally}} a song written to be played by Bowie's hard rock band, <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> to perform live; it was never released on a <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> album. His choice to disband the group {{to return to a}} solo career gave him more creative control over his own pieces, and the differences between <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine's</b> version of [...] "You've Been Around" [...] and Bowie's version show a distinct stylistic change and preference. The piece was made more danceworthy, relying more upon the drums and rhythm section than the guitar-based arrangement of the <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> era. Bowie has stated that he personally enjoyed taking Reeves Gabrels' guitar-playing and mixing it deeply into the background instead of having it at the forefront.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> Live: Oy Vey, Baby is a live album by <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> {{originally}} {{released by}} London Records in 1992. It {{was to be}} the group's last release, and was recorded on the 1991-1992 It's My Life Tour. The title, suggested by Hunt Sales, was intended as a play on U2's album Achtung Baby.|$|R

50|$|After {{finishing}} the album, Bowie said {{he planned to}} take some time off to spend with his wife as well as go back into the studio with <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> for a third album in 1993, but the <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> project failed to come together and Bowie's next effort was to be his solo soundtrack, The Buddha of Suburbia.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> Live: Oy Vey, Baby - 27 July 1992 (Did not chart) ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>Machine's</b> {{first world}} tour was a {{commercial}} success, {{but there was}} growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.|$|R
50|$|The only {{exception}} from his latest albums is Hours (1999); no tracks from this album were included on this release, possibly due to poor {{reception of the}} album, and no songs from the album were included in his touring repertoire. Other albums with no appearance included the cover album Pin Ups (1973), Never Let Me Down (1987), the albums produced with the band <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> (<b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> (1989) and <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> II (1991)), and Black Tie White Noise (1993). Aladdin Sane (1973) & Station to Station (1976) also made no concert appearances in the video, although songs from both albums were performed on the tour.|$|R

50|$|The Police {{recorded}} {{the first half}} of their Live! album, on November 27, 1979. U2's performance in 1983 was recorded and broadcast on The King Biscuit Flower Hour. In 1984, Aerosmith was united since Joe Perry and Brad Whitford left the band. <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> recorded a portion of their live album, entitled <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> Live: Oy Vey, Baby, here on November 20, 1991.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1990, {{a decade}} after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were {{introduced}} by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, [...] "I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate." [...] They married in 1992. <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second. <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> IIs arrival was marked by a widely publicised and ill-timed conflict over the cover art: after production had begun, the new record label, Victory, deemed the depiction of four ancient nude Kouroi statues, judged by Bowie to be [...] "in exquisite taste", [...] "a show of wrong, obscene images", requiring air-brushing and patching to render the figures sexless. <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> toured again, but after the live album <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> Live: Oy Vey, Baby failed commercially, the band drifted apart, and Bowie, though he continued to collaborate with Gabrels, resumed his solo career.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of release, <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> met with some success, winning {{generally}} positive reviews and reaching No. 3 in the UK Albums Chart. However, short-term sales of the album were not good, with the album estimated to have sold only around 200,000 copies by 1991 (although {{by the end of}} 2012 the entire catalogue of <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> albums had sold an estimated 2 million copies).|$|R
5000|$|... "Prisoner of Love" [...] {{is a song}} by <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> {{taken from}} their eponymous debut album. It was issued as their third single in October 1989. Bowie claimed {{at the time he}} wrote the song for his then-partner Melissa Hurley. It reads as worldly advice from the singer, warning the subject off drugs among other things - Bowie's social {{conscience}} is a recurring theme of <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> is {{the debut}} album by Anglo-American hard rock band <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine.</b> It was {{originally}} released in May 1989, {{on the label}} EMI. The band was the latest venture of David Bowie, inspired by sessions with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. Drummer Hunt Sales and bassist Tony Fox Sales formed {{the rest of the}} band, with [...] "fifth member" [...] Kevin Armstrong providing rhythm guitar and Hammond organ.|$|R

50|$|The tinning set {{consists}} {{of at least}} one pot of molten tin, with a zinc chloride flux on top, and a grease pot. The flux dries the plate and prepares it for the tin to adhere. If a second tin pot is used, called the wash pot, it contains tin at a lower temperature. This is followed by the grease pot, which contains oil and a <b>tinning</b> <b>machine.</b> The <b>tinning</b> <b>machine</b> has two small rollers that are spring-loaded together so that when the tinned plate is inserted the rolls squeeze any excess tin off. The springs on the <b>tinning</b> <b>machine</b> can be set to different forces to give different thicknesses of tin. Finally, the oil is cleaned off with fine bran and dusted clean.|$|R

5000|$|The Hamburg Docks {{performance}} on 24 October 1991, was filmed and later released on the video, Oy Vey, Baby: <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> Live at the Docks, {{with the song}} [...] "Baby Can Dance" [...] from the same performance appearing on the compilation album Best of Grunge Rock.

5000|$|The band, despite earning {{mixed reviews}} during its existence, has, in later years, been found [...] "unjustly" [...] harshly reviewed. One critic {{suggested}} {{that part of}} the reason for its poor reception was that <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine's</b> music was somewhat ahead of its time, and that the band [...] "explored alternative and grunge before the styles were even widely known to exist." [...] Another critic agreed, with yet another suggesting that <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine</b> and Bowie were [...] "merely ahead of the curve. A prophet, a voice in the desert predicting the coming of Nirvana. At the time, Nirvana was toiling in Seattle obscurity, pushing its debut Bleach on Sub Pop at every dive it played." [...] Tim Palmer, after producing <b>Tin</b> <b>Machine's</b> two studio albums, would go on to mix Pearl Jam's grunge album Ten in 1991.|$|R
