25|$|The entire {{volume of}} the Zambezi River pours through the First Gorge's 110-metre-wide (360ft) exit for a {{distance}} of about 150 metres (500ft), then enters a zigzagging series of gorges designated by the order in which the river reaches them. Water entering the Second Gorge makes a sharp right turn and has carved out a deep pool there called the Boiling Pot. Reached via a steep footpath from the Zambian side, it is about 150 metres (500ft) across. Its surface is smooth at low water, but at high water is marked by enormous, slow swirls and heavy boiling turbulence. Objects– and humans– that are swept over the falls, including the occasional hippopotamus or crocodile, are frequently found swirling <b>about</b> <b>here</b> or washed up at the north-east end of the Second Gorge. This is where the bodies of Mrs Moss and Mr Orchard, mutilated by crocodiles, were found in 1910 after two canoes were capsized by a hippo at Long Island above the falls.|$|E
500|$|In 1828 Morrell {{was engaged}} by Messrs. Christian Bergh & Co. to take {{command of the}} {{schooner}} Antarctic (named, he claims, in honour of his earlier Antarctic achievements). Antarctic left New York on June 25, 1828, bound for Western Africa. During the following months Morrell carried out an extensive survey of the African coast between the Cape of Good Hope and Benguela, and led several short excursions inland. He {{was impressed by the}} commercial potential of this coast, recording that [...] "many kinds of skins may be procured <b>about</b> <b>here,</b> including those of the leopard, fox, bullock, together with ostrich feathers and valuable minerals". At Ichaboe Island he discovered huge deposits of guano, 25 feet thick. In the face of such opportunity he records his belief that a $30,000 investment would produce in two years a profit [...] "from ten to fifteen hundred per cent." ...|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker {{called the}} episode [...] "at once cool-looking, heart-tugging, and pretty simple", {{especially}} {{when compared to}} previous episodes like [...] "White Tulip". Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, explaining [...] "I can't really find anything to complain <b>about</b> <b>here.</b> The direction was effectively moody and snappy, the performances were sharp, and the case was cool." [...] Murray praised the subtle characteristics of the parallel universe, the action scenes, {{and the use of}} split-screens to visually show Milo's predictions. MTV's Josh Wigler believed that the episode [...] "demonstrated how the mystery-of-the-week format can still be compelling: by taking everything familiar and applying a stark new layer of paint." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "The third season of Fringe continues to get better with each episode. Most importantly, it has momentum. It's moving forward with a distinct destination, and even though I know Fringe is heading somewhere, I have no idea where that might be, or what's going to happen when we get there. Boy, if you're not watching Fringe, you're missing out." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think <b>about</b> <b>here?</b> Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E

2500|$|The 'requirement' talked <b>about</b> <b>here</b> – [...] "to {{display a}} {{distinguishing}} registration sign" [...] – is derived directly from Article 37 of the 1968 Vienna Convention (this is actually stated in preamble (3) of Reg 2411/98). So {{in order for}} Regulation 2411/98 to apply, the state must have ratified the 1968 Convention.

2500|$|The news website AsiaNews quoted Yahia Said, an Iraqi {{scholar at}} the London School of Economics, as saying: [...] "The {{reception}} [...] was surprisingly low-key in Iraq. Part of the reason was that rumors and tall stories, as well as true stories, about abuse, mass rape, and torture in the jails and in coalition custody have been going round for a long time. So compared to what people have been talking <b>about</b> <b>here</b> the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: why did they come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there's some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point." [...] CNN reporter Ben Wedeman reported that Iraqi reaction to George W. Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was [...] "mixed": [...] "Some people react positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem {{and that he has}} said that those involved in the abuse will be punished. On the other hand, there are many others who says it simply isn't enough, that they – many people noted that there was not a frank apology from the president for this incident. And, in fact, I have a Baghdad newspaper with me right now from – it's called 'Dar-es-Salaam.' That's from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party. It says that an apology is not enough for the torture [...] of Iraqi prisoners." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine {{said that}} the saddest thing about 20 Y.O. was Jackson's {{decision}} to make a terrible R instead of great dance music, which would likely pay off. He also referred to Jam and Lewis's production as [...] "ice-cold beats [...] have melted into a lugubrious, lukewarm pudding—at under an hour, it still feels almost {{twice as long as}} Janet. and The Velvet Rope." [...] With a C+ rating, Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine called it [...] "half-decent" [...] and went to say, [...] "there's precious little to get, well, excited <b>about</b> <b>here.</b> Janet commits the ultimate sin of making an album that’s thoroughly mediocre. Apart from the sticky ear-candy of [...] "So Excited," [...] there’s little I’d miss here if I went six months without it. This doesn’t sound like rejuvenation—it sounds like the beginning of the end." [...] The Village Voices music critic Miles Marshall Lewis commented that Jackson's last two albums also talked excessively about sex, and with the new release, it was getting tired. Evan Serpick from Rolling Stone disagreed with the album's reference to Control, saying [...] "If we were her, we wouldn't make the comparison." [...] Angus Batey, writing for Yahoo! Music UK, remarked that in Jackson's producers desire to take Jackson back to her roots, they made not a great album for Jackson, but a facsimile of one; correct in all the details, but lacking substance and soul. Robert Christgau gave it a [...] "dud" [...] score (...) [...] Additionally, 20 Y.O. earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R Album in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S. {{reviews of}} Brothers in Arms were more positive. Writing for Spin magazine, E. Brooks noted that [...] "Mark Knopfler {{may be the}} most lyrical of all rock guitarists, and when the {{intensity}} of his words approaches that of his ravishing stratocaster licks, the song soars. That doesn't happen as often as I'd like on this new album by a band I've cared about for a long time, but I find myself returning to certain cuts the way one might come back to a favorite chair." [...] He singled out the [...] "haunting ballad" [...] "Your Latest Trick", the [...] "acerbic satire of vid-rock culture" [...] in [...] "Money for Nothing" [...] and the [...] "outstanding craftsmanship in the words and music" [...] of the title track, which was [...] "not a new message, but at least something other than sex, cars, or drugs is being talked <b>about</b> <b>here.</b> Take that {{and the quality of the}} musicianship, and you've got a lot." [...] Debby Bull gave the album a mixed review for Rolling Stone magazine, praising the [...] "carefully crafted" [...] effort, writing, [...] "The record is beautifully produced, with Mark Knopfler's terrific guitar work catching the best light". Although she found the lyrics literate, Bull noted that the scenarios [...] "aren't as interesting as they used to be on records like Making Movies". Despite the production values and notable contributions from guest artists like drummer Omar Hakim and the Brecker Brothers, Bull concluded that [...] "the music lacks the ache that made Knopfler's recent soundtracks for Comfort and Joy and Cal so powerful." [...] In Rolling Stones end-of-year round-up of 1985's key albums, Fred Schruers said that [...] "Knopfler's nimble, evocative guitar style and gentle vocalizing are still as appealing as the were on previous scenario-rich albums".|$|E
2500|$|IGN {{reviewed}} {{all four}} {{versions of the}} game. David Smith scored the PlayStation 2 version 9.4 out of 10, giving it an [...] "Editor's Award" [...] and calling the Dark Alliance engine [...] "one of the best 3D engines yet devised." [...] He dismissed criticisms of the game as a [...] "Diablo clone," [...] arguing the gameplay is much deeper than such a comparison suggests. His only criticisms were some anti-climatic boss fights and repetitive music. He concluded [...] "There is honestly {{not a great deal}} to complain <b>about</b> <b>here</b> [...] Snowblind has put together one of the best engines on PS2 {{and one of the best}} hacks in the business, certainly the best a console has ever seen." [...] Kaiser Hwang scored the Xbox version 8.5 out of 10. He praised the graphics, but wrote [...] "What hurts this game's score is the fact that it is almost exactly the same game that was released last year, not that that's a bad thing. The game is a fine example of exceptional game-making. But an extra level or character, or really any added extras would've been great." [...] Fran Mirabella III scored the GameCube version 7.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a downgrade from the PS2 version." [...] He criticized the [...] "bafflingly destroyed frame rate," [...] and commented [...] "When it was released on the PS2 a year ago, few could believe what Snowblind had pulled off on Sony's stubborn console. A year later, and quite magically, High Voltage couldn't get the engine running smoothly on GameCube." [...] Craig Harris scored the Game Boy Advance version 8 out of 10, arguing that [...] "Even though it's missing a few key elements from the original design it's based upon, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance works out very well in portable form." ...|$|E
