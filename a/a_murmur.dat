5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not <b>a</b> <b>murmur</b> or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E

25|$|We {{were near}} the {{entrance}} to a bar when a roar penetrated the alleyway under the stairs. It was a kind of reaction from a crowd I'd not heard before...The roar went on...and on. There was no following applause to greet a departing batsman. The roar dropped to <b>a</b> <b>murmur.</b> Then there was silence. It was all very eerie.|$|E
25|$|Problems due to rhabdomyomas include obstruction, arrhythmia, and <b>a</b> <b>murmur.</b> Such {{complications}} occur {{almost exclusively}} during pregnancy or within the child's first year. Prenatal ultrasound, performed by an obstetric sonographer specializing in cardiology, can detect a rhabdomyoma after 20 weeks. This rare tumour {{is a strong}} indicator of TSC in the child, especially if {{a family history of}} TSC exists.|$|E
25|$|Heart murmurs are {{produced}} {{as a result}} of turbulent flow of blood strong enough to produce audible noise. They are usually heard as a whooshing sound. The term murmur only refers to a sound believed to originate within blood flow through or near the heart; rapid blood velocity is necessary to produce <b>a</b> <b>murmur.</b> It should be noted that most heart problems do not produce any murmur and most valve problems also do not produce an audible murmur.|$|E

500|$|Yorkshire {{had been}} criticised {{in the press}} for fielding a {{weakened}} line-up against the Natives when the sides first met in December. After the unexpected loss, Yorkshire were determined to make amends and a strong side was selected for the county, including Fred Bonsor, Richard Lockwood and John Willie Sutcliffe, all of whom would appear for England against the Natives later that season. Described as [...] "knocked about" [...] and [...] "stale", the Natives struggled to compete against such strong opposition, and Yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to Ellison left the scores at 9–1 at half-time. The second half was little better for the Natives; they conceded a further two tries {{as well as a}} drop-goal. The second of these tries was scored by Lockwood after he ran the ball from his own half. Ellison scored a converted try late in the match, but this didn't prevent the Natives suffering their largest defeat of the tour: 16–4 to the Yorkshiremen. Ellison later described the match as [...] "without <b>a</b> <b>murmur,</b> the biggest beating we received in our whole tour".|$|E

2500|$|On the Australia Day weekend (24 and 25 January) 1970, Ourimbah was {{the venue}} for the [...] "Pilgrimage for Pop", the nation's first rock music festival. Saddington {{performed}} {{as a solo}} artist, with other acts including Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs and Jeff St John's Copperwine. Julie Kusko from The Australian Women's Weekly estimated some 6000 to 10000 attendees [...] "sat and watched, taking the long delays between poor performances without <b>a</b> <b>murmur</b> ... At night the music became better, and psychedelic lighting and colored searchlights helped. A couple of artists got standing ovations, surprisingly, for songs of the rock-'n-roll style of 15 years ago". Despite local predictions [...] "that it would all turn into a drug and sex orgy", there was some nudity and drug use, but police only [...] "laid four charges of indecency and ten for language and offensive behaviour".|$|E
2500|$|In {{fulfilment}} of {{the promise}} of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head (Leviticus Rabbah x., Midrash Teh. cxxxiii. 1), Aaron's death, {{as described in the}} Haggadah, was of a wonderful tranquility. Accompanied by Moses, his brother, and by Eleazar, his son, Aaron went to the summit of Mount Hor, where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view. [...] "Take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son Eleazar!" [...] said Moses; [...] "and then follow me." [...] Aaron did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was prepared a bed around which angels stood. [...] "Go lie down upon thy bed, my brother," [...] Moses continued; and Aaron obeyed without <b>a</b> <b>murmur.</b> Then his soul departed as if by a kiss from God. The cave closed behind Moses as he left; and he went down the hill with Eleazar, with garments rent, and crying: [...] "Alas, Aaron, my brother! thou, the pillar of supplication of Israel!" [...] When the Israelites cried in bewilderment, [...] "Where is Aaron?" [...] angels were seen carrying Aaron's bier through the air. A voice was then heard saying: [...] "The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin" [...] (Malachi 2:6). He died, according to Seder Olam Rabbah ix., R. H. 2, 3a, on the first of Ab." [...] The pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israel's camp disappeared at Aaron's death (see Seder 'Olam, ix. and R. H. 2b-3a). The seeming contradiction between Numbers 20:22 et seq. and Deuteronomy 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner: Aaron's death on Mount Hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of Arad, in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to Mosera, where they performed the rites of mourning for Aaron; wherefore it is said: [...] "There [...] died Aaron." ...|$|E
