6000|$|It is {{possible}} that the intervention of money blinds some minds to [...] a proper understanding of the operations described above. The [...] supposition, as given, applies to a condition of barter, but is [...] equally true if money is used.(110) Imagine a display of all the [...] industries of the world, A, B, C, ... X, Y, Z, presented within [...] sight on one large field, and at the central spot the producer of [...] gold and silver. When Z is produced, it is taken to the [...] gold-counter, and exchanged for money; when A is produced, the [...] same is done. Then the former money is given for A, and the latter [...] for Z, so that in truth A is exchanged against Z through the [...] medium of money, just as before money was considered. Now, it may [...] be said by an objector, “If A is not wanted, after it is produced, [...] and can not be sold, because the demand from Z has been withdrawn, [...] then the capital used for A will not be returned, and the laborers [...] in A will be thrown out of employment.” The answer is, of course, [...] that the state of things here contemplated is a permanent and [...] normal one wherein production is correctly adapted to human [...] desires. If A is found not to be wanted, after the production of [...] it, an industrial blunder has been committed, and wealth is wasted [...] just as when burned up. It is ill-assorted production. The trouble [...] is not in a lack of demand for what A may produce (of something [...] else), but with the producers of A in not making that for which [...] there were desires, from ignorance or lack of early information of [...] the disposition of wealth Z. In practice, however, it will be [...] found that most goods are made upon “orders,” and, except under [...] peculiar circumstances, not actually produced unless a market is [...] foreseen. Indeed, as every man knows, the most important function [...] of a successful business man is the <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to [...] the market, that is, to the desires of consumers.|$|E
50|$|Meat analog {{products}} are currently made by two basic processes, through either thermoplastic extrusion or fiber spinning. Thermoplastic extrusion involves the <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> {{processes that are}} more commonly associated with the making of ready-to-eat cereal products. Extruders are simple in nature and {{are considered to be}} a cost effective method of accommodating large scale productions. It also provides the conditions that are crucial to the formation of the desirable fibers. The wet mix is mixed in a heated vessel at a temperature lower than the coagulation temperature of the proteins. The elevated temperature assists in lowering the viscosity of the dough and allows for a more homogenized mixing process. Special caution must be taken as to not over mix the dough as it has been known to substantially decrease the amount of fibers formed.|$|E

40|$|We {{show how}} to treat supply {{networks}} as physical transport problems governed by balance equations and equations for the <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> speeds. Although the non-linear behaviour is different, the linearized set of coupled differential equations is formally related to those of mechanical or electrical oscillator networks. Supply networks possess interesting new features due to their complex topology and directed links. We derive analytical conditions for absolute and convective instabilities. The empirically observed "bull-whip effect" in supply chains is explained {{as a form of}} convective instability based on resonance effects. Moreover, it is generalized to arbitrary supply networks. Their related eigenvalues are usually complex, depending on the network structure (even without loops). Therefore, their generic behavior is characterized by oscillations. We also show that regular distribution networks possess two negative eigenvalues only, but perturbations generate a spectrum of complex eigenvalues. Comment: For related work see [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} few decades, the concept of {{flexible}} manufacturing has started to gain more and more attention, as an <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> methods to the increasingly varied demands by customers. Therefore, new procedures have been introduced as alternatives to the classical ones, a very promising one being incremental forming [1]. A possible application for this new procedure, targeted by {{the authors of this}} paper, is the manufacturing of custom-shaped prosthetic parts for use in various areas of human medicine. Such prostheses can have a functional role, when they target the replacing of a functional component of the human body, or an esthetic role, when they target the solving of problems related to the appearance of the human body.

40|$|Batch {{manufacturing}} plants require the frequent <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> facilities to incorporate {{internal and external}} uncertainties. The introduction of flexibility {{in the design of}} general-purpose plants represents a cornerstone for the design and retrofit of batch processes along the plants lifecycle. Moreover, the integration of batch process development decisions during the plant design also contributes to handle uncertainty. This paper presents a novel optimization-based approach for the flexible design of batch plants by integrating process synthesis and plant allocation decisions, such as feed-forward control trajectories of processing conditions or the selection of operating modes and equipment items. To do so, a modeling strategy based on Mixed-Logic Dynamic Optimization and two-stage stochastic formulation is used to maximize the expected profit taking into account several uncertain scenarios. Moreover, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting problem that is characterized by a great complexity, consisting of an iterative procedure with embedded deterministic solutions of the integrated problem. The proposed approach is illustrated through the design of a single-product batch plant to carry out a competitive reaction process. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{delays in}} the <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> or {{delivery}} rates, supply chains can be dynamically unstable with respect to perturbations in the consumption rate, which is known as "bull-whip effect". Here, we study several conceivable production strategies to stabilize supply chains, which is expressed by different specifications of the management function controlling the production speed in dependence of the stock levels. In particular, we will investigate, whether the reaction to stock levels of other producers or suppliers has a stabilizing effect. We will also demonstrate that the anticipation of future stock levels can stabilize the supply system, given the forecast horizon is long enough. To show this, we derive linear stability conditions and carry out simulations for different control strategies. The {{results indicate that the}} linear stability analysis is a helpful tool for the judgement of the stabilization effect, although unexpected deviations can occur in the non-linear regime. There are also signs of phase transitions and chaotic behavior, but this remains to be investigated more thoroughly in the future. Comment: For related work see [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Today’s {{production}} systems {{have to cope}} with volatile production environments characterized by frequently changing customer requirements, an increasing number of product variants, small batch sizes, short product life-cycles, the rapid emergence of new technical solutions and increasing regulatory requirements aimed at sustainable manufacturing.

This adaptation is required on the physical, logical and parametric levels. Such adaptivity cannot be achieved without intelligent methodologies, information models and tools to facilitate the adaptation planning and reactive adaptation of the systems. In industry it has been recognized that, because of the often expensive and inefficient adaptation process, companies rarely decide to adapt their production lines.

40|$|AbstractGenerally, inland {{waterway}} transport (IWT) is characterised by {{a high degree of}} reliability and safety compared to other transport modes. Against the background of the climate change debate however, new concerns are starting to raise attention. IWT is expected to be more sensitive to climate change aspects than other transport modes, e. g. in terms of water level fluctuations and resulting effects on costs and reliability. The present paper specifically addresses the topic of adaptation to climate change, taking IWT as a case-study. The results figuring in the paper are {{based on the results of}} the EC funded ECCONET project, which is an interdisciplinary project combining the expertise gained from climatology, hydrology, transport-economics, ship building and {{inland waterway}} management. A quantitative approach is applied, using the results of existing climate ensembles, hydrological results from KLIWAS and the transport network models TRANSTOOLS and NODUS. The paper starts first with an overview of expected effects of climate change on the Rhine and Danube. Adaptation measures are evaluated in function of their cost-effectiveness, given the expected impact of climate change on the navigation conditions. The main concern for adaptation is coping with periods of low water levels, as these were empirically established as the most influential for the sector. We consider four focal points for adaptation: fleet- and transport related strategies, operational concepts, improvement of forecasting tools and <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> procedures and storekeeping...|$|E
40|$|Despite many {{claims by}} {{high-ranking}} policymakers and some scientists {{that climate change}} breeds violent conflict, the existing empirical literature has {{so far not been}} able to identify a systematic, causal relationship of this kind. This may either reflect de facto absence of such a relationship, or it may be the consequence of theoretical and methodological limitations of existing work. In this article we revisit the climate–conflict hypothesis along two lines. First, we concentrate on indirect effects of climatic conditions on conflict, whereas most of the existing literature focuses on direct effects. Specifically, we examine the causal pathway linking climatic conditions to economic growth and to armed conflict, and argue that the growth–conflict part of this pathway is contingent on the political system. Second, we employ a measure of climatic varia-bility that has advantages over those used in the existing literature because it can presumably take into account the <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to persistent climatic changes. For the empirical analysis we use a glo-bal dataset for 1980 – 2004 and design the testing strategy tightly in line with our theory. Our empirical analysis does not produce evidence for the claim that climate variability affects economic growth. However, we find some, albeit weak, support for the hypothesis that non-democratic countries are more likely to expe-rience civil conflict when economic conditions deteriorate...|$|E
