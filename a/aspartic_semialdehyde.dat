50|$|The 3 {{substrates}} of this enzyme are L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde, phosphate, and NADP+, whereas its 3 {{products are}} L-4-aspartyl phosphate, NADPH, and H+.In physiological conditions however, the reaction {{runs in the}} opposite direction. This enzyme belongs {{to the family of}} oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-aspartate-4-semialdehyde:NADP+ oxidoreductase (phosphorylating). Other names in common use include aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, <b>aspartic</b> <b>semialdehyde</b> dehydrogenase, L-aspartate-beta-semialdehyde:NADP+ oxidoreductase, (phosphorylating), aspartic beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, and ASA dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and lysine biosynthesis.|$|E
40|$|Mutants of Escherichia coli {{in which}} the lysine-sensitive aspartokinase is feedback-resistant are described. In these strains, {{as well as in}} the wild type, <b>aspartic</b> <b>semialdehyde</b> {{dehydrogenase}} is subject to multivalent repression by lysine, threonine, and methionine. When these amino acids were added to a culture in minimal medium, the differential rate of synthesis of the enzyme dropped to zero and remained there for about one generation...|$|E
40|$|Structural gene mutants of the {{glycogen}} biosynthetic enzymes {{adenosine diphosphate}} glucose pyrophosphorylase (glgC) and glycogen synthase (glgA) were isolated and partially characterized. The cotransduction frequencies of these genes with the <b>aspartic</b> <b>semialdehyde</b> dehydrogenase (asd) and glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (glpD) genes suggested the unambiguous gene order of glpD glgA glgC asd. The {{results of the}} three-factor cross glpD- glgA- glgC+ X glpD+ glgA+ glgC- {{were consistent with the}} proposed order. A simultaneous and approximately equivalent derepression of the glgC, glgA, and glgB (branching enzyme) gene products was observed in the late logarithmic-early stationary phase of growth on enriched media. These results are consistent with the coordinately regulated synthesis of the three glycogen biosynthetic enzymes in Salmonella typhimurium...|$|E
40|$|A Lewis-acid {{promoted}} one-carbon homologation of an <b>aspartic</b> acid <b>semialdehyde</b> with trimethylsilyldiazomethane {{has led to}} {{the efficient}} synthesis of two silicon-containing α-amino acids. The use of trimethylaluminium or catalytic tin(II) chloride gave novel 4 -oxo- 5 -trimethylsilanyl derived amino acids in yields of 71 – 88 %. An investigation into the reactivity of these highly functional α-amino acids showed that selective cleavage of the C–Si bond could be achieved under mild basic conditions to give a protected derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, 4 -oxo-l-norvaline. Alternatively, Peterson olefination with aryl or alkyl aldehydes resulted in the formation of E-enone derived α-amino acids...|$|R
40|$|<b>Aspartic</b> acid <b>semialdehyde</b> {{dehydrogenase}} (ASADH) lies at {{the first}} branch point in the essential aspartic acid biosynthetic pathway that is found in bacteria and plants but is absent from animals. Mutations in the asadh gene encoding ASADH produce an inactive enzyme, which is lethal. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the hypothesis that ASADH represents a new anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) target. An asadh promoter-replacement mutant MTB, designated MTB::asadh, in which asadh gene expression is regulated by pristinamycin, was constructed to investigate the physiological functions of ASADH in the host bacteria. Bacterial growth was evaluated by monitoring OD 600 and ASADH expression was analyzed by Western blotting. The {{results showed that the}} growth and survival of MTB::asadh was completely inhibited {{in the absence of the}} inducer pristinamycin. Furthermore, the growth of the mutant was rigorously dependent on the presence of the inducer in the medium. The starved mutant exhibited a marked reduction (approximately 80 %) in the cell wall materials compared to the wild-type, in addition to obvious morphological differences that were apparent in scanning electron microscopy studies; however, with the addition of pristinamycin, the cell wall contents and morphology similar to those of the wild-type strain were recovered. The starved mutant also exhibited almost no pathogenicity in an in vitro model of infection using mouse macrophage J 774 A. 1 cells. The mutant showed a concentration-dependent recovery of pathogenicity with the addition of the inducer. These findings implicate ASADH as a promising target for the development of novel anti-MTB drugs...|$|R
50|$|The biosynthetic {{precursors}} of tabtoxin {{were identified}} by the incorporation of 13C-labeled compounds and shown to consist of L-threonine and L-aspartate for the side chain and pyruvic acid and the methyl group of L-methionine for the β-lactam moiety. A biosynthetic model {{for the formation of}} TβL resembles that of lysine, where the first dedicated step is the DapA-catalyzed condensation of <b>aspartic</b> acid <b>semialdehyde</b> with pyruvate to form L-2,3-dihydropicolinate (DHDPA). Tabtoxin biosynthesis branches off from the lysine biosynthetic pathway before the formation of diaminopimelate (DAP). TabA is a gene, which is essential for tabtoxin production. The discovery of this gene provided the first experimental data to support the hypotheses that the precursors for tabtoxin originate from the lysine biosynthetic pathway. The deduced amino acid sequence of tabA showed significant relatedness to lysA, which encodes DAP decarboxylase in bacteria. Although tabA was not required for lysine biosynthesis, the deduced product of a tabB, also located in the TβL biosynthetic region, showed relatedness todapD, a gene encoding THDPA succinyl-CoA succinyltransferase (THDPA-ST). DapB is essential for both lysine and tabtoxin biosynthesis and THDPA may be an intermediate in both pathways. Three genes have been characterized in the 31-kb region which contains all genes necessary for TβL synthesis and tabtoxin resistance: tabA, tabB, and tblA. Although there is no obvious relationship between TblA and known polypeptides, TabA has significant sequence homology to LysA from E. coliand P. aeruginosa whereas TabB shows relatedness to DapD. Some progress has been made on elucidating factors that regulate tabtoxin biosynthesis in P. syringae. In a subsequent study, zinc was shown to be required for the aminopeptidase activity, which hydrolyzes tabtoxin to release TβL.|$|R
40|$|The coding regions for the Escherichia coli {{gene for}} aspartokinase I/homoserine {{dehydrogenase}} I (thrA) and the Corynebacterium glutamicum gene for <b>aspartic</b> <b>semialdehyde</b> dehydrogenase (asd) have been subcloned into a Simian Virus 40 (SV 40) -based mammalian expression vector. Both enzyme activities {{are expressed in}} mouse 3 T 3 cells after transfer of the corresponding chimaeric gene. The kinetic parameters {{are similar to those}} of the native bacterial enzymes, and aspartokinase I/homoserine dehydrogenase I retains its allosteric regulation by threonine. An extract of the cells expressing aspartokinase I/homoserine dehydrogenase I, mixed with one from cells expressing <b>aspartic</b> <b>semialdehyde</b> dehydrogenase, produced homoserine when the mixture was incubated with aspartic acid, ATP and NADPH. The thrA and asd expression cassettes were combined into a single plasmid which, when transfected into 3 T 3 cells, enabled them to produce homoserine from aspartic acid. Homoserine-producing 3 T 3 cells were transfected with the plasmid pSVthrB/C (homoserine kinase and threonine synthase) and selected for growth on homoserine. Cell lines isolated from these cells expressed the complete bacterial threonine pathway, were independent of threonine for growth and could be maintained in medium which contained no free threonine. The threonine in the proteins of these cells became enriched in 15 N when the culture medium contained [15 N]aspartic acid. The production of homoserine and the growth of cells was at a maximum when there was more than 2. 5 mM aspartate in the medium. Below this concentration the high Km of aspartokinase limited the flux through the pathway. In the presence of additional aspartic acid the new pathway could sustain a cell cycle time close to that of the same cells cultured in threonine-containing medium...|$|E
40|$|The asd gene of {{escherichia coli}} encodes <b>aspartic</b> <b>semialdehyde</b> dehydrogenase, an enzyme {{involved}} in lysine, threonine, and methionine biosynthesis; its synthesis {{is controlled by}} a multivalent repression mechanism. It was cloned in plasmid pBR 322 and its complete nucleotide sequence determined. The sequence predicts a polypeptide chain of 367 amino acids, in good agreement with results obtained for the purified protein (Biellmann et al., 1980 a). Our data indicate a Cys residue instead of a His residue, which was proposed after covalent labeling of the active center of the enzyme; this is {{more in line with}} the catalytic site of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme which carries out a similar reaction. The nucleotide sequence that precedes the translational start does not display any of the characteristic features of an attenuation signal. Hence the expression of the asd gene is probably not controlled {{in the same way as}} other multivalently repressed operons such as ilva and thr...|$|E
