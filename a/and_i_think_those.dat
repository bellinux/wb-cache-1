6000|$|It will here {{perhaps be}} said that {{mathematical}} demonstrations, and other truths that are not innate, are not assented to as soon as proposed, wherein they are distinguished from these maxims and other innate truths. I shall have occasion to speak of assent upon the first proposing, more particularly by and by. I shall here only, and that very readily, allow, that these maxims and mathematical demonstrations are in this different: that the one have need of reason, using of proofs, to make them out and to gain our assent; but the other, as soon as understood, are, without any the least reasoning, embraced and assented to. But I withal beg leave to observe, that it lays open the weakness of this subterfuge, which {{requires the use of}} reason for the discovery of these general truths: since it must be confessed that in their discovery there is no use made of reasoning at all. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> who give this answer will not be forward to affirm that the knowledge of this maxim, [...] "That it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be," [...] is a deduction of our reason. For this would be to destroy that bounty of nature they seem so fond of, whilst they make the knowledge of those principles to depend on the labour of our thoughts. For all reasoning is search, and casting about, and requires pains and application. And how can it with any tolerable sense be supposed, that what was imprinted by nature, as the foundation and guide of our reason, should need the use of reason to discover it? ...|$|E

6000|$|... 11. Very seriously, in {{all such}} public duties, Mr. Harrison {{was a person}} of rarest quality and worth; {{absolutely}} disinterested in his zeal, unwearied in exertion, always ready, never tiresome, never absurd; bringing practical sense, kindly discretion, and a most wholesome element of good-humored, but incorruptible honesty, into everything his hand found to do. Everybody respected, and the best men sincerely regarded him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> who knew {{most of the world}} were always the first to acknowledge his fine faculty of doing exactly the right thing to exactly the right point--and so pleasantly. In private life, he was to me an object of quite special admiration, in the quantity of pleasure he could take in little things; and he very materially modified many of my gravest conclusions, as to the advantages or mischiefs of modern suburban life. To myself scarcely any dwelling-place and duty in this world would have appeared (until, perhaps, I had tried them) less eligible for a man of sensitive and fanciful mind than the New Road, Camberwell Green, and the monotonous office work in Bridge Street. And to a certain extent, I am still of the same mind as to these matters, and do altogether, and without doubt or hesitation, repudiate the existence of New Road and Camberwell Green in general, no less than the condemnation of intelligent persons to a routine of clerk's work broken only by a three weeks' holiday in the decline of the year. On less lively, fanciful, and amiable persons than my old friend, the New Road and the daily desk do verily exercise a degrading and much to be regretted influence. But Mr. Harrison brought the freshness of pastoral simplicity into the most faded corners of the Green, lightened with his cheerful heart the most leaden hours of the office, and gathered during his three weeks' holiday in the neighborhood, suppose, of Guildford, Gravesend, Broadstairs, or Rustington, more vital recreation and speculative philosophy than another man would have got on the grand tour.|$|E

5000|$|Although La Torre {{played with}} the band as Rising West, he was not privy to any {{information}} concerning tensions within the band at the time. Neither was he considering a career with Queensrÿche at that point, as he was primarily focused on Crimson Glory at the time: [...] "West was {{just a way to}} get out there and play stuff that they haven't played in a long time and hopefully be able to earn supplemental income until Queensrÿche was going back out." [...] Queensrÿche, however, were debating how they would carry on. According to La Torre, his eventual hiring was a [...] "natural evolution", and he was therefore announced as the band's replacement singer at the same time it was publicly announced they had parted ways with Tate, continuing under the name Queensrÿche. In retrospect, he feels that he is a suitable candidate because Tate has been an inspiration to him, saying: [...] "there's lots of guys that sing higher notes and maybe cleaner and could do it a little better that way, but I think that the subtleties and those little nuances that Geoff Tate was always so known for, was something that I just grasped at a very early age. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> characteristics are what kind of separates someone from being to able to hit notes, and someone being able to actually sell the song as a vocalist." ...|$|E

40|$|This Internship {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts in English, 2012. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 23). A widely used method for language in Bangladeshi schools is grammar translation method (GTM). Grammar translation method is a very traditional method, {{and i think in}} more or less in all medium schools it is mainly used. I also use Grammar translation method for teaching the students. From my point view in our Bangladeshi culture especially beginner level of students need appropriate use of both native language (L 1) and target language (L 2). And for that reason grammar translation method is suitable. Also in Asian part of the world the parents are very conscious about their child's results. And GTM method also helps students to get good grades in English. Also students need to know the meaning of different words and GTM helps to fulfill that. I taught the students by GTM method which included some more activities <b>and</b> <b>i</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> techniques helped them a lot. So by a good feedback, well guidance from a teacher, effective error correction could give a student's progression and fluency. From my internship result I found that by GTM method and with my other efforts students developed a lot in their academic results and also in speaking fluency by target language (L 2) where both are equally important.

5000|$|Vertov {{wrote in}} {{response}} to the criticism his film received upon its release. On page 114 of Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov, the director expressed his frustration with those critics who wanted to critique the film’s sound or the film’s footage individually and separately from each other. Instead, he believed that critics should view both the film’s sound and images and the way they worked together. In the same section of his writing, he urged for a holistic, contextualized critique of the film: “Those who worked on Enthusiasm <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> all <b>those</b> in newsreel film, are interested in a many-sided (and not a one-sided) analysis of this film.” To Vertov, the role and place of his film in the course of cinema, Soviet cinema, and documentary film were all necessary components of critically appraising Enthusiasms success and significance.|$|R
