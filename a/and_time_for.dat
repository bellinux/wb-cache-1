5|$|A simple {{record of}} depth <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a dive is {{useful as a}} legal record of a diving operation, where this is required, {{and in the case}} of an {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can provide useful diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to the accident and the action taken during and after the incident. A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E
5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings {{of time and}} money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus {{did not have to be}} broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> cleaning up the site prior to building anew.|$|E
5|$|Western civilization {{could only}} be saved, Innis argued, by {{recovering}} the balance between space <b>and</b> <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing {{institutions of higher learning}} from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, A Plea for Time, he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.|$|E

5|$|With {{just one}} owned-and-operated station, Paramount's program service never gelled into a true {{television}} network; television historians such as Alex McNeil (1996) consider Paramount programs syndicated rather than network series. While the Paramount series Hollywood Wrestling <b>and</b> <b>Time</b> <b>For</b> Beany were widely seen on stations across the United States, most other Paramount television programs aired {{in only a}} handful of markets (another exception, Hollywood Reel, aired in fourteen major cities in 1950).|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Philip {{engaged in a}} flurry of {{diplomatic}} activity. He bribed Berisades, son of the Thracian king Cotys, to withdraw Thracian support for Pausanias, and thereby prevented the Thracian invasion. Similarly, he bought off the Paionians with gifts in exchange for their withdrawal from Macedon. Philip may also have concluded a treaty with the victorious Dardanian king Bardylis, possibly surrendering large parts of Macedon in exchange for peace. Although no evidence remains of such a treaty, the fact that Illyrians did not follow up their victory despite Macedon's weakness is suggestive that some agreement was reached. Philip also married Bardylis's daughter (or niece), which may have formed part of the treaty. At any rate, Philip's diplomacy gave Macedon some breathing space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> recovery.|$|E

25|$|The unmanageably {{high number}} of corpses strewn all over the cities and countrysides, limited {{resources}} <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> identifying bodies, and the very real threat of cholera, diphtheria and other diseases prompted emergency workers to create makeshift mass graves.

25|$|Unlike the {{equations}} of motion for describing particle mechanics, which are systems of coupled ordinary differential equations, the analogous equations governing the dynamics of waves and fields are always partial differential equations, since the waves or fields are functions of space <b>and</b> <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> a particular solution, boundary conditions along with initial conditions need to be specified.|$|E
25|$|R. W. Gosper's {{algorithm}} {{finds the}} period {{but not the}} starting point of the first cycle. Its main feature is that it never backs up to reevaluate the generator function, and is economical in both space <b>and</b> <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> example, if it is known a priori that the generator function has a period of 232 then 33 words is sufficient.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, Stengel {{once again}} {{returned}} to Time, {{this time as}} {{managing editor of the}} magazine. The appointment was announced on 17 May 2006 by the Editor in Chief of Time Inc., John Huey, and he officially entered the role on 15 June 2006 as the 16th managing editor of the magazine, which was in its 83rd year at the time. In his role as managing editor, Stengel oversees Time magazine, {{which is one of the}} largest magazines worldwide, and Time.com, as well as Time Books, <b>and</b> <b>Time</b> <b>for</b> Kids.|$|E
25|$|Until 1912, the {{education}} system in Albania depended on religious institutions. Muslims attended Ottoman schools, the Orthodox population attended Greek or Armenian schools, Catholics attended Italian or Austrian schools, whereas in the districts near Slavic states, the population attended Serbian or Bulgarian schools. When Albania was declared independent in 1912 its government took measures to close foreign schools and to open Albanian ones. From 1912 to 1914, {{there was not much}} opportunity <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> progress of national education, because of the political instability and the breakout of World War I. The first laic school was opened in Shkoder in 1913.|$|E
25|$|As far as presidential appointments, as with {{treaties}} {{a person}} is not officially and legally appointed to a position until their appointment is approved by the Senate. Prior to Senate approval and publication of that approval along with an official date <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> their swearing-in and assumption of duties and responsibilities, they are nominees rather than appointees. And again, the President nominates people for specific positions at his pleasure and can do so without or in spite of Senate advice. Senate consent occurs when a supermajority of senators votes to approve and therefore appoint a nominee.|$|E

25|$|Stracke was {{a figure}} in the Chicago School of Television, a style of early TV shows in the 1950s {{characterized}} by improvisational dialog and a variety show-like atmosphere. Along with Studs Terkel, Stracke was a cast member on Studs' Place. He played {{on one of the}} first sitcoms, Hawkins Falls, and gained national fame as Uncle Win on his children's program Animal Playtime (on NBC) <b>and</b> <b>Time</b> <b>For</b> Uncle Win. It was notable {{as one of the first}} children's programs that treated children's programming as an educational opportunity and not merely entertainment. This program also toured local schools.|$|E
25|$|The ACMA set Tuesday, November 12, 1912, at 2:00 P.M. as {{the date}} <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> laying the {{cornerstone}} for the memorial. The date {{coincided with the}} first day of the UDC's annual convention, which that year was to be held in Washington, D.C. The UDC claimed it was the first time the convention had been held outside the boundary of the old Confederacy (although that was not true, as the convention was held in San Francisco, California, in 1905.) The organization invited President William Howard Taft to speak to the convention, and he agreed to do so in mid-October.|$|E
25|$|While the {{practicality}} of CBCT fosters its increasing {{application in}} IR, technical limitations hinder its {{integration into the}} field. The two most significant factors that affect successful integration are image quality <b>and</b> <b>time</b> (<b>for</b> set up, image acquisition, and image reconstruction). Compared to MDCT, the wider collimation in CBCT leads to increased scatter radiation and degradation of image quality as demonstrated by artifacts and decreased contrast-to-noise ratio. The temporal resolution of cesium iodide detectors in CBCT slows data acquisition time to approximately 5 to 20 seconds, which increases motion artifact. The time required for image reconstruction takes longer for CBCT (1 minute) compared to MDCT (real time) due to the computationally demanding cone beam reconstruction algorithms.|$|E
