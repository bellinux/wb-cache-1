5|$|A late-night {{service from}} Ludgate Hill (departing 01:15) to Beckenham Junction via Herne Hill began in 1910. The {{intention}} was to satisfy journalists on Fleet Street who regularly complained in print <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> quality of service on the line; those working on the morning papers often worked beyond midnight and missed the last train.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Lamason {{was among}} a group of 168 allied airmen from Great Britain, United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Jamaica who -- along with over 2,500 French prisoners -- were taken by train—in overcrowded cattle boxcars — from Fresnes Prison outside Paris, to Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp. As the airmen were herded into the boxcars, Lamason protested <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> treatment of the airmen, only to be struck in the face by a SS guard. Lamason fell to the ground and captured pilot Roy Allen watched as a SS Major pulled a Luger from his holster and thought Lamason would be shot on the spot. After five days travel, during which the airmen received very little food or water, they arrived at Buchenwald on 20 August 1944.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} sparse {{through most of}} the life of the railway. In 1905, three trains per day ran from Goole to Haxey Junction and back, with a {{separate}} train operating on the Fockerby Branch. By November, only the morning and evening train ran, except on Wednesdays. A coal strike in 1912 resulted in all services being withdrawn except on Wednesdays and Saturdays for a period of three weeks. At a public meeting held in October 1920, users complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> service and the lack of trucks to carry goods. The chairman of the Isle of Axholme Rural District Council was particularly exasperated by the fact that the trains arrived at Haxey Junction shortly after the trains on the other line had departed.|$|E

5|$|The {{promotion}} {{strategy for}} the film played on nationalist sentiment by announcing that La tragedia del silencio was the first authentically Colombian movie. It was first screened to the public on 18 July 1924 in Faenza theatre in Bogotá, attracting a large audience. There were several technical problems including power failure and projector errors, caused in particular by the nervousness of the director and his son, {{the director of the}} theatre Joaquín Francisco, and operator Gustavo Francisco. However, the film was well received by the public and the press, although some viewers complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> image quality. The theatre was crowded during the seventeen showings of the film, but it was not very successful financially.|$|E
5|$|In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Engineer District (the {{military}} {{component of the}} Manhattan Project) surveyed sites around Gallup, Las Vegas, La Ventana, Jemez Springs, and Otowi, and recommended the one near Jemez Springs. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned {{with the possibility of}} flooding. The party then moved on to the Otowi site, the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which, he hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project. The engineers were concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, the {{supporting}} British armour {{was nowhere to}} be seen and the artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger inspected the brigade's position and found his battalions under fire from German tanks. Unable to contact nearby units by radio and realising the degree to which his men were exposed, he raced off under fire in a Bren carrier to locate the British armour. Coming across an armoured brigade four miles away, he implored its commander to bring his unit forward but was refused meaningful support until the intervention of Major General Herbert Lumsden, commander of the British 1st Armoured Division. By the time the tanks had arrived, the men of the 22nd Battalion had been largely killed or captured. The headquarters element of the 23rd Battalion were also prisoners of war. By nightfall, the 4th Brigade had been overrun. Kippenberger asked for and received permission to withdraw his brigade from the ridge. Although awarded a Bar to his DSO for his dash for help from the British, Kippenberger was bitter <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> planning of the operation and admitted his own errors of judgement.|$|E

5|$|The first project {{proposed}} {{and worked on}} was a period film to be called Dora-Heita, but when this was deemed too expensive, attention shifted to Dodesukaden, an adaptation of yet another Shūgorō Yamamoto work, again <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> and destitute. The film was shot quickly (by Kurosawa's standards) in about nine weeks, with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget. For his first work in color, the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside, with the artist focusing {{on the creation of}} a bold, almost surreal palette of primary colors, in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live. It was released in Japan in October 1970, but though a minor critical success, it was greeted with audience indifference. The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve. Initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable, but Dodesukaden has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the director's best work.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y at Oak Ridge was considered, {{but in the}} end it {{was decided}} that it should be in a remote location. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search for a suitable site was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch. In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Project was sent to survey the area, and he recommended a site near Jemez Springs, New Mexico. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned with the possibility of flooding. The party then moved on to the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{the cities of}} New Jersey began {{experiencing}} urban decay. Governments attempted to intervene with the urban decay, focusing on the office Gateway Center and several other projects. However, suburbs continued to grow. Revolts occurred, often due to frustration <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> urban conditions. As urban decay started {{a gap between the}} wealthier suburbs and poorer cities, state income taxes were implemented to stop the gap. Around the 1970s, urbanization started increasing again.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, {{the area}} around the bridge was {{designated}} a conservation area, with responsibility shared between Salford City and Trafford. The bridge and the aqueduct both became Grade II listed structures. Salford City Council have been concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> quality of pedestrian access across the bridge, which, as well as being potentially unsafe, detracts from the development of tourism in the area.

25|$|In the Dutch Golden Age, {{literature}} flourished as well, with Joost van den Vondel and P. C. Hooft as the {{two most}} famous writers.

Important 20th century authors include Godfried Bomans, Harry Mulisch, Jan Wolkers, Simon Vestdijk, Hella S. Haasse, Cees Nooteboom, Gerard Reve and Willem Frederik Hermans. Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl was published after she died in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.|$|E

25|$|Resistance {{from the}} {{military}} command and concerns about high production cost were finally overcome by anxieties <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> performance of Soviet tanks in the Winter War in Finland, {{and the effectiveness of}} German tanks during the Battle of France. The first production T-34s were completed in September 1940, completely replacing the production of the T-26, the BT series, and the multi-turreted T-28 medium tank at the KhPZ plant.

When fans began to complain <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> quality of the Showground venue as a rugby league ground, the club eventually decided to move all future home matches to the Stadium, where the club remains.
