5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices <b>and</b> <b>faces</b> that {{is valid}} for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices <b>and</b> <b>faces</b> have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides of the faces of the graph equals twice the number of edges.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{research}} is to collate, compare, and discuss the presently available data for head <b>and</b> <b>face</b> dimensions among Korean and Japanese ethnic groups. Classification of Korean male and female head <b>and</b> <b>face</b> types is simpler than classification of Japanese subjects. Male groups have more statistically significant morphological differences than females, and Japanese subjects display larger values for head <b>and</b> <b>face</b> measurement categories than Korean subjects. Japanese item values for head <b>and</b> <b>face</b> dimensions show distinct differences between male and female subjects compared to Korean subjects. Japanese male subjects have distinct differences from Korean male subjects and relatively lower values for head <b>and</b> <b>face</b> dimensions as age increases compared to Korean male subjects. Generally, female subjects have no regular tendency according to age compared to male subjects...|$|R

Most of the Merops bee-eaters have a black bar through the eye and many have differently coloured throats <b>and</b> <b>faces.</b> The extent of the green in these species varies from almost complete in the green bee-eater to barely any green in the white-throated bee-eater. Three species, from equatorial Africa, have no green at all in their plumage, the black bee-eater, the blue-headed bee-eater and the rosy bee-eater. Many species have elongated central tail feathers.|$|E

Because of these concerns, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Least Concern.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Most {{biometric}} {{systems that}} are presently used in real time applications typically use a single biometric characteristic to authenticate the user. A biometric system which is based only on a single biometric identifier in making a personal identification is often not {{able to meet the}} desired performance requirements. Multimodal biometrics is an emerging field of biometric technology, where more than one biometric trait to improve the combined performance. We design a bimodal biometric system which integrates FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face.</b> Hence this paper has focused on the extraction of features from FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and the key points are derived from FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> <b>and</b> then they are clustered using K-Means Algorithm. The centroid, mean and variance of key extracted image of K-Means are stored in the database which is compared with the query FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> features to prove the recognition and authentication. The comparison is based on the XOR operation. Results are performed on the Poly-U FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> database to check the proposed FKP <b>and</b> <b>Face</b> recognition method. It can be used to overcome some of the limitations of a single biometrics, increases the performance...|$|R

40|$|Holistic {{processing}} <b>and</b> <b>face</b> space coding {{are widely}} considered primary perceptual mechanisms behind good face recognition. Here, however, we present {{the case of}} S. P., a developmental prosopagnosic who demonstrated severe impairments in <b>face</b> memory <b>and</b> <b>face</b> perception, yet showed normal holistic processing <b>and</b> <b>face</b> space coding. Across three composite experiments, S. P. showed normal-strength holistic processing for upright <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> no composite effect for inverted faces. Across five aftereffect experiments, S. P. showed normal-sized face aftereffects, which derived normally from face space rather than shape-generic mechanisms. The case of S. P. implies: (a) normal holistic processing <b>and</b> <b>face</b> space coding can be insufficient for good face recognition even when present in combination; and (b) the focus of recent literature on holistic processing <b>and</b> <b>face</b> space should be expanded to include other potential face processing mechanisms (e. g., part-based processing).

5|$|After Samus {{retrieves}} {{three pieces}} of the Light of Aether, she enters the Ing's Sky Temple <b>and</b> <b>faces</b> the Emperor Ing, the strongest Ing who guards the remaining Light of Aether. Samus defeats the creature and retrieves the last remaining energy, causing Dark Aether to become critically unstable and collapse; however, her path out of the temple is blocked by a horribly altered and unstable Dark Samus. After defeating her foe, Samus escapes as the dark world disappears around her. Returning to U-Mos, she finds that the Luminoth were {{in a state of}} hibernation but have now awakened. After a brief celebration, Samus leaves Aether in her repaired gunship. If the player completes the game with all of the items collected, Dark Samus is shown reforming herself above Aether.|$|E

Off the United States, this ray is common <b>and</b> <b>faces</b> no substantial threats: it is only occasionally caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, and has no economic value. As most of its range lies within US waters, the species has been assessed as Least Concern overall by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
