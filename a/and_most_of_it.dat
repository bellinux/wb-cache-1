5|$|Much of Traherne's work remains un{{published}}. He was {{not known}} during his lifetime, and only one of his works was published {{before his death in}} 1674 and two others were published shortly thereafter. Of his published work, almost all appeared posthumously, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in the 20th century. Several unpublished manuscripts are held in museums, private collections and university archives, including the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, the British Library in London and the Beinecke Library at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June, Morris {{ordered the}} 39th Infantry Battalion (less one company) and the Papuan Infantry Battalion, as Maroubra Force, to defend Kokoda. The Japanese {{landed in the}} Buna area on 21 July. At this point, B Company of the 39th Infantry Battalion was at Kokoda, with C Company {{advancing}} along the track, departing Illolo on 23 July. The remainder of the battalion was poised to move <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> had arrived at Deniki by 4 August. Maroubra Force was run out of Kokoda on 29 July. MacArthur was sanguine about this, believing that the landings on Guadalcanal on 8 August would cause the Japanese to withdraw to Buna. Blamey was not so sure, and ordered Major General Arthur Allen's 7th Division to Port Moresby to reinforce Maroubra Force.|$|E

5|$|The Alsos Mission {{had learned}} that the uranium ores that {{had been taken from}} Belgium in 1944 had been shipped to the Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Staßfurt. The 83rd Infantry Division {{captured}} this on 15 April. As it was in the occupation zone allocated to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference, the Alsos Mission, led by Pash and accompanied by Lansdale, Perrin and Air Commodore Sir Charles Hambro, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of uranium ore, sodium uranate and ferrouranium weighing about 1,000 tons, were taken away by an African-American truck company. The uranium was taken to Hildesheim <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was flown to the United Kingdom by the Royal Air Force; the rest had to be moved to Antwerp by train and loaded onto a ship to England.|$|E

5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E

25|$|Construction {{began by}} the Wehrmacht during the German {{occupation}} of Norway from 1940 to 1945, but {{the project was}} never completed.

25|$|In December 1915 the {{division}} {{was ordered to}} Egypt, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> (with two of the field companies) arrived there by 13 January. A week later the move was countermanded and the troops re-embarked for France, concentrating near Amiens by mid-February. The only result of this move was an outbreak of infectious disease (Paratyphoid fever and Diphtheria) that weakened units and men for months to come.|$|E
25|$|Another disputed {{decision}} made by Radcliffe was division of the Malda district of Bengal. The district overall had a slight Muslim majority, but was divided <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> including Malda town, went to India. The district remained under East Pakistan administration for 3–4 days after 15 August 1947.

5|$|Magnus's kingship {{has been}} downplayed in later history {{partly due to}} his short tenure, <b>and</b> because <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was {{together}} with his brother.

25|$|Eisenstein's film, Ivan The Terrible, Part I, {{presenting}} Ivan IV of Russia as {{a national}} hero, won Joseph Stalin's approval (and a Stalin Prize), but the sequel, Ivan The Terrible, Part II was criticized by various authorities and would go unreleased until 1958.

25|$|By 1800, {{the canal}} {{was in a}} poor condition, and another £57,000 of public money was spent {{refurbishing}} it over the following ten years. Closures during the refurbishment resulted {{in a loss of}} traffic, which did not fully recover. In 1829, both canals were transferred to a private company, who spent £80,000 on improvements over the next twenty years. The ship canal was enlarged in 1884, to allow ships of 5,000 tons to reach Newry. It reverted to public ownership in 1901, when the Newry Port and Harbour Authority was created. The canal closed in 1936 <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was officially abandoned in 1949, with some in 1956. The ship canal closed in 1966 and the Authority was wound up in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the canal}} was {{completed}} in 1792, and it operated successfully until the 1830s. The construction and operation of the Hay inclined plane was documented by two Prussian engineers who visited it in 1826 or 1827. In the 1840s it was leased by the Shropshire Union Canal, but was suffering from subsidence by the 1850s. Following nine breaches in 1855 and 1856, it was purchased by the London and North Western Railway company, owners of the Shropshire Union, in 1857 <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was closed in 1858. A railway was laid along parts of it, but a small section {{at the southern end}} remained in operation until 1912, and was not formally abandoned until 1944. The Hay inclined plane and a section {{of the canal}} now form part of the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust.|$|E
