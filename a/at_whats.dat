40|$|Most interpreters {{think that}} for Leibniz, {{teleology}} is goodness-directedness. Explaining a monadic action teleologically, according to them, simply means explaining {{it in terms of}} the goodness of the state at which the agent aims. On some interpretations, the goodness at issue is always apparent goodness: an action is end-directed iff it aims <b>at</b> <b>what</b> appears good to the agent. On other interpretations, the goodness at issue is only sometimes apparent goodness and at other times merely objective goodness: some actions do not aim <b>at</b> <b>what</b> appears good to the agent, but merely <b>at</b> <b>what</b> is objectively good—that is, <b>at</b> <b>what</b> God knows to be good—and that is sufficient for teleology. My paper, on the other hand, argues that both of these interpretations are mistaken. Monadic teleology, I contend, does not have to consist in striving for the good; neither goodness nor God is required to make monadic actions teleological...|$|R
