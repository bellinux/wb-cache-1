5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> so they must always be treated as <b>an</b> <b>end.</b> Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be <b>an</b> <b>end</b> and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> but that when we do, we also treat him as <b>an</b> <b>end</b> in himself.|$|E
