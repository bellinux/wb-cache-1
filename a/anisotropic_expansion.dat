40|$|The two-particle {{azimuthal}} angle correlation (TPAC) and azimuthal charge balance function (ACBF) {{are used}} to study the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>expansion</b> in relativistic heavy ion collisions.

The AMPT model reproduces the observed TPAC, but the RQMD model fails to reproduce the strong correlations in both small and large azimuthal angles.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to efficiently implement thermal expansion in the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) for both isotropic and <b>anisotropic</b> <b>expansion.</b> We compare our approach to previous isotropic methods that require a grid search for free energy minima and are infeasible to carry out for <b>anisotropic</b> <b>expansion.</b> These methods are carried out on experimentally known polymorphs of piracetam. All isotropic methods agree at all temperatures, with the Gibbs free energy deviating less than 0. 04 kcal/mol and polymorph free energy differences deviating less than 0. 03 kcal/mol. Our anisotropic method converges to lower free energy minima with a maximum deviation from isotropic QHA of over 0. 3 kcal/mol, but {{much of that is}} lost for free energy differences that deviate less than 0. 04 kcal/mol. Overall, the use of <b>anisotropic</b> <b>expansion</b> was found to improve the accuracy of the Gibbs free energies of each polymorph, each of which demonstrates moderate anisotropy upon expansion, but have little effect on free energy difference between polymorphs of piracetam.

40|$|The CESA 1 {{component}} of cellulose synthase is phosphorylated at sites clustered in two hypervariable {{regions of the}} protein. Mutations of the phosphorylated residues to Ala (A) or Glu (E) alter <b>anisotropic</b> cell <b>expansion</b> and cellulose synthesis in rapidly expanding roots and hypocotyls. Expression of T 166 E, S 686 E, or S 688 E mutants of CESA 1 fully rescued the temperature sensitive cesA 1 - 1 allele (rsw 1) at a restrictive temperature whereas mutations to A at these positions caused defects in <b>anisotropic</b> cell <b>expansion.</b> However, mutations to E at residues surrounding T 166 (i. e., S 162, T 165, and S 167) caused opposite effects. Live-cell imaging of fluorescently labeled CESA showed close correlations between tissue or cell morphology and patterns of bidirectional motility of CESA complexes in the plasma membrane. In the WT, CESA complexes moved at similar velocities in both directions along microtubule tracks. By contrast, the rate of movement of CESA particles was directionally asymmetric in mutant lines that exhibited abnormal tissue or cell expansion, and the asymmetry was removed upon depolymerizing microtubules with oryzalin. This suggests that phosphorylation of CESA differentially affects a polar interaction with microtubules that may regulate the length or quantity of a subset of cellulose microfibrils and that this, in turn, alters microfibril structure in the primary cell wall resulting in or contributing to the observed defect in <b>anisotropic</b> cell <b>expansion...</b>|$|R
