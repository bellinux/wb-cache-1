50|$|The {{rack railway}} section of line {{operated}} through the Razorback Ranges, between Moonmera and the Mount Morgan township. It was built at {{half the cost}} of a conventional railway to Mt Morgan {{at a time when the}} longevity of the ore deposit was unknown, but added significant operating cost and time delays to the journey. A special purpose steam locomotive needed to attach to the train for ascent and descent of the rack section. Although only ~2.4km long, the rack section speed of ~10km/h and the time for the rack loco to <b>attach</b> <b>and</b> <b>detach</b> added 40 minutes or more to the journey compared to a conventional line, and the maximum load was limited to ~130 tons. The engine was typically coupled at the lower side of the train, when ascending and descending the incline to prevent runaways if wagon couplings broke. The steepest grade was 1 in 16.5 (~6%), double the steepest grade on a conventional line and three times steeper than the usual maximum grade.|$|E
50|$|The {{risks of}} double heading {{as well as}} its costs (fuel and {{maintenance}} costs for the engines, wages for their crews) have led railroads to seek alternative solutions. Electrification has been used in many cases. The Milwaukee Road was able to switch from triple-headed steam locomotives to a single electric locomotive. The costs of running extra steam locomotives were eliminated, and average train speeds increased because it was no longer necessary to <b>attach</b> <b>and</b> <b>detach</b> the locomotives. In Britain, the Midland Railway used to use double-heading often, because it built only small, light locomotives, which were often not powerful enough to haul the trains alone. Several accidents on the Midland system were indirectly caused by this 'small engine policy' and the resulting reliance on double-heading. Some were caused by trains stalling despite being double-headed (such as the 1913 Ais Gill rail accident), while others were caused by excessive light-engine movements as locomotives that had been used for double-heading returned to their depots (the Hawes Junction rail crash in 1910). When the Midland was absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, this practice was stopped because it was uneconomical, and more powerful locomotives were built.|$|E
