40|$|Adult pigeons {{when given}} {{extended}} treatment with beef <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extract</b> will become refractory to the prolactin and gonadotrophic {{portions of the}} extract. Refractoriness to prolactin is indicated {{by the failure of}} the crops of the immunized birds to continue to respond, with typical hyper-plasia, to the prolactin entity of the administered extract. That an anti-gonadotrophic factor is produced in the immunized adult pigeons is suggested by the finding that the spermatogenic activity in these birds was much less than that noted in birds receiving short-term treatment with <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extract.</b> In addition, the serum ofthe immunized birds significantly reduced the effects of the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extract</b> on average size of ovarian follicles and hypertrophy of the epididymis in immature pigeons...|$|E

40|$|The first {{indication}} {{of the existence of}} gonadotropic substances in <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extracts</b> came from the pioneer work of Smith (1927). It was shown later by Fevold, Hisaw, and Leonard (1931) and others that the gonadotropicall), active <b>pituitary</b> <b>extracts</b> contain two components: the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and the interstitial cell-stimulating hormone (ICSH). The former concerns mainly the stimulation of follicle growth in the ovaries and increase of spermatogenic activity in the male, while the function of ICSH is to transform the follicles to corpora lutea in the ovaries and to enlarge the secondary sex glands through its stimulation of the interstitial cells of the testes. The isolation of ICSH from both sheep and pig glands has been reported independently by Li, Simpson, and Evans (1940) and Shedlovsky, Rothen, Greep, van Dyke, and Chow (1940). Recently Li and coworkers (Li, Simpson, and Evans, 1949; Li, 1949) described a procedure for the preparation of FSH in a highly purified form from sheep pituitary tissue.

40|$|In 1927 Aschheim and Zondek {{announced}} their {{discovery of a}} gonadotrophic substance in the urine of pregnant women; and based on this finding they established their well known test for pregnancy.

They maintained that conclusive demonstration {{of the presence of}} this substance, which they termed prolan, demanded the production of reactions II and/or III.

40|$|The {{observation}} that a permanently diabetic condition may be induced in dogs {{by a short}} period of treatment with <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extract</b> [Young, 1937] has been generally confirmed [Campbell and Best, 1938; Houssay and Biasotti, 1938; Dohan and Lukens, 1939; Loubatił=e`, 1939 a, b]. Subsequently it was found that changes in the islets of Langer-hans of the pancreas were demonstrable in those animals in which a permanently diabetic condition had thus been established [Richardson and Young, 1938; Campbell and Best, 1938; Dohan and Lukens, 1939]. In the present paper, which is concerned with investigations {{on the nature of the}} metabolism of these diabetic dogs, the term `pituitary-diabetes' will be used to describe the permanently diabetic condition established by such {{a short period of}} pituitary treatment, but it must be stressed that there is no intention to imply by the use of this expression that the diabetic condition is one associated with a continued over-activity of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. On the contrary, evidence will be adduced that this condition is not associated with any obvious change in the pituitary function of the diabetic animal. It is necessary, however, to use a term which will clearly distinguish the diabetic condition induced in dogs by pancreatectomy, on the one hand, and by a short treatment with <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extract,</b> on the other. The terms 'pancreatic-diabetes ' and 'pituitary-diabetes ' are clearly the most suitable for this purpose, if the particular meanings here attached to them are clear and explicit.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{arterial}} disease associated with diabetes mellitus has loomed {{larger and larger}} ever since the discovery of insulin. However, experimental study of this problem has been thwarted {{by the fact that}} dogs and cats, in which experimental diabetes can be readily produced by several methods, are notoriously resistant to the development of arterial disease. On the other hand, although experimental arterial diseases of various types can be produced very easily in rabbits, this species cannot be rendered permanently diabetic by <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extracts</b> and its pancreatic tissue, like that of other rodents, has an anatomical distribution such as to render total pancreatectomy an operation of extreme technical difficulty. Thus, prior to the recognition of the diabetogenie properties of alloxan, it was not feasible to study experimentally the effects of diabetes in the one mammalian species that appeared most likely to respond to such a metabolic disturbance with the development of some form of arterial disease.

40|$|SUMMARY. -Teratomas {{have been}} induced in Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix Japonica) by intra-testicular {{injections}} of 3 % zinc chloride solution {{during a period}} of testicular growth artificially stimulated by increased photoperiod. These tumours resemble those previously induced by similar methods in domes-tic fowl and have histological features in common with spontaneous testicular teratomas in man. TESTICULAR teratomas were first produced experimentally by Michalowsky (1926, 1928, 1929), when he injected zinc salts into the testes of roosters as a method of partial castration. Later, the salts of other transition elements, copper (Falin and Anissimowa, 1940), and cadmium (Guthrie, 1964 b), were shown to have similar carcinogenic effects. These tumours could only be induced by the intratesticular injection of metallic salt solutions during the spring period of gonadal growth (in northern latitudes, January to March inclusive), although Bagg (1936), was able to induce a teratoma out of season by using mammalian <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extract.</b> It has been established that photoperiod influences gonadal activit...|$|E
40|$|Prolonged {{administration}} of certain anterior pituitary extracts to animals results {{in at least}} two processes requiring nitrogen, [...] growth and lactation.

As a result of single injections of <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extract,</b> Teel and Watkins (4) observed a fall in the blood non-protein nitrogen of dogs. Teel and Cushing (5) also refer to experiments carried out in collaboration with Dr. Walter Bauer, in which it was found that anterior pituitary extracts administered to dogs which were consuming a constant diet caused a marked retention of nitrogen.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of multiple forms of rat prolactin with different molecular weights (size heterogeneity) was studied with <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extracts,</b> purified rat prolactin and 125 I-labelled rat prolactin. In each case, three main {{forms of the}} hormone were detected by gel filtration on Sephadex G- 100 : a major one (80 [...] 90 %) corresponding to monomeric prolactin (mol. wt. 22000 [...] 25000), a peak (8 [...] 20 %) {{that could be a}} dimer (mol. wt. 45000 [...] 50000) and a small quantity (1 [...] 5 %) of a component of much greater molecular weight. On freezing and thawing of 125 I-labelled rat prolactin, there was little interconversion of monomer and 'dimer' peaks, but both were converted substantially to very high-molecular-weight material. All three peaks of 125 I-labelled rat prolactin could be precipitated by anti-(rat prolactin) serum and all three gave similar patterns of radioactive peptides after digestion with chymotrypsin followed by high-voltage paper electrophoresis. On sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, the monomer peak of 125 I-labelled prolactin migrated as a single component of mol. wt. 22000, the very high-molecular-weight peak largely dissociated to a component running in the same position as the monomer, and the 'dimer' peak migrated partly as a component of mol. wt. 45000 and partly as a component migrating with monomeric prolactin. No treatment was found that could dissociate the 'dimer' peak completely to monomeric prolactin...|$|R

In dry and milking cows which produced less than 30 kg/day, the percentages of cows which produced more than 3 transferable embryos were 28. 2 % (22 / 78) of the cows that had less than 130 mg/dl of T-CHO, and 52. 5 % (21 / 40) of those that had 130 mg/dl and over (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Regulated endocrine-specific protein, 18 -kDa (RESP 18), was {{previously}} cloned from rat neurointermediate pituitary {{based on its}} coordinate regulation with proopiomelanocortin and neuroendocrine specificity. RESP 18 has no homology to any known protein. Although RESP 18 is translocated across microsomal membranes after in vitro translation, AtT- 20 pituitary tumor cells, which endogenously synthesize RESP 18, do not release it into the culture medium. In this work, immunostaining and subcellular fractionation have identified RESP 18 as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein. Biosynthetic labeling and temperature block studies of AtT- 20 cells demonstrated the localization of RESP 18 to the ER lumen by a unique mechanism, degradation by proteolysis in a post-ER pre-Golgi compartment. Proteases in this compartment were saturated by exogenous RESP 18 overexpression in AtT- 20 cells. Furthermore, a calpain protease inhibitor enhanced secretion of RESP 18 from AtT- 20 cells overexpressing RESP 18. Saturation and inhibition of the RESP 18 degrading proteases allowed RESP 18 to enter secretory granules and acquire a post-translational modification, likely O-glycosylation; this modified 21 -kDa RESP 18 isoform was the only RESP 18 secreted. Rat <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extracts</b> contain 18 -kDa and O-glycosylated RESP 18 with similar properties. Exogenous RESP 18 expression in hEK- 293 cells demonstrated ER localization and RESP 18 metabolism similar to AtT- 20 cells, indicating that the cellular machinery involved in localizing RESP 18 is not specific to neuroendocrine cells.

At post-hypophysectomy intervals of 18 - 59 days no 131 I was concentrated in the thyroid. An <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extract</b> ('Preglandol', Hoffmann-La Roche) in daily doses of 0 =. ml. given for 2 or 3 days, restored {{the activity of the}} thyroid.

One or two daily injections of 2 =. mg. cortisone, administered simultaneously with Pre-glandol or thyrotrophin, prevented this activation of the thyroid. It is concluded that the effect of cortisone is due to a direct inhibition of the thyroid, and not to interference with the production of thyrotrophic hormone.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the pancreas, from various types of dogs, to correct {{diabetic}} hyperglycemia has been studied (Table XI). The pancreas from one animal was united by a vascular union with the neck blood vessels of another dog which had been pancreatectomized for 20 hours. The time necessary to reduce the blood sugar level to 120 mg. per cent was determined. 1. Pancreas from 6 hypophysectomized dogs produced a normal insulin secretion, showing that an anterior pituitary hormone is not necessary for its production or maintenance. 2. In 14 of 17 normal dogs given <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extract</b> for 3 or more consecutive days and presenting diabetes (fasting blood sugar 150 mg. per cent or more) the pancreas showed diminished insulin production. 3. In animals which remained diabetic after discontinuing the injections of hypophyseal extract, the pancreas islands were markedly pathologic and the insulin secretion was practically nil. 4. When hyperglycemia existed on the 2 nd to 5 th day but fell later, the insulin secretion of 5 dogs was normal in 2, supernormal in 1, and less than normal in 2. Histologic examination showed a restoration of beta cells. 5. In 14 dogs resistant to the diabetogenic action of <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extract,</b> as shown by little or no change in blood sugar, the pancreatic secretion of insulin was normal in 6 cases, supernormal in 3, and subnormal in 5 cases. Clear signs of hyperfunction of B cells were observed. In 6 resistant animals a high blood sugar (150 mg. per cent) appeared shortly before transplanting, but insulin secretion was normal in 4, supernormal in 1, and subnormal in 1 case. 6. With one injection of extract and 1 day of hyperglycemia {{the capacity of the}} pancreas to secrete insulin was not altered. 7. A high blood sugar level lasting 4 days does not alter the islets. The hypophyseal extract acts, therefore, by some other mechanism. In normal dogs, the continuous intravenous infusion of glucose for 4 days maintained the blood sugar at levels as high as those after pituitary extract. In these animals the B cells were hyperplastic and insulin secretion normal. 8. Anterior hypophyseal hyperglycemia is due at first to extrapancreatic factors which are the most important, and last only during the injections of extracts. Pancreatic factors appear afterwards and are responsible for permanent diabetes. Hypophyseal extract produces histological changes in many tissues and damages the Langerhans islands. The coexistent high blood sugar probably exhausts the B cells and exaggerates their injury. 9. In all cases there is a relation between the cytology of the islet B cells and the insulin secreting capacity...|$|E
40|$|Enzymatically {{dispersed}} bovine hypothalamic or {{cortical tissue}} was maintained in {{culture in the}} presence of 3 H-labeled amino acids. After such incubation, extracts of cells and of media contained 3 H-labeled products that were specifically bound by immobilized affinity-purified antisera to corticotropin (ACTH) and β-endorphin. The majority of these products eluted in the void volume (V 0) upon Sephadex G- 50 gel filtration; minor 3 H-labeled products eluted in the regions of the ovine β-lipotropin marker and in fractions having apparent molecular weights of approximately 12, 000 and 3800. Sequential use of these immobilized antisera revealed that most of the V 0 material contained both ACTH and β-endorphin antigenic determinants within the same molecule(s), whereas retarded material contained only one of the determinants. When this V 0 material was rerun on a Sephadex G- 75 column, it coeluted with the 31 -kilodalton precursor of both ACTH and β-endorphin obtained from a bovine <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extract.</b> Thus, the high molecular weight immunoreactive ACTH/β-endorphin-like 3 H-labeled product(s) derived from the hypothalamic culture is similar to the pituitary-derived precursor in containing the dual antigenic determinants and in its gel filtration characteristics.

The BAM- 12 P antibodies recognize the COOH-terminal fragment of the peptide from Arg 7 to Glu 12 and do not crossreact with [Met 5]- or [Leu 5]enkephalin or any of their COOH-terminal lysine or arginine extended analogs. Specificity for the COOH-terminal Glu-OH is suggested by the 100 % crossreactivity with BAM- 12 P 5 - 12 and 0. 3 % crossreactivity with BAM- 12 P 5 - 12 amide. Using these antibodies, we have measured three forms of BAM- 12 P-like immunoreactivity in extracts of bovine adrenal medulla, of which the major form (greater than 90 %) corresponds to BAM- 12 P by molecular weight. Extracts of bovine adrenal cortex contain 1 % the amount of a BAM- 12 P-like material (Mr approximately 1400; 20 ng per gland), possibly due to crosscontamination with adrenomedullary tissue. The major form of BAM- 12 P-like material in extracts of bovine neurointermediate pituitaries is of higher molecular weight than authentic BAM- 12 P (Mr approximately 4000); the remaining material (10 %) corresponds to BAM- 12 P by molecular weight.

40|$|A {{departmental}} {{interest in}} the subject or experimental diabetes had been hitherto somewhat discouraged by the usual obstacles. A surgical approach to the problem was known to be impractical in small laboratory animals, because it was technically difficult to excise sufficiently large proportions of the pancreatic tissue, and because the subsequent results were usually uncertain. Nor did the newer endocrine approach using anterior pituitary hermone completely solve the problem because it was known that the smaller laboratory animals such as the rabbit and the rat were refractory to its diabetogenic action. Consequently, when we used Alloxan and found that we could easily produce experimental diabetes in hooded rats, we were greatly stimulated by this ready success, and we decided to conduct many further investigations with this new and powerful diabetogenic agent.

Highly significant (P< 0 =. 01) linear dose-response relationships were observed in the ovulatory response to both 2 - and 3 -day treatments. Treatment for 3 days was significantly better than treatment for 2 days in the proportion of ewes ovulating (P< 0 =. 5),ovulation rates (P< 0 =. 01) and fertilization of eggs shed (P< 0 =. 01). For both 2 - and 3 -day treatments the ovarian responses varied with the time elapsing between the final hap injection and the onset of oestrus. Maximum responses were observed in ewes in oestrus 24 to 48 hr after the cessation of treatment.

The data were accumulated in the course of another investigation (1) in which it was shown that a growth-promoting extract of bovine anterior pituitary does not prevent the increase in gonad-stimulating content of the pituitary of the rat which occurs after castration (2, 3). It was felt that the data on the water content would throw additional light {{on the question of the}} composition of the tissues of rats and mice injected with <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>extract</b> as reported recently by several investigators (4 - 8), since these investigators in their analyses used the animals in toto without attempting, as indeed the magnitude of the task would forbid, to follow the changes in the separate parts and organs. In addition, it was thought that the data on the weight of the different organs and parts of the animals might yield some interesting information as to the early effects of an excess of anterior pituitary growthpromoting principle on the development of the young organism that is still rapidly growing. Inspection of the literature as to the effects of castration on the growth of the albino rat indicates that the castration of the animals of the early age here employed has not materially altered the results from what they would have been had non-castrates been used.

A previously proposed {{hypothesis that the}} glucokinase gene might be expressed in the pituitary corticotrophic cells was therefore reexamined using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques. No evidence was found that corticotrophs are glucokinase positive, and the identity of glucokinase-expressing cells remains to be determined. The findings do, however, suggest a novel hypothesis that a critical subgroup of <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> cells might function as glucose sensor cells and that direct fuel regulation of such cells may modify the classical indirect neuroendocrine pathways that are known to control hormone secretion from <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> cells. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Seven {{years ago}} a {{considerable}} impetus was given to research on the biology of the thyroid gland {{by the use of}} extracts from the anterior pituitary. Soon, however, confusion arose on account of the peculiar refractoriness which animals treated with thyro-stimulating pituitary extracts for long periods are liable to develop. Today the study of this refractory state has become a major issue in thyroid biology, as well as in endocrinology generally. Several investigators have shown that the initial hyperplasia of the thyroid gland produced in animals by the administration of the thyro-stimulating factor from the anterior pituitary may regress and involute to the colloid atrophic state, in spite of continued treatment. Similarly, the metabolic rate, after an initial rise to a maximum on the 7 th to the 14 th day, falls to normal or below. The mechanism whereby this regression in thyroid activity is brought about is unknown and the published observations and various explanations forwarded by different workers disagree to a very large extent. Some authors have suggested that the refractoriness {{may be the result of}} an exhaustion of the thyroid parenchyma. Others assume that specific neutralizing substances are formed and circulate in the blood of the refractory animals. CoUip and Anderson (1) have advanced the so called antihormone theory. According to their view, there may be an antagonistic principle for each hormone which is not the result of an antigen-antibody response but is a true hormone in every way. Collip (2) has lately declared that possibly the antihormone theory should be applied only to the trophic (pituitary) principles. He admits that theoretically a resistant state may be due to a variety of causes, but he stresses the point that the condition is transferable, i. e. through serum injections into test animals.

40|$|Rabbits {{injected}} subcutaneously with alkaline extracts of bovine, hog, {{or human}} <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> glands develop a markedhyperlipemia within 12 to 24 hours, {{as has been}} shown recently by Rudman and Seidman (1). During the course of experiments here reported which were designed {{to learn more about the}} pathogenesis of this hyperlipemia, it was found that injection of the <b>pituitary</b> <b>extracts</b> was regularly accompanied by a striking inhibition of the lipemiaclearing activity that normally occurs in the plasma following the intravenous injection of heparin (2). Moreover, relatively small amounts of serum from rabbits given <b>pituitary</b> <b>extracts</b> were capable of retarding or abolishing completely the ability of postheparin plasma obtained from normal animals to clear lipid emulsions. The inhibition of clearing paralleled closely the severity of the hypexlipemia and in a number of instances preceded the onset of hyperlipemia, the findings suggesting a possible causal connection between the two phenomena.

40|$|The media (secreted isoforms) {{and tissue}} {{extracts}} (intracellular isoforms) from ovine and bovine pituitaries perifused in vitro were chromatofocused {{to examine the}} pattern of LH isoforms secreted. At slaughter, <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitaries</b> from castrated male cattle (n = 6) and sheep (n = 4) were collected, sectioned mid-sagitally, and weighed. One half was immediately frozen and used to assess intracellular isoforms of UI, The remaining half was sliced and perifused for 120 mm to allow attainment of a stable basal secretion rate and then stimulated with 5 X l 0 M LHRH. Effluent samples were collected and assayed for LH. Samples representing basal or LHRH induced secretion were pooled, dialyzed against water, and lyophiized. <b>Pituitary</b> <b>extracts</b> were desalted by flow dialysis against water, All samples were chromatofocused on pH 10. 5 - 7. 0 gradients, and concentrations of UI in eluant fractions were determined by RIA. Lii in <b>pituitary</b> <b>extracts</b> resolved into nine peaks, which were coded with letters beginning with the most basic isoform. Isoforms A, B, and C were nondetectable (bovine; p 0. 05). Isoforms F and G were proportionately higher (p 0, 05) for secreted and intracellular ovine samples but lower (p < 0. 01) in secreted bovine samples. Similar percentages of isoform Z were noted for basal (bovine) and LHRH-induced (bovine and ovine) perifusates compared to intracellular UI. Thus, the UI isoforms released from the ovine and bovine <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> generally reflected intracellular stores except that the Lii lsohormones secreted contained a reduced percentage of basic forms (A, B, and C) and an increased percentage of the most abundant forms (F and G).

We show here that in the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> of female sheep the somatotrope, gonadotrope, and lactotrope/thyrotrope cell populations each expressed vgf mRNA, but displayed a distinct profile of VGF immunoreactive peptides. ProVGF C-terminus and VGF 443 – 588 immunoreactivities were found in lactotropes and thyrotropes, often in a subcellular location restricted to the Golgi area and suggestive of rapid peptide (or proVGF) release upon biosynthesis, while high molecular weight bands consistent with proVGF were shown in <b>pituitary</b> <b>extracts.</b> Distinct seasonal changes were revealed, proVGF C-terminus immunoreactive cells being largely identified as lactotropes during the summer (83 · 7 ± 2 · 1...|$|R
