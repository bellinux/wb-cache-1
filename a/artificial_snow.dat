25|$|Arizona Snowbowl {{does not}} publish their revenue or make it public knowledge, {{which makes it}} hard to {{calculate}} its impact on the Flagstaff economy. The Snowbowl supports approximately 200 full-time jobs and $12.08 million in economic output for the city of Flagstaff. The main reason for Snowbowl uses <b>artificial</b> <b>snow</b> is to allow Flagstaff’s winter economy to flourish, even in dry seasons. This <b>artificial</b> <b>snow</b> allows Snowbowl to open earlier in the Winter season and stay open later into the Spring season.|$|E

25|$|It's a Wonderful Life won {{just the}} one Academy Award, in the Technical Achievement {{category}} for developing a new method of creating <b>artificial</b> <b>snow.</b> Before It's a Wonderful Life, fake movie snow was mostly made from cornflakes painted white. And it was so loud when stepped on that any snow-filled scenes with dialogue had to be re-dubbed afterwards. RKO studio's head of special effects, Russell Sherman, developed a new compound, utilizing water, soap flakes, foamite and sugar.|$|E

The growing use of snow guns in the Alps’ ski resorts is increasing and more often seen as a threat to the other uses of water in the mountains (agriculture, drinking water etc).

25|$|Small pumped-storage {{hydropower}} {{plants can}} be built on streams and within infrastructures, such as drinking water networks and <b>artificial</b> <b>snow</b> making infrastructures. Such plants provide distributed energy storage and distributed flexible electricity production and {{can contribute to the}} decentralized integration of intermittent renewable energy technologies, such as wind power and solar power. Reservoirs {{that can be used for}} small pumped-storage hydropower plants could include natural or artificial lakes, reservoirs within other structures such as irrigation, or unused portions of mines or underground military installations. In Switzerland one study suggested that the total installed capacity of small pumped-storage hydropower plants in 2011 could be increased by 3 to 9 times by providing adequate policy instruments.|$|E
25|$|Both {{northern}} and {{southern part of the}} voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt. Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with <b>artificial</b> <b>snow</b> generators. Szczyrk, Brenna, Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska. The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa - the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski). Along Odra river are interesting natural reserve and at summer places for swimming.|$|E

The examined sites included the stream being a receiver of sewage from the treatment plant, before the treatment plant and few kilometers downstream of the sewage discharge - at the water intake for <b>artificial</b> <b>snowing</b> of the largest ski station in the region. Twelve series of samples were collected over 36 hours period. Temperature, pH, electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured onsite, microbiological analyses included the numbers of mesophilic bacteria, fecal Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, chemical analyses determined the concentration of main ions. E. faecalis was not detected in this study, while the concentration of mesophilic bacteria and E. coli varied largely between sites and hours of sampling. The smallest content of microorganisms was observed before the treatment plant and significantly increased at the sewage discharge. It was found that the cycle of the sewage treatment plant operation affects microbial contamination of water both in the stream which receives effluent from the treatment plant and in the downstream part of the river...|$|R

40|$|After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, a MOSSFA (Marine Oil Snow Sedimentation and Flocculent Accumulation) event took place, {{transporting}} {{an estimated}} 14 % of total released {{oil to the}} sediment, and smothering parts of the benthic ecosystem. This microcosm study describes the effects of oiled <b>artificial</b> marine <b>snow</b> on benthic macroinvertebrates. Corophium volutator survival was reduced by 80 % in oil-contaminated snow. Hydrobia ulvae survival was reduced by 40 % in oil-contaminated snow, possibly due to consumption of oiled snow. Macoma balthica was sensitive to marine snow, addition of oil slightly decreased survival. This study reveals trait-dependent sensitivity to oil with or without marine snow. The main drivers for organismal response to marine snow and oil are motility, sensitivity to hypoxia and oil toxicity, and feeding habits. Adverse effects of MOSSFA events on benthos will have consequence for the benthic-pelagic habitat and food chain, and should receive more attention in oil spill management...|$|R

500|$|Third scale miniatures several {{meters in}} height {{were created to}} give the film the effect of realism, {{rather than relying on}} {{computer}} generated imagery (CGI). For the whaling station miniatures and life-sized sets, over 700 bags of <b>artificial</b> <b>snow</b> were used (roughly 15–20 tons). A 4.5-meter miniature of an icebreaker with working lights and a mechanical moving radar was created, costing almost $37,000 and taking 10 weeks to create. Visual effects producer Arthur Windus, claimed miniatures were beneficial in the filming process: [...] "With computer graphics, you need {{to spend a lot of}} time making it real. With a miniature, you shoot it and its there." [...] A scale 25-meter miniature of the whaling station was created in several months. It was designed so the model could be collapsed and then reconstructed, which proved beneficial for a six-second shot which required a re-shoot.|$|E

500|$|Two {{facilities}} were built west of Calgary, {{in the foothills}} of the Rocky Mountains. [...] The Canmore Nordic Centre was 90-percent funded by the Province of Alberta at a cost of $17.3 million. [...] Located near the community of Canmore it was built with the intention that it would become a year-round recreation destination for Albertans. The facility hosted cross-country skiing, biathlon and Nordic combined events. [...] Nakiska (Cree for [...] "to meet") was the most controversial facility built. The province paid the $25 million construction cost for the alpine skiing facility on Mount Allan, about an hour west of Calgary. It was initially criticized for the location's relative lack of snow, requiring <b>artificial</b> <b>snow</b> making machines to be installed, and for an initial lack of technical difficulty.
