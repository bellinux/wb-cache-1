CBO estimated that subsidies paid under the law in 2016 averaged $4,240 per person for 10 million individuals receiving them, roughly $42 billion. For scale, the subsidy for the employer market, {{in the form of}} exempting from taxation those health insurance premiums paid on behalf of employees by employers, was approximately $1,700 per person in 2016, or $266 billion total in the employer market.

25|$|The {{trend of}} rising income {{inequality}} is also apparent <b>after</b> <b>taxes</b> and transfers. A 2011 {{study by the}} CBO found that the top earning 1 percent of households increased their income by about 275% after federal taxes and income transfers over a period between 1979 and 2007, compared to a gain of just under 40% for the 60 percent {{in the middle of}} America's income distribution. U.S. federal tax and transfer policies are progressive and therefore substantially reduce income inequality measured <b>after</b> <b>taxes</b> and transfers. They became moderately less progressive between 1979 and 2007 but slightly more progressive measured between 1979 and 2011.

25|$|Income {{inequality}} in the United States has increased significantly since the 1970s after several decades of stability, meaning {{the share of}} the nation's income received by higher income households has increased. This trend is evident with income measured both before taxes (market income) as well as <b>after</b> <b>taxes</b> and transfer payments. Income inequality has fluctuated considerably since measurements began around 1915, moving in an arc between peaks in the 1920s and 2000s, with a 30-year period of relatively lower inequality between 1950–1980.|$|E

25|$|There is {{significant}} and ongoing debate {{as to the}} causes, economic effects, and solutions regarding income inequality. While before-tax income inequality is subject to market factors (e.g., globalization, trade policy, labor policy, and international competition), after-tax income inequality can be directly affected by tax and transfer policy. U.S. income inequality is comparable to other developed nations before taxes and transfers, but is among the worst <b>after</b> <b>taxes</b> and transfers. Income inequality may contribute to slower economic growth, reduced income mobility, higher levels of household debt, and greater risk of financial crises and deflation.|$|E
25|$|Measured for all households, U.S. income {{inequality}} {{is comparable to}} other developed countries before taxes and transfers, but is among the highest <b>after</b> <b>taxes</b> and transfers, meaning the U.S. shifts relatively less income from higher income households to lower income households.

25|$|The Gini {{coefficient}} summarizes {{income inequality}} {{in a single}} number {{and is one of}} the most commonly used measures of income inequality. It uses a scale from 0 to 1 – the higher the number the more inequality. Zero represents perfect equality (everyone having exactly the same income), and 1 represents perfect inequality (one person having all income). (Index scores are commonly multiplied by 100 to make them easier to understand.) Gini index ratings can be used to compare inequality within (by race, gender, employment) and between countries, before and <b>after</b> <b>taxes.</b> Different sources will often give different gini values for the same country or population measured. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau's official Gini coefficient for the United States was 47.6 in 2013, up from 45.4 in 1993, the earliest year for comparable data. By contrast, the OECD's Gini coefficient for income inequality in the United States is 37 in 2012 (including wages and other cash transfers), which is still the highest in the developed world, with the lowest being Denmark (24.3), Norway (25.6), and Sweden (25.9).|$|E

Eto'o made his debut for Anzhi on 27 August 2011 against Rostov when he came on as a substitute with 30 {{minutes left in the}} game, later scoring an equalizer in the 80th minute from a cross by Yuri Zhirkov. Eto'o scored the opening goal in an 5–3 defeat at home to CSKA Moscow leaving his side four points above Krasnodar with only two games left for qualification to the Championship Group. At the end of the 2012–13 Russian Premier League, Eto'o made it to the Top 33 players of the Season list as the #1 Right Striker. Anzhi's billionaire owner Suleiman Kerimov shocked the Russian football world by deciding in August 2013 to scale down the club's ambitions and drastically shrink its budget.

25|$|Based on The ACS-Zachry Preliminary Financial Plan (TTC-35 Development Agreement, Exhibit C) {{funding the}} TTC-35 Corridor awarded to ACS-Zachry showed that 22%(1) {{of the initial}} {{infrastructure}} costs were shown to be funded with equity provided by ACS-Zachry. The other 78% was to be provided by bank loans or bonds arranged by ACS-Zachry. Based on then-current federal regulations these bonds could have been tax-exempt. It was also noted in the financial plan that ACS-Zachry expected to have 12% return on investment for their equity partners. The 12% return was <b>after</b> <b>taxes,</b> {{which would have been}} approximately equivalent to 16% before taxes. The plan called for paying off the bank loans and the bonds prior to retiring the equity as shown in cash flow diagrams of the Preliminary Financial Plan (TTC-35 Development Agreement, Exhibit C). With usual bond financing there is a 3:1 ratio between total fees collected and value of capital infrastructure built. With TTC-35 the ratio was in the order of magnitude of 13:1. So while TTC-35 committed to construct $8 billion in infrastructure ACS-Zachry expected to collect $114 billion in toll revenues as shown in the preliminary plan. A report by the Texas State Auditor estimated the toll to be collected for TTC-35 to be $104 billion or more, confirming the order of magnitude of tolls collected.|$|E
