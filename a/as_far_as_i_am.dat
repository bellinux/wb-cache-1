500|$|The expedition's {{other main}} accomplishments {{included}} the first ascent of Mount Erebus, {{and the discovery}} of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole, reached on 16 January 1909 by Edgeworth David, Douglas Mawson, and Alistair Mackay. Shackleton returned to the United Kingdom as a hero, and soon afterwards published his expedition account, Heart of the Antarctic. Emily Shackleton later recorded: [...] "The only comment he made to me about not reaching the Pole was 'a live donkey is better than a dead lion, isn't it?' and I said 'Yes darling, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned'".|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} {{private secretary}} to the Prince of Wales, Sir Michael Peat, said in 2007 that the Prince [...] "...is always {{very careful to}} ensure he is not politically contentious or party political, and <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> aware even his most ardent critic has never suggested he is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since the war , Jews have {{occupied}} {{the villages of}} Maramureş and Bukovina, and gained the absolute majority in the towns and cities in Bessarabia. [...] It would be absurd to expect Jews to resign themselves {{in order to become}} a minority with certain rights and very many duties—after they have tasted the honey of power and conquered as many command positions as they have. Jews are currently fighting with all forces to maintain their positions, expecting a future offensive—and, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned, I understand their fight and admire their vitality, tenacity, genius.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{made all}} of his {{personal}} dispatches to London public (there was no Official Secrets Act at the time) in attempts to win public opinion over to his policy, writing on one dispatch: [...] "Not secret <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned". [...] At one point, Gordon suggested in a telegram to Gladstone that the notoriously corrupt Ottoman Sultan Abdul-Hamid II could be bribed into sending 3,000 Ottoman troops for the relief of Khartoum and if the British government was unwilling and/or unable to pay that amount, {{he was certain that}} either Pope Leo XIII or a group of American millionaires would be.|$|E
2500|$|On March 23, 2009, The Advocate interviewed Braun {{about her}} {{portrayal}} of Reese and the Reese and Bianca storyline. [...] "From {{my point of}} view, Reese is {{not in love with}} Zach and she never has been," [...] said Braun. [...] "As far as the kiss, any doubt she may have had about her relationship with Bianca dissolved immediately after it happened. It was a moment of needing a connection. It was not about being in love with Zach. She was drunk, upset, and it was unfortunate. It was a terrible mistake. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned, Reese has always been in love with Bianca." ...|$|E

2500|$|Morrison {{has stated}} that he was {{uncertain}} whether his Superman and the version featured in All Star Batman & Robin are the same due to the dramatic time {{differences between the two}} books: [...] "I don’t know if it would have worked. For me, I guess I do see it all taking place in the same world even though they seem like very different characters. Frank Miller is doing Batman {{at the beginning of his}} career and I am doing Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond All Star Batman. But it could be the same character <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned. That’s where they may have ended up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Merezkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov and Zlobin headed {{first for}} Minsk, then Vilno, staying in both cities to give {{newspaper}} interviews and public lectures. Speaking to a Vilno correspondent, Merezhkovsky commented:The {{whole question of}} Russia's existence as such — and it's non-existent at the moment, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned, — depends on Europe's recognizing at last {{the true nature of}} Bolshevism. Europe has to open its eyes to the fact that Bolshevism uses the Socialist banner only as a camouflage; that what it does in effect is defile high Socialist ideals; that it is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. ...There is not a trace in Russia at the moment of either Socialism or even the [...] dictatorship of proletariat; the only dictatorship that's there is that of the two people: Lenin and Trotsky.|$|E
2500|$|The {{redesign}} was criticised by {{some for}} having no specifically Welsh symbol (such as the Welsh Dragon), because the Royal Shield {{does not include}} a specifically Welsh symbol. Wrexham MP Ian Lucas, who was also campaigning to have the Welsh Dragon included on the Union Flag, called the omission [...] "disappointing", and stated {{that he would be}} writing to the Queen to request that the Royal Standard be changed to include Wales. The Royal Mint stated that [...] "the Shield of the Royal Arms is symbolic of the whole of the United Kingdom and as such, represents Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland." [...] Designer Dent stated [...] "I am a Welshman and proud of it, but I never thought about the fact we did not have a dragon or another representation of Wales on the design because <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned Wales is represented on the Royal Arms. This was never an issue for me." ...|$|E
