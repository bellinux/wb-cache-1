5|$|DiMaggio {{returned}} from injury on June 28 after missing 65 games. He hit four {{home runs in}} three games to help sweep Boston and extend the Yankees' league lead. Despite DiMaggio's return, the lineup remained plagued with injuries. After consulting with Stengel, Weiss obtained Johnny Mize from the Giants, but he was soon sidelined with a separated shoulder. Twelve games behind on the Fourth of July, the Red Sox steadily gained ground on the Yankees, and tied them by sweeping a two-game set at Fenway September 24 and 25, {{the first time the}} Yankees had not been in sole possession of first place since the third game of the season. The Red Sox took the lead the following day with a comeback win in <b>a</b> <b>makeup</b> game, as Stengel lost his temper at the umpire {{for the first time in}} Yankee uniform; although he was not ejected, he was fined by the league.|$|E

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Morgan Lawley, was released through Black's YouTube channel on July 18, 2011, and a behind-the-scenes video was uploaded the day after. The video opens with Black in a studio, finishing the song recording with a studio band; guitarist Kellen McGee, bassist Jeremy Steel, and keyboardist Jourdan Steel. The video intercuts {{scenes of the}} studio with footage of Black making TV appearances, walking on red carpets, driving around Hollywood and greeting fans.

5|$|One of {{the regular}} season games {{resulted}} in a tie, which is unusual in baseball given the provision in {{the rules of the game}} to play extra innings to determine a winner. The game between the Sydney Blue Sox and the Melbourne Aces at Blacktown Olympic Park was the second game of <b>a</b> <b>makeup</b> doubleheader as a result of rain earlier that weekend washing out two games, and so had been shortened to seven innings. A rain delay during the first game of the day forced the second game to a later start. Under a provision in the ABL rules that is modeled on the International Baseball Federation's tiebreaker rule, in any extra inning that starts within an hour of the curfew time for the game—a time set to allow the visiting team time to meet travel schedules to return home at the end of a series—each team starts with runners at first and second base with nobody out. In addition, no new inning may start within 15minutes of the curfew time. The game was scoreless at the end of the regulation seven innings, and was tied at 1–1 at the end of the eighth inning, which ended at the curfew time. Though the game was an official game, the result did not count towards the season standings.|$|E

25|$|Starting pitcher Max Scherzer joined an {{exclusive}} club of pitchers in a June 6 {{game against the}} Dodgers by striking out 11 batters through the first four innings of the game. The feat had only been accomplished by four other pitchers in major league history. Scherzer ultimately ended up with 14 strikeouts and zero earned runs through seven innings of a 2–1 Nationals victory. The Nationals dropped the last game of the series to Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers' ace, to finish 7–2 on their California roadtrip. Washington's Stephen Strasburg, who took the loss despite giving up just one earned run over seven innings and striking out eight Dodgers, tied Kerry Wood's record for most strikeouts in the first 1,000 innings of a starting pitcher's career at 1,166 during the game. Getting another start after a pair of poor outings, Ross bounced back in <b>a</b> <b>makeup</b> game against the Baltimore Orioles in interleague play at Nationals Park on June 8, pitching 7⅓ innings and allowing one earned run for the win and setting a new personal best for strikeouts in a game with 12.|$|E

In 1910, Kinkaid took his examinations for the rank of ensign but failed navigation. While his classmates were promoted in June 1910, Kinkaid remained a midshipman, pending the result of <b>a</b> <b>makeup</b> examination in December 1910. In July, he developed pleurisy and was hospitalized in New York, New York before being sent to Annapolis to recuperate. At the time his father {{was in charge of the}} Naval Engineering Experiment Station there, which allowed Kinkaid to stay with his parents while studying for his navigation examination.

Kinkaid passed his navigation examination on 7 December and was promoted to ensign on 14 February 1911, backdated to 6 June 1910. While still at Annapolis, Kinkaid met Helen Sherburne Ross (1892-1980), the daughter of a Philadelphia businessman.

In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. I'm not a rapper," [...] he says dismissively. I'm not talking about my scars or my battles. Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. I'll tell you this, Tim says.
