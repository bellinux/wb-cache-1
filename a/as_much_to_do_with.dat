The reasons for this have <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> financial considerations as with the psycho-social difficulty in choosing hospice. A 2009 study found that with proper case management hospice access could be liberalized without additional costs to insurers.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the first}} couple of years of his company, Goldfaden did not shy away from serious themes: his rained-out {{vaudeville}} in Botoşani had been Di Rekruten (The Recruits), playing with the theme of the press gangs working the streets of that town to conscript young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated Desolate Island by August von Kotzebue; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although Shmendrik and The Two Kuni-Lemls were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many serious Yiddish-language plays on Jewish themes, perhaps the most famous being Shulamith, also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly serious turn became possible because he had educated his audience. Nahma Sandrow suggests that it may have had equally <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the arrival in Romania, {{at the time of the}} Russo-Turkish War, of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated Russian language theater. Goldfaden's strong turn toward almost uniformly serious subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to Odessa.|$|E

The system, established in 2002, awards teachers and principals bonuses for improving student performance at Chattanooga's lowest performing schools. Two years after its implementation, {{a study published in}} The Tennessean showed that the percentage of third graders reading at or above grade level had increased from 53% to 74%. However, a report by the think tank Education Sector suggested that specific teacher training had at least <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the student improvement.|$|E

25|$|Social {{commentator}} Mike Davis {{pointed to}} the growing economic disparity in Los Angeles in the {{years leading up to}} the riots caused by corporate restructuring and government deregulation, with inner-city residents bearing the brunt of these changes. Such conditions engendered a widespread feeling of frustration and powerlessness in the urban populace, with the King verdicts eventually setting off their resentments in a violent expression of collective public protest. To Davis and other writers, the tensions witnessed between African-Americans and Korean-Americans during the unrest was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the economic competition forced on the two groups by wider market forces as with either cultural misunderstandings or blacks angered about the killing of Latasha Harlins.|$|E
25|$|Art {{therapists}} {{and other professionals}} use art-based assessments to evaluate emotional, cognitive, and developmental conditions. There are also many psychological assessments that utilize artmaking to analyze various types of mental functioning (Betts, 2005). Art {{therapists and}} other professionals are educated to administer and interpret these assessments, most of which rely on simple directives and a standardized array of art materials (Malchiodi 1998, 2003; Betts, 2005). The first drawing assessment for psychological purposes was created in 1906 by German psychiatrist Fritz Mohr (Malchiodi 1998). In 1926, researcher Florence Goodenough created a drawing test to measure the intelligence in children called the Draw–A–Man Test (Malchiodi 1998). The key to interpreting the Draw-A-Man Test was that the more details a child incorporated into the drawing, the MORE intelligent they were (Malchiodi, 1998). Goodenough and other researchers realized the test had just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> personality as it did intelligence (Malchiodi, 1998). Several other psychiatric art assessments were created in the 1940s, and have been used ever since (Malchiodi 1998).|$|E

[...] The relatively untried Continentals in Gates' army were routed, and suffered heavy casualties.

The victory added to his reputation, although the rout of the American rebels had <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the failings of Gates (whose rapid departure from the battlefield was widely noted) as it did the skill of Cornwallis.

500|$|Three of the Blacks' {{leaders had}} already been {{captured}} during {{the passage of the}} Act, although one later escaped, and a series of raids captured a total of 32 Blacks who were tried after the Act's passage in Reading. Four were sentenced to death for the killing of the gamekeeper's son, with the executions occurring on 15 June 1723. Trials for the others continued into 1724, and 7 more were captured and tried on 7 December. This marked the effective end of the Blacks as an organised group. At the time, it was thought that the Blacks were Jacobites, with Sir Robert Walpole encouraging these ideas to advance his own interests; the rationale for the Act has been described as [...] "at least <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the hysteria induced by Walpole...as with any need for new powers to fight deer-stealing".|$|E

First, Grigg carried out its mid-tempo beat. [...] "If you can slow a song down to mid-tempo, the girls are just gonna lose their minds," [...] Grigg told Time magazine in 2012. Svensson reflected that Hollander [...] "had {{an idea for a}} title that's like 'rock me' instead of ‘rock you,’ and the melody just came." [...] Co-producers Lukasz 'Dr. Luke' Gottwald and Henry 'Circut' Walter ended up with writing credits on the finished recording too — [...] "standard operating practice, now that the sound of a song has <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> its identity as its lyrics or melody," [...] according to Time magazine correspondent Douglas Wolk.|$|E
500|$|In 1926 Pankhurst {{joined the}} Conservative Party {{and two years}} later ran as a {{candidate}} for Parliament in Whitechapel and St George's. Her transformation from a fiery supporter of the ILP and window-smashing radical to an official Conservative Party member surprised many people. She replied succinctly: [...] "My war experience and my experience {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic have changed my views considerably." [...] Her biographers insist that the move was more complex; she was devoted to a programme of women's empowerment and anti-communism. Both the Liberal and Labour parties bore grudges for her work against them in the WSPU, and the Conservative Party had a victorious record after the war and a significant majority. Pankhurst's membership of the Conservative Party may have had <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> ensuring her aims of obtaining the vote for women were achieved as with ideology.|$|E

The lack of communication between divisions was astounding and {{it got to the point}} where divisions would be building separate factories in China at the same time. These kind of inefficiencies cost Canon dearly and in certain instances it would cost the company twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something.
