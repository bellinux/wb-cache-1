5|$|A Kentucky {{governor}} is elected under our constitution {{for four years}} without legal opportunity, regardless of how acceptable his program has been, to put it before the public for approval or rejection. In practical application he must successfully run the legislative gauntlet during the first hurried ninety days he is in office {{if he is to}} adopt a program <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> administration worthy of history's harsh pen. The remaining general assembly two years hence is invariably plagued with vicissitudes common to 'lame duck' tenures.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to as}} the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.|$|E

5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real grape juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine grape juice allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real grape juice producers such as Welch Grape Juice Co. <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> advantage over other imitation grape flavored beverage producers. A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial grape drink that included neither real grape juice nor fruit from the grape.|$|E

5|$|DC often still draws {{criticism}} {{for its use}} of stereotypes for LGBT characters. Firebrand, a superhero debuting in 1941, is thought {{by some to be}} an early example, with his pink or transparent costume. Writer Roy Thomas penned thought balloons that suggested Firebrand had been involved in a gay relationship with his sidekick and bodyguard Slugger Dunn, although these hints never moved beyond subtext. A more modern example is the violent vigilante superhero Midnighter. The Batman-like Midnighter was shown as being in a relationship with the Superman-like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority. Midnighter and Apollo are now married <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> adopted daughter– Midnighter has gone on to star in his own title. In 2006, DC Comics could still draw widespread media attention by announcing a new, lesbian incarnation of the well-known character Batwoman, even though openly lesbian minor characters such as Gotham City police officer Renee Montoya already existed in the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Golden and Amber grades {{typically}} have a milder flavour than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested {{earlier in the}} season tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden has to have 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.|$|E

5|$|Large swells {{produced}} by the storm resulted in about 1,000 lifeguard rescues in Orange County, California. High temperatures in southern California, exceeding 100°F (37.7°C) in places, and cool ocean temperatures led to an estimated 575,000 people going to beaches during the Labor Day weekend. One incident required 25 rescues as dozens of people were overwhelmed by 810ft (2.43m) waves. Officials in San Bernardino County advised residents to take precautions {{for the possibility of}} flooding as a result of moisture from the remnants of Howard. Following wildfires in 2003, foothills were highly susceptible to flooding. Residents were advised to have sandbags ready, ensure their emergency supplies were stocked <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> evacuation plan. Despite all the preparations undertaken, Howard did not produced any rainfall in California. The moisture also enhanced rainfall across portions of Arizona. This led to minor rainfall accumulations throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|Non-dental {{sources of}} pain often cause {{multiple}} teeth to hurt <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> epicenter that is either {{above or below}} the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, {{it is possible that}} dental treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment, or tooth extraction may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark {{is that there is no}} obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. Often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain.|$|E
5|$|The University of Texas Longhorns {{began the}} 1995 college {{football}} season after winning eight games and losing four in 1994, {{a year that}} culminated with the Longhorns in a five-way tie for the Southwest Conference championship and with a 3531 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels in the 1994 Sun Bowl. Heading into the 1995 season, Texas was ranked 18th in both the coaches' and Associated Press preseason polls. In the Southwest Conference, which was scheduled to dissolve after the season, Texas was picked to finish second in the annual preseason poll of media covering the Southwest Conference. Texas A was predicted to win the conference. Overall, most commentators predicted Texas to improve on its 84 performance in 1994 <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> outside chance {{to compete in the}} top ranks, nationally.|$|E

5|$|The {{spore print}} is brown. Spores {{typically}} measure 8.0–9.0 by 4.0–5.5µm, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> ellipsoid to oblong to ovoid shape, {{depending on the}} viewing angle. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 24–40 by 7–12µm. The cheilochrysocystidia (found on the gill edge) are club-shaped, measuring 30–55 by 4–40µm, with a neck that is 2–5µm wide. Pleurochrysocystidia (on the gill face) are 40–60 by 5–18µm with a 2–4µm-wide neck. Clamp connections are abundant in all tissues of S.caerulea. The fungus produces acanthocytes, which are spiny cells produced on short branches on the mycelium.|$|E
5|$|The temple is {{enclosed}} in the cave, it has interior walls but no exterior wall. The pillars create {{the space and}} symmetric rhythm as they support the weight of hill above. The main mandapa recesses into a pillared vestibule (ardha-mandapa) on the south side, while a pillared portico (mukha-mandapa) connects it to the main entrance. Embedded within the Great Cave are dedicated shrines, the largest {{of which is the}} square plan Linga shrine (see 16 in plan). It is a square garbha-griya (womb house) with four entrances, located in the right section of the main hall. Steps lead from the four doorways into the sanctum, which has a linga in the mulavigraha style. Each doorway is guarded by a dvarapala on each side, for a total of eight dvarapalas, their heights spanning floor to the ceiling. These were badly damaged when the Portuguese ceded control of this region to the British. The linga shrine is surrounded by a mandapa and circumambulation path (pradakshina-patha) as in other Hindu temples. The pillars are similarly aligned east-west to this shrine, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> east entrance. Overlaid, as if fused, on the architecture of this temple is another open temple aligned to the north-south direction with three faced Sadashiva as its focal center. One features the abstract, unmanifest, aniconic symbol of Shiva, the other anthropomorphic, manifest, iconic symbol of Shiva. The mandapa pillars of the two align up.|$|E
