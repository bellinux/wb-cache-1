25|$|Dial-A-Song {{consisted}} of <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> with {{a tape of}} the band playing various songs. The machine played one track at a time, ranging from demos and uncompleted work to mock advertisements the band had created.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cassettes}} {{were made}} to play a continuous loop of tape without stopping. Lengths available are from around 30 seconds to a standard full length. They are used in situations where a short message or musical jingle is to be played, either continuously or whenever a device is triggered, or whenever continuous recording or playing is needed. Some include a sensing foil on the tape to allow tape players to re-cue. From as early as 1969 various patents have been issued, covering such uses as uni-directional, bi-directional, and compatibility with auto-shut-off and anti-tape-eating mechanisms. One variant has a half-width loop of tape for <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> outgoing message, and another half-width tape on spools to record incoming messages.|$|E
500|$|... "Shake It Off" [...] {{is a song}} {{performed}} by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, taken from her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). It was written and produced by Carey along with Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, and Johntá Austin. The song was initially solicited to radio on July 12, 2005 by Island and Mercury Records as the album's third single in the United States, while [...] "Get Your Number" [...] served as the album's third single elsewhere. Described by Dupri as [...] "ghetto," [...] the track is a R song that makes use of pop and hip hop influences and a simple, sparse production. Lyrically, the song follows Carey as she moves on from her relationship with an unfaithful lover, packing her things and breaking up with him over <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E

500|$|George {{decides to}} call Carol, but gets her {{answering}} machine. He leaves her an extremely long, obnoxious message, and {{is concerned that}} she will think he is an idiot. Jerry's friend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) tells George how something similar happened to her brother-in-law, {{who took care of}} the problem by secretly switching the tape. Jerry advises George to wait a few days for Carol to call back; George agrees, but continues to leave increasingly angry — and eventually almost hostile — messages on her machine. When he discovers she was out of town, he decides to go through with the plan of changing the tape. Frustrated by his inability to use <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine,</b> George convinces Jerry to go with him. They decide to wait for Carol outside her apartment, and George will distract her while Jerry changes the tape. They succeed, but, just as they are about to leave Carol's apartment, she tells George that she had already heard the messages and found them funny, adding that she [...] "loves jokes like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Pippa Trench (née Croker) (Janine Duvitski) – Patrick's wife sought {{friendly}} {{relations with}} the Meldrews and, after a while, became good friends with Margaret. The two women usually attempt to get the men {{to make peace with}} each other at least once per series. Eventually Patrick proposes that the Trenches move house, but they soon realise that the Meldrew curse has followed them: Victor sent workmen to their home, thinking they were removal men who had initially come to the wrong house. They were in fact from a house clearance firm Margaret had employed to clear her late cousin Ursula's country mansion. The workmen consequently cleared Patrick and Pippa's house of their entire furniture and sold it for a mere four hundred and seventy five pounds. Pippa is slightly dim-witted (once described by Victor as a [...] "gormless twerp" [...] on <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> message, unaware she was listening)for example, believing Victor had murdered an elderly blind man simply because the victim had been found clutching a double-one domino in his hand, and Victor had two pimples on his nose.|$|E
500|$|It took Levi {{approximately}} {{one year to}} record all of his dialogue {{due in part to}} his busy schedule. Levi recorded once every six weeks for six hours at a time, recording each of his lines at least twice. The actor's voice ultimately helped shape and develop Flynn's character. Howard explained, [...] "He's so smart and clever, and his adlibs are so great, and you like him straight away ... he brings that to Flynn." [...] On Levi's own influence on his character, the actor explained that Flynn's [...] "voice was really just a slight variation of [...] own". Wanting to sound [...] "more appropriate" [...] for the film's medieval setting, Levi [...] "cleaned up [...] own diction and made things a little bit more polished", referring to Flynn's accent as Mid-Atlantic. Describing Tangled as a [...] "very family friendly" [...] version of Romancing the Stone (1984), Levi studied and channelled the film's star, American actor Michael Douglas, and English legend Robin Hood. However, when Levi heard his performance in its entirety for the first time after the film's release, the actor admitted that he was ultimately dissatisfied with his performance, explaining, [...] "I felt like I sounded incredibly nasally and I was plugged up," [...] likening the experience to hearing one's voice played back on <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{present the}} results of a field trial in which <b>a</b> visual <b>answer</b> <b>machine,</b> the BubbleBoard, was {{deployed}} in five households. The aims of the trial were to create <b>an</b> improved <b>answer</b> <b>machine,</b> but also, and more interestingly, to encourage family members to appropriate it through the inclusion of open and playful design elements. Through making aspects of audio messages visible, BubbleBoard offered a number of improvements over existing <b>answer</b> <b>machines.</b> However, the new affordances associated with this were not appropriated by family members in the ways we had expected. We discuss possible reasons for this, and conclude that attempting to encourage appropriation through „openness ‟ in design may not be sufficient in the face of well-established social practices...|$|R

2500|$|At one point, Linnell {{broke his}} wrist in a biking accident, and Flansburgh's {{apartment}} was burgled, stopping them from performing for a time. During this hiatus, they began recording their songs onto <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine,</b> and then advertising {{the phone number}} in local newspapers such as The Village Voice, using the moniker [...] "Dial-A-Song".

2500|$|Interested {{in making}} {{something}} totally {{different from his}} Cajmere moniker and other work, Curtis created Relief as an offshoot to his Cajual records in 1993. The first Relief release was also his first Green Velvet production, 1993's [...] "Velvet Tracks," [...] which came from a name {{given to him by}} a girlfriend's father, emerged as the flamboyant, neon-haired electro punk, although in interviews he denied being linked to the Punk lifestyle and fashion, as he was more inspired by the likes of David Bowie and Sly and the Family Stone, he created mid-1990s hits such as [...] "Preacher Man," [...] on which a Moral Majority-type of preacher spoke (the Reverend Trotter, not, contrary to popular belief, Reverend Franklin); [...] "Answering Machine," [...] a darkly funny house track consisting of taped messages from <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine,</b> including a bad news message from a girlfriend and a noise complaint message from his landlord—all made with Jones's voice; and [...] "Flash," [...] which was a #1 US dance hit in 1995 and was included on many DJ-mixed compilation albums. After DJing under both of his now infamous monikers, he released his first album, Constant Chaos, with Belgian Music label Music Man in 1999, which showed Green Velvet's style of house progress into styles similar to Prince and Kraftwerk, his spoken-word monologues also took a bizarre turn. In Abduction he spoke about little green men turning up while washing dishes.|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{with the}} 1974 model year, Rockford {{would get a}} new model-year Pontiac Firebird each year {{throughout}} the series. [...] The Firebirds used had an identical [...] "copper mist" [...] color with the Esprit's exterior and interior. [...] Although the Firebirds were badged as Esprits, they were actually the higher performance [...] "Formula" [...] model without the twin scoop hood. [...] Garner needed Rockford's car {{to look like the}} lower tiered [...] "Esprit" [...] model, a car Rockford could afford, but have the performance necessary for the chase sequences in the show. [...] To achieve this, the show featured Pontiac Firebird Formula's re-badged and re-hooded to look like the [...] "Esprit" [...] model. [...] The [...] "Formula" [...] model was developed to provide the performance of the top level [...] "Trans Am" [...] in a less ostentatious form. Formulas didn't have the Shaker hood scoop, side vents, graphics or lettering used on the Trans Am, but they had the same higher horsepower engines and drive trains, larger front and rear anti-roll bars, stiffer springs and shocks, and a twin scoop hood. (Sharp-eyed car connoisseurs can spot the twin exhausts and rear anti-roll bar on the cars used on the show, options that were not part of the [...] "Esprit" [...] package, as well as spot the different model year cars used in various chase scenes that differed from those in an actual episode, especially in later seasons). Although the series ran until early 1980, no Firebird was used past the 1978 model year as Garner reportedly was displeased with the restyled front end of the 1979 and later Firebird models and as such did not wish them featured on the show (although <b>an</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> message in one episode in the final season indicated his car was 1979 Firebird).|$|E
