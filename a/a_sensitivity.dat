5|$|Congenital malformation, {{hereditary}} disorders, {{and acquired}} conditions can affect cerebellar structure and, consequently, cerebellar function. Unless the causative condition is reversible, {{the only possible}} treatment is to help people live with their problems. Visualization of the fetal cerebellum by ultrasound scan at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy {{can be used to}} screen for fetal neural tube defects with <b>a</b> <b>sensitivity</b> rate of up to 99%.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests can}} show {{a combination of}} results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has <b>a</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Rodents have {{sensitive}} olfactory abilities, {{which have}} been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. The Gambian pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with <b>a</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines. Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be trained to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.|$|E
50|$|Until 1983, Week Ending {{was taken}} off the air during {{election}} campaigns. <b>As</b> <b>sensitivities</b> eased, it was allowed to remain on air during the 1987, 1992 and 1997 elections, albeit with rigid levels of political balance.|$|R

5|$|The {{available}} {{laboratory tests}} for influenza continue to improve. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains an up-to-date summary of available laboratory tests. According to the CDC, rapid diagnostic tests have <b>a</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 50–75% and specificity of 90–95% {{when compared with}} viral culture. These tests may be especially useful during the influenza season (prevalence=25%) but {{in the absence of}} a local outbreak, or peri-influenza season (prevalence=10%).|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland is performed if the diagnosis is suspected; this has <b>a</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of over 90% for detecting pituitary apoplexy; it may demonstrate infarction (tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply) or hemorrhage. Different MRI sequences {{can be used to}} establish when the apoplexy occurred, and the predominant form of damage (hemorrhage or infarction). If MRI is not suitable (e.g. due to claustrophobia or the presence of metal-containing implants), a computed tomography (CT) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary gland, although it is less reliable. Many pituitary tumors (25%) are found to have areas of hemorrhagic infarction on MRI scans, but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the mirror flaw on {{scientific}} observations depended on the particular observation—the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through <b>a</b> <b>sensitivity</b> loss. However, the loss of light to the large, out of focus halo severely reduced {{the usefulness of the}} telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant that nearly all of the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects. NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a white elephant. For instance, in the 1991 comedy , Hubble was pictured with the Lusitania, the Hindenburg, and the Edsel. Nonetheless, during {{the first three years of}} the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets. The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution.|$|E
50|$|The {{glass tube}} of a mercury relay must be mounted near-vertically. Their {{sensitivity}} {{can be adjusted}} by adjusting their angle relative to vertical. <b>As</b> <b>sensitivity</b> depends upon angle, they are unsuitable for use on mobile equipment or with conditions of high vibration.|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{sensitivity}} and spatial resolution are closely related. A good spatial resolution (low FWHM) {{comes at the}} expense of <b>a</b> loss in <b>sensitivity,</b> and vice versa. Normally, when the aim is to locate lesions after injection of a low amount of a diagnostic radionuclide, <b>a</b> low <b>sensitivity</b> is undesirable. In the case of a 177 Lu-octreotate treatment, where there same requirements to minimise the injected amount does not exists, the level of activity is much higher and <b>a</b> high <b>sensitivity</b> is thus less crucial. An intraoperative gamma detector with a good spatial resolution, and <b>a</b> lower <b>sensitivity,</b> is therefore preferable for determination of 177 Lu activity concentration in vivo.|$|R

5|$|The {{specificity}} of RSTs {{for the presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, the presence of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The sensitivity of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has <b>a</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher sensitivity of 94%.|$|E

25|$|It was {{recently}} demonstrated that continuous Doppler enables the auscultation of valvular movements and {{blood flow sounds}} that are undetected during cardiac examination with a stethoscope in adults.

Moreover, Doppler auscultation was superior in the detection of impaired ventricular relaxation.

Likewise fragility is defined as <b>a</b> concave <b>sensitivity</b> to stressors, leading to <b>a</b> negative <b>sensitivity</b> to increase in volatility.
