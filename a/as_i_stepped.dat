Idaho, Utah State, Colorado State, and Murray State were some of his other potential Division I destinations.

As soon as he arrived at EKU, he became close with the school. Oppong said, [...] "From the first day, I was accepted, as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> on campus. I was here in the summertime and there were a few guys here who I knew and as soon as we came in August, I felt like I was part of the family." [...] Head coach Jeff Neubauer commented on him, [...] "We think Papa Oppong will be a tough match-up for our opponents because he is a shooter, rebounder and slasher." ...|$|E

She commented: [...] "I missed playing Kat," [...] she said. [...] "Now it feels like I've come home. I was nervous at first because I thought I might have forgotten how to play her, but as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> back onto the Square {{she came back to}} me. Even when I was out of the show, people called me Kat every day in the street. I was flattered and now I'm having a great time. The recent scripts have been brilliant." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> back, to my amazement, Sally, excusing {{herself to}} the scowling Wright, hurriedly joined me.|$|E
60|$|The {{sight that}} met my eyes <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out upon a small ledge which ran before the {{entrance}} of the cave filled me with consternation.|$|E

"I never {{enter the}} door of a house to which I have been summoned," [...] she said to me one evening, [...] "without wondering, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>step</b> over the threshold, what the story is going to be. I always feel inside a sick-room <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> were behind the scenes of life. The people come and go about you, and you listen to them talking and laughing, and you look into your patient's eyes, and you just know that it's all a play." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted the}} stick <b>as</b> he spoke. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> up and {{snatched}} {{it out of}} his hand.|$|R
60|$|He {{handed it}} to me, and I tore it open <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> on to the pavement. It was written from Feltham Court, Norfolk, and dated the {{previous}} day.|$|E
60|$|Yvonne's adieu {{was cold}} and formal--so cold and formal {{that it seemed to}} rob the {{sunshine}} of its glory for me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out into the open air.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} it right enough," [...] ses Joe, {{getting a bit}} closer to me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> outside the gate. [...] "Here’s your fifteen bob; {{are you going to}} give me that watch and chain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lenore, good-by {{for this}} time. Think of me, {{but not as}} lonely or [...] unhappy or uncomfortable {{out there in the}} cold, raw, black, wet [...] night. I will be neither.

At the last moment, even <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>stepping</b> into a taxicab, I turned back. I went instead to the desk and boldly asked {{for the number of}} your suite. I want that taste removed, please." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> aboard her, Thuvan Dihn {{took his}} place beside me. I cast a look of {{questioning}} surprise upon him. He turned to the highest of his own officers who had accompanied him to Kaol.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> {{a sudden}} {{moisture}} struck my stockinged feet. Its nature I knew by instinct upon the instant, and filled by {{it with a}} sudden unreasoning terror, I dashed with a loud cry from the room.|$|E
60|$|She was comforted {{long before}} I left her. But <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> {{out into the}} street again a man accosted me. Evidently he had been on the watch, {{awaiting}} me. He fell into step beside me almost before I realized his presence. It was Escovedo.|$|E

60|$|The {{difference}} between a great mind's and a little mind's use of history is this. The latter would consider, for instance, what Luther did, taught, or sanctioned: the former, what Luther,--a Luther,--would now do, teach, and sanction. This thought occurred to me at midnight, Tuesday, the 16th of March, 1824, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>stepping</b> into bed,--my eye having glanced on Luther's Table Talk.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> felt <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> had <b>stepped</b> on {{the place}} where the last stair ought to have been, but wasn't. I felt defiant, if you know what I mean, and there didn't seem {{anything}} to defy.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a pretty}} group in a pretty setting, and I thrilled with {{professional}} pride <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> back for a final, knowing squint at it all. Then I went to my camera, slipped in the plate, gave them due warning and took off the cap.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} that Lakor quickly unslung a belt from his harness, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> back to parry a wicked thrust he lashed one end of it about my left ankle so that it wound there for an instant, while he jerked {{suddenly}} upon the other end, throwing me heavily upon my back.|$|E
60|$|So thick is my {{head that}} I would have gone {{directly}} toward him, thinking only to tell of Saul's disappearance and ask his advice concerning what we had best do; but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> forward Pierre clutched me firmly by the arm, {{and at the same}} instant I saw a warning look in Morgan's eyes as he recognized us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, gentlemen?" [...] I {{asked in}} a tone of persiflage, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> took a <b>step</b> towards them. [...] "Have you naught to say to me, now that I have {{answered}} your imperious summons? What! All dumb?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Oakhurst. Yes. (Aside.) It {{was such}} a night <b>as</b> this <b>I</b> first <b>stepped</b> into Sandy's place, I first met the old man. Well, it will be soon over. (Aloud.) You have the papers and {{transfers}} all ready? ...|$|R
40|$|From the Editor: I {{would like}} to first take a minute to thank Dr. Herbert Sherman of Long Island University for 6 {{excellent}} years of service as Editor of the journal. His selfless service and professionalism were greatly appreciated and his presence is already missed. I think that all involved with NEJE over the years enjoyed their time with Herb at the helm, as he was a true pro at the journal game. With that being said, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>step</b> into the lead role, {{it should be noted}} that we are now soliciting applications and/or nominations for a new Editor at the journal. Additionally, we will be filling some other vacant positions, including that of Book Editor. If you are interested, or know of anyone interested, please let us know. You can email me directly at shuartj@sacredheart. edu. On to the issue itself, I believe we have four very intriguing and varied research articles for you...|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> on {{the deck}} I could not help a slight feeling of triumph, as I caught sight of my sailor-like {{features}} reflected in a tar-barrel that stood beside the mast, while a little later I could scarcely repress a sense of gratification as I noticed them reflected again in a bucket of bilge water.|$|E
60|$|But {{nothing in}} my manner, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out of the {{carriage}} under {{the porch of the}} house which loomed dark and massive out of the surrounding gloom, betrayed anything of what I felt. Outwardly I was just a worthy bourgeois, an interpreter by profession, and delighted at the remunerative work so opportunely put in my way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, sir, I {{was but a}} sojourner at Cape Girádeau. Though, {{now that}} you mention a snuff-colored surtout, I think I met such a man as you speak of {{stepping}} ashore <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> aboard, and 'pears to me I have seen him somewhere before. Looks like a very mild Christian sort of person, I should say. Do you know him, respected sir?" ...|$|E
50|$|Hieroglyphic Stairway 2 is {{the riser}} of the {{uppermost}} step approaching Structure 33. It consists of 13 sculptured blocks, numbered {{from left to}} right <b>as</b> <b>Steps</b> <b>I</b> to XIII. <b>Steps</b> VI, VII and XVIII are extremely well preserved and depict Bird Jaguar IV and two of his predecessors dressed as ball players.|$|R
60|$|Noon had but struck from Nôtre Dame, next day, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{mounted the}} <b>steps</b> of the Hôtel de Luynes. My swagger, and that brave suit of pearl grey velvet with its silver lace, bore me unchallenged past the {{gorgeous}} suisse, who stood, majestic, in the doorway.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked up}} from my work. Through the camera of my jealously guarded window I could {{catch a glimpse of}} the vivid, quivering blue of the sky, the {{glittering}} intensity of the ocean, the long motionless leaves of the horse-chestnut in the road,--all utterly inconsistent with anything as active <b>as</b> this lamentation. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> to the open door and into the silent hall.|$|R
