40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} the {{technological}} {{foundations of the}} current Blogosphere. The review is primarily based on a large-scale evaluation of <b>active</b> <b>blogs.</b> The extensive list of examined technologies enables commenting {{on a range of}} widely adopted standards and potential trends in the Blogosphere. The evaluation has been conducted in the following stages: 1. Retrieving and parsing a large set of blogs 2. Identifying and quantifying the use of technologies such as web standards, adopted services, file formats and platforms. 3. Analysing collected data and reporting the results 4. Comparing the results with existing findings from the generic Web to identify similarities and differences in the Blogosphere. The presented work was performed as part of BlogForever (ICT No. 269963), an EC funded research project aiming to aggregate, preserve, manage and disseminate blogs. The results of this study are relevant within the context weblog preservation and weblog data extractio...|$|R
40|$|With an {{increasing}} number of people that read, write and comment on blogs, the blogosphere has established itself as an essential medium of communication. A fun-damental characteristic of the blogging activity is that bloggers often link to each other. The succession of linking behavior determines the way in which informa-tion propagates in the blogosphere, forming cascades. Analyzing cascades can be useful in various applica-tions, such as providing insight of public opinion on various topics and developing better cascade models. This paper presents the results of an excessive study on cascading behavior in the blogosphere. Our objective is to present trends on the degree of engagement and reaction of bloggers in stories that become available in blogs under various parameters and constraints. To this end, we analyze cascades that are attributed to differ-ent population groups constrained by factors of gender, age, and continent. We also analyze how cascades dif-ferentiate depending on their subject. Our analysis is performed on one of the largest available datasets, in-cluding 30 M <b>active</b> <b>blogs</b> and 700 M posts. The study reveals large variations in the properties of cascades...|$|R
40|$|The {{blogosphere}} {{provides a}} novel window into public opinion, but its dynamic nature {{makes it an}} elusive medium to analyze and interpret in the aggregate, where it is most informative. We are developing new technology employing ontologies {{to solve this problem}} by fusing the signals of the blogosphere and zeroing in on issues that are most likely to migrate offline, enabling analysts to anticipate the threats or opportunities they represent. There are nearly 16 million <b>active</b> <b>blogs</b> on the Internet with more launched every day. Although much of what’s discussed in the blogosphere is of little consequence, increasingly, blogs are emerging as powerful organizing mechanisms, giving momentum to ideas that shape public opinion and influence behavior. For example, Malaysian bloggers have recently become quite effective in confronting perceived corruption in their national government despite governmental control of the major media [4]. The blogosphere is thus a great bellwether of changing attitudes and new schools of thought, but only if analysts know which issues to pay attention to and how to identify those issues early in their lifecycle...|$|R
