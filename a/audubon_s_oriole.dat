For this Summer Report, observers are encouraged to report high counts on their BBS routes, as well as nesting data such as egg and fledging dates. Finally, this report includes a few observations from 1996. In general, this was a rather routine summer period. The only real rarity was, however, a good one, a 1 st state record Curlew Sandpiper. other unusual reports were an easterly Pacific Loon, a flock of 42 Clark’s Nutcrackers, a lost Prairie Warbler in the Sandhills, and a reported but undocumented Scott 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Oriole.</b> Species {{at the edges of}} their ranges were Chuck-will 2 ̆ 7 s-widow near Kearney, Purple Martin at Bassett, and Brown Creeper in Cass Co.

40|$|This {{summer was}} a 2 ̆ 2 {{something}} for everyone 2 ̆ 2 season. Ecologists, already excited by the apparent ability of Greater Prairie-Chickens to lek in improbable habitats, such as corn fields and dirt edges of Rainwater Basin playas, will welcome the use by Lark Buntings and Vesper Sparrows of wheat stubble fields with a growing corn crop. The Vesper Sparrows of the east, a different subspecies {{from those in the}} north and west, have been at the mercy of full-tillage cropping systems, but now have a reprieve and may even be increasing because of no-till and minimum tillage methods currently in vogue due to high fuel prices and conservation benefits. White-faced Ibis again nested in several places, and Red-shouldered Hawk is showing signs of expanding from its limited range at Fontenelle Forest. Very exciting was the confirmation of breeding {{for the first time in}} Nebraska of Ash-throated Flycatcher, only the second record of the species 2 ̆ 7 occurrence in the state. Hopefully confirmation is soon to follow for Broad-tailed Hummingbird, which has now twice been reported during the breeding season. A phenomenon that may be applicable to those early migrant passerines that appear well before local breeders seem to have finished breeding and have even contemplated migration, is molt-migration. A recent article in Birding ([URL] discusses this strategy for such species as Dusky Flycatcher, Warbling Vireo, Western Tanager, Lazuli Bunting, and Bullock 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Oriole,</b> which is probably best known for its early departure from breeding areas for an intermediate staging area where it molts, and then continues to its wintering grounds. The possibility was raised by Ted Floyd that Chipping Sparrow might be in this group as well. Unfortunately, other than the existence of many such rather early fall records for various species in areas where breeding does not occur, Nebraska has little data to support or contradict this idea. Observers should continue to report obvious indications of early fall movement (flocking, appearance out of breeding habitat, disappearance of adults) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{spring of}} 2001 {{will likely be}} remembered as the winter that wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t end, {{especially}} in central and western Nebraska. The last remnants of roadside snowbanks remained in the east until 10 April, but the last blizzard closed down the Panhandle on 21 - 22 April, and the last appreciable snowfall there was on 19 May. None of these dates represent late records, but are remarkably later than average for the past 10 - 15 years, and seemed especially burdensome following the long cold winter and the remarkably early spring the previous year. While I recognize the danger inherent in making generalizations when working with such a small sample size, I feel it worthwhile to comment on differences and similarities between the timing of the 2000 and 2001 nesting seasons. While only a few species allowed direct comparison by being found nesting again in the same location as last year, the following information is offered for what it 2 ̆ 7 s worth. It would have been interesting to compare data on more of the cavity nesters, but unfortunately, I did not locate any active nuthatch nests this year, nor take the time to search out more of the other cavity nesters. In the southern Panhandle, Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s, Western and Eastern Kingbirds, Bluegray Gnatcatcher, Bullock 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Oriole</b> (and Red-winged Blackbird in the east), all appeared to be 2 - 3 weeks later in their breeding cycle than last year. By contrast, also in the Panhandle, Great Blue Heron, Great Homed Owl, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 s Woodpecker, Western Wood-Pewee, Lark Sparrow, and McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur seemed {{to be on the same}} schedule as last year, as were American Crow, Common Grackle, and House Finch in the east. While it seems intuitive that some species would respond to the late spring by nesting later, why didn 2 ̆ 7 t some other species? How much of the difference in timing was actually due to the weather, and how much was due to the randomness of the small sample size or other variables? Obviously, it will take more years of data collection and a much larger sample size, one that includes all species, before generalizations can be made. Witnessing a blizzard disrupt breeding by Pinyon Jays and Canada Geese makes the reason for those delays pretty apparent. But what about kingbirds and gnatcatchers that were not even present yet? Were they later because of delayed plant growth and insect development? More study and many more records are needed before we can speak with certainty...|$|R
40|$|This season, {{partly due}} to the {{departure}} of my co-writer Joel Jorgensen and {{partly due to}} mental aging, I have shortened the species accounts by including only data that add to our current knowledge base. I will not routinely list early and late dates and peak counts for each species unless they are significant; readers should refer to past issues of NBR for guidelines as to what are early or late dates and high counts. Observers are, however, urged to report early and late dates and high counts of all migrant species; {{it is difficult to know}} if a sighting is significant until all the reports are pooled in my computer. In general, most observers thought this a fairly routine fall, although the Panhandle continued to be a source of significant new information, thanks to consistent coverage by Steven Dinsmore. Similar coverage of the Rainwater Basin by Joel Jorgensen also has enhanced our knowledge considerably. Every report is valuable: very few of the large list of observers fail to have at least one of their sightings included in the report. There were no new species added to the state list this fall, but this year was amazing in that respect, with 7 new species (some awaiting approval by the Records Committee) bringing the total state list to a very respectable 441 species. Rarest this fall was the pair of Black-bellied Whistling-Ducks in the Rainwater Basin, a second documented state record. Also very rare were a 7 th state record White-winged Dove and 8 th state record Lesser Goldfinch. Other interesting finds included a Brant of the western race, 3 Pomarine Jaegers, the first documented central Nebraska Blue-headed Vireo, a Mountain Chickadee, a Varied Thrush, another report of Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, the first Bullock 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Oriole</b> for fall east of the Panhandle, and a White-winged Crossbill. Some rather amazing counts were made: 35, 000 Western Grebes (considered conservative by the experienced observer!), a total of about 300 Great Egrets, 6000 and 4200 Blue-winged Teal, 1492 Ruddy Ducks (no estimating there!), 12, 000 Cliff Swallows, 16 Nelson 2 ̆ 7 s Sharp-tailed Sparrows, and good numbers of Purple Finches for a change. Interesting range expansions were noted for Carolina Wren, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, and Chipping Sparrow, while the continued presence of Pileated Woodpeckers at Fontenelle Forest adds to the uniqueness of that area in terms of species which breed there and nowhere else that we know about: Red-shouldered Hawk and Yellow-throated Warbler are others.

The event was {{attended}} by more than 100 scientists, who heard 29 speakers and participated in strategy discussions during the 2 -day meeting. The main focus of the conference was {{the present and future}} impact of West Nile virus on wildlife populations. Talks and discussions emphasized how basic research, public health, and land management can contribute {{to our understanding of the}} disease’s impact and spread. A primary objective of this meeting was to develop future research priorities from both basic and applied perspectives. The conference centered around four main themes: 1) host, vector, and pathogen interactions (disease ecology); 2) vertebrate behavior and ecology; 3) vector behavior and ecology; and 4) modeling and spatial statistics. We describe some of the findings from the meeting.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources, Wildlife, 2006 The Western Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus) is {{a federally}} listed {{threatened}} species {{as well as}} a state listed ???species of special concern??? in California. Accurate survival estimates are required to determine the best conservation strategies for threatened and endangered species. The population located in Humboldt County, CA was studied for five breeding seasons (2001 - 2005) and apparent survival for adult and juvenile plovers was estimated using program MARK. In addition, the population structure over this time period was described to determine the importance of immigration. The growth rate of the population was also estimated using the Pradel model and site specific birth and death rates to quantify the importance of immigration. Apparent survival for adult males (?? = 0. 64) was greater than that for adult females (?? = 0. 57) while apparent survival for adults was greater than that for juveniles (?? = 0. 30). The estimated annual growth rate using Pradel models demonstrated a stable population (?? = 0. 99); however, this included both local recruitment and immigration as sources of new individuals. When calculated algebraically, based on estimates of local recruitment and survival, the growth rate demonstrated a declining population (?? = 0. 71), clearly indicating the importance of immigration to the persistence of the population. Source/sink dynamics probably occur in the spatially disjunct populations of Snowy Plovers along the Pacific coast due to differences in habitat quality. However, the Humboldt County population should not be defined as a sink population across all breeding sites. At a smaller scale, sites along gravel bars of the Eel River were closely approaching the recruitment requirements to be classified as source areas whereas beach breeding sites were sink areas. Continued management activities, especially those that were designed to increase productivity (e. g. exclosures) are recommended. Because productivity is a major problem for plovers in this area and due to the success observed in Oregon, population control of predators should be considered. Increased management, such as curtailing the access of off-road vehicles along the more productive gravel bar areas during the breeding season is also recommended. Funding for the project was made possible by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and California Department of Fish and Game???s Oil Spill Response Trust Fund through the Oiled Wildlife Care Network at the Wildlife Health Center, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis as well as California Department of Parks and Recreation, Humboldt State University, MRBR Inc., Redwood Region <b>Audubon</b> Society, U. <b>S.</b> Bureau of Land Management, Humboldt County and the Wildlife Society...|$|R
40|$|The California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus; {{hereafter}} “condor”; Fig. 1) {{has long}} been symbolic of avian conservation in the United States. Its large size, inquisitiveness, and association with remote places make it highly charismatic, and its decline {{to the brink of}} extinction aroused a continuing public interest in its plight. By 1982, only 22 individuals remained of this species whose range once encompassed much of North America. The last wild bird was trapped and brought into captivity in 1987, which rendered the species extinct in the wild (Snyder and Snyder 1989). In the 1980 s, some questioned whether viable populations could ever again exist in the natural environment, and whether limited conservation funds should be expended on what they viewed as a hopeless cause (Pitelka 1981). Nevertheless, since that low point, a captive-breeding and release program has increased the total population by an order of magnitude, and condors fly free again in California, Arizona, Utah, and Baja California, Mexico (Fig. 2). At this writing (summer 2009), more than 350 condors exist, 180 of which are in the wild (J. Grantham pers. comm.). The free-living birds face severe challenges, however, and receive constant human assistance. The intensive management applied to the free-living populations, as well as the ongoing monitoring and captive-breeding programs, are tremendously expensive and become more so as the population grows. Thus, the program has reached a crossroads, caught between the financial and logistical pressures required to maintain an increasing number of condors in the wild and the environmental problems that preclude establishment of naturally sustainable, free-ranging populations. Recognizing this dilemma, in November 2006, Audubon California requested that the American Ornithologists’ Union (AOU) convene an independent panel to evaluate the California Condor Recovery Program. The National Audubon Society (NAS) and the AOU {{have a long history of}} interest and involvement in condor recovery. The NAS helped fund Carl Koford’s pioneering studies of condor biology in the 1940 s (Koford 1953). A previous panel jointly appointed by the NAS and AOU examined the plight of the condor in the late 1970 s, and their report (Ricklefs 1978) laid the groundwork for the current conservation program. The NAS was a full partner with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in the early days of the program, from 1980 through 1988. Ricklefs (1978) recommended that the program “be reviewed periodically by an impartial panel of scientists,” and this was done annually by an AOU committee for several years after the release of the report, but the condor program has not been formally and thoroughly reviewed since the mid- 1980 <b>s.</b> <b>Audubon</b> California believed that the recovery program was operating with a recovery plan (USFWS 1996) widely acknowledged to be outdated, and that issues that were impeding progress toward recovery needed outside evaluation in order for the USFWS, which administers the program, and other policy makers to make the best decisions about the direction of the program (G. Chisholm pers. comm.). Such an evaluation would also help funding organizations better invest in the program...|$|R
