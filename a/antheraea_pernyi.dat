As an example, the wild silkworm cocoon provides multiple protective functions against environmental and physical hazards, promoting the survival chance of moth pupae that resides inside. In the present investigation, the microstructure and thermal {{property of the}} Chinese tussah silkworm (<b>Antheraea</b> <b>pernyi)</b> cocoon in both warm and cold environments under windy conditions have been studied by experimental and numerical methods.

After infection with Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, <b>Antheraea</b> <b>pernyi</b> nuclear polyhedrosis virus (ApNPV) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively, the pupae showed different gene expression levels in the different tissues examined (midgut, fatbody, epidermis, testis, and hemocytes).

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} study, <b>Antheraea</b> <b>pernyi</b> silk fibroin (Ap-SF) is {{employed}} {{to regulate the}} mineralization of hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanocrystals. Calcium phosphate crystals precipitate in the aqueous solution of regenerated Ap-SF at pH 7. 4 and room temperature. The samples are charaterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on the XRD results, the inorganic phase in the mineralized Ap-SF composites is HAp as small particles with low crystallinity. The FTIR analysis reveals that the HAp crystals are carbonate-substituted HAp and compounded with Ap-SF. The TEM images show mineralized nanofibrils in the composites as rod-like shapes 4 – 5 nm in diameter. Electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of selected areas of the composites exhibit polycrystalline rings that are ascribed to HAp. SEM images show mineralized Ap-SF composites with several mineralized rods 49 – 74 nm in diameter. KEY WORDS: <b>Antheraea</b> <b>pernyi</b> silk fibroin, hydroxyapatite, nanocomposite...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Antheraea</b> <b>pernyi</b> silk fibroin (ASF) {{solution}} was prepared by dissolving <b>Antheraea</b> <b>pernyi</b> silk fiber in lithium thiocyanate solution. The ASF/ 1, 4 -butanediol (ASF/BDO) blend porous materials were prepared with freeze-drying method. The structure of ASF was {{investigated by the}} X-ray diffraction method. The result showed that the structure of regenerated ASF scaffold was α-helix and random coil conformation. After ASF mixed with 5 wt % BDO, the structure of ASF was changed to β-sheet and the ASF scaffolds became water-insoluble. There were some small pores and fibrous structure in the big pores and the surface of pores was rough with a great many raised particles. The scaffolds with the average pore size of 300 - 1000 µm and the porosity of 82 - 92 % can efficiently be produced in this paper.

40|$|Silk fibroin (SF) hydrogels were {{obtained}} from both domestic (Bombyx mori) and wild (<b>Antheraea</b> <b>pernyi)</b> silkworms from aqueous silk fibroin solutions at room temperature. The gelation time of the <b>Antheraea</b> <b>pernyi</b> (A. pernyi) SF solution was significantly shorter {{than that of the}} Bombyx mori (B. mori) SF solution. The secondary structures of the two kinds of hydrogels were also compared. In order to further reduce the gelation time, various amounts of polyethylene glycol (PEG) were blended with the silk fibroins of A. pernyi and B. mori. The gelation time of both A. pernyi SF and B. mori SF decreased with the increased amount of PEG. After freeze-drying, the hydrogels were characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy.

40|$|Natural {{silk protein}} {{nanoparticles}} are a promising biomaterial for drug delivery {{due to their}} pleiotropic properties, including biocompatibility, high bioavailability, and biodegradability. Chinese oak tasar <b>Antheraea</b> <b>pernyi</b> silk fibroin (ApF) nanoparticles are easily obtained using cations as reagents under mild conditions. The mild conditions are potentially advantageous for the encapsulation of sensitive drugs and therapeutic molecules. In the present study, silk fibroin protein nanoparticles are loaded with differently-charged small-molecule drugs, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, ibuprofen, and ibuprofen-Na, by simple absorption based on electrostatic interactions. The structure, morphology and biocompatibility of the silk nanoparticles in vitro are investigated. In vitro release of the drugs from the nanoparticles depends on charge-charge interactions between the drugs and the nanoparticles. The release behavior of the compounds from the nanoparticles demonstrates that positively-charged molecules are released in a more prolonged or sustained manner. Cell viability studies with L 929 demonstrated that the ApF nanoparticles significantly promoted cell growth.

40|$|Larvae of the Chinese oak silkmoth (<b>Antheraea</b> <b>pernyi)</b> {{are often}} {{affected}} by AVD (A. pernyi vomiting disease), whose causative agent {{has long been}} suspected to be a virus. In an unrelated project we discovered a novel positive sense single-stranded RNA virus that could reproduce AVD symptoms upon injection into healthy A. pernyi larvae. The genome of this virus is 10, 163 nucleotides long, has a natural poly-A tail, and contains a single, large open reading frame flanked at the 5 ' and 3 ' ends by untranslated regions containing putative structural elements for replication and translation of the virus genome. The open reading frame is predicted to encode a 3036 amino acid polyprotein with four viral structural proteins (VP 1 -VP 4) located in the N-terminal end and the non-structural proteins, including a helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and 3 C-protease, located in the C-terminal end of the polyprotein. Putative 3 C-protease and autolytic cleavage sites were identified for processing the polyprotein into functional units.

40|$|AbstractRegulation of {{the period}} (per) gene is a {{critical}} feature of circadian clock function in insects. Here, we show that per is sex-linked in the silkmoth, <b>Antheraea</b> <b>pernyi.</b> The previously described silkmoth per gene is found on the Z chromosome. Silkmoth per is not dosage compensated at either the RNA or the protein level. Although earlier studies showed {{the presence of an}} oscillating endogenous antisense per transcript, we show that this transcript comes from a locus on the female-specific W chromosome. We further demonstrate the presence of a homolog of per on W that encodes a truncated protein. Rhythmicity of male (ZZ) moths demonstrates that neither of the W-linked per-like genes is essential for clock function. The presence of a per allele with duplications on W provides insight into the evolution of the sex chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{fabricate}} <b>Antheraea</b> <b>pernyi</b> silk fibroin (ASF) microparticles using electrospinning under mild processing conditions. To improve processability of the ASF solution, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) was used to regulate viscosity of ASF solution for electrospinning. It was found that the blend of ASF with PEO could form a bead-on-string structure with well spherical particles. Furthermore, aqueous ethanol and ultrasonic treatments could disrupt the nanofibrillar string structure between particles and ultimately produced water-insoluble ASF particles with submicron scale. Cell viability studies indicated that the ASF microparticles were nontoxic to EA 926 cells. Moreover, fluorescent images based on FITC labeling showed that the ASF microparticles were easily uptaken by the cells. Aqueous-based electrospinning provides a potentially useful option for the fabrication of ASF microparticles based on this unique fibrous protein...|$|E

When expressed in transgenic Drosophila, the silkmoth PER protein is detected in the expected neural cell types, with diurnal changes in abundance that are similar to those observed in wild-type fruitflies. Behavioral analysis demonstrates that the silkmoth protein can serve as a molecular element of the Drosophila clock system; expression of the protein shortens circadian period in a dose-dependent manner and restores pacemaker functions to arrhythmic per 0 mutants.

A per antisense RNA oscillation was detected that is spatially restricted to PER-expressing cells, suggesting a novel mechanism of PER regulation. PER-positive neurons and their projections are strategically positioned for regulating prothoracicotropic hormone and eclosion hormone, two neurohormones under circadian control.
