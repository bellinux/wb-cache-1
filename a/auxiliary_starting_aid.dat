50|$|In all years, the Indy {{cars have}} {{utilized}} the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>starting</b> line {{located at the}} mid-point of the backstretch. This allows the entire field to properly assemble into the grid formation, and start the race heading towards the best passing zone on the circuit. The pace car will pull off into the pits as normal, and allow the pole position car to pace the field {{all the way to}} the backstretch. Since the start/finish line at the pit straight is immediately proceeded by the tight and slow carousel, it does not allow for optimum racing into the first turn. The finish line and all other scoring is done at the line on the pit straight. Over the years, restarts after caution periods were previously done at the pit straight, but as of 2017, they too were moved to the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>starting</b> line.|$|R

50|$|The {{prestige}} of the black <b>auxiliaries</b> <b>started</b> to decay in July 1794, after the massacre of Bayajá. This place had been a French possession (Fort Dauphin) until the Spaniards conquered it in January 1794. At that moment, the authorities of the village asked the Spaniards to not let Jean-François’ troops enter the place in the future, {{because they were afraid}} that the latter would massacre them, provided that most of its inhabitants were the former owners of Jean-François’ collaborators, and also that one of the officers that surrendered the city to Spain was the mulato Candy, Jean-François’ former subordinate that had deserted to the French camp.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Heavy Current)) [...] Cape Technikon, 1991 Linear {{induction}} motors {{are built}} for numerous applications. Their robustness, gearfree-link to the load {{and the fact}} that speed is not a function of the number of poles (as in round machines) are only a few advantages. As every single phase motor needs some <b>starting</b> <b>aid,</b> so does a linear induction drive. For round machines, capacitors or shaded poles are usually used. A capacitor can be damaged electrically, which is a rare occurrence for shading rings. A useful combination of these advantages is a linear induction motor which is gearless and uses the shaded pole principle as a <b>starting</b> <b>aid.</b> In order to simplify the designing process, a computer program (Fortran) was written. The main objective on the electrical side was to obtain low input power, high power factor and high efficiency. In order to find the performance curves, torque measurements were made. Although the principles of torque measurements are well known the device to measure torque for this machine was not available and had to be constructed...|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{in which}} a quasi-steady MPD {{thruster}} is driven by a large inductor demonstrate the feasibility of using inductive energy storage to couple an intermittent high power plasma thruster to a lower power steady state supply, such as a thermionic converter. Switching between inductor charging and MPD thrusting phases of the current cycle occurs smoothly, with the voltage spike generated during switching sufficient to initiate the arc discharge in the thruster without an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>starting</b> circuit. Further, the current waveforms delivered by the inductor are of a shape suitable for the quasi-steady thrusting process, and they agree with analytical estimates, indicating that {{the interaction between the}} thruster impedance and the inductive source is dynamically stable...|$|R

40|$|The first dental {{therapists}} (previously called dental <b>auxiliaries),</b> <b>started</b> {{their training}} in 1960 and, {{by the end}} of 1976, 792 women had qualified after a two-year course. In the present study the role of all dental therapists was investigated by means of a postal survey.

It was found that dental therapists, in terms of their working pattern and family profile, are typical of women of their age and level of qualification in Britain. The return to work by therapists, after a break from practice because of family commitments, will depend mainly on the availability of posts, particularly part-time posts. Dental therapists provide treatment predominantly for younger children. Compared with previous studies, a noticeable increase in the clinical preventive care provided by therapists was observed...|$|R
