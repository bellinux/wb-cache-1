5|$|In 1980, Pascu {{applied for}} Târgu Mureş' Szentgyörgyi István Drama School, but failed the entry exam. He {{worked in a}} {{state-owned}} factory as <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> operator, and for several months in 1980, was conscripted into the Romanian Land Forces, where he met other amateur musicians who were undergoing military training. Together they founded the rock band Fundal, with Pascu as lead singer and drummer. They performed in the nationwide Cântarea României festival.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Lee, the police arrested {{a friend of}} Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits. By Monday, the police had theorized that the murder occurred {{on the second floor}} (the same as Frank's office) based on hair found on <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> and what appeared to be blood on the ground of the second floor.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the action}} of the pole lathe and the skills {{required}} are similar to those employed on <b>a</b> modern power <b>lathe,</b> <b>a</b> requirement is that the timber used on <b>a</b> pole <b>lathe</b> is freshly felled and unseasoned, i.e., green. The angle that the tools are ground is closer to that of a carpenter's chisel than that of <b>a</b> power <b>lathe</b> tool. Using power <b>lathe</b> tools on <b>a</b> pole <b>lathe</b> is safe, but hard work. Using <b>a</b> pole <b>lathe</b> chisel on <b>a</b> power <b>lathe</b> risks serious injury, since the forces are such that the blade is likely to break.|$|R

5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E
5|$|Himalayan salt is Pakistan's {{best known}} rock salt. It {{is used for}} cooking, as bath salt, as brine and as a raw {{material}} for many industries, including a soda ash plant set up by AkzoNobel in 1940. Salt from Khewra mine {{is also used to}} make decorative items like lamps, vases, ashtrays and statues, which are exported to the United States, India and many European countries. The use of rock salt to make artistic and decorative items started during the Mughal era, when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it. Warth introduced the use of <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> to cut out art pieces from the rock salt, as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using <b>a</b> <b>lathe.</b> Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E

50|$|The lathe is {{so named}} because it {{produces}} {{the same type of}} object that <b>a</b> real <b>lathe</b> would produce: <b>an</b> object that is symmetrical about an axis of rotation. However, unlike objects produced by <b>a</b> real <b>lathe,</b> the object can have an axis of rotation through a hole (e.g. a torus).|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{geometric}} <b>lathe</b> {{was used}} for making ornamental patterns on the plates used in printing bank notes and postage stamps. It is sometimes called <b>a</b> guilloché <b>lathe.</b> It was developed early {{in the nineteenth century}} when efforts were introduced to combat forgery, and is an adaptation of <b>an</b> ornamental turning <b>lathe.</b> The lathe was able to generate intersecting and interlacing patterns of fine lines in various shapes, which were almost impossible to forge by hand-engraving. They were used by many national mints.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>lathe</b> is {{a machine}} tool which spins {{a block or}} {{cylinder}} of material so that when abrasive, cutting, or deformation tools are applied to the workpiece, it can be shaped to produce an object which has rotational symmetry about an axis of rotation. Examples of objects that can be produced on <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> include candlestick holders, crankshafts, camshafts, and bearing mounts.|$|E

25|$|Threads {{of metal}} {{fasteners}} are usually created on a thread rolling machine. They {{may also be}} cut with <b>a</b> <b>lathe,</b> tap or die. Rolled threads are stronger than cut threads, with increases of 10% to 20% in tensile strength and possibly more in fatigue resistance and wear resistance.|$|E
25|$|Center drill bits, {{occasionally}} {{known as}} Slocombe drill bits, {{are used in}} metalworking to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized drill bit or to make a conical indentation {{in the end of}} a workpiece in which to mount <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> center. In either use, the name seems appropriate, as the bit is either establishing the center of a hole or making a conical hole for <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> center. However, the true purpose of a center drill bit is the latter task, while the former task is best done with a spotting drill bit (as explained in detail below). Nevertheless, because of the frequent lumping together of both the terminology and the tool use, suppliers may call center drill bits combined-drill-and-countersinks {{in order to make it}} unambiguously clear what product is being ordered. They are numbered from 00 to 10 (smallest to largest).|$|E

25|$|During his childhood, {{he worked}} on the family farm and became acquainted with the Mayo people who also worked there.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>lathe</b> is an {{adjustable}} horizontal metal rail and a tool rest, between {{the material and}} the operator which accommodates the positioning of shaping tools. With wood, it is common practice to press and slide sandpaper against the still-spinning object after shaping it to smooth the surface. As {{the first of its}} kind, Thomas Blanchard of Middlebury, Connecticut, invented the profile lathe in 1818, intended for the mass duplication of woodworking.|$|E

25|$|The force {{accelerating}} a pinewood derby car is gravity; {{the opposing}} forces are friction and air drag. Therefore, car modifications {{are aimed at}} maximizing the potential energy in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track guide rail. Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel tread can be sanded or turned on <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly {{so that it does}} not contact the track and add to the rolling resistance. Axles are filed or turned on <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area. Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.|$|E
