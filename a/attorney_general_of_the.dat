5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival in Maryland, Carroll {{presented}} his commission to the colony's council and was recognized as the new <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony. He arrived in a place already riven by religious and class differences. Carroll and nearly the entire governing structure of the colony, {{with the exception of}} the lower house of the proprietary assembly, were appointed by Calvert. Most of the appointees were Catholic and wealthy, whereas the majority of the population and the lower house of the assembly were Protestant and less wealthy. Carroll arrived in Maryland just as long-standing economic, religious, and political tensions between the poorer Protestant majority and the wealthier and more powerful Catholic minority were reaching a head.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{men have}} {{resigned}} {{the office of}} governor {{before the end of}} their terms—John J. Crittenden, Beriah Magoffin, John W. Stevenson, Augustus O. Stanley, Happy Chandler, Earle C. Clements, and Wendell H. Ford. Six resigned to accept a higher office: Crittenden was appointed <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States and the other five were elected to the U.S. Senate. Only Beriah Magoffin resigned under duress. A Confederate sympathizer during the Civil War, Magoffin's power was entirely checked by a hostile, pro-Union legislature. With the state's government in gridlock, Magoffin agreed to resign in exchange for being able to name his successor. Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and the Speaker of the Senate, John F. Fisk, was not acceptable to Magoffin as a successor. Fisk resigned as Speaker, and the Senate elected Magoffin's choice, James Fisher Robinson as Speaker. Magoffin then resigned, Robinson was elevated to governor, and Fisk was re-elected as Speaker of the Senate.|$|E

5|$|The {{verdict was}} treated with scepticism by much of the {{international}} media and the U.S. government of President Jimmy Carter. On 2 February 1978, {{based on the evidence}} given at the inquest, the <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Cape stated that he would not prosecute the officers. After the inquest, Biko's family brought a civil case against the state; at the advice of their lawyers, they agreed to a settlement of R65,000 (US$78,000) in July 1979. Shortly after the inquest, the South African Medical and Dental Council initiated proceedings against the medical professionals who had been entrusted with Biko's care; eight years later two of the medics were found guilty of improper conduct. The failure of the government-employed doctors to diagnose or treat Biko's injuries has been frequently cited {{as an example of a}} repressive state influencing medical practitioners' decisions, and Biko's death as evidence of the need for doctors to serve the needs of patients before those of the state.|$|E
