5|$|There {{had been}} {{reported}} problems with smuggling around Hurst Castle since the 1670s, and these continued into the 18th century. In 1729, the Revenue service hired the Hurst, a wide, heavy yacht, to assist in anti-smuggling operations out of Southampton, arming its crew with muskets, pistols and swords. The problems persisted and, later in the century, the site was used as <b>a</b> <b>rendezvous</b> for smugglers led by a notorious criminal called John Streeter.|$|E

In October, he traveled to his uncle Lewis Breckinridge's home to wait for his father, but he never came. Disappointed, he returned to Princeton for the beginning of the new term, unaware that his father's recovery had been short-lived. Later he {{learned that his}} father had attempted to leave Cabell's Dale on October 22 but collapsed off his horse and returned to his sick bed; he died December 14, 1806.|$|E

Herold to guide Powell (who was unfamiliar with Washington) to the Seward house and then to <b>a</b> <b>rendezvous</b> with Booth in Maryland. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln with his single-shot Deringer, and then stab Grant, at Ford's Theatre. They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock.

5|$|The crew {{assignments}} for Gemini8 {{were announced}} on September 20, 1965, with Armstrong as Command Pilot and David Scott as Pilot. Scott {{was the first}} member of the third group of astronauts to receive a prime crew assignment. The mission launched on March 16, 1966; it was to be the most complex yet, with <b>a</b> <b>rendezvous</b> and docking with the unmanned Agena target vehicle, the second American extra-vehicular activity (EVA) by Scott. In total, the mission was planned to last 75 hours and 55 orbits. After the Agena lifted off at 10a.m. EST, the Titan II carrying Armstrong and Scott ignited at 11:41:02am EST, putting them into an orbit from where they would chase the Agena.|$|E
5|$|Brumfield {{arrived by}} {{helicopter}} {{on the morning}} of 8 November, just as A Company was preparing to depart from its night location at 08:00. With contact now seeming unlikely to the Australians, Healy was instructed to move to <b>a</b> <b>rendezvous</b> from which the battalion would be extracted back to Bien Hoa the following day. A Company subsequently set out on a compass bearing which would take them across the northern edge of the Gang Toi plateau. By 10:30 the Australians moved out in single file but had not gone far before a lone Viet Cong scout was observed shadowing them; he was subsequently shot and killed by the rear section. Crossing a creek line the Australians uncovered a company-sized camp of dugouts and trenches, before being fired upon at 15:40 by a single Viet Cong soldier who then fled. A Company halted briefly, and at this time two Viet Cong approached their position, before being killed by 1 Platoon.|$|E

5|$|Morgan did {{not stay}} long in Port Royal and in October 1668 sailed with ten ships and 800 men for Île-à-Vache, {{a small island}} he used as <b>a</b> <b>rendezvous</b> point. His plan was to attack the Spanish {{settlement}} of Cartagena de Indias, the richest and most important city on the Spanish Main. In December he was joined by a former Royal Navy frigate, Oxford, which {{had been sent to}} Port Royal to aid in any defence of Jamaica. Modyford sent the vessel to Morgan, who made it his flagship. On 2 January 1669 Morgan called a council of war for all his captains, which took place on Oxford. A spark in the ship's powder magazine destroyed the ship and over 200 of its crew. Morgan and the captains seated {{on one side of the}} table were blown into the water and survived; the four captains on the other side of the table were all killed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 April 1916, the 2nd BCS sailed again for the Skagerrak, this time to support efforts to disrupt the {{transport}} of Swedish ore to Germany. The planned destroyer sweep of the Kattegat was cancelled when word came that the High Seas Fleet was mobilising for an operation of their own (later learned to be timed {{to coincide with the}} Irish Easter Rising), and the British ships were ordered to <b>a</b> <b>rendezvous</b> point {{in the middle of the}} North Sea, while the rest of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern end of the Long Forties. On the afternoon of 22 April, the Battlecruiser Fleet was patrolling to the north-west of Horn Reefs when heavy fog came down. The ships were zigzagging to avoid submarine attack when Australia collided with sister ship New Zealand twice in three minutes. Australia was damaged badly enough to be put out of action for several months, but New Zealand returned to the fleet on 30 May, a day before the start of the Battle of Jutland, relieving Indefatigable as flagship.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day as the {{formation}} of the Anglo-French hunter groups, Admiral Graf Spee captured the steamer Newton Beech. Two days later, she encountered and sank the merchant ship Ashlea. On 8 October, the following day, she sank Newton Beech, which Langsdorff had been using to house prisoners. Newton Beech was too slow to keep up with Admiral Graf Spee, and so the prisoners were transferred to the cruiser. On 10 October, she captured the steamer Huntsman, the captain of which had not sent a distress signal until the last minute, as he had mistakenly identified Admiral Graf Spee as a French warship. Unable to accommodate the crew from Huntsman, Admiral Graf Spee sent the ship to <b>a</b> <b>rendezvous</b> location with a prize crew. On 15 October, Admiral Graf Spee rendezvoused with Altmark to refuel and transfer prisoners; the following morning, the prize Huntsman joined the two ships. The prisoners aboard Huntsman were transferred to Altmark and Langsdorff then sank Huntsman on the night of 17 October.|$|E

5|$|The International Zone {{served as}} {{the hub of the}} Games Village, {{offering}} retail and entertainment services as well as <b>a</b> <b>rendezvous</b> location for visitors and Games participants. Key facilities such as a bank, post office and general store were hosted there, alongside retail shops and entertainment facilities including a cinema and an Internet café. Live craft demonstrations, band performances and cultural programmes were also held at the Village. The Training Area, a zonal area by itself with an area of , provided training facilities entirely within the Games Village, in what {{has been described as a}} first in the history of the Commonwealth Games. There were facilities for four sports, including a track and field, wrestling and weightlifting training halls and an Olympic-size pool. A fully equipped gymnasium and fitness centre, steam and sauna facilities, physiotherapy rooms, as well as a leisure pool complemented the sport-specific facilities.|$|E
5|$|The first Space Shuttle {{flight to}} Mir was <b>a</b> <b>rendezvous</b> mission without docking on STS-63. This was {{followed}} {{during the course}} of the project by a total of 9 Shuttle-Mir docking missions, from STS-71 to STS-91. The Shuttle rotated crews and delivered supplies, and one mission, STS-74, carried a docking module and a pair of solar arrays to Mir. Various scientific experiments were also conducted, both on shuttle flights and long-term aboard the station. The project also saw the launch of two new modules, Spektr and Priroda, to Mir, which were used by American astronauts as living quarters and laboratories to conduct the majority of their science aboard the station. These missions allowed NASA and the Roskosmos to learn a great deal about how best to work with international partners in space and how to minimize the risks associated with assembling a large space station in orbit, as would have to be done with the ISS.|$|E
5|$|The {{message was}} {{repeated}} twice {{on the international}} 600m wavelength. The BdU later changed the order slightly and U-506, U-507 and the Italian submarine Capellini were dispatched. In parallel U-156 was assisting and supplying the survivors in the numerous lifeboats that kept arriving or were picked up. U-506 arrived at 11:32 on 14 September 1942, followed by U-507 in the afternoon of 15 September. Heading to <b>a</b> <b>rendezvous</b> with Vichy French ships under Red Cross banners, the U-boats were attacked by a U.S. Army B-24 Liberator bomber (343d Bomb Squadron; Lieutenant James D. Harden) at 12:32 on 16 September 1942. The attack ordered by Captain Robert C. Richardson III, which killed {{a number of people}} in the lifeboats and damaged U-156, forced Hartenstein to abandon the rescue operations. A majority of survivors were later rescued by British merchant ships and two Vichy French warships, the cruiser Gloire and the sloop Annamite, out of Dakar, Africa.|$|E
