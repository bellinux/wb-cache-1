5|$|With the Crimea {{identified}} as the target, Nolan and his fellow staff officers had to plan the assault, which eventually included 30,000 infantry, 1,240 cavalry and 54 guns, along with 24,000 French soldiers and 70 of their guns. The cavalry alone required 3,379 horses, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>such</b> {{a small number of}} ships available the Heavy Brigade would be part of a second wave – until it arrived, the Light Brigade would be relied on as the sole unit of cavalry. The force departed for the Crimea on 2 September 1854, and began landing at Kalamita Bay, 35 miles north of Sevastopol itself. Airey had the light cavalry engage in reconnaissance and screening {{while the rest of the}} force moved off the transports, and they were fully ashore by the 18th. On the 19th, they began marching to Sevastopol – still without the Heavy Brigade.|$|E

25|$|About this time, the Light Cavalry Brigade of Colonel Makwitz, had {{completed}} his manoeuvre from the left, reached the right flank, and was formed {{up in two}} lines: also the four Battalions that had been detached from the 6th Brigade (General Krafft's), arrived upon the right of Saint-Amand-la-Haye, and came into action. The battle on both sides on {{this part of the}} Field continued to rage with unabated violence <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>such</b> indefatigable ardour did the Prussians continue the struggle, that when the fire of their skirmishers was observed to slacken, from the men having expended their ammunition, the soldiers of the 11th Hussars rushed into the midst of them, and supplied them with such cartridges as they had of their own; an act of devotion to which many of them fell a sacrifice.|$|E

After reviewing the applicant for clemency, and a favorable vote from the majority, the board may empower the governor to make such acts of as he deems necessary.|$|E

25|$|The boat {{is first}} {{directly}} addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if Skíðblaðnir {{is the best}} of ships, what {{there is to know about}} it, and asks if there is no other ship as good or as large as it. High responds that while Skíðblaðnir is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact Naglfar, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship is big enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>such</b> craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that Skíðblaðnir sounds like a great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{skilled workers}} of {{carpenter}} are brought from Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shantou while the Javanese from Java island. Although the Javanese were also provided with board and lodging as the Chinese, {{they did not}} receive a good treatment as the latter is considered as skilled workers. Most of the Javanese are being sent to Brunei and Maeda-shima, while the upper classes Chinese immigrants worked in boat-building industry in Kuching and Elopura. Other local Chinese became inevitable targets of Japanese authorities, with any hostilities outbreak will be met with severe consequences. Many young Chinese males avoided from being captured as forced labour, while young Chinese females terrified from being taken as comfort women. Most coastal inhabitants fled to the interior or other coastal districts <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>such</b> persistent threats, some Chinese decided to formed and participate in a revolt with the indigenous people. In response to the Jesselton Revolt in October 1943, Japanese kenpeitai raid the Chau Kee Sundry Shop in Tenghilan of North Borneo to searching {{the members of the}} revolt where a proprietor was found in possession of a Nationalist Chinese flag and summarily executed. Another search for “Chinese agitators” on Mantanani Islands in February 1944 led to the mass killing of 60 Suluk and several Chinese civilians.|$|E

500|$|Kafka {{feared that}} people would find him mentally and {{physically}} repulsive. However, those who met him found him to possess a quiet and cool demeanor, obvious intelligence, and a dry sense of humour; they also found him boyishly handsome, although of austere appearance. Brod compared Kafka to Heinrich von Kleist, noting that both writers {{had the ability to}} describe a situation realistically with precise details. Brod thought Kafka {{was one of the most}} entertaining people he had met; Kafka enjoyed sharing humour with his friends, but also helped them in difficult situations with good advice. According to Brod, he was a passionate reciter, who was able to phrase his speaking as if it were music.

Scott Bowles, writing for USA Today, gave the film a negative review, declaring [...] "never was a movie so bleak and empty". He claimed that Never Let Me Go did not [...] "embrace the book's unrelentingly dark tones", but rather wallowed in them.
