500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] was {{directed}} by Alex De Rakoff in early November 2004. Clarkson told MTV that she conceived {{the idea of the}} video after assuming that revenge is what every girl wants to do when their boyfriend cheats on them. She added, [...] "You know, 'Why don't I just go trash her house? [...] <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it in the video. All I do is break stuff. It's a cool job. I could get used to this." [...] Clarkson expressed that in the music video, viewers would get to see her act out of character. She explained, [...] "In the beginning, I'm like tipping things over and smearing mud all over the walls and it seems like my apartment, but it ends up being the other girl's that he's with, so it's a humorous video." [...] The music video premiered on Total Request Live on November 16, 2004.|$|E

6000|$|... "And so I am at home--only I do {{not find}} so much of it. I walk about here, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> there; but here I see a variety of people in every street, and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen." ...|$|E
60|$|Limb. In {{good time}} be it spoken; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> Mrs Pleasance.|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} nothing else to be <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it. Very clumsily too, I fear.|$|R
60|$|I never {{pretended to}} {{understand}} Private Ortheris; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{the next best}} thing I left him alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} ought to know," [...] she said suddenly. [...] "You see, Charlie, Sir Marmaduke is very kind to me, and I love him dearly, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> you, and I {{think you ought}} to know, {{although}} it may be nothing at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bella: [...] "I {{know you}} like to have me always speak the truth, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> to you, ma'am, and every lady I ever lived with; but I wasn't going to have that young {{waitress}} of Mrs. Baker's and that nasty cook of Mrs. Merrick's laughing at us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{want to see}} him,' said Marie. Lady Carbury, hardly {{knowing what}} answer to make, {{was silent for a}} while. 'I suppose he told you everything;--didn't he? You know that we were to have been married? I loved him very much, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> still. I am not ashamed of coming and telling you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. She told me afore that <b>I</b> should hear'n; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> They say she's {{clever and}} deep, and perhaps she charmed 'en to come." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "After my fight, <b>I</b> was excited, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{something}} rude that I should apologize for. But {{that showed}} just how excited I was over that fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I'll {{drive to}} the nearest police station,' <b>I</b> answered; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> leaving him {{shivering}} on the pavement. There I gave up my fare, {{and that was the}} last I ever saw of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father, I {{belong to}} a society of three, and we have promised to do all we can for temperance. As yet I can only show bravely the faith that is in me; {{therefore}} I can never offer any friend of mine a drop of wine, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ask them here, where it would seem most uncourteous to refuse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn’t say {{she took}} it," [...] snapped his wife. [...] "I said I believe she knows {{something}} about it, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> She’s a horrid woman. Look at the way she encouraged her girl Looey to run after that young traveller from Smithson’s. The whole {{fact of the matter}} is, it isn’t your brooch, so you don’t care." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no {{time like}} the present, when I've {{got it in}} my mind; and, if you'll wait, I can settle it all for you to-night. I was telling you that I hate farming, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> There are thirty or five-and-thirty acres of land about the house, and lying round {{to the back of}} the town; you shall take them off my hands, and welcome." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{never had}} the heart to throw cold water on Euphemia's noble emotions, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not tell her that the notice merely {{requested}} travellers to remove from their trunks the anciennes etiquettes, or old railway labels.|$|R
60|$|CUSINS. It is true. You {{accused me}} yourself, Lady Brit, {{of joining the}} Army to worship Barbara; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> She bought my soul like a flower at a street corner; but she bought it for herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, I {{recalled}} {{what the}} son of Sirach says in the True Book: 'An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips;' <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> what {{the son of}} Sirach advises in such cases: 'I believed not his many words.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, my dear," [...] said Lily, [...] "you allow yourself, for {{the sake}} of your argument, to use a word in a double sense, and you attempt to {{confound}} me by doing so. But I am a great deal too clever for you, and have thought too much about it, to be taken in in that way. I certainly love your cousin John; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> love Mr. Boyce, the vicar." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{a sudden}} thought came to Myles, {{and as it}} came his cheeks glowed as hot as fire [...] "Master Gascoyne," [...] said he, with gruff awkwardness, [...] "thou hast been a very good, true friend to me since I have come to this place, and hast befriended me in all ways thou mightest do, and I, as well I know, but a poor rustic clod. Now I have forty shillings by me which I may spend as I list, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> beseech thee that thou wilt take yon dagger {{of me as a}} love-gift, and have and hold it for thy very own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes!' cried Pip. 'To be sure. So I was. At {{first he}} was dumb--sewn up, dead, sir--but after a minute {{he said to the}} Duke, [...] "Here's Pip. Ask Pip. Pip's our mutual friend. Ask Pip. He knows." [...] "Damme!" [...] said the Duke, [...] "I appeal to Pip then. Come, Pip. Bandy or not bandy? Speak out!" [...] "Bandy, your Grace, by the Lord Harry!" [...] said I. [...] "Ha, ha!" [...] laughed the Duke. [...] "To be sure she is. Bravo, Pip. Well said Pip. I wish I may die if you're not a trump, Pip. Pop me down among your fashionable {{visitors}} whenever I'm in town, Pip." [...] <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> to this day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I got to Mr. Charlecote,' said Robert--an {{answer that}} thrilled her all over. 'I said I'd be always very good, {{if he would}} take care of me, and not let them frighten me. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> go to sleep.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} my {{question}} he motioned for me to follow, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with such good avail that within a quarter-hour I was in my father's arms, he pressing me to his heart as if I had just come out from some terrible danger.|$|R
60|$|She {{remained}} {{for a time}} looking down at me and, I could feel, perplexed by me, but I {{wanted to go on}} with my thinking, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not look up, and presently she stooped to my forehead and kissed me and went rustling softly to her room.|$|R
60|$|I {{have never}} told this story, nor shall mortal man see this {{manuscript}} until after I have {{passed over for}} eternity. I know that the average human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not purpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the press, and held up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truths which some day science will substantiate. Possibly the suggestions which I gained upon Mars, and the knowledge which I can set down in this chronicle, will aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteries of our sister planet; mysteries to you, but no longer mysteries to me.|$|E
60|$|This was {{all very}} well in France and England; but in Germany what was I to do? What did Hercules do when Omphale captivated him? What did Rinaldo do when Armida fixed upon him her {{twinkling}} eyes? Nay, to cut all historical instances short, by going at once to the earliest, what did Adam do when Eve tempted him? He yielded and became her slave; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> heartily trust every honest man will yield {{until the end of}} the world--he has no heart who will not. When I was in Germany, I say, I began to learn to WALTZ. The reader from this will no doubt expect that some new love-adventures befell me--nor will his gentle heart be disappointed. Two deep and tremendous incidents occurred which shall be notified on the present occasion.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do {{not read}} much here this time, so much of every day is taken up with talking to the people about me. That is all right, and I {{generally}} can turn the talk to something that I wish them to hear, so it is all {{in the way of}} business here. And I am glad to say that my school, and conversations and lessons, need some careful preparation. I have spent some time in drawing up for myself a little scheme of teaching for people in the state of my friends here. I ought of course to have done it long ago, and it is a poor thing now. I cannot take a real pleasure in teaching, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it badly. I am always, almost always, glad when school is over, though sometimes I get much interested myself, though not often able to interest others.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} write that because I was being pigeonholed as a writer who wrote funny stuff [...] [...] [...] I went to Bill Schafer, the {{publisher}} of Subterranean, and said, “I want to write something horrible where everybody dies at the end,” and he’s like, “Yes!” <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> [...] " ...|$|R
60|$|I {{spoke for}} him, as his interpreter, to my comrades, {{and in their}} names thanked him; but, {{speaking}} to them in Portuguese, I desired them to defer the acceptance of his kindness to the next morning; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> telling him we would further talk of this part in the morning; so we parted for that time.|$|R
6000|$|... "There wasn't {{any other}} way to <b>do</b> it, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it this way," [...] he said. [...] "I'm sorry, really, to have to tie you up <b>so,</b> because <b>I</b> wouldn't like it myself, and I wouldn't have put that {{handkerchief}} over your mouth if you had agreed to keep quiet, but I don't want anybody coming in here until you've promised." ...|$|R
6000|$|The good of {{the whole}} is to be sought before the {{good of the}} part. Although the whole {{material}} universe ought not to be dearer to its Creator than a single thinking and feeling being, yet the system of the universe which produces, preserves, and perpetuates all thinking and feeling beings, ought to be dearer to him than any one of them, and he may, notwithstanding his goodness, or rather by reason of his goodness, sacrifice something of the happiness of individuals to the preservation of the whole. [...] "That the dead body of a man should feed worms or wolves or plants is not, I admit, a compensation for the death of such a man; but if in the system of this universe, it is necessary for the preservation of the human race {{that there should be a}} circulation of substance between men, animals, vegetables, then the particular mishap of an individual contributes to the general good. I die, I am eaten by worms; but my children, my brothers, will live as I have lived; my body enriches the earth of which they will consume the fruits; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> by the order of nature and for all men, what Codrus, Curtius, the Decii, and a thousand others, did of their own free will for a small part of men."

60|$|Then I tried my best {{to catch}} cold and really be sick by {{standing}} on the snowbank in the Methodist graveyard with my bare feet until Jerry pulled me off. But it didn't hurt me a bit and so I couldn't get out of going to church. So I just decided I would put my boots on and go that way. I can't see {{why it was so}} wrong and I was so careful to wash my legs just as clean as my face, but, anyway, father wasn't to blame for it. He was in the study thinking of his sermon and other heavenly things, and I kept out of his way before I went to Sunday School. Father does not look at people's legs in church, so of course he did not notice mine, but all the gossips did and talked about it, and that is why I am writing this letter to the Journal to explain. I suppose I did very wrong, since everybody says so, and I am sorry and I am wearing those awful stockings to punish myself, although father bought me two nice new black pairs as soon as Mr. Flagg's store opened on Monday morning. But it was all my fault, and if people blame father for it after they read this they are not Christians <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not mind what they say.|$|E
6000|$|... . Last night I was at {{the theatre}} and heard DIE JUDIN (LA JUIVE), and was thereby terribly excited. At last, {{in the middle of}} the fifth act, which was {{perfectly}} beastly, I had to slope. I could stand even seeing the cauldron with the sham fire beneath, and the two hateful executioners in red; but when at last the girl's courage breaks down, and, grasping her father's arm, she cries out - O so shudderfully! - I thought it high time to be out of that GALERE, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know yet whether it ends well or ill; but if I ever afterwards find that they do carry things to the extremity, I shall think more meanly of my species. It was raining and cold outside, so I went into a BIERHALLE, and sat and brooded over a SCHNITT (half-glass) for nearly an hour. An opera is far more REAL than real life to me. It seems as if stage illusion, and particularly this hardest to swallow and most conventional illusion of them all - an opera - would never stale upon me. I wish that life was an opera. I should like to LIVE in one; but I don't know in what quarter of the globe I shall find a society so constituted. [...] Besides, it would soon pall: imagine asking for three-kreuzer cigars in recitative, or giving the washerwoman the inventory of your dirty clothes in a sustained and FLOURISHOUS aria.|$|E
