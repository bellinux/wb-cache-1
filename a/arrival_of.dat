40|$|The {{coefficient}} of variation of counts of customers in nodes of all members of an equivalence class of stochastic service networks is computed for three classes <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> processes: i) Poisson <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> individual customers, ii) Poisson <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> fixed and random sized batches of customers, and iii) fixed times <b>of</b> <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> constant and random sized batches of customers. Time-variable expressions of means, variances, and coefficients of variation are computed in terms <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> process parameters, nodal linkages within networks, and residence time distributions of customers in nodes. Coefficients of variation are compared and indices of traffic congestion are computed for member networks within an equivalence class. Use of these indices are an efficient means of rapidly evaluating design parameter changes on performance of networks within an equivalence class...|$|R

5|$|Before the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> Europeans in the area, {{wildebeest}} used to roam widely, {{probably in}} relation to the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the rains and the availability of good forage. They never made such extensive migrations as the blue wildebeest but at one time, they used to cross the Drakensberg Range, moving eastwards in autumn, searching for good pastures. Then they returned to the highvelds in the spring and moved towards the west, where sweet potato and Karoo vegetation were abundant. They also moved from north to south as the sourgrass found north of the Vaal River matured and became unpalatable, the wildebeest only consuming young shoots of sourgrass. Nowadays, almost all black wildebeest are in reserves or on farms and the extent of their movements is limited.|$|E
5|$|Before the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> Islam, Afghanistan {{had close}} {{cultural}} ties with India, and the adoration of both Hindu and Buddhist deities was practiced.

5|$|Egypt {{and much}} of Palestine were {{controlled}} by the Arab Shi'ite Fatimid Caliphate, which was significantly smaller since the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the Seljuqs. Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuqs caused great disruption for the local Christians and for western pilgrims. The Fatimids, under the nominal rule of caliph al-Musta'li but actually controlled by vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuqs in 1073 (although some older accounts say 1076); they recaptured it in 1098 from the Artuqids, a smaller Turkish tribe associated with the Seljuqs, just before the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the crusaders.|$|E

50|$|If {{vehicles}} experience no delay as {{they travel}} from X1 to X2, then the <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> vehicles at location X1 {{is represented by}} curve N1 and the <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> the vehicles at location X2 is represented by N2 in figure 8. More commonly, curve N1 {{is known as the}} <b>arrival</b> curve <b>of</b> vehicles at location X1 and curve N2 is known as the <b>arrival</b> curve <b>of</b> vehicles at location X2. Using a one-lane signalized approach to an intersection as an example, where X1 is the location of the stop bar at the approach and X2 is an arbitrary line on the receiving lane just across of the intersection, when the traffic signal is green, vehicles can travel through both points with no delay and {{the time it takes to}} travel that distance is equal to the free-flow travel time. Graphically, this is shown as the two separate curves in figure 8.|$|R
