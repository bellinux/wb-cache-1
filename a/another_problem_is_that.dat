5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E
25|$|Although localizationist {{approaches}} {{provide a}} useful way of classifying the different patterns of language difficulty into broad groups, {{one problem is}} that a sizeable number of individuals do not fit neatly into one category or another. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the categories, particularly the major ones such as Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, still remain quite broad. Consequently, even amongst individuals who meet the criteria for classification into a subtype, there can be enormous variability {{in the types of}} difficulties they experience.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{was written}} to {{entertain}} the Japanese court of the eleventh century, the work presents many difficulties to modern readers. First and foremost, Murasaki's language, Heian period court Japanese, was highly inflected and had very complex grammar. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> naming people was considered rude in Heian court society, so none of the characters are named within the work; instead, the narrator refers to men often by their rank or their station in life, and to women often {{by the color of}} their clothing, or by the words used at a meeting, or by the rank of a prominent male relative. This results in different appellations for the same character depending on the chapter.|$|E

50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{one of the}} stamps, for boltwoodite, had {{an error}} in its {{chemical}} equation. This was corrected in the Namibian issue. Currently Artists Jonny Skolnick and Eli Fenyes are responsible for philatelic design and have oversight over postage stamp images.|$|R
25|$|A {{technical}} {{concern is}} that the 14 MeV neutrons produced by the fusion reactions will damage the materials from which the reactor is built. Research is in progress to determine whether and how reactor walls can be designed to last long enough to make a commercial power station economically viable {{in the presence of the}} intense neutron bombardment. The damage is primarily caused by high energy neutrons knocking atoms out of their normal position in the crystal lattice. A related problem for a future commercial fusion power station is that the neutron bombardment will induce radioactivity in the reactor material itself. Maintaining and decommissioning a commercial reactor may thus be difficult and expensive. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> superconducting magnets are damaged by neutron fluxes. A new special research facility, IFMIF, is planned to investigate this problem.|$|E
25|$|Slower {{degeneration}} of {{the distal}} segment {{than that which}} occurs in the peripheral nervous system also contributes to the inhibitory environment because inhibitory myelin and axonal debris are not cleared away as quickly. All these factors contribute {{to the formation of}} what is known as a glial scar, which axons cannot grow across. The proximal segment attempts to regenerate after injury, but its growth is hindered by the environment. It {{is important to note that}} central nervous system axons have been proven to regrow in permissive environments; therefore, the primary problem to central nervous system axonal regeneration is crossing or eliminating the inhibitory lesion site. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the morphology and functional properties of central nervous system neurons are highly complex, for this reason a neuron cannot be functionally replaced by one of another type (Llinás' law).|$|E
25|$|While {{this method}} greatly {{improves}} {{the chances that}} an attack will be successful, it is not without problems. Exploits using this technique still must rely on some amount of luck that they will guess offsets on the stack that are within the NOP-sled region. An incorrect guess will usually result in the target program crashing and could alert the system administrator to the attacker's activities. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the NOP-sled requires a much larger amount of memory in which to hold a NOP-sled {{large enough to be}} of any use. This can be a problem when the allocated size of the affected buffer is too small and the current depth of the stack is shallow (i.e. there is not much space {{from the end of the}} current stack frame to the start of the stack). Despite its problems, the NOP-sled is often the only method that will work for a given platform, environment, or situation; as such it is still an important technique.|$|E
50|$|Reasons for loss: Despite having {{many more}} people visit their fish and chip store, the girls failed to bring in big donors and focused more on the public customers. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Layla and Prinnie who were {{assigned}} to cooking focused solely on that and raised $165 and $2000-$3000 respectively.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the {{civilian}} wing was riven by infighting between the radical socialist and moderate faction, while the military stood more unified. Whatever the case, the Syrian Regional Command slowly amassed its powers by weakening the National Command. This {{all came to}} a head in the 1966 Syrian coup d'état.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Model 10 {{could only}} be fired from the right arm, as the gun ejected spent {{cartridges}} from {{the right side of}} the unit with a high force.

25|$|The shelters {{are made}} from aluminum, steel, and glass. Air {{ventilation}} works through fins on the aluminum part of the shelters. Floors {{are made from}} tread plate, although newer shelters now use concrete. The shelters are equipped with platform screen doors. Some of the connecting elevated bridge ramps have gentle slopes (with some exceptions) to accommodate the disabled. One disadvantage {{of some of the}} ramps is that passengers need to walk a relatively long way up the ramps and then double back to reach the boarding shelters. The floors of the bridge are mostly tread plates although some are made from concrete. One problem with the tread plate is that considerable noise is generated by the movement of passengers across the tread plate surfaces. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some of the tread plate surfaces can become very slippery during the rainy season. There are no sanitary facilities in most of the shelters.|$|E
25|$|Flaming {{is done to}} {{loops and}} straight-wires in {{microbiology}} labs. Leaving the loop in the flame of a Bunsen burner or alcohol lamp until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see Incineration below). However, during the initial heating infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in 70% or higher ethanol, then briefly touch the object to a Bunsen burner flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame.|$|E
25|$|Screening by {{hysteroscopy}} {{to obtain}} cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed. This {{is similar to}} the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound. Other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective. However, it's not yet clear if this approach could actually help to save lives—the full results of the trial will be published in 2015. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery. The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population. Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> despite {{economic}} resurgence, {{the state}} hardly received higher income. <b>another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the modest {{capacity of the}} domestic industry was reaching its limits. Further investments and foreign capital were required to install new capabilities and continue with economic growth and recovery. This led to increased dependency on foreign loans and investments.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> commanders {{often used}} their {{reconnaissance}} squadrons for fire support missions, {{for which the}} thinly-armored M8 was ill-suited. When it encountered German armored reconnaissance units, the M8 could easily penetrate their armor with its 37 mm gun. Conversely, its own thin armor was vulnerable to the 20 mm autocannons that German scout cars were equipped with.|$|R
5000|$|Coherers {{were also}} finicky to adjust {{and not very}} sensitive. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> because of the {{cumbersome}} mechanical [...] "decohering" [...] mechanism, the coherer was limited to a receiving speed of 12 - 15 words per minute of Morse code, while telegraph operators could send at rates of 50 WPM, and paper tape machines at 100 WPM.|$|R
25|$|There are {{problems}} that may hinder the development the modeling of reading behaviours. First, computer models in reading {{tend to make}} assumptions of direct links between lexical properties and saccade attributes (by putting a formula linking the two into the model). These links are descriptive generalizations of existing empirical data and normally do not survive new data. In search for new data to support their models, researcher might have to keep adding and adjusting lexical process assumptions {{and are likely to}} ignore possible parsimonious process that underlies these assumptions. Caution should be taken when adding assumptions of how lexical processes affect saccade programming because reading is not what humans are evolved to do. The modeling of eye-movements in reading should treat reading as special case of visual perception and take into account more basic oculomotor properties(e.g., split fovea, depth perception) before making assumptions about the link between lexical processes and eye movements. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there has been a lack of comparison between models on the same data set. Researcher teams tend to focus on the development of their own model and {{might not be able to}} fully appreciate the merits of other models due to the technical difficulties in sharing programs. In the future we might see unifying model that both explains complex reading behaviors well and is parsimonious enough to be generalizable to other eye-tracking fields such as visual search, scene viewing.|$|E
500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> functionals of continuous-time {{process that}} rely upon an {{uncountable}} {{number of points}} of the index set may not be measurable, so the probabilities of certain events may not be well-defined. For example, the supremum of a stochastic process or random field {{is not necessarily a}} well-defined random variable. For a continuous-time stochastic process , other characteristics that depend on an uncountable number of points of the index set [...] include: ...|$|E
500|$|For example, {{physicists}} and mathematicians often {{assume that}} space has a mathematical property called smoothness, but this property cannot be assumed {{in the case}} of a [...] manifold if one wishes to recover the physics of our four-dimensional world. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] manifolds are not complex manifolds, so theorists are unable to use tools from the branch of mathematics known as complex analysis. Finally, there are many open questions about the existence, uniqueness, and other mathematical properties of [...] manifolds, and mathematicians lack a systematic way of searching for these manifolds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> East German {{production}} costs {{had been very}} high. The conversion rates of the GDR mark to the Deutsche Mark often kept those costs high, as did the early wage negotiations, which resulted in wages far above the productivity level. Western German firms found it easier and cheaper to serve their new eastern German markets by expanding production in western facilities.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the design}} of the steam turbine {{required}} the complete water supply of the Connecticut River that came into Hartford. To solve that problem three cooling towers were built to capture the steam of the turbine and condense it back to liquid water <b>that</b> could <b>be</b> used again. This way the same water could be used over and over again for about a year.|$|R
5000|$|In 1917, {{the private}} ferry owners on Lake Washington, which meant Captain Anderson as a {{practical}} matter, were undercut by competition from King County. [...] <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> all of the company's docking facilities had to be reconstructed after {{the opening of the}} Lake Washington Ship Canal in 1916 caused the level of the water in Lake Washington to be lowered by 9 ft.|$|R
500|$|The {{fossil record}} tells a {{different}} story. [...] Although it cannot show the earliest possible {{date for the}} appearance of a taxonomic group, other concerns have arisen about these vastly earlier divergence dates predicted independently of the fossil record. [...] First, palaeontologists have expressed concerns that if primates have been around for significantly more than 66million years, then the first one-third of the primate fossil record is missing. [...] <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some of these molecular dates have overestimated the divergence of other mammalian orders, such as Rodentia, suggesting primate divergence might also be overestimated. [...] One of the oldest known strepsirrhines, Djebelemur, dates from the early Eocene of northern Africa and lacks a fully differentiated toothcomb. [...] Based on fossils and other genetic tests, a more conservative estimate dates the divergence between lemurs and lorises to around 50 to 55mya.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, this {{rule of thumb}} came into being, {{developed}} by R. H. Kraft. [...] It was noted from rainfall amounts (in imperial units) reported by the first order rainfall network in the United States that the storm total rainfall fit a simple equation: [...] 100 divided by the speed of motion in knots. [...] This rule works, even in other countries, {{as long as a}} tropical cyclone is moving and only the first order or synoptic station network (with observations spaced about [...] apart) are used to derive storm totals. [...] Canada uses {{a modified version of the}} Kraft rule which divides the results by a factor of two, which takes into account the lower sea surface temperatures seen around Atlantic Canada and the prevalence of systems undergoing vertical wind shear at their northerly latitudes. [...] The main problem with this rule is that the rainfall observing network is denser than either the synoptic reporting network or the first order station networks, which means the absolute maximum is likely to be underestimated. [...] <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it does not take the size of the tropical cyclone or topography into account.|$|E
2500|$|The Vivarana school {{takes an}} {{epistemological}} approach. Prakasatman {{was the first}} to propound the theory of mulavidya or maya as being of [...] "positive beginningless nature", and sees Brahman as the source of avidya. Critics object that Brahman is pure consciousness, so it cannot be the source of avidya. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> contradictory qualities, namely knowledge and ignorance, are attributed to Brahman.|$|E
2500|$|Criticism: Newton {{objected to}} the theory because drag must lead to {{noticeable}} deviations of the orbits which <b>were</b> not observed. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> moons often move in different directions, against {{the direction of the}} vortex motion. Also, Huygens' explanation of the inverse square law is circular, because this means that the aether obeys [...] Kepler's third law. But a theory of gravitation has to explain those laws and must not presuppose them.|$|R

2500|$|However, {{researchers}} have found lead content in wares stamped [...] "sin plomo" [...] (without lead). Even though the boron glaze costs less than the traditional lead glaze, many potters refused to change tradition. In all, only half of Mexico's potters have switched.

2500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{there are}} no {{independent}} indications of literacy existing in the Balkans at this period. Sarunas Milisauskas comments that [...] "it {{is extremely difficult to}} demonstrate archaeologically whether a corpus of symbols constitutes a writing system" [...] and notes that the first known writing systems were all developed by early states to facilitate record-keeping in complex organised societies in the Middle East and Mediterranean. There is no evidence of organised states in the European Neolithic, thus it is unlikely they would have needed the administrative systems facilitated by writing. David Anthony notes that Chinese characters were first used for ritual and commemorative purposes associated with the 'sacred power' of kings; it is possible that a similar usage accounts for the Tărtăria symbols.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{existing}} CPU performance quickly {{pushed through}} the [...] "obvious" [...] barriers that experts perceived in the 1980s, {{and the value of}} parallel computing quickly dropped {{to the point where it}} was for some time used only in niche situations.

5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Japanese {{car dealers}} have always excelled at {{customer}} service; {{this meant that}} Saturn's main sales argument in the United States was meaningless in the Japanese market. The introduction of Saturn was also ill-timed, as the economy {{was in the midst}} of a recession due to the effects of the 1980s [...] "bubble economy".
