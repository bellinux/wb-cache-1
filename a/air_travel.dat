The lift produced means that the ball drops slower and travels further than a normal delivery. The slower descent also results in the ball bouncing lower.|$|R

The forward spinning motion impedes <b>air</b> <b>travelling</b> over the ball, but assists <b>air</b> <b>travelling</b> underneath.

5|$|The {{environmental}} impact of aviation in the United Kingdom is increasing due to the increasing demand for <b>air</b> <b>travel</b> in the country. In the past 25 years the UK air transport industry has seen sustained growth, {{and the demand for}} passenger <b>air</b> <b>travel</b> in particular is forecast to increase more than twofold, to 465 million passengers, by 2030. Two airports; London Heathrow Airport and London Gatwick Airport, are amongst the top ten busiest airports in the world for international passenger traffic. Whilst {{more than half of all}} passengers travelling by air in the UK currently travel via the five London area airports, regional airports have experienced the most growth in recent years, due to the success of 'no-frills' airlines over the last decade.|$|E

Underwater diving is considered unsafe after an episode of pneumothorax unless a preventative procedure has been performed.

5|$|Seven shorter NoL Eurostar trains {{for these}} Regional Eurostar {{services}} were built, but these services never ran. Predicted journey times of almost nine hours for Glasgow to Paris {{at the time}} of growth of low-cost <b>air</b> <b>travel</b> during the 1990s made the plans commercially unviable against the cheaper and quicker airlines. Other reasons that have been suggested for these services having never been run were both government policies and the disruptive privatisation of British Rail.|$|E
5|$|Support for airport {{expansion}} {{is based on}} an economic case that regards the air transport industry not only as an important industry in its own right, but also as a facilitator of growth for the economy as a whole. One study predicts that the government's strategy will realise an additional £13billion per annum in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030. Another study which is critical of the government approach, and which favours addressing environmental impacts through increased taxation of air transport, indicates a negative economic benefit resulting from airport expansion. In 2006 the industry was responsible for over 6 per cent of all UK carbon emissions, a figure that is set to rise as demand increases. Under current strategies of emissions reduction and growth in air transport, <b>air</b> <b>travel</b> in the UK could account for up to 50 per cent of the UK carbon budget by 2050. Industry attempts to address this issue are longer term efforts based on technological and operational improvements, whilst government policy is based on the inclusion of air transport within emissions trading schemes. Critics advocate a shift in government policy to address environmental impacts by constraining the growth in demand for <b>air</b> <b>travel,</b> primarily through the use of economic instruments to price <b>air</b> <b>travel</b> less attractively. Local environmental issues include noise and air quality, and the impact of these, particularly {{in the case of the}} former, is subject to debate. Government policy generally is that these are local issues best addressed locally, and has introduced legislation designed to facilitate this.|$|E
40|$|The {{enhancement}} {{of the greenhouse}} effect in driving increases in temperature and many other changes associated with climate have become great concern to research. The objective {{of this paper is}} to estimate the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in Lagos Metropolis. Literatures on road and <b>air</b> <b>travels</b> were read; and also journal articles on pollution and greenhouse gases, global warming and climate change. Newspaper cuttings, magazines, and electronic media sources of data and information were used. Trends in the growth and development of railway locomotives, marine activities, vehicular movements and <b>air</b> <b>travels</b> in the metropolis were studied and correlated with the estimated greenhouse gases emitted. There is positive correlation. Vehicular movements and <b>air</b> <b>travels</b> have increased by over 50 % in the last twenty years. Greenhouse gases are increasing by the day. There must be deliberate checks on gas emission from automobiles, plants and machineries and in the aviation industry. The world is not at rest to arrest the effects of climate change and global warming. Nigeria and Nigerians and particularly Lagosian, the government and research institutions should be parts of the efforts...|$|R
