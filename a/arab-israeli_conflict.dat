5|$|In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council {{resolution}} condemning Israeli settlements, {{with the}} United States {{being the only}} nation to do so. Obama supports the two-state solution to the <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.|$|E
5|$|By 1972 the United States and the Soviet Union {{were focused}} on détente. The Arabs were worried, as it meant their {{military}} situation in regards to Israel would remain at a disadvantage. Believing diplomatic avenues had reached a dead end, Sadat focused on taking decisive military action. A renewed conflict with Israel would disrupt Soviet-American détente, force superpower intervention and make {{the solution of the}} <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> a center-stage issue to Israel, the US and the USSR.|$|E

50|$|On {{the issue}} of energy security, China relies mainly on Persian Gulf exports. In {{contrast}} with the USA, China is not associated with the <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflicts</b> and may focus simply on oil supply from an economic standpoint. The increase in Chinese dependence on Persian Gulf oil also means an associated increasing economic dependence on Arabian exporters, who will probably not join hands to block exports to China.|$|R

5|$|Indeed, since Willy Brandt {{had become}} {{chancellor}} in 1969, {{there had been}} a change of the West German attitude towards the <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict.</b> The earlier conservative governments had been considered pointedly pro-Israel (especially during the mid-1960s with the Six-Day War), which had resulted in a number of Arab states breaking off diplomatic relations to West Germany. With Egypt and Tunisia, these had only been restored shortly before the 1972 Olympics.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{the gun was}} {{supplied}} to many countries around the globe, including former Warsaw Pact allies, such as Poland. As of the early 2000s it remains in service in Afghanistan, Albania, China, Cuba, Hungary, Iraq, Mozambique, Syria, Vietnam and other countries. The gun was employed in the <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>Conflict</b> and also in some conflicts in former republics of Soviet Union. The long operational history of D-1 howitzers in the national armies of numerous countries is an additional testimony to its qualities.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{nationalist}} and communist forces resumed {{the civil}} war in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949. In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of the <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict.</b> While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflicts</b> were {{a series}} of wars between the country of Israel and its {{surrounding}} Arab neighbors. Those that involved dogfighting occurred between 1948 and 1985. The wars escalated on 14 May 1948, the day Israel declared its sovereignty from Britain. The War of Independence {{was followed by the}} Suez-Sinai War in 1956, the Six-Day War in 1967, the War of Attrition, the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and the First Lebanon War in the early 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Kaplan was {{executive}} producer of ABC News Nightline from 1984 to 1989, where he guided the late-night news program {{through a period of}} innovation and exclusive interviews. While at Nightline in March 1985, Kaplan produced the historic week-long series of broadcasts originating from Johannesburg, South Africa. In 1988, Kaplan was {{executive producer}} of Nightline in the Holy Land, a critically acclaimed week-long series examining <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflicts.</b> At that time he was also responsible for an unprecedented four-hour Nightline National Town Meeting on AIDS, the most comprehensive coverage of the epidemic ever shown on network television.|$|R
50|$|Tanks and {{anti-tank}} {{weapons of}} the Cold War era saw {{action in a}} number of proxy wars like the Korean War, Vietnam War, Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Soviet war in Afghanistan and <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflicts,</b> culminating with the Yom Kippur War. The T-55, for example, has seen action in no fewer than 32 conflicts. In these wars the U.S. or NATO countries and the Soviet Union or China consistently backed opposing forces. Proxy wars were studied by Western and Soviet military analysts and provided a contribution to the Cold War tank development process.|$|R
5|$|Jennings was {{determined}} to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world. The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of Mind, a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with {{the intricacies of the}} <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict,</b> including the rise of the Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>{{conflict}}</b> is {{a modern}} phenomenon, which {{has its roots in}} the end of the 19th century. The conflict became a major international issue with the birth of Israel in 1948. The <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> has resulted in at least five major wars and a number of minor conflicts. It has also been the source of two major Palestinian uprisings (s).|$|E
50|$|The M107 {{was also}} used by the Israel Defense Forces in the various <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflicts</b> from the Yom Kippur War on. During the Yom Kippur War {{it was one of}} the few weapons able to destroy Egyptian and Syrian {{anti-aircraft}} missile positions. Of the 15 SA-2 batteries lost by Egypt on the east bank of the Suez Canal, 13 were destroyed by M107s. When the IDF crossed the Suez Canal in Operation Gazelle, M107 SP guns were among the first to cross together with tanks and APC's. M107s also had sufficient range to hit the Syrian capital of Damascus.|$|R
2500|$|Although the chocolate-chip {{camouflage}} became {{well known}} during the Persian Gulf War, {{it was originally}} designed decades prior, in 1962. The U.S. Army, believing that it might one day [...] become necessary {{to intervene in the}} <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflicts,</b> developed a test pattern using the deserts of southwestern United States as a model. When the hostilities in the Middle East wound down, the test pattern was mothballed. The formation of the U.S. Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) in 1979, with its remit to operate in the Middle East, and protect U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf region, saw the need for desert camouflage clothing to emerge again.|$|R

Miri, twice-widowed because of the ongoing <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflicts,</b> has been going through the motions of living, somehow detached from a real connection to life itself. Her decision to help reunite the child—nicknamed [...] "Noodle"—with his mother, now back in Beijing, ends up helping her, not just the boy and his mother, in ways Miri herself could not have expected.|$|R

50|$|During {{the early}} days of Operation Barbarossa, the USSR's only {{infantry}} anti-armour weapons were anti-tank rifles, anti-tank guns, and the RPG-40. These were adequate against early German tanks such as the Panzer I and Panzer II but, as the war progressed, they were found to be nearly useless against the heavier Panthers and Tigers. The RPG-43 was developed as a result, and it was produced in large numbers {{until the end of the}} war. After the war it was passed on extensively to Soviet client states, and was used in the numerous <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Despite being thoroughly outdated, it can still be encountered in many third world nations, mainly due to its reliability and low cost.|$|R
5000|$|He became {{regarded}} as a Middle East specialist after covering the war for Israeli independence. St. John covered the Eichmann trial and five Arab-Israeli wars, including the 1982 Lebanon War.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to capture the Middle East {{conflict}} from a new perspective. In this regard, the conflict analysis works with two new factors: lack of water resources {{in the region and}} the effect this situation has on the regional actors to initiate an open war conflict. As an introduction to the topic, the first chapter discusses water resources in the context of international relations. The general findings of the first chapter are then applied to the specific situation in the Middle East region. In particular, the second chapter depicts the role of water resources throughout <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflicts</b> that later serves as a basis for the analysis of the conflicts {{at the end of the}} chapter. Finally, the last chapter seeks to pinpoint some actual conditions and technological capabilities that could secure the efficient and regular supply of water resources in the region...|$|R
