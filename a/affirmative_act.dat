In Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida v.

The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida held, in the latest round in the three-state battle for rights to the Chattahoochee River’s water, that the Army Corps of Engineers had violated federal law by the de facto reallocation of water stored in Lake Lanier in north Georgia for use as a municipal water supply. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, on an issue of first impression in the Eleventh Circuit, held that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over claims challenging federal and state agency permitting decisions regarding a natural gas pipeline because the Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave the federal circuit courts of appeal exclusive jurisdiction over permitting challenges to facilities or projects within its scope.

40|$|The Constitution ordinarily places only {{negative}} {{restrictions on}} government {{and does not}} require <b>affirmative</b> <b>acts</b> to assist individuals. The statutory vehicle for most constitutional tort litigation, 42 U. S. C. section 1983, echoes this constitutional principle. It extends liability to 2 ̆ 2 [e]very person who [...] . [under color of state law] subjects, or causes to be subjected, any [...] . person 2 ̆ 2 to the deprivation of federal rights, and makes no provision for a duty on governmental defendants to stop others from harming the plaintiff. For some courts this principle disposes of affirmative duty claims forthwith. A noteworthy example is the recent seventh circuit case Bowers v. DeVito. A man released from a state mental hospital killed a woman, and her estate brought a constitutional tort action against the officials responsible for his release. The court denied liability, explaining that 2 ̆ 2 [t]he Constitution is a charter of negative liberties, 2 ̆ 2 that 2 ̆ 2 {{it does not require}} [...] . the state to provide [...] . even so elementary a service as maintaining law and order, 2 ̆ 2 and that 2 ̆ 2 as the State of Illinois has no federal constitutional duty to provide such protection its failure to do so is not actionable under section 1983. 2 ̆ 2 In spite of these constitutional and statutory principles, other courts have upheld affirmative duty claims in constitutional tort. Their opinions, however, do not adequately explain the foundation and scope of these affirmative duties. In particular, they do not respond to the rationale of Bowers, that constitutional tort is available only to redress violations of constitutional rights. This Article argues that the Bowers principle is wrong. It examines the issues of doctrine and policy that bear on the affirmative duty question in constitutional tort and contends that affirmative duties may be imposed even though constitutional rights are generally negative in character, as a matter of federal constitutional common law.

In the current context this is a particularly flexible framework allowing one to capture both the direct and indirect effects of the legislative reforms. The indirect effect refers to the narrowing of the gender wage gap associated with legislative manipulation of the male-female occupational distributions.

40|$|A {{reassessment}} of United States 2 ̆ 7 constitutional constraints on state-level {{foreign policy is}} sorely needed. State engagement in foreign policy was rarely significant until the 1960 s. Since that time, state involvement has rapidly expanded in both sheer magnitude {{and the types of}} activities undertaken. The most prominent and problematic among these state and local activities in the past fifty-plus years has been three waves of state and local sanction initiatives targeting countries ruled by regimes with repugnant human rights policies. In the mid- 1980 s, over half of the states and at least 100 localities adopted sanctions legislation against South Africa, most often in the form of divestment requirements for state or city pension funds, procurement restrictions applicable to companies active in South Africa, or both. In the late 1990 s, many states and localities targeted Burma (officially known as the Union of Myanmar), a country ruled by an undemocratic military regime with a repugnant human rights record that has included the killing of as many as several thousand pro-democracy demonstrators. More recently, states and localities have targeted the Sudanese government for its participation in the genocide in the Darfur region of the country. Divestment requirements and procurement sanctions continue to be tools of choice for states and localities seeking to use their substantial market leverage to change the behavior of these foreign governments. Unless halted through the faithful application of constitutional constraints by state and local officials, globalization and technological developments that increase access to and the exchange of information concerning conditions and policies in foreign countries will likely facilitate the trend of increased state and local involvement in foreign affairs. Constraints on state-level foreign policy flow from the Supremacy Clause (in the form of the preemption doctrine), the Foreign Commerce Clause (in the form of the dormant Foreign Commerce Clause), and the amalgam of clauses allocating foreign affairs powers to federal actors and denying them to the states (in the form of the dormant foreign affairs doctrine). In 1968, the Supreme Court in Zschernig v. Miller for the first time relied upon the dormant foreign affairs doctrine to invalidate a state law in an as-applied challenge. This doctrine prohibits certain state foreign policy actions even in instances in which such state actions are not preempted by <b>affirmative</b> <b>acts</b> of the federal government (i. e., where the foreign policy powers of the federal government lie dormant or unutilized). The dormant foreign affairs doctrine is rooted in an exclusive federal government foreign affairs power. 6 By definition, if a power is exclusive to the federal government, then states are denied such power irrespective of whether the federal government has utilized its power. The Court has declared the foreign relations power to be exclusive to the federal government since the early 1800 s, and a multi-modal interpretation of the Constitution supports a significant degree of federal exclusivity over foreign affairs...|$|R
