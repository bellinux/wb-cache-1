5|$|Brimsek {{decided to}} help the war effort next season by joining the United States Coast Guard. During his time with the Coast Guard, he played with the Coast Guard Cutters hockey team in Curtis Bay, Maryland, and later served in the South Pacific. After the war ended, Brimsek {{returned}} to the Bruins {{in time for the}} 1945–46 season. However, Brimsek was not <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> as he was before due to having not played any professional hockey for two years. In his first season back, Brimsek guided the Bruins to the Finals, matching up with the Montreal Canadiens. The Bruins were defeated in five games with three games requiring overtime. Brimsek was applauded for his performance in the playoffs, compensating for his team's weak defence. This marked Brimsek's fourth appearance in the Finals and it would be his last. At the end of the season, Brimsek was also named to the NHL Second All-Star Team, the fifth time in his career.|$|E

5|$|Brimsek {{spent his}} first nine NHL seasons with the Bruins and during this time, he {{received}} numerous individual awards. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy, the Vezina Trophy twice, and he {{was named to the}} NHL All-Star Team eight times (twice on the First Team and six times on the Second Team). He was also a member of two Stanley Cup championships (1939 and 1941). During World War II, Brimsek left the NHL for two years in order to serve with the United States Coast Guard skating with the vaunted Coast Guard Cutters which featured fellow Eveleth native John Mariucci. After being discharged from the Coast Guard, Brimsek returned to the NHL for the 1945–46 season where it was noted that his skills were not <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> as before he left. Despite this, he still managed {{to be one of the}} best goalies in the league. Brimsek was traded to the Black Hawks following the 1948–49 season due to personal reasons. He spent one season with the Black Hawks before retiring from professional hockey.|$|E

25|$|The devocalization {{procedure}} {{does not}} take away a dog's ability to bark. Dogs will normally bark {{just as much as}} before the procedure. After the procedure the sound will be softer, typically about half as loud as before, or less, and it is not <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> or piercing. So while the procedure does not stop barking or silence the animal completely, it is effective in reducing the sound level and sharpness of the dog's bark.|$|E

Most frequently, this power manifests itself {{in the form of}} a blade that comes out of the arms, claws, or even <b>as</b> <b>sharp,</b> prehensile hair. Some Methuselah have displayed an ability to control some elemental powers such as fire and ice. When being born, a Methuselah behaves as any normal human. He or she is able to wake during daytime and lacks the supernatural life and shortcomings of the race.|$|E
25|$|The Stock Market {{crash in}} New York led people to hoard their money; as {{consumption}} fell, the American economy steadily contracted, 1929-32. Given the close economic {{links between the}} two countries, the collapse quickly affected Canada. Added to the woes of the prairies were those of Ontario and Quebec, whose manufacturing industries were now victims of overproduction. Massive lay-offs occurred and other companies collapsed into bankruptcy. This collapse was not <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> as that in the United States, but was the second sharpest collapse in the world.|$|E

25|$|Ectopic pregnancy, {{also known}} as tubal pregnancy, is a {{complication}} of pregnancy in which the embryo attaches outside the uterus. Signs and symptoms classically include abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Less than 50 percent of affected women have both of these symptoms. The pain may be described <b>as</b> <b>sharp,</b> dull, or crampy. Pain may also spread to the shoulder if bleeding into the abdomen has occurred. Severe bleeding {{may result in a}} fast heart rate, fainting, or shock. With very rare exceptions the fetus is unable to survive.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the process}} of {{developing}} his art, Al-Zahawi tried various methods of sculpting, yet he vastly preferred the coiling method. The coiling method allows the artists to create irregular forms with superimposed volume and with angles <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> as 45°, collectively allowing for the construction of very large forms that can reach up to 7 feet high with a diameter as wide as 4 feet. As each inch is built, coil by coil, similar to how one builds a house, the final product becomes a one of a kind form that is rarely repeated, and oftentimes goes far beyond traditional ceramics.|$|E
25|$|Titanium is a {{metal that}} has a better strength-to-weight ratio, is more wear resistant, and more {{flexible}} than steel. Although less hard and unable to take <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> an edge, carbides in the titanium alloy {{allow them to be}} heat-treated to a sufficient hardness. Ceramic blades are hard, brittle, and lightweight: they may maintain a sharp edge for years with no maintenance at all, but are as fragile as glass and will break if dropped on a hard surface. They are immune to common corrosion, and can only be sharpened on silicon carbide sandpaper and some grinding wheels. Plastic blades are not especially sharp and typically serrated. They are often disposable.|$|E

25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E
25|$|Seed oils are {{the richest}} sources of α-linolenic acid, notably those of chia, perilla, {{flaxseed}} (linseed oil), rapeseed (canola), and soybeans. α-Linolenic acid is also {{obtained from the}} thylakoid membranes in the leaves of Pisum sativum (pea leaves). Plant chloroplasts consisting of more than 95 percent of photosynthetic thylakoid membranes are highly fluid due to large abundance of linolenic acid, that shows up <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> resonances in high resolution carbon-13 NMR spectra, invariably. Some studies state that ALA remains stable during processing and cooking. However, other studies state that ALA might not be suitable for baking, as it will polymerize with itself, a feature exploited in paint with transition metal catalysts. Some ALA may also oxidize at baking temperatures. ALA percentages in the table below refer to the oils extracted from each item.|$|E
25|$|Knife blades can be {{manufactured}} {{from a variety}} of materials, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Carbon steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, can be very sharp. It holds its edge well, and remains easy to sharpen, but is vulnerable to rust and stains. Stainless steel is an alloy of iron, chromium, possibly nickel, and molybdenum, with only a small amount of carbon. It is not able to take quite <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> an edge as carbon steel, but is highly resistant to corrosion. High carbon stainless steel is stainless steel with a higher amount of carbon, intended to incorporate the better attributes of carbon steel and stainless steel. High carbon stainless steel blades do not discolor or stain, and maintain a sharp edge. Laminate blades use multiple metals to create a layered sandwich, combining the attributes of both. For example, a harder, more brittle steel may be sandwiched between an outer layer of softer, tougher, stainless steel to reduce vulnerability to corrosion. In this case, however, the part most affected by corrosion, the edge, is still vulnerable. Pattern-welding is similar to laminate construction. Layers of different steel types are welded together, but then the stock is manipulated to create patterns in the steel.|$|E
