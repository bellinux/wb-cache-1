In presence of sufficient lead and tin, bismuth forms crystals of Sn16Pb32Bi52 with melting point of only 95°C, which diffuses <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries and may cause a joint failure at relatively low temperatures. A high-power part pre-tinned with an {{alloy of lead}} can therefore desolder under load when soldered with a bismuth-containing solder. Such joints are also prone to cracking.

40|$|Eutectoid and {{hypereutectoid}} steels are extensively {{used for}} different engineering applications, because {{they offer a}} useful combination of strength and ductility as well as good corrosion resistance, wear resistance and machinability. In these steels, the major microstructural microconstituent is pearlite. However, depending on the chemical composition of the austenite prior to transformation and the thermal path during the decomposition of austenite, i. e., rate of cooling to the transformation temperature, the formation of proeutectoid cementite <b>along</b> <b>the</b> prior-austenite <b>grain</b> boundaries might take place. The presence of proeutectoid cementite <b>along</b> <b>the</b> austenite <b>grain</b> boundaries has a deleterious effect on the final mechanical properties of these fully pearlitic steels. Thermomechanical processing studies on hypereutectoid steels {{have shown that the}} composition and microstructural conditions of austenite prior to transformation to a fully pearlitic microstructure has a strong effect on reducing the formation of proeutectoid cementite <b>along</b> <b>the</b> austenite <b>grain</b> boundaries as well as the refinement of the interlamellar spacing.

25|$|Shrinkage and {{swelling}} may occur in wood when the moisture content is changed (Stamm, 1964). Shrinkage occurs as moisture content decreases, while swelling takes place when it increases. Volume {{change is not}} equal in all directions. The greatest dimensional change occurs in a direction tangential to the growth rings. Shrinkage from the pith outwards, or radially, is usually considerably less than tangential shrinkage, while longitudinal (<b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain)</b> shrinkage is so slight as to be usually neglected. The longitudinal shrinkage is 0.1% to 0.3%, in contrast to transverse shrinkages, which is 2% to 10%. Tangential shrinkage is often about twice as great as in the radial direction, although in some species it is as much as five times as great. The shrinkage is about 5% to 10% in the tangential direction and about 2% to 6% in the radial direction (Walker et al., 1993).|$|E

2500|$|Young's modulus is {{not always}} the same in all orientations of a material. Most metals and ceramics, along with many other materials, are isotropic, and their {{mechanical}} properties are the same in all orientations. However, metals and ceramics can be treated with certain impurities, and metals can be mechanically worked to make their grain structures directional. These materials then become anisotropic, and Young's modulus will change depending on the direction of the force vector. Anisotropy can be seen in many composites as well. For example, carbon fiber has a much higher Young's modulus (is much stiffer) when force is loaded parallel to the fibers (<b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain).</b> [...] Other such materials include wood and reinforced concrete. Engineers can use this directional phenomenon to their advantage in creating structures.|$|E
2500|$|Barrels are {{constructed}} in cooperages. The traditional method of European coopers {{has been to}} hand-split the oak into staves (or strips) <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain.</b> After the oak is split, it is allowed to [...] "season" [...] or dry outdoors while exposed to the elements. This process can take anywhere from 10 to 36 months during which time the harshest tannins from the wood are leached out. These tannins are visible as dark gray and black residue left on the ground once the staves are removed. The longer the wood is allowed to season the softer the potential wine stored in the barrels may be but this can add substantially {{to the cost of}} the barrel. In some American cooperage the wood is dried in a kiln instead of outdoor seasoning. While this method is much faster, it does not soften the tannins quite as much as outdoor seasoning.|$|E
2500|$|The {{common walnut}} {{and the black}} walnut and its allies, are {{important}} for their attractive timber, which is hard, dense, tight-grained and polishes to a very smooth finish. The colour ranges from creamy white in the sapwood to a dark chocolate colour in the heartwood. When kiln-dried, walnut wood tends toward a dull brown colour, but when air-dried can become a rich purplish-brown. Because of its colour, hardness and grain, it is a prized furniture and carving wood. Walnut burls (or [...] "burrs" [...] in Europe) are commonly used to create bowls and other turned pieces. Veneer sliced from walnut burl {{is one of the}} most valuable and highly prized by cabinet makers and prestige car manufacturers. Walnut wood has been the timber of choice for gun makers for centuries, including the Gewehr 98 and Lee–Enfield rifles of the First World War. It remains one of the most popular choices for rifle and shotgun stocks, and is generally considered to be the premium – as well as the most traditional – wood for gun stocks, due to its resilience to compression <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain.</b> Walnut is also used in lutherie and for the body of pipe organs. The wood of the butternut and related Asian species is of much lower value, softer, coarser, less strong and heavy, and paler in colour.|$|E

40|$|Thin {{titanium}} layers (approximately 10 nm) {{have been}} grown {{on top of}} a clean Si(111) substrate. Heating these layers initiates a solid state reaction, yielding an amorphous monosilicide phase at about 350 °C. The kinetics of the solid state reaction has been followed using three-wavelength ellipsometry (340, 450 and 550 nm). A very coarse two-layer model has been applied in the analyses of the measured data: a top layer of pure titanium is consumed by a second layer of TiSi. The dielectric constants of titanium and TiSi are known and the layer thicknesses d 1 and d 2 have been fitted to the six ellipsometrical angles measured. These analyses reveal a diffusion-limited growth mechanism exhibiting two growth rates: a rapid initial rate followed by a slower final rate. The diffusion coefficient D of the rapid process and its activation energy Ea could be obtained: D = 2 × 10 − 15 cm 2 s− 1 atT 370 °CandEa = 0. 62 eV The two growth rates have been attributed to silicon diffusion <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> and diffusion into <b>the</b> <b>grains.</b> ...|$|R
2500|$|Coble creep is {{a second}} form of {{diffusion}} controlled creep. In Coble creep the atoms diffuse along grain boundaries to elongate the grains along the stress axis. This causes Coble creep to have a stronger grain size dependence than Nabarro–Herring creep, thus, Coble creep will be more important in materials composed of very fine grains. For Coble creep k {{is related to the}} diffusion coefficient of atoms <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary, Q = Q(grain boundary diffusion), m = 1, and b = 3. Because Q(grain boundary diffusion) < Q(self diffusion), Coble creep occurs at lower temperatures than Nabarro–Herring creep. Coble creep is still temperature dependent, as the temperature increases so does the grain boundary diffusion. However, since the number of nearest neighbors is effectively limited along the interface of the grains, and thermal generation of vacancies along the boundaries is less prevalent, the temperature dependence is not as strong as in Nabarro–Herring creep. It also exhibits the same linear dependence on stress as Nabarro–Herring creep. Generally, the diffusional creep rate should be the sum of Nabarro–Herring creep rate and Coble creep rate. Diffusional creep leads to grain-boundary separation, that is, voids or cracks form between the grains. To heal this, grain-boundary sliding occurs. The diffusional creep rate and the grain boundary sliding rate must be balanced if there are no voids or cracks remain. When grain-boundary sliding couldn't accommodate the incompatibility, [...] grain-boundary voids are generated, which is related to the initiation of creep fracture.|$|E
