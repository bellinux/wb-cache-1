30|$|All the {{peptides}} deduced experimentally or computationally from a gene sequence/transcript will {{be assigned}} a systematic identifier {{that is the}} same as <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> identifier, except that the letter ‘t’ for transcript will be replaced by the letter ‘p’ for protein, thus <b>assuring</b> consistency with <b>the</b> gene’s locus ID and its transcript ID. For instance, the protein Os 05 p 0000300 - 01 is translated from transcript Os 05 t 0000300 - 01 that is transcribed from locus Os 05 g 0000300, which represents gene 3 on chromosome 5. In order to avoid conflicts with proteins deduced from alternatively spliced forms of <b>the</b> <b>transcripts</b> from a single locus, the protein ID must reflect <b>the</b> corresponding <b>transcript</b> from which it is deduced, except for the letter ‘t’.|$|R

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{transcription}} of chicken reticulocyte chromatin with E. coli RNA polymerase has been studied in several different ways.

The amount of globin RNA in <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> is approximately 20 fold greater than that from erythrocyte chromatin or reticulocyte DNA. Although these data {{could be used to}} support the hypothesis of specific transcription, we show by RNA/RNA self hybridization of <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> (which is at least 50 % symmetric) and by hybridization of <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> to unique DNA in vast RNA excess that the bulk of <b>the</b> chromatin <b>transcript</b> differs little from <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> of naked DNA.

3000|$|Every {{known or}} {{predicted}} form of transcript {{of a gene}} will be assigned a systematic identifier {{that will be the}} same as the locus identifier except that the letter ‘g’ for gene will be replaced by letter ‘t’ for transcript, to be added as a suffix following the two-digit chromosome identifier. This naming convention will ensure consistency in the gene’s locus ID and its transcript ID. For example, <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> Os 05 t 0000300 is transcribed by the locus Os 05 g 0000300 representing gene 3 on chromosome 5. Sometimes <b>the</b> nascent <b>transcript</b> undergoes alternative splicing. In order to clearly identify the alternatively spliced forms of <b>the</b> <b>transcripts,</b> a two-digit suffix will be added to <b>the</b> systematic <b>transcript</b> ID of <b>the</b> gene will be added, separated by a dash, e.g., - 01, - 02, - 03, [...]....- 99, in order of discovery. By default, <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> ID of <b>the</b> very first <b>transcript</b> (or <b>the</b> only <b>transcript</b> identified) will always have number “- 01 ” suffixed to <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> ID. For example, <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> ID of <b>the</b> locus Os 05 g 0000300, for which there are no known splice variants, will be Os 05 t 0000300 - 01. If there is a later report suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> from this locus undergoes alternative splicing, such that three alternative forms are created, if any one of the three forms matches <b>the</b> original <b>transcript,</b> it would retain <b>the</b> original <b>transcript</b> ID and two additional IDs would be generated, Os 05 t 0000300 - 02 and Os 05 t 0000300 - 03. Assigning the number series to the splice variants will depend on the precedence of identification, the submission to GenBank or possibly the size of the cDNA. Any additional alternative forms are numbered sequentially.|$|R
