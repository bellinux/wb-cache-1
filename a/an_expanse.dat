5|$|On 1 July, Rupert outmanoeuvred the Covenanters and Parliamentarians {{to relieve}} the city. The next day, he sought battle with them {{even though he was}} outnumbered. He was dissuaded from attacking {{immediately}} and during the day both sides gathered their full strength on Marston Moor, <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> of wild meadow west of York. Towards evening, the Covenanters and Parliamentarians themselves launched a surprise attack. After a confused fight lasting two hours, Parliamentarian cavalry under Oliver Cromwell routed the Royalist cavalry from the field and, with Leven's infantry, annihilated the remaining Royalist infantry.|$|E
5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> of green lawn, {{the plan is}} usually clearly visible at ground level, {{which is not the}} case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|During Darwin's lifetime, many {{geographical}} {{features were}} given his name. <b>An</b> <b>expanse</b> of water adjoining the Beagle Channel was named Darwin Sound by Robert FitzRoy after Darwin's prompt action, {{along with two}} or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing glacier caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats, and the nearby Mount Darwin in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday. When the Beagle was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend John Lort Stokes sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain Wickham named Port Darwin: a nearby settlement was renamed Darwin in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory.|$|E

5|$|The Mumbai Suburban Railway, popularly {{referred}} to as Locals forms {{the backbone of the}} city's transport system. It is operated by the Central Railway and Western Railway zones of the Indian Railways. Mumbai's suburban rail systems carried a total of 6.3million passengers every day in 2007. Trains are overcrowded during peak hours, with nine-car trains of rated capacity 1,700 passengers, actually carrying around 4,500 passengers at peak hours. The Mumbai rail network is spread at <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> of 319 route kilometres. 191 rakes (train-sets) of 9 car and 12 car composition are utilised to run a total of 2,226 train services in the city.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cristobal {{originated}} from a westward-tracking tropical wave which {{emerged from the}} western coast of Africa on August 14, accompanied for several days by <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> of clouds. Some cyclonic turning was evident as the disturbance approached the Leeward Islands by August 21, but a Hurricane Hunters flight tasked with investigating the system did not reveal a strong circulation at the surface. The system failed to consolidate as it traversed Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, but on August 23, further reconnaissance data confirmed {{the formation of a}} tropical depression just south of the Caicos Islands. The nascent cyclone slowly moved north-northwestward toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Moderate wind shear in the area kept convection over the depression disorganized and outflow limited, and the storm only gradually intensified. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Cristobal at 06:00UTC on August24, while located just north of Mayaguana in the Bahamas, but its structure was vertically tilted and suboptimally broad.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E

25|$|The Valley of Puebla is <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> of plains crossed by {{a number}} of small rivers, streams and arroyos, with the most {{significant}} being the Atoyac River. The Atoyac River has its beginning in the runoff of both the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatepetl volcancos. Cholula is located in the river's upper basin. This river passes through the San Pedro area and forms part of the border between San Andrés and the city of Puebla. There are also tributaries such as the Ametlapanapa, Zapatero and the Rabanillo and number of fresh water springs and seasonal arroyos.|$|E

25|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the river once abounded in flightless moa, predated upon by the Haast's eagle. The river was known by the Māori as Mata-au, meaning current or eddy in <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> of water. This name, now more {{frequently}} rendered as Matau, is still used for one of the two main channels of the Clutha delta. In the early days of European exploration there was at least one settlement of some 250-300 Māori close to the river's banks. The river takes its European name from Cluaidh, the Scots Gaelic name for the River Clyde in Scotland which runs through Glasgow. During New Zealand's early colonial history it was known as the Molyneux, that name given to it by Captain Cook. During early European settlement, a whaling station was established close to the river's mouth, and during this period the sea was the source of almost all of the area's economy.|$|E

25|$|One theory, Revelation Draft Hypothesis, {{sees the}} book of Revelation {{constructed}} by forming parallels with several texts in the Old Testament such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, Zechariah, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Exodus, and Daniel. For example, Ezekiel's encounter with God is in reverse order as John's encounter with God (Ezek 1:5-28; Rev 4:2-7; note both accounts have beings with faces of a lion, ox or calf, man, and eagle (Ezek 1:10; Rev 4:7), both accounts have <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> before the throne (Ezek 1:22; Rev 4:6). The chariot's horses in Zechariah's are the same colors as the four horses in Revelation (Zech 6:1-8; Rev 6:1-8). The nesting of the seven marches around Jericho by Joshua is reenacted by Jesus nesting the seven trumpets within the seventh seal (Josh 6:8-10; Rev 6:1-17; 8:1-9:21; 11:15-19). The description of the beast in Revelation is taken directly out of Daniel (see Dan 7:2-8; Rev 13:1-7). The method that John used allowed him to use the Hebrew Scriptures as the source and also use basic techniques of parallel formation, thereby alluding to the Hebrew Scriptures.|$|E
25|$|The {{valley floor}} is <b>an</b> <b>expanse</b> of plains crossed {{by a number}} of small rivers, streams and arroyos, with the most {{significant}} being the Atoyac River. The Atoyac River has its beginning in the runoff of both the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatepetl volcanoes. The area has an average altitude of 2,190masl, with a gentle descent from northwest to southeast along the Atoyac River. There are two main elevations: the Zapotecas Mountain, which rises about 200 meters over the valley and the Tecajetes, which rises 210 meters. There is mountain biking and motocross on the Zapotecas Mountain as well as parasailing at the San Bernardino Chalchilhuapan Mountain. Each year, there is a mountain biking event just north of the city in March in three categories: beginners, advanced and expert. The race begins from the main plaza of Cholula and extends for 50km through a number of small communities. The Zapotecas Mountain is important culturally as well, figuring in a number of local myths and legends, including one about a man who made a pact with a demon in order to obtain money to sponsor a religious festival.|$|E
