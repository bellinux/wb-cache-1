500|$|Brian Fairbanks {{differed}} {{in his opinion}} of Lazenby, saying that the film [...] "gives us a James Bond capable of vulnerability, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> show fear and is not immune to heartbreak. Lazenby is that man, and his performance is superb." [...] Fairbanks also thought On Her Majesty's Secret Service to be [...] "not only the best Bond, {{it is also the}} last truly great film in the series. In fact, had the decision been made to end the series, this would have been the perfect final chapter." ...|$|E
500|$|James Chapman {{considers}} that Lazenby looks {{the part of}} Bond, identifying his athleticism and [...] "arrogant swagger", which [...] "convey the snobbery of the character". Chapman also distinguished a more vulnerable and human characterisation in Bond—feeling exhausted and falling in love—as opposed to the [...] "heroic superman" [...] of Connery. Brian Fairbanks noted that [...] "OHMSS gives us a James Bond capable of vulnerability, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> show fear and is not immune to heartbreak. Lazenby is that man, and his performance is superb". Ben Macintyre also observed {{that of all the}} Bonds, Lazenby's characterisation was closest to that of Fleming's original character.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Mickey Rapkin {{considered}} Roma to be {{the central}} character of the play, describing him as [...] "the salesman’s salesman, a shark in a sharkskin suit". Mantegna has stated that he feels Roma is not a [...] "sleazy" [...] character, but simply <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> convince customers {{to follow through on}} their dreams. Reviewing a 2012 revival at the La Jolla Playhouse, Charles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times compared Roma to a Giacomo Casanova-type figure, adding that [...] "when Roma puts the moves on a prospective buyer, it's as though he's making love to them". While interviewing actor Aidan Gillen, The Guardian Mark Lawson felt that Roma was an amoral character, considering him a [...] "super-schmoozer". Gillen, then portraying the character in the Apollo Theatre in London, described him as a [...] "cunt with a romantic, poetic streak".|$|E
500|$|William J. Bell created Victor as a [...] "despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser". The soap opera's {{official}} website notes: [...] "Victor is loving and protective toward family and loved ones, but if crossed, or if Victor feels {{that one is}} {{not living up to}} one's full potential; then he can more than live up to the adjective that many have used to describe him ruthless." [...] The Los Angeles Times characterizes him as [...] "charming but complicated", while others publications have described him as a villain, as well as an evil, powerful and ruthless character. Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote that Victor is a male chauvinist. Although he is often considered malicious, Braeden stated that [...] "Bill Bell was a very wise man" [...] and that [...] "he created someone in Victor who is a very lonely man yet also <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> be affectionate and loving and forgiving". Shelly Fralic of the Winnipeg Free Press described Victor in 2009, stating: ...|$|E
500|$|Beecham {{has been}} much quoted. In 1929, {{the editor of a}} music journal wrote, [...] "The stories {{gathered}} around Sir Thomas Beecham are innumerable. Wherever musicians come together, he is likely {{to be one of the}} topics of conversation. Everyone telling a Beecham story tries to imitate his manner and his tone of voice." [...] A book, Beecham Stories, was published in 1978 consisting entirely of his bons mots and anecdotes about him. Some are variously attributed to Beecham or one or more other people, including Arnold Bax and Winston Churchill; Neville Cardus admitted to inventing some himself. Among the Beecham lines that are reliably attributed are, [...] "A musicologist is <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> read music but can't hear it"; his maxim, [...] "There are only two things requisite so far as the public is concerned for a good performance: that is for the orchestra to begin together and end together; in between it doesn't matter much"; and his remark at his 70th birthday celebrations after telegrams were read out from Strauss, Stravinsky and Sibelius: [...] "Nothing from Mozart?" ...|$|E

500|$|Kyla's [...] "no-nonsense" [...] {{personality}} {{has led to}} {{mixed reviews}} in the press. A number of episodes central to her storylines have been reviewed by various publications as televisual 'picks of the day' - from her introductory episode, {{to the death of}} her husband, to the surprise return of her former boyfriend Abra. Her [...] "fiery" [...] stance resulted in the assessment that, from a viewing perspective, the character [...] "has never been one of the more likeable members of staff", however her descent into alcoholism drew some more sympathetic reviews, with Linda Gibson of TV Quick writing of the character: [...] "Let's hope that Kyla pulls herself together, gets her son back and meets <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> give her what she wants." [...] Conversely, Daily Mirror TV critic Jim Shelley opined that the character had formerly been one of the more [...] "normal" [...] and [...] "reliable" [...] members of the cast, but criticized the handling of her alcoholism storyline, stating that the character seemed to have become an alcoholic [...] "overnight".|$|E
500|$|The book {{is divided}} into five chapters. Each chapter {{is divided into}} five parts, each {{describing}} events {{from the perspective of}} one of the five main characters: Karen, Rick, Luke, Rachel, and Player One. The first chapter, [...] "Hour One: Cue the Flaming Zeppelin", has Karen arriving at the Toronto airport on a flight from Winnipeg to meet a man she met online. She sits on a stool at the airport hotel bar in which Rick is the bartender, Rachel is at a computer terminal, and Luke is sitting at a table drinking scotch. Rachel is there with the expectation to meet <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> father her child and approaches Luke. Karen's date goes badly as she finds the man too assertive physically and too distant intellectually. A self-help guru, Leslie Freemont, enters with his assistant Tara to welcome Rick into his empowerment program; Leslie gives a speech to the group, takes Rick's money, and leaves. Meanwhile, oil prices rapidly increase and explosions start to occur outside. With the power unreliable, Karen, Rick, Luke, and Rachel run to Rick's vehicle to listen to the radio. Karen's date, Warren, is killed by a sniper as he runs to the group, who quickly return to the bar lounge where they barricade themselves in.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Gulf News, Vikram spoke of the challenges in portraying all three characters while wearing the same costumes. He said, [...] "I love such challenges. [...] Although the costume defined {{each of the three}} characters in Anniyan, there were scenes where Ambi would suddenly become Remo and Remo would become Anniyan. There I made it dramatic to bring out each character." [...] He credited his wife Shailaja Balakrishnan, a psychologist, for helping him in fleshing out the character of Ambi, a person who has multiple personality disorder. In a conversation with film critic Baradwaj Rangan, Shailaja recalled the times the film was being made and spoke of Vikram, saying, [...] "I felt we should live in two houses. It's not easy to live with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> get that eccentric, an actor who wants to be that difficult on himself. I wouldn't say he becomes the character, but there's definitely some kind of internalisation." [...] Vikram confessed that he had a tough time during the film's making as playing different characters affected him and he found himself going mad. He added that he would take a break after a 15-day shoot and watch the pigeons on his terrace as a way of dealing with the pressure.|$|E

He never brushed up". In the final verse the lyrics state, [...] "And if the man can't dance/He gets no second chance"; a reference to her refusal to date men if they cannot dance. In an interview Dixon explained in further detail about the lyric, saying [...] "I have to be honest, I do like <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> dance, but it's not a deal-breaker.
