The result showed that with deregulation of the downstream oil sector, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>levies</b> on importation <b>of</b> petroleum would hike the price of domestic sales of petroleum.

40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of tax compliance behavior from the tax morale standpoint. We grounded our research {{on the idea that}} empirical studies constantly invalidating the assumptions of theoretical models of tax evasion show there are more factors influencing compliance than just the economic ones (e. g., audit probability, fine, tax rate, income). Giving the fact that audit probabilities are generally very low and that tax evasion is not as high as one could expect, tax morale might {{have to do with the}} high degrees of tax compliance registered around the world. In a stream of articles on taxation published beginning with the late 60 n# 8217;s, tax morale defined as the intrinsic motivation to comply or n# 8220;internalised obligation to pay taxn# 8221; (Braithwaite and Ahmed 2005) has been found to positively relate to tax compliance and negatively relate to shadow economy. This paper attempts to offer a broader view on the influence of tax morale on compliance behavior, covering articles ranging from national and cross-cultural surveys to experimental games.

40|$|By {{using an}} {{overlapping}} generations (OLG) {{model in the}} context of the production economy, this paper shows that public debt lowers the future generation’s well-being even in the situation of imperfect employment equilibrium. According to the dynamically extended multiplier theory, which has a rigorous microeconomic foundation, the effect of the redemption of public debt is equivalent to that of the balanced-budget multiplier because the redemption increases autonom-ous spending by old generation while the same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> tax is <b>levied</b> on the young generation. Thus, the aggregate disposable income remains before the issuance since the value of the ba-lanced-budget multiplier is unity. However, it is evident that real GDP before tax reduction in-creases; it costs more resources to earn the same disposable income. Therefore, it is unavoidable that the issuance of public debt impairs the welfare of future generation even in a Keynesian framework...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The main aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the compensation-betterment issue in the process of {{granting}} compensation for compulsory acquisition of land. This situation is the opposite of the decline in the value of a retained land (injurious affection and severance). The paper focuses on the concept of betterment off-set for the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> compensation with the analysis from the Polish point of view. In the first part of the paper a definition of the term “betterment off-setting ” is presented and evaluated. Then three approaches to betterment are discussed: betterment set off rule as a general rule, a betterment deduction rule limited only to compensation for injurious affection and severance and the lack of betterment provisions. The paper briefly evaluates each of these approaches. Further the Polish approach to betterment in the context of compensation provisions is discussed. On the basis of such examination the paper presents the fairest method of recapturing the enhanced value of land. In this optimal method recapturing provisions should be separated from the expropriation provisions. Moreover the development agreement supported by development contribution seems to serve as the main tool of recapturing. The method discussed resolves also the problem of a public project (ex. subway) increasing the value of not only the land adjacent to the acquired land but also of the further parcels. I suggest that deduction of compensation equal to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure <b>levy</b> should be allowed only when a landowner demands it. Finally the paper suggests that only betterment charges can successfully deal with the increase in the value of private property accrued by public project...|$|R
40|$|Given {{demands on}} public funding, the {{question}} arises whether agricultural research should be {{the responsibility of the}} public or private sectors, or whether the state should play a facilitating role. These issues are studied using the management and success of R&D in the South African Sugar Industry as an example. The usual answer is that research should be publicly funded if it is a public good and privately funded if a private good. It is shown that even if aspects of research have clear public good characteristics, then it is still possible to internalise externalities. Sugar cane farmers pay a <b>levy</b> <b>of</b> about 1. 0 % {{of the value of the}} crop to finance their R&D package, which includes research, training and extension. The sugar growers decide on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the <b>levy</b> themselves. A possible reason why sugar farmers agree to this levy is that a bottom-up multidisciplinary research programme is followed in which they have a direct say. Scientists from different disciplines work together on a single crop. The South African government should consider the Dutch example where the role of government has shifted from administrator of institutions to stimulator (sponsor) of research. Government should thus still play a critical role in R&D funding in South Africa and there is concern that State funding has declined. Private incentives for research may be weaker in the case of generic research with broad applications across commodities. However, in the latter case it will be expected that different commodity organisations will embark on joint projects as has happened in the past.
