All the reference tests suffer from specific limitations. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop easy to use diagnostic tool for screening of hereditary spherocytosis based on routinely acquired haematological parameters like percentage of microcytes, percentage of hypochromic cells, reticulocyte counts, and percentage of immature reticulocytes. The levels of haemoglobin, mean cell volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, reticulocytes (Ret), immature reticulocytes fraction (IRF), hypochromic erythrocytes (Hypo-He) and microcytic erythrocytes (MicroR) were determined on EDTA samples on Sysmex instruments from a cohort of 45 confirmed SH. The HS group was then compared with haemolytical disorders, microcytic anaemia, healthy individuals and routine samples ([*]=[*] 1, 488). HS is characterised by a high Ret count without an equally elevated IRF. All 45 HS have Ret > 80, 000 /μl and Ret(10 /L) /IRF (%) greater than 7. 7 (rule 1). Trait and mild HS had a Ret/IRF ratio greater than 19. Moderate and severe HS had increased MicroR and MicroR/Hypo-He (rule 2). Combination of both rules gave predictive positive value and negative predictive value of respectively 75 % and 100 % ([*]=[*] 1, 488), which is much greater than single parameters or existing rules. This simple and fast diagnostic method could be used as an excellent screening tool for HS.

5000|$|The third {{sensitization}} {{model can}} occur in women of blood type O. The immune response to A and B antigens, that are widespread in the environment, usually leads {{to the production of}} IgM or IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies early in life. Women of blood type O are more prone than women of types A and B to making IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies, and these IgG antibodies are able to cross the placenta. For unknown reasons, the incidence of maternal antibodies against type A and B antigens of the IgG type that could potentially cause hemolytic disease of the newborn is greater than the observed incidence of [...] "ABO disease." [...] About 15% of pregnancies involve a type O mother and a type A or type B child; only 3% of these pregnancies result in hemolytic disease due to A/B/O incompatibility. In contrast to antibodies to A and B antigens, Rhesus antibodies are generally not produced from exposure to environmental antigens. In cases where there is <b>ABO</b> <b>incompatibility</b> and Rh incompatibility, the risk of alloimmunization is decreased because fetal red blood cells are removed from maternal circulation due to anti-ABO antibodies before they can trigger an anti-Rh response.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Hyperbilirubinemia {{is common}} in neonates; it can have a serious rising course. Due to its {{critical}} morbidity called "kernicterus", severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia causes which lead to exchange transfusion, should be clarified. This descriptive cross sectional study performed with reviewing of files of 118 neonates weighting 2 kg and more who had exchange transfusion in pediatrics ward at Ghaem training hospital in Mashhad from April 2004 to March 2007. Among 118 patients, 75 (63. 6 %) were male, and 43 patients (36. 4 %) were female. The {{most common cause of}} exchange transfusion was <b>ABO</b> <b>incompatibility</b> (38. 1 %). In order of frequency, unknown etiology (25. 4 %), Rh incompatibility (16. 1 %) with no immune hydrops, Sepsis (8. 5 %), urinary tract infection (5. 1 %) and others (3. 4 %) (Including Crigler-Najjar and cephalohematoma) were next ones. Vaginal delivery and exclusive breast feeding were detected as associated factors. Mean serum bilirubin levels was 28. 7 mg/dl (SD. 9. 2) <b>ABO</b> <b>incompatibility.</b> <b>ABO</b> <b>incompatibility</b> was the main cause of exchange transfusion.

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{cause of}} {{hyperbilirubinemia}} cannot {{be found in}} about 45 &#x 0025; of cases of neonatal jaundice. Gilbert syndrome (GS) {{is the most common}} congenital disease associated with bilirubin metabolism in the liver. Since the screening value of genetic tests cannot be fully determined until accurate data on the prevalence and penetrance of the GS genotype are known, we sought to estimate whether the prevalence of GS is higher in the parents of neonates with severe unexplained indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Design and Setting: Case-control study of parents of neonates with severe unexplained indirect hyperbilirubinemia admitted to a neonatal ward. Methods: We used the rifampin test (checked bilirubin before and 4 hours after administration of 600 mg rifampin) for diagnosis of GS in parents of 115 neonates with severe unexplained indirect hyperbilirubinemia. We compared the prevalence of GS in these parents with that of a control group of 115 couples referred for premarital counseling. Results: The 115 neonates were aged 5. 2 (1. 6) days (mean, standard deviation), all were breast-fed, and males constituted 56. 5 &#x 0025;. Mean total serum bilirubin (TSB) level was 20. 96 (5. 48) mg/dL. 14. 8 &#x 0025; were glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency was present in 14. 8 &#x 0025;, and 10. 4 &#x 0025; had A, B or O blood group (<b>ABO)</b> <b>incompatibilities</b> with their mothers. There was no difference in the prevalence of GS between parents of the group with hyperbilirubinemia (22. 2 &#x 0025;) and the control group (19. 13 &#x 0025;) (P =. 42). Mean TSB in neonates with parents who had GS was more (about 3 mg/dL) than in neonates with normal parents (P =. 004). Fathers had GS twice as often as the mothers among the parents of neonates with hyperbilirubinemia (P =. 003), among the control group (P =. 009) and among neonates (P =. 014). Conclusion: This study showed that GS cannot cause severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia by itself, but it may have a summative effect on rising bilirubin when combined with other factors, for example, G 6 PD. Our results showed that in GS, males are affected about twice as much as the females...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>ABO</b> <b>incompatibility</b> {{hemolytic}} {{disease of}} the newborn is a common cause of clinical jaundice and causes two-thirds of the hemolytic disease in newborns. This study was undertaken to determine the frequency of <b>ABO</b> <b>incompatibility</b> hemolytic disease and its complications in newborns undergoing exchange transfusion. Methods: This prospective and descriptive study was performed in jaundiced newborn infants during a three-year period. Inclusion criteria were: maternal blood type O, newborn blood type A or B, rising indirect hyperbilirubinemia {{in the first two}} days of life, positive immunohematologic test for newborns and exchange transfusion. Exclusion criteria were: incomplete information, other accompanying diseases that induce hyperbilirubinemia. All newborn infants received phototherapy before and after exchange transfusion. We did not use intravenous immunoglobulin, hemoxygenase inhibitor drugs and blood products before exchange transfusion. Results: Double-volume exchange transfusion via umbilical cord catheter was performed in 96 patients, 19 (20 %) of whom suffered from <b>ABO</b> <b>incompatibility.</b> Of these 19 newborns, two-thirds (13) were preterm infants. The minimum level of serum bilirubin was 10 mg/dl and the maximum serum bilirubin level was 35 mg/dl. In six patients (32 %) serum bilirubin levels were &gt; 25 mg/dl. The most common blood group was type A for newborns.

40|$|Anemia in {{neonatal}} period is rare, {{with the common}} causes being Rh and <b>ABO</b> blood group <b>incompatibility,</b> hemorrhagic disease of newborn, congenital hemolytic anemia, hemoglobinopathies, and TORCH (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes virus) infections. Congenital leukemia and infantile osteopetrosis (OP) are among the rare causes of neonatal anemia. A {{review of the literature}} shows approximately 200 reported cases of congenital leukemia. Articles describing the imaging features of congenital leukemia are still rarer. Infantile OP, another rare disorder with a reported incidence of 1 in 250, 000 has characteristic imaging features, which are diagnostic of the disease. We report a case each, of two rare diseases: Congenital leukemia and infantile osteopetrosis. Additionally, our report highlights the radiological and imaging features of congenital leukemia and infantile OP and their crucial role in arriving at an early diagnosis...|$|R

Donor-recipient <b>ABO</b> and/or HLA <b>incompatibility</b> used to lead to donor decline. Development of alternative transplantation programs enabled transplantation of incompatible couples. How did that influence couple characteristics? Between 2000 and 2014, 1232 living donor transplantations have been performed. In conventional and ABO-incompatible transplantation the willing donor becomes an actual donor for the intended recipient. In kidney-exchange and domino-donation the donor donates indirectly to the intended recipient. The relationship between the donor and intended recipient was studied. There were 935 conventional and 297 alternative program transplantations. There were 66 ABO-incompatible, 68 domino-paired, 62 kidney-exchange, and 104 altruistic donor transplantations.

40|$|Although {{criteria}} for living kidney donations have greatly evolved {{in recent years}} with acceptance of related and unrelated donors, an immunological incompatibility, between a living donor and his intended recipient, could impede up to 40 % of such procedures. To avoid refusal of willing and healthy living donors, different strategies have emerged to overcome immunological <b>incompatibilities.</b> <b>ABO</b> incompatible kidney transplantation can now be achieved with identical outcomes to compatible/identical kidney transplantation and kidney paired donation is the safest way for HLA-incompatible patients to undergo kidney transplantation. Implemented with success in many countries either as national or multiple regional independent programs, kidney paired donation could include simple exchanges between any number of incompatible pairs, incorporate compatible pairs and non-directed donors to start a chain of compatible transplantations, lead to acceptance of ABO-incompatible matching, and integrate desensitizing protocols. Incorporating all these variations, kidney paired donation {{has been able to}} facilitate kidney transplantation in up to 49 % of registered patients from incompatible pairs...|$|R
