5|$|The {{music for}} Flower {{was created by}} Vincent Diamante, a video game music {{composer}} and professor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Southern</b> California's Interactive Media Division. He had previously scored the music for Cloud, Chen's first game, and Dyadin {{when they were both}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Southern</b> California. He worked directly with the development team to integrate the music into the game by adjusting the placements of flowers and the tones that each type played when they were reached. He did this by harmonizing the gameplay with the music, and adjusting the music dynamically to correspond to changes in the game world. Diamante used his music to influence the development team in adapting ideas he had for the game.|$|E
