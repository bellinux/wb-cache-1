5|$|Bars and {{restaurants}} are considered strictly liable for their patrons' behavior, and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if <b>a</b> <b>customer</b> engages in illegal activity (e.g. fighting, public urination) after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop liability and social host liability, wherein the server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable {{if that person}} then causes death or injury to a third party in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate liability, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating civil rights laws.|$|E

In both episodes, Jim and Dwight hit a snag as the new heads of the Party Planning Committee when they forget Kelly's birthday. In the first episode, Andy develops a crush on <b>a</b> <b>customer,</b> and in the second episode, Angela's unhealthy obsession with her cats is spotlighted when she installs a nanny cam.|$|E

5|$|Ice had to {{be stored}} at {{multiple}} points between harvesting and its final use by <b>a</b> <b>customer.</b> One method for doing this was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at regional depots after it had been shipped out. Early ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|E

50|$|The {{service order}} process {{utilizes}} the USOC, USO and Field Identifiers (FIDs), to provision, bill and maintain services and equipment. Universal Service Order or USO Codes {{are used by}} telecommunications service providers to collect and structure all the information needed for service activation, including ordering, provisioning, service assurance and billing. USOC codes, also known as rate elements, are used by telecommunications service providers to identify each billable element of <b>a</b> <b>customer’s</b> service. Field Identifiers or FIDs are used by telecommunications service providers to identify a billing preference or attribute of <b>a</b> <b>customer’s</b> account. FIDs define the technical parameters required to provision and bill <b>a</b> <b>customer’s</b> service beyond those described in USOCs.|$|R
5|$|Khalifa {{entered the}} pornographic film {{industry}} in October 2014.

Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves <b>a</b> <b>customer,</b> holding his nose like that of a pig, while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. The {{surgeons}} and barbers had been a single profession since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when the surgeons broke away to form the Company of Surgeons. Bowls on the windowsill contain blood from the day's patients.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} slogans of the Whopper advertised by Burger King was There are 1024 ways to have a Whopper; the claim {{is based on an}} exponential function of whether the sandwich has the ingredient or not, represented by a binary number of 0 or 1, raised to the power of number of possible ingredients at the time, ten, thus 210 =1,024. This claim was later expanded to There are 221,184 possible ways for <b>a</b> <b>customer</b> to order a Whopper sandwich.

5|$|While Reich was in Arizona in May 1956, {{one of his}} {{associates}} sent an accumulator part through the mail to another state, {{in violation of the}} injunction, after an FDA inspector posing as <b>a</b> <b>customer</b> requested it. Reich and another associate, Dr. Michael Silvert, were charged with contempt of court; Silvert had been looking after the inventory in Reich's absence. Reich at first refused to attend court, and was arrested and held for two days until a supporter posted bail of $30,000.|$|E
5|$|Yumemi is very {{adamant about}} {{protecting}} humans and is happiest {{when she is}} helping those she serves.

Protecting humans is her top priority and will even ignore previous orders to make sure no human is harmed when in her care.|$|E

This is likewise also true for digital subscriber lines (DSL).|$|R
