5|$|David A. Wheeler's paper How to Prevent {{the next}} Heartbleed {{analyzes}} why Heartbleed wasn't discovered earlier, and suggests several techniques {{which could have}} led to a faster identification, as well as techniques which could have reduced its impact.

Wheeler highlights that a single general-purpose test suite could serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>base</b> <b>for</b> all TLS implementations.|$|E
