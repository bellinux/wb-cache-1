This is distinct from countries which have not abolished the right to inherit titles, but which do not grant legal recognition or protection to them, such as Germany and Italy, although Germany recognizes their use {{as part of the}} legal surname. Still other countries and authorities allow their use, but forbid <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> any <b>privilege</b> thereto, e.g., Finland, Norway and the European Union, while French law also protects lawful titles against usurpation.|$|R

40|$|Many lawyers {{believe that}} ethical duties of {{confidentiality}} and zealousness {{require them to}} assert attorney-client privilege as aggressively as they assert a criminal defendant’s lack of guilt. They treat client information {{as if it is}} “privileged until proven unprivileged,” even though it is the claimant <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> that has the evidentiary burden of showing that all the legal elements <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> are met. Ordinarily, the adversary system works well to expose and control frivolous claims, but challenges to frivolous claims <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> face unique obstacles. Challengers must operate “in the dark,” without the detailed knowledge of the communication needed to determine whether it really is privileged and whether its strategic value justifies the expense of opposition. This has made it easy and advantageous for lawyers to make frivolous claims <b>of</b> attorney-client <b>privilege,</b> despite the threat of court-imposed sanctions. Such abusive claims <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> decrease the quality of justice by preventing consideration of relevant evidence and increase the cost of litigation by forcing expensive collateral litigation around privilege claims. The strategic advantage of frivolous claims <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> combined with the inadequacy of the adversary system to discover and sanction such claims suggests that the rules of ethics could serve as a counter-balance. Yet, our existing ethical rules actually seem to encourage lawyers to make frivolous, “knee-jerk” claims <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> by emphasizing the ethical duties of confidentiality and zealous representation. Against this, I argue that a limit to claims <b>of</b> attorney-client <b>privilege</b> should be understood as implicit in the existing Model Rules <b>of</b> Attorney-Client <b>Privilege</b> and that explicit ethical limits of the kind proposed in the article will not undermine confidentiality. However, an effective ethical limit requires that useful guidance about what constitutes a frivolous claim <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> can be provided. I condense an analysis of cases in which lawyers have been either legally sanctioned or ethically disciplined for making such claims into a proposed added Comment to Model Rule 3. 1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions) ...|$|R

Moreover, the <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> the posterosuperior capsule may contribute to the stability of the glenohumeral joint.(Nimura and Akita 2013) Recently, it has been though that anatomical knowledge regarding the relatively wide <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> the joint capsule could be helpful for the understanding the joint stabilizing in other joints.(Nasu et al. 2017; Nimura et al. 2014; Sato et al. 2018; Shimura et al. 2016) However, the anterior and inferior <b>attachments</b> <b>of</b> the articular capsule, which is generally referred as the inferior glenohumeral ligament, on the humerus has been remained controversial. Furthermore, the relationship between the width <b>of</b> the capsular <b>attachment</b> and the thickness of the corresponding midsubstance of the capsule has not been assessed. If the wide <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> the capsule were shown to correspond to the thick capsule in the whole capsule, the anatomical significance <b>of</b> the wide <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> the capsule could be understood and useful for the selection of the operative procedures.|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{challenges}} in educating about issues <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> {{have been documented}} in the academic literature. To address many of those challenges, this paper outlines a pedagogical model that combines a modified form of intergroup dialogue, called cross-privilege dialogue, with single identity caucusing to engage participants in exploring their personal embodiment <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> and their barriers to engaging in ally behavior. The paper identifies specific issues that arose in implementing the pedagogy and theorizes a process from resistance to praxis that combines critical self-awareness with action to assist students in {{understanding the importance of}} both. 2 While the academic community has focused increasing attention on issues <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> {{in the last couple of}} decades (Manglitz, 2003; Ore, 2006), most of the writing has focused on defining various forms <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> and how those forms function to maintain inequality (Goodman, 2001...|$|R
