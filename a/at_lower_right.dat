5|$|The six {{commonly}} recognised metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. Five {{elements are}} less frequently so classified: carbon, aluminium, selenium, polonium, and astatine. On a standard periodic table, all eleven {{are in a}} diagonal area in the p-block extending from boron at the upper left to astatine <b>at</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right,</b> along the dividing line between metals and nonmetals shown on some periodic tables.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} was {{illustrated}} with paintings by the Swiss artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm, engraved by W. Angus and aquatinted. Grimm {{had lived in}} England since 1768, and was quite a famous artist, costing 2½ guineas per week. In the event, he stayed in Selborne for 28 days, and White recorded that he worked very hard on 24 of them. White also described Grimm's method, which was to sketch the landscape in lead pencil, then {{to put in the}} shading, and finally to add a light wash of watercolour. The illustrations were engraved (signed <b>at</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right)</b> by a variety of engravers including William Angus and Peter Mazell.|$|E

500|$|The faint {{lines in}} the field around the continents {{represent}} various ocean currents, with the Gulf Stream to the upper right of the reverse. [...] Swiatek and Breen speculate that the reason ocean currents were shown was to symbolize the trade routes between the continents. [...] They also consider the design to have an Art Deco look, though noting that the lettering has more of an older, Art Nouveau appearance. [...] Beach's monogram, CB made into a circle, is found <b>at</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> of the reverse.|$|E
500|$|The {{black-and-white}} ribbon drawing above {{shows the}} large, twisted beta sheet (arrows) of ribonuclease, flanked by several alpha-helices (spirals). The shorter S-peptide piece is behind, starting at upper {{left with a}} helix and ending with the chain break (between residues 20-21) <b>at</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right.</b> The active site for RNA cleavage (in the groove at center front in this drawing) involves one histidine side chain from the S-peptide fragment and another from the S-protein part. The computer image shows superimposed structures of ribonuclease S and A, with the S-peptide in gold and the active site histidines in hot pink. [...] The close match of the 3D structures shows that the 2-fragment S system does indeed fold to the active form (...) [...]|$|E
500|$|The obverse {{features}} {{a portrait of}} McLoughlin, facing left. [...] The name of his adopted country overarches him, and his name and HALF DOLLAR are below him, with the centennial dates and IN GOD WE TRUST flanking his bust. [...] Fraser had no likenesses of McLoughlin to work with, and what she based her portrait of him on is unclear. It shows him as an older man than the 41 years {{he was at the}} time of Fort Vancouver's founding. The reverse shows an armed frontiersman, dressed in buckskins, with the stockade of Fort Vancouver behind him, and Mt. Hood in the distance. The inscription is somewhat broken up, but is intended to be read as FORT VANCOUVER CENTENNIAL VANCOUVER WASHINGTON FOUNDED 1825 BY HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY. Numismatists have debated whether the absence of a mint mark was intentional; it is the only commemorative coin issue struck at Denver or San Francisco that lacks one. The artist's initials, LGF, are <b>at</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> on the reverse, {{on the other side of}} the circle from the date 1825.|$|E
