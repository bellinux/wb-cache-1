5|$|A land {{of green}} fields for crop {{cultivation}} and cattle rearing limits the space {{available for the}} establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy,</b> which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy</b> had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.|$|E

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced {{in an attempt to}} stabilise the market. There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming and increasing mechanisation. The UK joined the European Economic Community in 1972. Some sectors became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the Common <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy</b> from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. A dual farm structure emerged with large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings.|$|E
5|$|Rau {{grew up in}} {{a suburb}} of Stuttgart, where early on he became active in socialist youth organizations. After {{military}} service in World War I, he participated in the German Revolution of 1918-19. From 1920 onward, he was a leading <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> maker of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). This ended in 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power. Shortly afterward Rau was thrown in jail for two years. As an enemy of the Nazi regime in Germany he was imprisoned, in total, {{for more than half of}} the time of Hitler's reign. After his first imprisonment he emigrated in 1935 to the Soviet Union (USSR). From there, in 1937, he went on to Spain, where he participated in the Spanish Civil War as a leader of one of the International Brigades. In 1939, he was arrested in France, and was delivered by the Vichy regime back to Nazi Germany in 1942. After a few months in a Gestapo prison, he was transferred to the Mauthausen Concentration Camp in March 1943. While in the concentration camp he participated in conspiratorial prisoner activities, which led to a camp uprising in the final days before the end of World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76–77 {{per cent}} of output by value was {{livestock}} farming and, although this {{has fallen to}} about 64 per cent since 1990, arable farming remains {{a minority of the}} sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture. One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where farming is overwhelmingly arable. The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish farming. A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the Common <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy</b> (CAP) of the EU, which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill sheep farming, became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming, the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to fish farming and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, almost ten times the average.|$|E
40|$|Journal articleBackground. Diet-related chronic {{diseases}} {{are now a}} serious global public health problem. Public health groups are calling for the agricultural sector to play {{a greater role in}} tackling the threat. Objective. To identify potential points of policy intervention in the agricultural sector that could be leveraged to promote healthy diets and tackle obesity and diet related {{chronic diseases}}. Methods. A review of the literature on the dietary implications of agriculture, a conceptual analysis of the issues, and the identification of relevant examples. Results. There are two main potential points of intervention in the agricultural sector that could be leveraged to promote healthy diets: <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> and <b>agricultural</b> production practices. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> and practices affect diet through their influence on food availability, price, and nutrient quality, which in turn affects food choices available to consumers. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> amenable to intervention include input, production, and trade policies; agricultural production practices amenable to intervention include crop breeding, crop fertilization practices, livestock-feeding practices, and crop systems diversity. Conclusions. It is well-known that <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> and production practices influence what farmers choose to grow. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> and production practices could also play a role in influencing what consumers choose to eat. To identify how <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> and practices can usefully contribute toward promoting healthy diets and tackling obesity and diet-related chronic diseases, health policymakers need to examine whether current <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> and production practices are contributing to—or detracting from—efforts to attain dietary goals; where and how could agricultural intervention help achieve dietary goals; and whether there are trade-offs between these interventions and other important concerns, such as undernutrition and the livelihoods of agricultural producers. Given the potential of agriculture to contribute to large-scale, population-level dietary improvements, these questions warrant closer attention from health policymakers. ISI; IFPRI 3 P...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} occurrence and grade of policy convergence in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> of OECD countries. Based on various concepts of policy convergence four social mechanisms can be identified that justify the expectation that convergence of <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> since the mid 1980 s has occurred: similar problem pressure due to surpluses and budget problems, pressure toward harmonization through integration of agricultural trade into GATT/WTO, EU enlargement, and transnational communication in the OECD. Two expectations are tested {{on the base of}} OECD country data for the years 1986 to 2004 : Convergence mechanisms lead to a) decreasing and more similar levels of support for agricultural producers and b) a structural shift in the pattern of support toward less trade distorting measures. Empirical findings support the expected direction of policy convergence (delta convergence). However, <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> of OECD countries have not grown more similar, the data do not confirm the expectation of sigma convergence. Against this background, causes of and conditions favouring enduring international differences in <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> are discussed...|$|R
