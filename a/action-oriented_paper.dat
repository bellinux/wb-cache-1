To unravel the various layers of the policy, the paper proceeds in three steps: firstly, it lays out some facts pertaining to the origins of the ENP, as its ‘origins ’ arguably account for a number of the core tensions. It then presents the underlying logic and objectives attributed to JHA cooperation, which can be derived from the viewpoints voiced during policy formulation. The paper goes on to argue that despite the existence of different logics, there is a unifying objective, which is to ‘extra-territorialise ’ the management of ‘threats ’ to the neighbouring countries. The core of the paper presents the various policy measures that have been put in place to achieve external ‘threat management’. In this context it is argued that the ’conditionality-inspired policy instruments’, namely monitoring and benchmarking of progress, transfer of legal and institutional models to non-member states and inter-governmental negotiations, contain socialisation elements that rely on the common values approach. This mix of conditionality and socialisation instruments is illustrated in two case studies, one on the fight against terrorism and one on irregular migration. Finally, the paper recommends that the EU draft an <b>Action-Oriented</b> <b>Paper</b> (AOP) on JHA cooperation with the ENP countries that indicates how the EU intends to balance the conflicting objectives and instruments that are currently present in the JHA provisions of the ENP.

40|$|Action {{research}} {{has a long}} history in the field of management and organisation studies. Since Lewin’s original work to develop the processes of action research, the approach has been applied {{to a wide variety of}} research problems and in a host of different organisational contexts. Furthermore, a range of variants of action {{research has}} developed, including action science, action learning, participatory action research and many others. In more recent years, there have been calls for greater use of action-oriented research approaches to help increase the relevance of management research to the community of practising managers. However, despite these developments, action researchers still face significant challenges in publishing their research. This paper undertakes an empirical review of the volume of research published in action research as compared to other research methods. If the management research community aims to achieve a macro-level change by adopting more <b>action-oriented</b> research, this <b>paper</b> explores the question “what micro-level changes can action researchers make to effect this desired macro-level change?...|$|R
