5|$|The next German {{aircraft}} on the scene, a Junkers 88, {{was engaged}} by a RAF Bristol Beaufighter which {{had appeared in}} the area earlier. Both machines crashed into the sea. Other German planes arrived but were driven off by Beaufighters and Hudsons from Coastal Command. The Atlantic weather conditions deteriorated. Amid concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> German threat and the realisation that the damaged small ships {{would not be able to}} keep up, Commander Sayer ordered the crews off the smaller boats and had them sunk.|$|E
5|$|Greatly {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> partisanship {{within the}} government and the detrimental impact political parties could have on the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington struggled throughout his eight-year presidency to hold rival factions together. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party. In spite of his efforts, debates over Hamilton's economic policy, the French Revolution, and the Jay Treaty deepened ideological divisions. Those that supported Hamilton formed the Federalist Party, while his opponents coalesced around Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and formed the Democratic-Republican Party. While criticized for furthering the partisanship he sought to avoid by identifying himself with Hamilton, Washington is nonetheless considered by scholars and political historians {{as one of the greatest}} presidents in American history, usually ranking in the top three with Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, the Sudanese government allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E

5|$|The economic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} dislocation of ordinary people, the economic hardship of an economy in transition, and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure {{of most of the}} governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems. Those in authority were concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the intelligentsia. No amount of censorship, fines, imprisonment, or banishment, it seemed, could stem the criticism. Furthermore, it was becoming increasingly clear that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.|$|E

The Americans attempted to bring the two groups to peace with each other in order to aid the Queen Consort in a peaceful transformation of Joseon into a modern nation. After all, she liked the ideas and plans of both parties. As a matter of fact, she was in support of many of the Progressive's ideas, except for severing relations with China.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} in Litten's many lawsuits {{for the victims}} of the police attacks and raids was not to litigate individual incidents, but rather to warn <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> fascism in the country. He worked to put Nazi terror on display, in the hopes it would awaken the public to the threat facing them. He saw the methods of the police as approaching those of civil war and as being illegal and worked to prove that in court and to pursue the responsible parties wherever they were, even in the highest political circles. He wasn't interested in creating socialist martyrs, rather he sought acquittal or an appropriate punishment, which caused him some conflicts with the Rote Hilfe and the KPD.|$|E
25|$|Like Christian IV before him, Gustavus Adolphus came {{to aid the}} German Lutherans, to {{forestall}} Catholic suzerainty in his back yard, and to obtain economic influence in the German states around the Baltic Sea. He was also concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> power of the Holy Roman Empire, and like Christian IV before him, was heavily subsidized by Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister of Louis XIII of France, and by the Dutch. From 1630 to 1634, Swedish-led armies drove the Catholic forces back, regaining much of the lost Protestant territory. During his campaign, he managed to conquer half of the imperial kingdoms, making Sweden the continental leader of Protestantism until the Swedish Empire ended in 1721.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} weaponry, the Tenry≈´ class was weaker {{than any other}} {{contemporary}} cruiser. The main battery consisted of four 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns, which were also utilized as the secondary battery on the s. However, the guns were situated in single mounts on the centerline, with only a limited angle of fire, and could fire only one gun at a target immediately in front or aft of the vessel. A further weakness {{was the lack of}} room for anti-aircraft guns. Despite awareness increasing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> threat of aircraft to surface ships, the secondary battery of the Tenry≈´ class consisted of only a single dual-purpose 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval guns, plus two 6.5mm machine guns. The class also was the first to use triple torpedo launchers, with two centerline-mounted Type 6 21-inch launchers. No reloads were carried.|$|E
25|$|Lousteau was {{the first}} {{minister}} of economy of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. There was a dispute in the cabinet at the time between Julio de Vido, Ricardo Jaime and Guillermo Moreno, and Alberto Fern√°ndez, Graciela Oca√±a, Jorge Taiana and Carlos Tomada. Lousteau sided with Alberto Fern√°ndez, as he did not share the economic views of De Vido and Moreno. Fern√°ndez had promised him {{that both of them}} would be removed from government in a short time. Lousteau wrote a report for the president on the figures of the national economy, praising several aspects of the tenure of N√©stor Kirchner, but warning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> inflation. This report was dismissed by N√©stor Kirchner, who did not have an actual office but remained an influential figure. He also proposed to gradually reduce the subsidies to energy consumption, to eventually abandon the fixed price system established during the 2001 crisis. Cristina Kirchner did not support his proposal.|$|E
25|$|Raymond and Bohemond III mustered {{their troops}} and marched to Jerusalem in April 1180. They {{allegedly}} came to celebrate Easter in the Holy City, but the ailing Baldwin IV feared {{that they wanted}} to depose him. He hastily married his sister and heiress, Sibylla, to a knight who had recently arrived from Poitou, Guy of Lusignan, although her hand had been promised to Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy. After studying the controversial reports about the events, historian Bernard Hamilton concluded that Raymond and Bohemond had really wanted to stage a coup, because they felt concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> influence of the king's mother and her brother, Joscelin III of Edessa. Raymond and Bohemond, Hamilton continues, wanted to persuade the king by force to marry Sibylla to a local candidate of their own choosing, Baldwin of Ibelin, instead of Hugh, who was related to the Courtenays, but Sibylla's marriage to Guy destroyed their plan. Since both Raymond and Bohemond lost the king's favor, they left Jerusalem soon after Easter.|$|E

25|$|On 2 July 2015, Amadeo Salvo {{resigned}} {{from his post}} as the executive president of Valencia, citing personal reasons. He was a popular figure amongst the fans. On 10 August 2015, Nicol√°s Otamendi was sold to Manchester City for ¬£32million and Aymen Abdennour was signed from Monaco for ¬£22million as his replacement. Valencia defeated Monaco in the Champions League playoff round with a 4‚Äì3 aggregate victory. However, Valencia had a poor start to the 2015‚Äì16 season, winning 5 out of 13 matches and failing to progress from the Champions League group stages. The fans were also increasingly concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> influence of Jorge Mendes in the club's activities. On 29 November, Nuno resigned as manager and former Manchester United defender Gary Neville was hired as his replacement on 2 December. Valencia went winless for nine matches before earning their first win under Neville in a 2‚Äì1 victory at home against Espanyol. On 30 March 2015, Neville was sacked after recording the lowest win percentage in La Liga history for a Valencia manager with minimum of five matches, winning just 3 out of 16 matches. He was replaced by Pako Ayestar√°n, who was brought in by Neville as the assistant coach just one month prior. Valencia finished the season in 12th position.|$|E
