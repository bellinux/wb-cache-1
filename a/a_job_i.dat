500|$|In 1943 Arthur Freed, the {{successful}} producer of musical films at Metro Goldwyn Mayer, bought the film rights to Best Foot Forward {{and made a}} film version starring Lucille Ball and William Gaxton. Donen moved to Hollywood to audition for the film and signed a one-year contract with MGM. In Best Foot Forward, Donen appeared as a chorus dancer and was made assistant choreographer by Charles Walters. At MGM Donen renewed his friendship with Kelly, who was quickly becoming a popular supporting actor in musicals. When Kelly was loaned to Columbia Pictures for a film with Rita Hayworth, he was offered the chance to choreograph his own dance numbers and asked Donen to assist. Kelly stated, [...] "Stanley needed <b>a</b> <b>job.</b> <b>I</b> needed someone to count for the cameraman, someone who knew the steps and could explain what I {{was going to do}} so the shot was set up correctly." [...] Donen accepted and choreographed three dance sequences with Kelly in 1944's Cover Girl. Donen {{came up with the idea}} for the [...] "Alter Ego" [...] dance sequence where Kelly's reflection jumps out of a shop window and dances with him. Director Charles Vidor insisted that the idea would never work, so Donen and Kelly directed the scene themselves and Donen spent over a year editing it. The film made Kelly a movie star and is considered by many film critics to be an important and innovative musical. Donen signed a one-year contract with Columbia and choreographed several films there, but returned to MGM the following year when Kelly wanted assistance on his next film.|$|E

2500|$|American R singer-songwriter Ne-Yo {{was also}} {{involved}} in the album and wrote three songs which were produced by StarGate. When describing the process of working with him, Rowland said, [...] "Ne-Yo asked me what I wanted to talk about, and I replied 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'." [...] The first of these records, [...] "Shake Them Haters Off", was originally {{intended to be a}} single in the US. It is an [...] "up-tempo" [...] and fun record with lyrics such as [...] "Its like <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>I</b> that I never get a break from/because haters never take a vacation." [...] Another collaboration titled [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] (later changed to [...] "Grown Woman") was described by Rowland as her favorite song on the album. Ne-Yo conceptualized the song in a three-minute conversation with Rowland, where she told him she wanted a record where she could claim [...] "I'm grown!". According to Janine Simon from Honey Mag, on [...] "Grown [...] Woman" [...] Rowland digs [...] "through old pictures from the Destiny's Child days reflecting on how far she has come yet how 'Grown and silly' she still is." [...] It would later be released as one of the album's two US lead singles. The pair collaborated on a third song, [...] "Heaven and Earth", described by Simon as a ballad using imagery to demonstrate a [...] "sonic portrait, painted with flecks of sentiment; a picture of what the singer believes is what 'we deserve as a people'." [...] According to Rowland, one of these three records was also recorded as a duet featuring Ne-Yo's vocals. None of these songs made the album apart from [...] "Heaven and Earth", which features as song number eleven on the deluxe edition.|$|E
