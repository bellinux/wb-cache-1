3000|$|... 27 {{patients}} were included, 8 {{of which were}} excluded of the record and later analysis because of problems of protocols fulfillment. 19 included patients presented an average of 60, 46 years of age, and initial APACHEII 19, 07. The average time of mechanical ventilation was 23, 6 days. After ramdomisation 11 {{patients were}} treated with speaking valve (SVgroup), and 8 by identical protocol without speaking valve (decannulation protocol DPgroup). The incident of infections in the SVgroup was 18, 18 % (2 / 11) and 37, 5 % (3 / 8) in the DPgroup. Infections in the SVgroup were registered like tracheobronquitis while in DPgroup as pneumonia. It {{is important to indicate}} that all the patients included in this study remained under <b>absolute</b> <b>diet.</b> Decannulation time average was 4, 4 days in the SVgroup and 6 days in the DPgroup PD. Patients were decannulated when they fulfilled strict criteria (in both groups) including disphagia normalization. The mortality was 0 in the SVgroup and 3 in DPgroup.|$|E

40|$|Different diets wear {{teeth in}} {{different}} ways and generate distinguishable wear and microwear patterns that have long been the basis of palaeodiet reconstructions. Little experimental research has been performed to study them together. Here, we show that an artificial mechanical masticator, a chewing machine, occluding real horse teeth in continuous simulated chewing (of 100 000 chewing cycles) is capable of replicating microscopic wear features and gross wear on teeth that resemble wear in specimens collected from nature. Simulating pure attrition (chewing without food) and four plant material diets of different abrasives content (at n ¼ 5 tooth pairs per group), we detected differences in microscopic wear features by stereomicroscopy of the chewing surface in the number and quality of pits and scratches that were not always as expected. Using computed tomography scanning in one tooth per <b>diet,</b> <b>absolute</b> wear was quantified as the mean height change after the simulated chewing. Absolute wear increased with diet abrasiveness, originating from phytoliths and grit. In combination, our findings highlight that differences in actual dental tissue loss can occur at similar microwear patterns, cautioning against a direct transformation of microwear results into predictions about diet or tooth wear rate...|$|R
40|$|We used {{stable isotope}} tracers {{in the growing}} primary {{feathers}} of Eurasian Spoonbill chicks (Platalea leucorodia leucorodia) to study seasonal variation in their diet {{on one of the}} Frisian islands, Schiermonnikoog, The Netherlands. Using growing individual primaries as natural samplers over time, samples were taken along the length of primary feathers to estimate both within- and between-individual variation in <b>diet.</b> <b>Absolute</b> isotopic ratios of feather material ranged from - 26. 2 to - 14. 7 ‰ for carbon (d 13 C) and from 13. 0 to 18. 7 ‰ for nitrogen (d 15 N). The variation in d 13 C values suggests the use of a variety of feeding habitats, ranging from freshwater to marine. Across the breeding season, there was a shift from predominantly freshwater prey early on to a more marine diet later in the season. Surprisingly, this shift did not occur within the growth trajectory of early born chicks which instead showed the opposite, but it did occur within individual chicks born later in the season. Stable isotope Bayesian mixing-model (SIAR) outcomes demonstrated that the freshwater/brackish prey had the highest isotopic contribution “(51 %; 95 % confidence interval 39 – 63 %) to the diet early in the breeding season, whereas marine prey contributed most (78 %; 66 – 89 %) to the diet later. That chicks fed with either freshwater or marine food items had similar body condition indices suggests that the eating of marine prey did not come at a major cost for growing Spoonbill chicks...|$|R
40|$|Intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) are {{flexible}} fuel {{stores that}} are depleted by physical exercise and replenished by fat intake. IMCL or their degradation products {{are thought to}} interfere with insulin signaling thereby contributing to insulin resistance. From a practical point of view it is desirable to deplete IMCL prior to replenishing them. So far, {{it is not clear}} for how long and at which intensity subjects have to exercise in order to deplete IMCL. We therefore aimed at developing a standardized exercise protocol that is applicable to subjects over a broad range of exercise capacity and insulin sensitivity and allows measuring reliably reduced IMCL levels. Twelve male subjects, including four diabetes type 2 patients, with wide ranges of exercise capacity (VO(2) peak per total body weight 27. 9 - 55. 8 ml x kg(- 1) x min(- 1)), insulin sensitivity (glucose infusion rate per lean body mass 4. 7 - 15. 3 mg x min(- 1) x kg(- 1)), and BMI (21. 7 - 31. 5 kg x m(- 2)), respectively, were enrolled. Using (1) H magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS), IMCL was measured in m. tibialis anterior and m. vastus intermedius before and during a depletion protocol of a week, consisting of a moderate additional physical activity (1 h daily at 60 % VO(2) peak) and modest low-fat (10 - 15 %) <b>diet.</b> <b>Absolute</b> IMCL-levels were significantly reduced in both muscles during the first 3 days and stayed constant for the next 3 days of an identical diet/exercise-scheme. These reduced IMCL levels were independent of insulin sensitivity, yet a tendency to lower depleted IMCL levels has been observed in subjects with higher VO(2) peak. The proposed protocol is feasible in subjects with large differences in exercise capacity, insulin sensitivity, and BMI, leading to reduced IMCL levels that neither depend on the exact duration of the depletion protocol nor on insulin sensitivity. This allows for a standardized preparation of IMCL levels either for correlation with other physiological parameters or for replenishment studies...|$|R
40|$|Methodological {{aspects of}} {{digestibility}} measurements were studied in four Welsh pony geldings consuming haylage-based diets with increasing proportions of a pelleted concentrate {{according to a}} 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment. Ponies were fed four experimental, iso-energetic (net energy (NE) basis) diets (i. e. 22 MJ NE/day) with increasing proportions of a pelleted concentrate (C) in relation to haylage (H). The <b>absolute</b> amounts of <b>diet</b> dry matter fed per day were 4. 48 kg of H (100 H), 3. 36 and 0. 73 kg of H and C (75 H 25 C), 2. 24 and 1. 45 kg of H and C (50 H 50 C) and 1. 12 and 2. 17 kg of H and C (25 H 75 C). Diets were supplemented with minerals, vitamins and TiO 2 (3. 7 g Ti/day). Voluntary voided faeces were quantitatively collected daily during 10 consecutive days and analysed for moisture, ash, ADL, acid-insoluble ash (AIA) and Ti. A minimum faeces collection period of 6 consecutive days, along with a 14 -day period to adapt the animals to the diets and become accustomed to the collection procedure, is recommended to obtain accurate estimations on dry matter digestibility and organic matter digestibility (OMD) in equids fed haylage-based diets supplemented with concentrate. In addition, the recovery of AIA, ADL and Ti was determined and evaluated. Mean faecal recovery over 10 consecutive days across diets for AIA, ADL and Ti was 124. 9 % (SEM 2. 9), 108. 7 % (SEM 2. 0) and 97. 5 % (SEM 0. 9), respectively. Cumulative faecal recovery of AIA significantly differed between treatments, indicating that AIA is inadequate to estimate the OMD in equines. In addition, evaluation of the CV of mean cumulative faecal recoveries obtained by AIA, ADL and Ti showed greater variations in faecal excretion of AIA (9. 1) and ADL (7. 4) than Ti (3. 7). The accuracy of prediction of OMD was higher {{with the use of}} Ti than ADL. The use of Ti is preferred as a marker in digestibility trials in equines fed haylage-based diets supplemented with increasing amounts of pelleted concentrate. </p...|$|R
