Lawrence Tracy retired immediately after Wang's court-martial on an early (15-year) retirement option. As of May 2005 Jim Wang was still serving in the USAF, but he remained at the rank of captain, having been denied promotion. Interviewed in 2005 about the shootdown, Tracy stated, [...] "Jim (Wang) and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> first were held up as scapegoats. I think that was to cover up for the pilots. They had their fangs out. They wanted to kill something {{because it had been}} ages since an F-15 had shot anything down. We were held accountable for their actions." ...|$|E

[...] In June, Jennings visited the ABC News headquarters, and addressed staff members in an emotional speech; he thanked Gibson for closing each broadcast with the phrase, [...] "for Peter Jennings and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> ABC News." [...] During his visit, however, his colleagues noticed he was ill {{to the point where he}} could barely speak at times.

Brian Davis replied, [...] "You know, they talk all this Uncle Tom sh** and, you know, I'm like, I'm more hood and street than any mother f***** on that team. To say that about us, we knew was ridiculous. Because they all wanted to go Duke. Chris Webber visited Duke and stayed with me." [...] Laettner continued: [...] "Not <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> Duke were from the entitled families. I wasn't. Bobby Hurley wasn't. Thomas Hill wasn't. Brian Davis wasn't. The only person that was, was Grant Hill. Besides that, we were blue collar kids, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his death, {{a plaque}} in Williams' honor was {{installed}} at Harvard Business School, {{with the following}} inscription: [...] "Extraordinary teacher, inspiration to generations of students who have put his percepts into practice". According to Samuel L. HayesIII, the Jacob H. Schiff Professor of Investment Banking Emeritus, Williams was [...] "one of the great case teachers and promoters of the case method at Harvard Business School". John H. McArthur, Dean Emeritus of Harvard Business School, said: [...] "as a teacher, researcher, author, wise counsel, and good friend, Charlie Williams has had an enormous impact over the years on <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> HBS as well as upon the entire banking industry." [...] According to Stephen A. Greyser, Harvard Business School's Richard P.

2500|$|By contrast, some non-scientific studies, {{including}} one conducted by Philip Morris in the Czech Republic called Public Finance Balance of Smoking in the Czech Republic and another by the Cato Institute, support the opposite position. Philip Morris has explicitly apologised {{for the former}} study, saying: [...] "The funding and public release of this study which, among other things, detailed purported cost savings to the Czech Republic due to premature deaths of smokers, exhibited terrible judgment {{as well as a}} complete and unacceptable disregard of basic human values. For one of our tobacco companies to commission this study was not just a terrible mistake, it was wrong. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> Philip Morris, no matter where we work, are extremely sorry for this.

2500|$|With {{victory in}} the Safari Rally in 2002, McRae made the record books as the driver with most event wins in the World Rally Championship. His record has since been broken by Carlos Sainz, Sébastien Loeb and Marcus Grönholm. McRae's {{contract}} with Ford {{came to an end}} following the 2002 season, and after reportedly asking for wages of five million pounds a year, Ford decided against renewing the contract, reluctant to commit such a high amount of their budget to a driver's salary. The two parties split on amicable terms, with Ford's European director of motorsport Martin Whitaker stating [...] "On behalf of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> Ford Motor Company I would like to publicly thank Colin and Nicky for their efforts during the past four years with the Ford team.
