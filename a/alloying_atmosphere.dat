40|$|Mechanical {{alloying}} {{under various}} gas atmospheres such as Ar, an Ar-H 2 mixture, and He gases were carried out, {{and its effects}} on the powder properties, microstructure and mechanical properties of ODS ferritic steels were investigated. Hot isostatic pressing and hot rolling processes were employed to consolidate the ODS steel plates. While the mechanical alloyed powder in He had a high oxygen concentration, a milling in Ar showed fine particle diameters with comparably low oxygen concentration. The microstructural observation revealed that low oxygen concentration contributed to the formation of fine grains and homogeneous oxide particle distribution by the Y-Ti-O complex oxides. A milling in Ar was sufficient to lower the oxygen concentration, and this led a high tensile strength and fracture elongation at a high temperature. It is concluded that the mechanical <b>alloying</b> <b>atmosphere</b> affects oxygen concentration as well as powder particle properties.

40|$|The {{layer of}} the Earth's {{atmosphere}} which contains clouds and weather systems is a thin thermoregulatory surface. It maintains an exact energy budget between the Earth and the Sun. Recent work in theoretical physics is aimed at these types of dynamic systems. Key to a system such as the atmosphere is the constant yet fluctuating input of energy which forces the system into a state distant from its thermodynamic equilibrium. Certain physical systems, when past this point begin to organize themselves into dynamic structures which work to dissipate the incoming flux. As a result, they are decreasing system entropy, a characteristic previously only assigned to life or living matter. The line between living and inert systems has expanded to a field wide enough to work within. Concurrently, developments in the engineering of so-called intelligent materials seek to invest material or inert matter with characteristics or behaviors of life. Scientists intend the materials to sense, process and respond to environmental forces in a dynamic bio-mimetic manner through engineering at the molecular scale. This paper will examine these two fields, beginning a discourse and correlation between them, {{in the context of}} a built application. Specifically, Nitinol, a shape memory alloy, will be considered as 'dissipative media' in a dynamic building system. The proposed built system will then become a metallic <b>alloy</b> <b>atmosphere</b> on the thin surface boundary of a structure. Working also to dissipate an influx of solar energy, the building's surface will develop 'weather systems', dynamic and cyclonic, moving across and around the metallic skin. Perturbations from the imprints of the clouds and shadows will seed the system throwing it into flux as it seeks to feather out the disturbance s and settle back into pulsing rhythms and patterns.

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} is {{about the effect of}} oxide layers in creep of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V <b>alloy,</b> in {{different}} <b>atmospheres</b> (air, nitrogen and argon). Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy was treated during 24 hours in a thermal treatment furnace at 600 °C in different atmospheres (argon, nitrogen and air). The samples were analyzed by High Resolution X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and microhardness test. The polished samples of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V allloy were treated during 24 hours at 600 °C and the oxidation behavior in each case using argon, nitrogen and air atmospheres was observed. The oxidation was more aggressive in air atmosphere, forming TiO 2 film in the surface. The oxidation produced a weight gain through the oxide layer growth and hardening by oxygen dissolution. Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy specimens also were produced in order to test them in creep, at 250 MPa and 600 ºC, with argon, nitrogen and air atmospheres. When the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy was tested under argon and nitrogen atmospheres oxidation effects are smaller and the behavior of the creep curves shows that the creep life time was better in atmospheres not so oxidant. It is observed a decreasing of steady state creep in function of the oxidation process reduction. It is shown that, for the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy, their useful life is strongly affected by the atmosphere that is submitted, on account of the oxidation suffered by the material. 1...|$|R
40|$|Materials {{to convey}} hot CO 2 -rich gases {{are needed in}} carbon capture {{technologies}} currently being developed. This work is aimed at investigating the factors controlling the oxidation of chromia-forming <b>alloys</b> in these <b>atmospheres.</b> To do so, model Fe-Cr and Fe-Cr-Ni alloys were exposed to Ar-CO 2 -H 2 O gas mixtures at 650 and 800 °C, and the reaction products examined using conventional metallography techniques. Carbide precipitation beneath oxide scales reflects a carbon supersaturation at the metal/oxide interface relative to the external atmosphere: as a gradient of oxygen potential is established across the growing scale, an elevated carbon activity results at the interface if the scale transmits carbon. On {{the basis of a}} local equilibrium model, measured carburisation rates and precipitate volume fractions were used to evaluate the influence of oxide composition and of the presence of H 2 O in the gas on carbon uptake/transport in the scales. Limited carburisation beneath Cr 2 O 3 scales was shown by means of an analysis of subscale chromium depletion not to alter the oxide stability. The morphological evolution of Fe-rich oxide nodules formed as a result of localised Cr 2 O 3 failure was studied in relation to the alloy ability to supply chromium to the metal/oxide interface. Application of nucleation-growth models to the kinetics of nodule development allowed the resistance of Cr 2 O 3 scales to be evaluated in terms of nodule nucleation rates determined from experimental nodule surface coverages and specimen weight gains. The relative importance of nodule nucleation and growth in determining the overall alloy performance as a function of reaction temperature is discussed...|$|R
