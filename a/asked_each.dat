5|$|By 1997, Martin had met Classics student Tim Rice-Oxley. During {{a weekend}} in the English village Virginia Water in Surrey they <b>asked</b> <b>each</b> other to play their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's {{keyboard}} player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, Keane, was already active. Days after, this event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as quartets. In 1998, the band released 500 copies of the Safety EP. Most of the discs were given to record companies and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public. In December of that year, Coldplay signed to the independent label Fierce Panda. Their first release was the three-track Brothers and Sisters EP, which they had quickly recorded over four days in February 1999.|$|E

25|$|Elsewhere, in Honiara, {{the local}} {{ministry}} <b>asked</b> <b>each</b> resident to pay $50 {{so that the}} roofs that were damaged by the system could be repaired. The cleanup process took a long time; {{a year after the}} storm, bulldozers were reportedly still removing broken logs and not all roads had been repaired. Following the storm, disease spread to isolated part of the Solomon Island group; many animals died and hundreds of children were hospitalized because of the outbreak of disease.|$|E

When at twilight, {{they went to the}} Arameans' camp, there was no one there, for God had made the Arameans hear chariots, horses, and a great army, and fearing the Hittites and the Egyptians, they fled, leaving their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and their camp. The lepers went into a tent, ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and {{clothing}} from the tents and hid it.|$|E
25|$|Sequoyah first {{taught the}} syllabary to his six-year old daughter, Ayokeh (also spelled Ayoka), {{because he could}} not find adults willing to learn it. He {{traveled}} to the Indian Reserves in the Arkansaw Territory where some Cherokee had settled. When he tried to convince the local leaders of the syllabary's usefulness, they doubted him. Sequoyah <b>asked</b> <b>each</b> leader to say a word, which he wrote down, and then called his daughter in to read the words back. This demonstration convinced the leaders to let him teach the syllabary to a few more people. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, and read a dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokee that he had created a practical writing system.|$|E
25|$|It {{has become}} {{possible}} {{to study the}} living brain, and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by Benjamin Libet in the 1980s, in which he <b>asked</b> <b>each</b> subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the readiness potential (after German Bereitschaftspotential, which was discovered by Kornhuber & Deecke in 1965). Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported {{the time on the}} clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.|$|E

[...] When he was rebuffed, he demanded and was given keys to Samuel Willard's Third Church in 1687. [...] Services were held there under the auspices of Rev. Robert Ratcliff until 1688, when King's Chapel was built. These actions highlighted him as pro-Anglican in the eyes of local Puritans, who would later accuse him of involvement in a [...] "horrid Popish plot." ...|$|E

[...] In his commentary on the Torah (the Five Books of Moses), Nahmanides contends that Moses <b>asked</b> <b>each</b> Jew to come before him to be counted. This personal appearance of the Jew before Moses, the tzadik (Jewish holy man), foreshadowed the ceremony of the giving of a kvitel by the Hasid to his Rebbe.|$|E
500|$|According to Howard Linecar in {{his book}} on British coin designs and designers, [...] "Pistrucci held the cutting of these dies [...] as a {{bargaining}} counter in his relentless efforts to obtain the post of Chief Engraver at the Royal Mint".

Milano wrote, [...] "the Italian artist took this as an act of hostility by his enemies." [...] At about this time, Pistrucci contracted an illness that affected his vision, slowing his work.|$|E

500|$|... "It {{proved a}} wet, ungenial summer", Mary Shelley remembered in 1831, [...] "and incessant rain often {{confined}} us for {{days to the}} house". Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves with German ghost stories, which prompted Byron to propose that they [...] "each write a ghost story". Unable {{to think of a}} story, young Mary Godwin became anxious: [...] "Have you thought of a story? I was <b>asked</b> <b>each</b> morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative." [...] During one mid-June evening, the discussions turned {{to the nature of the}} principle of life. [...] "Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated", Mary noted, [...] "galvanism had given token of such things". It was after midnight before they retired, and unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the grim terrors of her [...] "waking dream", her ghost story: ...|$|E
500|$|Up to {{the point}} the episode [...] "August" [...] aired, only one {{character}} {{that was part of}} a group known as [...] "Observers" [...] had been introduced. In this episode, two more such individuals were revealed: August (played by Peter Woodward) and December (played by Eugene Lipinski). The creation of Observers {{was one of the first}} ideas the writers of Fringe thought of when developing the show in its early stages, when they <b>asked</b> <b>each</b> other, [...] "What if there were these characters where all they did was watch?". Pinkner and Wyman thought of creating Observers by [...] "looking for something... iconic" [...] that had the [...] "quality of being invisible". Though the Observer called September has appeared in every single Fringe episode in a brief cameo, he was first featured prominently in the fourth episode of the first season. The producers thought of unique characteristics for [...] "somebody who wasn't of our world," [...] evolving to the Observers having bald heads, no eyebrows, and [...] "largely deadened" [...] senses, which led to a love for extremely hot peppers.|$|E

500|$|Two contestants {{compete on}} each episode. On each turn, a Bingo ball {{comes out of}} the hopper and a {{question}} is <b>asked.</b> <b>Each</b> ball has a number from 1 to 75 and a letter in the word [...] "BINGO" [...] printed on it. If the question is answered correctly, the player earns the letter from that ball and the number on the ball is added in dollars to the bank, which starts at $500 (e.g., if G-50 comes out, the bank increases by $50). If the letter is a duplicate already earned by the player, no extra letters are earned. The first player that spells out BINGO from the earned letters wins the game. A Free-Space Ball with a sponsor's logo acts as a wild card in the game. The player who answers a question correctly when that ball is rolled out can choose any letter, and $100 is added to the bank. Two regular games are played. Contestants who win both games win the match and receive {{all the money in the}} bank. If each contestant wins one game, a five-question tie-breaker game is played. The first question's answer begins with a B, the second question's answer starts with I, and so on. The first to answer three questions correctly wins the money in the bank and goes on to play the Bingo Bonus Board for a chance at $100,000.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of November 8, Bundy approached 18-year-old telephone operator Carol DaRonch at Fashion Place Mall in Murray, Utah, {{less than a mile}} from the Midvale restaurant where Melissa Smith was last seen. He identified himself as [...] "Officer Roseland" [...] of the Murray Police Department, told DaRonch that someone had attempted to break into her car, and asked her to accompany him to the station to file a complaint. When DaRonch pointed out that Bundy was driving on a road that did not lead to the police station, he immediately pulled to the shoulder and attempted to handcuff her. During their struggle, he inadvertently fastened both handcuffs to the same wrist, and DaRonch was able to open the car door and escape. Later that evening, Debra Jean Kent, a 17-year-old student at Viewmont High School in Bountiful, [...] north of Murray, disappeared after leaving a theater production at the school to pick up her brother. The school's drama teacher and a student told police that [...] "a stranger" [...] had <b>asked</b> <b>each</b> of them to come out to the parking lot to identify a car. Another student later saw the same man pacing in the rear of the auditorium, and the drama teacher spotted him again shortly before the end of the play. Outside the auditorium, investigators found a key that unlocked the handcuffs removed from Carol DaRonch's wrist.|$|E
500|$|On June 1, 1978, {{following}} the monthly meeting of general {{authorities in the}} Salt Lake Temple, Kimball asked his counselors and the ten members of Quorum of the Twelve Apostles then present to remain behind for a special meeting. Kimball began by describing his studies, thoughts, and prayers on removing the restriction and on his growing assurance that {{the time had come}} for the change. Kimball <b>asked</b> <b>each</b> of the men present to share their views, and all spoke in favor of changing the policy. After all present had shared their views, Kimball led the gathered apostles in a prayer circle to seek final divine approval for the change. As Kimball prayed, many in the group recorded feeling a powerful spiritual confirmation. Bruce R. McConkie later said: [...] "There are no words to describe the sensation, but simultaneously the Twelve and the three members of the First Presidency had the Holy Ghost descend upon them and they knew that God had manifested his will.... I had had some remarkable spiritual experiences before... but nothing of this magnitude." [...] L. Tom Perry described: [...] "I felt something like the rushing of wind. There was a feeling that came over the whole group. When President Kimball got up he was visibly relieved and overjoyed." [...] Gordon B. Hinckley later said: [...] "For me, it felt as if a conduit opened between the heavenly throne and the kneeling, pleading prophet of God who was joined by his Brethren." ...|$|E
