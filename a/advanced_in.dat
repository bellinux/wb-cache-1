5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{operation}} was to take Salla, and then to proceed eastward along the railway to capture Kandalaksha, and to cut the Murmansk Railway line which connected Murmansk with Russia. To accomplish this, the German-Finnish forces <b>advanced</b> <b>in</b> two main groups: one led by the XXXVI Corps in the north, and one by the Finnish III Corps in the south. For XXXVI Corps part, the 169th Division <b>advanced</b> <b>in</b> a three-pronged, frontal attack against the defense line along the Tenniö River. Further south the Finnish 6th Division attempted a flanking operation into the Soviet rear from Kuusamo. They had to advance through difficult terrain to the northeast and capture the towns of Alakurtti and Kayraly (Kairala). Finnish III Corps was placed {{under the command of}} Army High Command Norway for {{the operation}}. There they would meet up with the German divisions. Both divisions were supported by the 6th SS Mountain Division that <b>advanced</b> <b>in</b> the centre along the Salla – Kandalaksha road in a frontal assault against the defensive line.|$|E
5|$|A second attack, {{simultaneous}} {{with the}} crossing at Kehl, occurred at Hüningen near Basel. After crossing unopposed, Ferino <b>advanced</b> <b>in</b> a dual-prong east along the German {{shore of the}} Rhine with the 16th and 50th demi-brigades, the 68th and 50th and 68th line infantry, and six squadrons of cavalry that included the 3rd and 7th Hussars and the 10th Dragoons.|$|E
5|$|About 175,000 black {{residents}} departed New Orleans {{over the year}} following the storm, while only 100,000 returned, pushing the African American population to 59 percent, from 66 percent previously.

5|$|During the Mesozoic (245 to 66 {{million years}} ago) the {{conifers}} flourished and became adapted {{to live in}} all the major terrestrial habitats. Subsequently, the tree forms of flowering plants evolved during the Cretaceous period.

When the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and {{the first of four}} ice ages occurred, the forests retreated as the ice <b>advanced.</b> <b>In</b> the interglacials, trees recolonised the land that had been covered by ice, only to be driven back again in the next ice age.|$|E

5|$|Many {{theories}} have been <b>advanced</b> <b>in</b> way of explanation for {{decline of the}} Roman Empire, and many dates given for its fall, from the onset of its decline in the 3rd century to the fall of Constantinople in 1453.

5|$|Retreat of the Little Ice Age glaciers {{was slow}} until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid. Between {{the height of}} the Little Ice Age and 1950, Mount Rainier's glaciers lost about one-quarter of their length. Beginning in 1950 and {{continuing}} through the early 1980s, however, many of the major glaciers <b>advanced</b> <b>in</b> response to relatively cooler temperatures of the mid-century. The Carbon, Cowlitz, Emmons, and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s. Since the early-1980s, however, many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed.|$|E

The class comprised four ships: Brandenburg, Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm, Weissenburg, and Wörth.
