5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements in which <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> {{takes a step}} with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
50|$|A bit is {{a device}} placed in <b>a</b> <b>horse's</b> mouth, kept on <b>a</b> <b>horse's</b> head {{by means of}} a headstall. There are many types, each useful for {{specific}} types of riding and training.|$|R

5|$|Although much of Britain {{from this}} time is now beneath the sea, remains have been {{discovered}} on land that show horses were present, and being hunted, in this period. Significant finds include <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> tooth dating from between 55,000 and 47,000BC and horse bones dating from between 50,000 and 45,000BC, recovered from Pin Hole Cave, in the Creswell Crags ravine in the North Midlands; further horse remains from the same era have been recovered from Kent's Cavern. In Robin Hood Cave, also in Creswell Crags, <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> tooth was recovered dating from between 32,000 and 24,000BC; this cave has also preserved {{one of the earliest}} examples of prehistoric artwork in Britain– an engraving of <b>a</b> <b>horse,</b> on a piece of horse bone. A goddess figurine carved from horse bone and dating from around 23,000BC has been recovered from Paviland Cave in South Wales.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, Plumb was the US Olympic athlete {{with the}} {{greatest}} number of appearances in any sport at the Games. He was named to the US team in every Olympic games between 1960 (his first) and 1984, as well as appearing for the last time at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and competed at all of the Games except for 1980, when the US did not compete. During his seven Olympic appearances, he gathered multiple medals. At the 1960 Summer Olympics, Plumb took an individual 15th, while the US team did not finish the competition. At the 1964 Games, he repeated his individual performance, while the US team improved to take the silver medal. At these Games, he became the first rider ever to win a medal on <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> that he had never previously ridden in competition. Plumb had planned to ride his main event horse, Markham, but on the flight to the Games in Tokyo, the horse panicked, possibly due to a bad experience previously suffered in <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> trailer. In order to keep him from destroying his stall and potentially the aircraft, the horse was euthanized. Plumb instead rode Bold Minstrel, <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> loaned to him by another top-level eventer.|$|E
5|$|Born Kathy Petro, {{she grew}} up in <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> racing family from Massachusetts and married a fellow horseman, Tim Ritvo, in 1990. Kathy and Tim ran a race horse {{training}} operation in Florida, and In 2010 she took it over solo when Tim became part of the management of Gulfstream Park race track. Her accomplishments came against the backdrop of having been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2001 and receiving a heart transplant in 2008. In spite of the medication regime and immunity issues that transplant recipients face, she lives a normal life as <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> trainer and shows no signs of organ rejection.|$|E
50|$|In 1924, {{her mother}} {{purchased}} the Why Worry Farm in Woodside for Lurline, where she bred <b>horses.</b> She owned <b>a</b> five-gaited <b>horse,</b> <b>a</b> three-gaited <b>horse,</b> <b>a</b> Standardbred road <b>horse,</b> <b>a</b> Hackney <b>horse,</b> <b>a</b> Hackney pony and a jumper and hired a trainer, thus {{turning it into}} a show stable. After she stopped competing, her horses won many equestrian awards. Two of her best-known American Saddlebred horses were Chief of Longview (born at Longview Farm in Lee's Summit, Missouri) and Sweetheart on Parade.|$|R

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>horse's</b> teeth include incisors, premolars, molars, and {{sometimes}} canine teeth. <b>A</b> <b>horse's</b> incisors, premolars, and molars, once fully developed, continue to erupt throughout its lifetime as the grinding surface is worn down through chewing. Because of {{this pattern of}} wear, a rough estimate of <b>a</b> <b>horse's</b> age {{can be made from}} an examination of the teeth. Abnormal wear of the teeth, caused by conformational defects, abnormal behaviors, or improper diets, can cause serious health issues and can even result in the death of the horse.|$|R

5|$|Horses appear {{frequently}} in accounts concerning miraculous {{events in the}} context of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 7th century, <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> is reported to have revealed warm bread and some meat when St Cuthbert was hungry, by pulling straw from the roof of a hut; and, when Cuthbert was suffering from a diseased knee, he was visited by an angel on horseback, who helped him to heal his knee. In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon Bishop Willibald of Eichstätt wrote that, when a source of fresh water was needed for a monastery on the site where St Boniface had died, in the kingdom of Frisia, the ground gave way under the forelegs of <b>a</b> <b>horse,</b> and, when the horse was pulled free, a fountain of spring water came out of the ground and formed a brook. In the 10th century, King Edmund I is reported to have been saved from death while chasing a deer on horseback when he prayed for forgiveness for his maltreatment of St Dunstan, and thereafter made him abbot of Glastonbury: the horse stopped {{at the edge of a}} cliff, over which the deer and hunting dogs had already fallen. On a later occasion, <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> fell dead under Dunstan when he heard a voice from heaven telling him that King Eadred had died.|$|E

5|$|Ponies are taxonomically {{the same}} animals as horses. The {{distinction}} between <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> and pony is commonly {{drawn on the}} basis of height, especially for competition purposes.

5000|$|The {{conditioning}} {{program for}} the different horses varies depending on the race length. Genetics, training, age, and skeletal soundness are all {{factors that contribute to}} <b>a</b> <b>horse's</b> performance. [...] The muscle structure and fiber type of horses depends on the breed; therefore, genetics must be considered when constructing a conditioning plan. <b>A</b> <b>horse's</b> fitness plan must be coordinated properly in order to prevent injury or lameness. If these are to occur, they may negatively affect <b>a</b> <b>horse's</b> willingness to learn. [...] Sprinting exercises are appropriate for training two-year-old racehorses, but the number is limited by psychological factors as well as physical. [...] <b>A</b> <b>horse's</b> skeletal system adapts to the exercise it receives. Because the skeletal system does not reach full maturity until the horse is at least four years of age, young racehorses often suffer injuries.|$|R

5|$|The Arabian {{developed}} in a desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and protection from theft. Selective breeding for traits including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans created <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend {{the task of the}} Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ashvamedha allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing <b>a</b> <b>horse.</b> It then {{goes on to say that}} spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in the image of <b>a</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vendel era helmet plates (from the 6th or 7th century) {{found in}} a grave in Sweden depict a helmeted figure holding a spear and a shield while riding <b>a</b> <b>horse,</b> flanked by two birds. The plate has been {{interpreted}} as Odin accompanied by two birds: his ravens.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> hobby <b>horse</b> (or hobby-horse) is <b>a</b> child's toy <b>horse,</b> {{particularly}} popular {{during the days}} before cars.
