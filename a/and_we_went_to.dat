500|$|At {{approximately}} 4 p.m. on September 18, Dannemann told Police Sergeant John Shaw: [...] "We went {{to sleep}} about 7 a.m. When I woke up at eleven his face was covered in vomit, and he was breathing noisily. I sent for an ambulance, and {{he was taken to}} hospital. I also noticed that ten of my sleeping tablets were missing." [...] In a statement given to P. Weyell of the coroner's office on September 24, she said: I made a sandwich and we talked until about 7 a.m. He then said that {{he wanted to go to}} sleep. He took some tablets, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed. I woke up about 11:00 a.m., and saw that Jimi's face was covered in vomit. I tried to wake him but could not. I called an ambulance and he was taken to the hospital in Kensington... Prior to going with him to the hospital, I checked my supply of Vesparax sleeping tablets and found that nine of them were missing.|$|E
500|$|Big Star {{returned}} in 1993 {{with a new}} line-up when guitarist Jon Auer and bassist Ken Stringfellow joined Chilton and Stephens. Auer and Stringfellow remained members of the Posies, founded by the pair in 1986. Stringfellow is also known for his work with R.E.M. and the Minus 5. Hummel elected not to participate. [...] First-era material dominated Big Star's performances, with the occasional addition of a song from the 2005 album In Space; Stringfellow recalled that during the 1990s, [...] "We were working out the set list <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> this little cafe. Little did I know we'd be playing that set {{for the next ten}} years". The resurrected band made its debut at the 1993 University of Missouri spring music festival. A recording of the performance was issued on CD by Zoo Records as Columbia: Live at Missouri University. The concert was followed by tours of Europe and Japan, as well as an appearance on The Tonight Show.|$|E
60|$|I obeyed, {{not without}} difficulty, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> find Retief.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never even {{suggested}} it," [...] Cecil declared eagerly. [...] "Fact is, we're out shooting all day, duck shooting, or fishing, or motoring, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed soon after dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are Foy van Goorl, Red Martin, Elsa Brant, {{a wounded}} {{man and a}} prisoner, escaped from Haarlem, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the house of Lysbeth van Goorl in the Bree Straat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall," [...] {{said her}} small companion. [...] "I {{am going to}} play marnels afore supper, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> supper at six o'clock, because father comes home. Does your father come home at six too?" ...|$|R
60|$|I nodded, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{that corner}} of the plateau where Shadrach stood apart, {{watching}} and listening.|$|E
60|$|We {{wound up}} our affairs at Saint Domingo, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> England to take {{possession}} of our new wealth.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} we were both ready, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Checco. We found him {{seated at a table}} {{polishing}} a dagger.|$|E
6000|$|... "The boat's full <b>to</b> the hatches <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sea to-morrow," [...] Wyndham said. [...] "If {{the wind}} keeps fair, I expect {{to put you}} on board the Spanish liner for the Canaries in three or four days. You'll {{transfer}} to a homeward Cape boat when you arrive." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> in <b>to</b> breakfast. On the table, {{beside my}} plate, was lying {{a letter from}} Cynthia.|$|R
60|$|We reached Paris at dusk {{three days}} later, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> {{straight}} <b>to</b> my old lodging in the Rue St. Antoine.|$|R
6000|$|At this moment, {{however, the}} gong for {{dressing}} sounded, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> our several apartments, after this emotional specimen of [...] "Evenings at Home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Twenty days {{towards the}} setting sun," [...] I said. As he {{remained}} silent I added: [...] "I heard that I could find {{gold in the}} mountains there. An old man told me, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> look for gold." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was by {{this time}} close on morning, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed. (Mem., this diary seems horribly like the {{beginning}} of the [...] "Arabian Nights," [...] for everything has to break off at cockcrow, or like the ghost of Hamlet's father.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my boy, I shan't be {{here when}} you come back. You know my visit is over in a week, <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Sir Richard's estate." ...|$|R
60|$|However, before nightfall, {{everything}} was arranged to Charles's satisfaction; <b>and</b> off <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Lancaster Gate, with a profound {{expectation that the}} German professor would do nothing worth seeing.|$|R
60|$|So {{that was}} how eleven of the Rochester team found {{themselves}} moodily boarding a Pullman en route for Buffalo <b>and</b> Canada. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed early <b>and</b> arose late.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{said she}} ’ad {{been in love}} with me all along," [...] ses Sam, filling their glasses agin to cheer ’em up. [...] "We went out arter tea and bought the engagement-ring, and then she got {{somebody}} to mind the shop <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the Pagoda music-’all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that will}} be best," [...] said Milray. [...] "But I shall give you a letter to my sister. She and I used to be famous cronies, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a great many parties {{together}} {{when we were young}} people. We thought the world was a fine thing, then. But it changes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, make it lunch,' said I. 'I am hungry, and I do {{not want}} to wait to get up a dinner.' Anita agreed to this, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> work to take the lid off a hamper which she told me had been packed by Mrs. Parker and {{contained}} everything we should want for several days.|$|E
5000|$|This {{suggests}} that [...] {{is an increasing}} odd sequence that restarts with [...] whenever the index n is a power of 2.Therefore, if <b>we</b> choose m <b>and</b> l so that [...] and , then [...]It is clear that values in the table satisfy this equation. Or we can think that after [...] people are dead there are only [...] people <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the th person. He must be the survivor. So [...] Below, we give a proof by induction.|$|R
60|$|He was so quaintly humorous that I {{was forced}} <b>to</b> laugh; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> {{together}} <b>to</b> the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained undisturbed {{as we had}} left them.|$|R
6000|$|For {{memory of}} worth <b>and</b> work <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>To</b> other records than a stone can show. [...] These lacking, naught remains; with these The stone is needless {{for the world}} will know.|$|R
6000|$|One {{night it}} blew what Pomona called a [...] "whirlicane," [...] <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed very early to keep warm. We heard our boarder on deck {{in the garden}} after we were in bed, and Euphemia said she could not imagine what he was about, unless he was {{anchoring}} his turnips {{to keep them from}} blowing away.|$|E
60|$|Our boy {{was greatly}} {{surprised}} when {{we told him}} sitting out in the balcony in the starlight, and he ran over some of those stories of former Lodgers, of the Major's putting down, and asked wasn't it possible {{that it might be}} this lodger or that lodger. It was not possible, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "At a {{shop where}} they sold souvenirs," [...] Lister replied. [...] "I didn't expect to meet her; I {{went in to}} buy some {{enameled}} things. It {{was a pretty good}} shop and the hotel clerk declared the people were all right. She knew me <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a tea-room. She left me at the door, and I think that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We had a boat-hook, and I {{pulled up}} to the island; I did, mother, and I made fast the boat to a little stick, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> out <b>to</b> explore the island." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever comes, {{you must}} not blame {{yourself}} in that matter, Diggory. You have only yielded to my solicitations, <b>and</b> if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> our death it is our choosing, and none of thine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{all want}} a little {{patching}} and repairing {{from time to time}},' he chirped. 'Like a ship, my dear sir,--exactly like a ship. Sometimes the hull is out of order, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> consult the surgeon; sometimes the rigging, and then I advise; sometimes the engines, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the brain-specialist; sometimes the look-out on the bridge is tired, <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> see an oculist. I should recommend you to see an oculist. A little patching and repairing from time to time is all we want. An oculist, by all means.' ...|$|R
60|$|So we loafed along home {{down the}} back lanes, feeling pretty glum and not talking. When we was passing {{the far corner of}} our tobacker field we heard the dog set up a long howl in there, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the place and he was {{scratching}} the ground with all his might, {{and every now and then}} canting up his head sideways and fetching another howl.|$|E
60|$|We got married. She gave me {{a living}} she had in her parsonage, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> live at her Hall. She wouldn't let me out of her sight. Lord!—we were an {{infatuated}} couple—and she would choose to view me in an aesthetic light. I was Greek statues for her, bless you: Croton, Hercules, I don't know what! She had her own way too much—I let her do as she liked with me.|$|E
60|$|Taiwun, the Emperor's brother, was a sot of sots, and as {{the night}} wore on he {{challenged}} me to a drinking. The Emperor was delighted, and commanded {{a dozen of the}} noblest sots to join in the bout. The women were dismissed, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> it, drink for drink, measure for measure. Kim I kept by me, and midway along, despite Hendrik Hamel's warning scowls, dismissed him and the company, first requesting, and obtaining, palace lodgment instead of the inn.|$|E

60|$|My Edward and I, then, are happy: and {{the more}} so, because those we most love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both married: alternately, once every year, they come <b>to</b> see us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see them. Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man. Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection. Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.|$|R
