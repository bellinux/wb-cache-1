2500|$|Bluehole used closed alpha and beta periods {{with about}} 80,000 players, {{including}} popular streamers, to gauge initial {{reaction to the}} gameplay and adjust balance prior to a wider release. The early access phase on Steam began in March 2017 for the Windows version. This early <b>access</b> <b>period</b> was planned to last approximately six months, originally aiming for a September 2017 release. In July 2017, Greene announced that {{they would need to}} extend the early <b>access</b> <b>period</b> by a few months, continuing to release updates on a regular basis, with plans to still release by the end of 2017, as committing to this original period [...] "could hinder us from delivering a fully featured game and/or lead to disappointment within the community if the launch deadline is not met". Initially, Bluehole had expected that they would just gain enough players through early access to smooth out the gameplay, and only when the game was completed, they would have started more marketing for the title. The sudden interest in the game from early access exceeded their expectations, and put emphasis on the stability of the game and its underlying networking alongside gameplay improvements. Through August 2017, these updates generally included a major weekly patch alongside major monthly updates that provided key performance improvements. However, from August onward Bluehole backed off the rate of such patches, as the high frequency has led to some quality control issues, and the developers rather make sure each patch content is well-vetted by the community before providing new updates; this did not change their plans for a 2017 release. Bluehold anticipated to leave the early <b>access</b> <b>period</b> by late December 2017.|$|E

30|$|The Superframe {{structure}} of MAC [45] comprises of Exclusive <b>Access</b> <b>Periods</b> (EAP-I/II), and Random <b>Access</b> <b>Periods</b> (RAP-I/II) using Traffic types Type-I and Type-II. The EAP-I and EAP-II {{are used to}} transmit emergency data {{with the support of}} TYPE-I. The RAP-I and RAP-II are used to transmit normal/periodic data with the support of TYPE-II. Both Types (I, II) inform the master node to allocate the slots when each node transmits data in the pre-allocated time slot. However, the master node blocks other slave nodes during data transmission of the one node in the pre-allocated time slot which consumes a higher amount of energy of other nodes in waiting. Another drawback is that one node can upload information at a time which degrades the performance of the suggested MAC in terms of a higher delay with the higher packets drop.|$|R

The minimum acquisition and inoculation <b>access</b> <b>periods</b> of ToYVSV by B. tabaci were 30 min and 10 min, respectively.

Out of 34 species of test-plants inoculated with ToYVSV only Capsicum annuum, Chenopodium amaranticolor, C. quinoa, Datura stramonium, Gomphrena globosa, Nicotiana clevelandii and N. tabacum cv.
