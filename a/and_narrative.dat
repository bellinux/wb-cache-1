5|$|Although {{set in the}} 12th and 13th centuries, Penman {{sets the}} {{characters}} <b>and</b> <b>narrative</b> in her novels in medieval sites that still exist and can be visited, including castles, churches and archeological areas. Areas such as Aber Falls and Dolwyddelan Castle have important scenes in Penman's novels. In Devil's Brood, Penman sets the characters in scenes {{in a variety of}} medieval royal residences, castles and abbeys, in England and present day France, many of which still exist such as the Château de Chinon, Fontevrault Abbey, and Chateau de Loches.|$|E
40|$|An explanatorystudy is conductedto {{examine the}} {{different}} kinds of rules in video games. Two layers of game, the abstract <b>and</b> the <b>narrative</b> layer, are explored to unify the study of gameplay <b>and</b> <b>narratives.</b> Derivatives of paidea rules and ludus rules are analyzed in relation to gameplay <b>and</b> <b>narratives.</b> A model is presented to show the relation between rules, gameplay, <b>and</b> <b>narratives.</b> Video games are seen as having two layers, an abstract layer <b>and</b> a <b>narrative</b> layer, which are linked by game rules. It is hence maintained that gameplay <b>and</b> <b>narratives</b> should not be antagonistic; they should be complementary when studying video games...|$|R
40|$|The {{power of}} the media lies {{in its ability to}} construct, change <b>and</b> recycle the <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> the signs that are {{foundational}} to our culture. This paper examines the <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> signs that represent men and in that representing, also stereotype, enclose and misrepresent men. Because many <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> images of men are negative, then men and women, and the institutions of society and culture such as the law and the legislature, take for granted these negative images <b>and</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> build their cultural and legal frameworks based on negative images <b>and</b> <b>narratives.</b> Through arguing that these representations are generally inaccurate, this paper calls for a closer examination of the <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> images that represent men, an acknowledgment of the {{power of the}}se images <b>and</b> <b>narratives</b> in the cultural life of Western countries. It argues for a reassessment of the institutional structures that further misrepresent men and place men in disadvantaged positions when they come in contact with these institutional structures...|$|R

5|$|As Evolve is multiplayer-focused, {{the design}} team put less time and focus into {{developing}} Evolves narrative and campaign. Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the design team {{thought that it}} would negatively impact on the conversations between players. However, the story <b>and</b> <b>narrative</b> became more significant in the single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve. Playing as different characters would also lead to different conversations and dialogues between characters.|$|E
5|$|Literature {{also served}} {{religious}} purposes. Beginning with the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom, works of funerary literature written on tomb walls, {{and later on}} coffins, and papyri placed within tombs, were designed to protect and nurture souls in their afterlife. This included the use of magical spells, incantations, and lyrical hymns. Copies of non-funerary literary texts found in non-royal tombs suggest that the dead could entertain themselves in the afterlife by reading these teaching texts <b>and</b> <b>narrative</b> tales. See also Egyptian influences in the Hebrew Bible.|$|E

Although the game's core gameplay mechanics, story <b>and</b> <b>narrative</b> are unchanged in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 ports, some features (such as the Nemesis system) are less complex than the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions. According to the game's developer, the Nemesis system was too large for older consoles.|$|E

Finding the exact words to type is {{considered part of the}} riddles that must be solved. While sound effects are present, the game lacks music and a save function. It features a conversation system with branching dialogue choices, where the story develops through entering commands and receiving answers to them from the player's sidekick or non-player characters.|$|E

5|$|While The Tale of Mac Da Thó's Pig {{appears to}} be the quintessential Ulster Cycle story in theme <b>and</b> <b>narrative,</b> there are certain unusual {{elements}} of the extant forms which suggest it may have a more satiric quality, parodying the heroic genre of the Ulster Cycle. The eponymous pig of Mac Da Thó may be mythic in origin, but its highly exaggerated size may also be satiric. In the Táin Bó Cuailnge, the Ulaid and Connachta go to war over a mythic best, the finest bull in Ireland, whereas here they come to blows over a dog.|$|E
5|$|Xenosaga I & II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} co-developed by Monolith Soft and Tom Create, {{and published by}} Namco for the Nintendo DS.

5|$|Architecturally, the {{elements}} {{characteristic of the}} style include: the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or apsaras), bas-reliefs, and on pediments extensive garlands <b>and</b> <b>narrative</b> scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.|$|E

5|$|As a manifesto, this {{paragraph}} became {{significant for the}} amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express {{the majority of the}} drama in instrumental music and set expository <b>and</b> <b>narrative</b> sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the structure of a choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.|$|E
5|$|Casino Royale (2006) is {{the twenty-first}} spy {{film in the}} Eon Productions James Bond film series, and is the third screen {{adaptation}} of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name. Directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, {{it is the first}} film to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, and was produced by Eon Productions for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, making it the first Eon-produced Bond film to be co-produced by the latter studio. Following Die Another Day, Eon Productions decided to reboot the film series, establishing a new timeline <b>and</b> <b>narrative</b> framework not meant to precede or succeed any previous Bond film, with the first film of the reboot allowing them to show a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond than in previous entries.|$|E
5|$|During {{its early}} advertising, {{the game was}} dubbed , and used {{character}} <b>and</b> <b>narrative</b> concepts that did {{not appear in the}} final product. The graphics also underwent changes, being particularly noticeable with Marth's hair color and style. The game was advertised on television with a live-action commercial featuring a version of the Fire Emblem theme. Filming the commercial proved troublesome: the actors overheated due to their heavy costumes, and the light and sound effects made the actor horse skittish. The commercial required twenty retakes. The game released on April 20, 1990. Future ports were released through Nintendo's Virtual Console. It released for the Wii on October 20, 2009; for Nintendo 3DS on August 1, 2012; and for Wii U on June 4, 2014.|$|E

5|$|In autumn 1943, Hergé {{decided that}} he wanted Edgar P. Jacobs, a fellow cartoonist, to {{collaborate}} with him on The Adventures of Tintin. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. The two became close friends and artistic collaborators, with Jacobs aiding him in developing {{various aspects of the}} plot, for instance developing the idea of the crystal balls and the story's title. Although stylistically they were different both in forms of illustration <b>and</b> <b>narrative,</b> they influenced each other greatly. He used Jacobs as a life model from whom he drew various poses that characters adopt in the story. He also used Jacobs as a researcher, sending him to the Cinquantenaire Museum to study its collections of Incan material, and it was the mummified Incan corpse in their collection that was used {{as the basis for the}} mummy of Rascar Capac.|$|E
5|$|Innocence began {{production}} in 2006 at Alfa System {{as the next}} main entry in the Tales series. Developed parallel to the DS spin-off title Tales of the Tempest, {{the goal was to}} include all the series' main gameplay <b>and</b> <b>narrative</b> elements despite the limited medium. The character designs were done by Mutsumi Inomata, while the music was composed by series newcomer Kazuhiro Nakamura. Extensive voice acting was included using CRI Middleware's Kyuseishu Sound Streamer compression algorithm. After release, it was decided to remake Innocence for the Vita, using platform-specific gameplay functions, redone voice work and music, and new characters. Japanese singer-songwriter Kokia created the opening theme songs for both versions of Innocence. Both versions have been positively received in Japan, and Western opinions on the two versions of Innocence have been mostly positive.|$|E
5|$|Madsen's {{idea was}} to bring {{attention}} {{to the story of}} Flammen and Citron as he felt it had been neglected or misrepresented. The most expensive Danish film produced to that date, it was co-produced by German companies because initially there was no interest in producing the film in Denmark. Portraying the protagonists as morally ambiguous characters, the director tried to depict war as a complicated experience that goes beyond a good versus evil dichotomy. With visual <b>and</b> <b>narrative</b> references borrowed from film noir and the French film Army of Shadows, Flame & Citron also explores themes of love, betrayal, and the emotional aspects of relationships.|$|E
