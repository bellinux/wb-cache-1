500|$|Reviewing {{the episode}} [...] "Counterfeit", Gutierrez wrote that [...] "...despite {{the fact that}} the having an exact twin of Tessa's pop up is flatly ludicrous, it plays out due to MacLeod's desire to have Tessa back {{overriding}} his sense of reason. (...) Vandernoot likes the Tessa character quite a bit and gave me the impression she was sad to see her go," [...] and that she [...] "...looks like she enjoys playing the good/bad Lisa. Her triple performance as Tessa shows Vandernoot's range." [...] Kathie Huddleston of Scifi.com felt that [...] "...a visit from Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit", even an evil Tessa look-alike, is a welcome nod to a significant character from the first season, and it gave our boy Duncan <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> to reflect on his recent lost love." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Clayson approves of {{the more}} [...] "understated {{production}} aesthetic" [...] next to what he views as an at-times [...] "bloated" [...] sound found elsewhere on All Things Must Pass. Simon Leng also acknowledges Harrison's success in [...] "temper Phil Spector's taste for the extreme" [...] and describes [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] {{as one of its}} composer's [...] "more attractive" [...] songs, with a fine lead vocal. [...] " [...] is refreshing to hear Harrison singing about another's pain," [...] Leng adds, [...] "suggesting that, unlike some of his contemporaries, he was able to displace himself as the center of his universe for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> at least." [...] In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams identifies [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] as an example of [...] "how sympathetic to the performer" [...] Spector could be as a producer, in this case, by giving the recording a [...] "mellow, autumnal mix" [...] that [...] "beautifully display" [...] Drake's pedal steel.|$|E
500|$|Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising Thompson and Kendrick's {{performances}} and the film's honesty and plausibility. He suspected that [...] "a lot {{of high school}} students will recognize elements of real life in the movie." [...] Bruce Feld of Film Journal International agreed, calling the film a [...] "dead-on revelation of what high school is really like". Variety magazine's Justin Chang thought that Blitz displayed a [...] "terrific ability to embrace people's idiosyncrasies, real or fictitious" [...] and called the cast a [...] "strong ensemble", commending Thompson, Kendrick and D'Agosto in particular. The San Francisco Chronicles Peter Hartlaub thought that the script [...] "never fails to present an unexpected scenarioâ€“ usually accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of hilarity", but felt that Hal's ultimate failure was anticlimactic and [...] "frustrating for moviegoers who prefer tidy endings". Stephen Holden, however, writing for The New York Times, believed that the final scenes were a [...] " [...] sign of the movie's integrity". TV Guides Ken Fox similarly admired the more [...] "real" [...] ending, and wrote that the film was [...] "sharp, observant... wonderfully dry". Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised Blitz for straying from common stereotypes and [...] "opt for deeper, darker and wittier developments".|$|E

60|$|Von Ragastein {{paused and}} turned his head. The deep {{breathing}} inside the banda had certainly ceased. He {{rose to his feet}} and, stealing uneasily to the opening, gazed down upon his guest's outstretched form. To all appearance, Dominey still slept deeply. After <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> watch, Von Ragastein returned to his place.|$|R
6000|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> tense silence after that, {{and then}} Agatha made a dejected gesture. [...] "He warned {{me that this}} might happen if I went on singing, but what could I do? I couldn't cancel my engagements without telling people why. He said I must go to Norway and give my throat and chest a rest." ...|$|R

60|$|At {{six o'clock}} that evening, Tavernake rang up the Milan Court and inquired for Elizabeth. There was <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> delay {{and then he}} heard her reply. Even over the {{telephone}} wires, even though he stood, cramped and uncomfortable, in that stuffy little telephone booth, he felt the quick start of pleasure, the thrill of something different in life, which came to him always {{at the sound of}} her voice, at the slightest suggestion of her presence.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{a scarlet}} hoop-petticoat," [...] added Esther. They now stared in each other's eyes, with great astonishment and some little fear. After <b>a</b> {{thoughtful}} <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> David drew <b>a</b> long breath and stood upright.|$|R
60|$|There was no answer, {{but after}} <b>a</b> horrible <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> had passed <b>a</b> half-seen arm and {{shoulder}} {{rose out of}} the flood, and the sudden drag on the bridle that slipped from her fingers was very reassuring. The horse plunged and floundered, and once more Hetty felt her dragging skirt was clear of the water.|$|R

Your friend Firebrand's [...] voice was audible. I listened. He muttered something, and yawned [...] vociferously, then muttered again--`Splend--propns--a--yi--a--ou!' ...|$|R
6000|$|His meal being ended, a lord {{came and}} held before him a broad, shallow, golden dish with {{fragrant}} rosewater in it, to cleanse {{his mouth and}} fingers with; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood by with a napkin for his use.

60|$|The {{new arrivals}} did it while the cable clanked and rattled as the {{schooner}} drove astern, {{but at the}} first heave the rotten staysail tore off the hanks, and one jib burst as they ran it up its stay. Then for <b>an</b> anxious <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> the cable jammed, and the anchor brought the schooner up. All four flung themselves upon the windlass levers, and after a furious effort the chain came up again and ran out faster, fathom by fathom, rattling horribly, {{until the end of}} it shot suddenly over the windlass. Then there was another check as the schooner brought up by the kedge swung suddenly across the stream.|$|R

50|$|The Silly Song, when present, always {{appears in}} the middle of an episode, usually at <b>a</b> cliffhanger <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> between <b>two</b> {{separate}} segments. The segment either takes place on the familiar countertop which opens and closes most episodes, or is presented in another setting off the countertop. On some videos, the background scenery often appeared as a stage set, behind which electrical outlets and ceramic tile can be seen.|$|R
60|$|Francis, glad of <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> {{solitude}} {{in which}} to rearrange his somewhat distorted sensations, found an empty space in {{the stern of the}} launch and stood leaning over the rail. His pulses were still tingling with the indubitable excitement of the last half-hour. It was all there, even now, before his eyes like a cinematograph picture--the duel between those two men, a duel of knowledge, of strength, of science, of courage. From beginning to end, there had been no moment when Francis had felt that he was looking on at what was in any way a degrading or immoral spectacle. Each man had fought in his way to win. Young Wilmore, graceful as a panther, with a keen, joyous desire of youth for supremacy written in his face and in the dogged lines of his mouth; the budding champion from the East End less graceful, perhaps, but with even more strength and at least as much determination, had certainly done his best to justify his selection. There were no points to be scored. There had been no undue feinting, no holding, few of the tricks of the professional ring. It was a fight to a finish, or until Harrison gave the word. And the better man had won. But even that knock-out blow which Reggie Wilmore had delivered after a wonderful feint, had had little that was cruel in it. There was something beautiful almost in the strength and grace with which it had been delivered--the breathless eagerness, the waiting, the end.|$|R
60|$|Let it be {{observed}} also {{that we have}} hitherto been speaking as if all things were produced under a monopoly. The objection might at once be raised that with competitive producers the price will also keep falling down towards cost {{and will not be}} based upon the point of maximum profit. We shall turn to this objection in <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> But one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> other points must be considered before doing so.|$|R

60|$|Stanmer came in, {{interrupting}} our talk, {{and looking}} at me, I thought, with a little air of bravado. He must think me indeed a tiresome, meddlesome bore; and upon my word, turning it all over, I wonder at his docility. After all, he's five-and-twenty--and yet I must add, it does irritate me--the way he sticks! He was followed in <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> by <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three of the regular Italians, and I made my visit short.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} in the New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, [...] "Comfort and Joy is a charming film on its own, but {{something}} of a disappointment when compared to Gregory's Girl and Local Hero, in which the inventions were more consistently comic and crazy." [...] The staff at Film4 agreed, calling it [...] "... somehow not as satisfying as his Forsyth's early films." [...] The reviewer went on to observe that, [...] "Paterson is always worth seeing, while Grogan and David are equally watchable, but there aren't the belly laughs That Sinking Feeling provides so readily, or the casual charm of Gregory's Girl." [...] The Variety magazine staff review was also lukewarm, concluding that after [...] "... evincing much laughter over an unexpectedly funny couple living together, Forsyth abruptly switches into a more conventional plot" [...] and that [...] "David and Paterson are terrific together and almost every line between them is a joy. From the point she departs with no explanation the pic flashes <b>a</b> sparky <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> but it doesn't reach the high spots again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will let}} them know we are here;" [...] and Mr. Atherton made two steps forward {{to the mouth of}} the defile. Almost at the same instant he {{levelled}} his rifle and fired, and one of the Maoris threw up his arms and fell back, the rest throwing themselves down instantaneously among the bushes, whence <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> later <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three shots were fired. But Mr. Atherton had stepped back, and he and the settler, lying down on the ground, worked themselves forward until by raising their heads they could command a view of the slope up to the mouth of the ravine.|$|R

50|$|The deep focus {{cinematography}} was {{the work}} of director Jack Curtis (working under a pseudonym, Carson Davidson), who shot every scene outdoors under the sun of Long Island. The film was scripted by comic book writer Arnold Drake (The Doom Patrol, Marvel's Captain Marvel, et al.). Drake storyboarded the film, so every shot has the careful, formalized composition of a well-drawn comic strip. One shot, for example is a shot in deep focus: the right profile of the hero dominates the left-side foreground of the frame; in <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three tiny figures at the far-removed shoreline move left to right, from behind the actor's head, and in focus.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] she answered. [...] "Go on! I shall {{follow with}} the Vladika. [...] And {{then you can}} have things ready to get on soon after the [...] Archbishop and Council arrive." [...] They kissed each other after, on her [...] part, a shy glance at me; {{and he went on}} the track of our comrades at [...] a great pace. I could see him shortly after catch them up,--though [...] they, too, were going fast. For a few minutes they ran together, he [...] speaking--I could note it from the way they kept turning their heads [...] towards him. Then he broke away from them hurriedly. He went like a [...] stag {{breaking}} covert, and was soon out of sight. They halted <b>a</b> [...] <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> Then some few ran on, and all the rest came back [...] towards us. Quickly they improvised a litter with cords and [...] branches, and insisted that the Voivodin should use it. In an [...] incredibly short time we were under way again, and proceeding with [...] great rapidity towards Vissarion. The men took it in turns to help [...] with the litter; I had the honour of taking a hand in the work [...] myself.|$|R
6000|$|The very {{tone of the}} {{question}} shook my confidence. That was what Mr. Bixby was expecting. He left, without saying anything more. I began to imagine all sorts of things. Mr. Bixby, unknown to me, of course, sent somebody down to the forecastle with some mysterious instructions to the leadsmen, another messenger was sent to whisper among the officers, and then Mr. Bixby went into hiding behind a smoke-stack where he could observe results. Presently the captain stepped out on the hurricane deck; next the chief mate appeared; then <b>a</b> clerk. Every <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>a</b> straggler was added to my audience; and before I got {{to the head of}} the island I had fifteen or twenty people assembled down there under my nose.
