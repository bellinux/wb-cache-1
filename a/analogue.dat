5|$|Passive linear {{electronic}} <b>analogue</b> {{filters are}} those filters {{which can be}} described with linear differential equations (linear); they are composed of capacitors, inductors and, sometimes, resistors (passive) and are designed to operate on continuously varying (<b>analogue)</b> signals. There are many linear filters which are not <b>analogue</b> in implementation (digital filter), {{and there are many}} electronic filters which may not have a passive topology both of which may have the same transfer function of the filters described in this article. <b>Analogue</b> filters are most often used in wave filtering applications, that is, where it is required to pass particular frequency components and to reject others from <b>analogue</b> (continuous-time) signals.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{meta-analysis}} evaluated {{trials of}} the rapid-acting <b>analogues</b> insulin lispro and insulin aspart, performed before {{the introduction of the}} basal <b>analogues,</b> insulin glargine and insulin detemir. This article reviews the effect of rapid-acting and basal insulin <b>analogues</b> separately and in combination, relative to human insulin. Outcomes evaluated include HbA(1 c), hypoglycaemia, postprandial glucose (PPG), and weight changes. Results from trials that matched defined criteria are presented in tables. In type 1 diabetes, compared with human insulin, the rapid-acting <b>analogues</b> generally reduced hypoglycaemia and postprandial glucose, whereas the basal <b>analogues</b> tended to reduce hypoglycaemia [...] particularly nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Weight gain may also be reduced with basal <b>analogues,</b> compared with human basal insulin. In type 2 diabetes, premix rapid-acting <b>analogues</b> controlled postprandial glucose better than human insulin mixes; basal <b>analogues</b> used as basal-only therapy reduced hypoglycaemia compared with NPH insulin; and some advantages were apparent with <b>analogues</b> in basal-bolus therapy. Whilst the benefits on individual metabolic and clinical outcomes appear modest, almost all studies report some advantage when using insulin <b>analogues</b> in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Significant benefits, including PPG lowering with the rapid-acting <b>analogues</b> and the potential for reduction in cardiovascular risk, should be investigated further...|$|R
