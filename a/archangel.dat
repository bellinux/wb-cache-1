5|$|In July 1799, Baranov {{returned}} to Sitka Sound on the brig Oryol and established {{the settlement of}} Arkhangelsk, also known as Fort <b>Archangel</b> Gabriel. In June 1802, Tlingit warriors attacked the settlement and killed or captured most of the 150 Russians and Aleuts living there. Baranov led an armed expedition to retake Sitka by force in June 1804. The Russian warship Neva joined Baranov at Sitka. A new Russian fort was established while the Tlingit prepared to defend themselves with a well-armed fort of their own. Tension rapidly escalated into skirmishes and negotiations broke down. In early October, the Russians attacked the Tlingit fort with cannon from the Neva and from a land party. The Tlingit responded with powerful gun and cannon fire of their own. The Battle of Sitka continued for several days until the Tlingit abandoned their fort and left the area. Tlingit accounts of the battle refuse to admit defeat or give the Russians credit for taking the Tlingit fort. The Russians destroyed the abandoned Tlingit fort and named the new Russian fort Novo-Arkhangelsk (New <b>Archangel),</b> also known as Fort <b>Archangel</b> Michael and Fort Saint Michael. The confrontations at Sitka in 1802 and 1804 {{played a significant role}} in subsequent Tlingit-Russian relations for generations.|$|E
