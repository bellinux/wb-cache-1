This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon <b>acoustic</b> <b>oscillation</b> feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of {{the age of the}} Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} of {{the cosmic microwave background}} anisotropies is principally determined by two effects: <b>acoustic</b> <b>oscillations</b> and diffusion damping (also called collisionless damping or Silk damping). The <b>acoustic</b> <b>oscillations</b> arise because of a conflict in the photon–baryon plasma in the early universe. The pressure of the photons tends to erase anisotropies, whereas the gravitational attraction of the baryons, moving at speeds much slower than light, makes them tend to collapse to form overdensities. These two effects compete to create <b>acoustic</b> <b>oscillations,</b> which give the microwave background its characteristic peak structure. The peaks correspond, roughly, to resonances in which the photons decouple when a particular mode is at its peak amplitude.|$|R

50|$|The baryonic <b>acoustic</b> <b>oscillation</b> signal {{should be}} {{evident in the}} power {{spectrum}} of Lyman-alpha emitters at high redshift. Baryonic acoustic oscillations are imprints of sound waves on scales where radiation pressure stabilized the density perturbations against gravitational collapse in the early universe. The three-dimensional distribution of the characteristically homogeneous Lyman-alpha galaxy population will allow a robust probe of cosmology. They are a good tool because the Lyman-alpha bias, the propensity for galaxies to form in the highest overdensity of the underlying dark matter distribution, can be modeled and accounted for. Lyman-alpha emitters are over dense in clusters.|$|E
5000|$|Due to <b>acoustic</b> <b>oscillation</b> of {{the pipe}} {{the air in the}} pipe is {{alternatively}} compressed and expanded. This results in an alternating flow of air into and out {{of the pipe}} through the pipe mouth. The interaction of this transversal acoustic flow with the planar air jet induces at the flue exit (origin of the jet) a localised perturbation of the velocity profile of the jet. This perturbation is strongly amplified by the intrinsic instability of the jet as the fluid travels towards the labium. This results into a global transversal motion of the jet at the labium.|$|E

The growth rate of structure, useful for testing modifications to general relativity, can also be measured using redshift space distortions. Both of these features are found at large scales of tens to hundreds of megaparsecs, which is why low angular resolution (unresolved) maps of neutral hydrogen are sufficient to detect them. This should be compared with the resolution of a redshift survey, which must detect individual galaxies that are typically only tens of kiloparsecs across.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the nonlinear power spectra of density perturbations and <b>acoustic</b> <b>oscillations</b> in growing neutrino quintessence. In this scenario, the neutrino mass {{has a strong}} dependence on the quintessence field. The induced coupling stops {{the evolution of the}} field when the neutrinos become nonrelativistic, and triggers the transition to the accelerating phase of the cosmological expansion. At redshifts around five, the neutrino fluctuations are still linear and <b>acoustic</b> <b>oscillations</b> are present in the neutrino power spectrum, induced by the <b>acoustic</b> <b>oscillations</b> in the baryonic and dark-matter sectors. The neutrino perturbations become nonlinear at redshifts around three. The mode coupling generated by the nonlinearities erases the oscillations in the neutrino spectrum at some redshift above two. There is a potential danger that at later times the influence of the gravitational potentials induced by the neutrino inhomogeneities could erase the oscillations from the baryonic and dark-matter spectra, making the scenario incompatible with observations. For the scenario to be viable, the neutrino-induced gravitational potentials in the range of baryonic <b>acoustic</b> <b>oscillations</b> should not grow to average values much larger than 10 ^{- 4 }. The magnitude of the expected potentials is still not known reliably, as the process of structure formation is poorly understood in growing neutrino quintessence.

The six free parameters can be well constrained by the TT spectrum alone, and then the TE and EE spectra can be predicted theoretically to few-percent precision with no further adjustments allowed: comparison of theory and observations shows an excellent match.|$|E

50|$|The {{instrument}} is a hybrid semi-cylindrical interferometer {{designed to measure}} the large scale neutral hydrogen power spectrum across the redshift range 0.8 to 2.5. The power spectrum {{will be used to}} measure the baryon <b>acoustic</b> <b>oscillation</b> (BAO) scale across this redshift range where dark energy becomes a significant contributor to the evolution of the Universe. CHIME is sensitive to the 21 cm radio light emitted by clouds of neutral hydrogen in distant galaxies. By measuring the distribution of the hydrogen in the Universe—a technique known as intensity mapping—CHIME will make a 3D map of the large-scale structure of the Universe between redshifts of 0.8 and 2.5, when the Universe was between about 2.5 and 7 billion years old. CHIME will thus map over 3% of the total observable volume of the Universe, substantially more than has been achieved by large-scale structure surveys to date, during an epoch when the Universe is largely unobserved.Maps of large-scale structure can be used to measure the expansion history of the Universe because sound waves in the early Universe, or baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), have left slight overdensities in the distribution of matter on scales of about 500 million light-years. This characteristic BAO scale has been well-measured by experiments like Planck and can therefore be used as a ‘standard ruler’ to determine the size of the Universe as a function of time, thereby indicating the expansion rate.|$|E

In the Neff massive neutrino case the two high multipole probes give very different results regardless of the external data sets used in the combined analyses. In the case in which a dark radiation background with unknown clustering properties is also considered, SPT data seem to exclude the standard value for the dark radiation viscosity cvis= 1 / 3 at the 2 sigma CL, finding evidence for massive neutrinos only when combining SPT data with BAO measurements.
