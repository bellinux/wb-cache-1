25|$|As a mode {{of inquiry}} Rabinow distinguishes the Anthropology of the Contemporary from Michel Foucault’s History of the Present.

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to {{establish}} (or attribute) the burdens associated with the production and use of a product, or with a specific service or process, {{at a point in}} time (typically the recent past). Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a decision or a proposed change in a system under study (oriented to the future), which means that market and economic implications of a decision may have to be taken into account. Social LCA is under development as a different approach to life cycle thinking intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> complementary to environmental LCA.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{disagreement}} amongst {{the advocates of}} different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the Encyclopedia uses an <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing {{an increasing number of}} people is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.|$|E
25|$|Vladimir Becić's {{earliest}} works {{date from}} the time of the Munich school, and together with the works of Josip Račić and Miroslav Kraljević, they point to a new direction in Croatian modern painting. Moving away from traditional academic styles, they are strongly influenced by Leibl's realism, and the works of Impressionist artists such as Manet whose work they saw in an exhibit of 1907. Other influences at that time were Velázquez and Goya. Becić's later works show an <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> closer to Cézanne, and emphasizing the structure and geometric shapes. His artistic expression was focused towards modeling and clarity. His sketches in oil, and especially watercolour, express the freshness of the immediate experience. He uses rich colour expression, and tone shaping for strong volume.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Hindemith wrote a {{theoretical}} book The Craft of Musical Composition (vol. 1, Hindemith 1937), which lays out this system in great detail. He also advocated this {{system as a}} means of understanding and analyzing the harmonic structure of other music, claiming that it has a broader reach than the traditional Roman numeral approach to chords (an <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> strongly tied to the diatonic scales). In the final chapter of Book I, Hindemith seeks to illustrate the wide-ranging relevance and applicability of his system in analysis of music examples ranging from the early origins of European music to the contemporary. These analyses include an early Gregorian melody, and compositions by Guillaume de Machaut, J. S. Bach, Richard Wagner, Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, and finally, a composition of his own.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, a Chinese agent {{working with}} the Chinese embassy in Berlin {{recruited}} a German Falun Gong practitioner Dr. Dan Sun {{to act as an}} informant. The agent reportedly arranged a meeting for Sun with two men who purported to be scholars of Chinese medicine interested in researching Falun Gong, and Sun agreed to pass information to them, ostensibly hoping to further their understanding of the practice. [...] The men were in fact high-ranking agents of the 610 Office in Shanghai. Sun maintained that he had no knowledge the men he was corresponding with were Chinese intelligence agents, but because he cooperated with them, he was nonetheless convicted of espionage in 2011. According to Der Spiegel, the case demonstrated [...] "how important fighting [...] is to the [...] government," [...] and [...] "points to the extremely offensive <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> sometimes being taken by the Chinese intelligence agencies." ...|$|E
500|$|Chapman {{began the}} 1932 season in good form and {{appeared}} fitter {{than he had}} for many seasons. There were further calls in the press for him to captain England. Jardine's captaincy in 1931 left critics unimpressed and C. Stewart Caine, the editor of Wisden, wrote that [...] "the impression appears to be widely entertained that Chapman, were he in [...] form, would again be given charge of the [...] team." [...] Christopher Douglas believes {{that the difference between}} Jardine and Chapman in captaincy style made it harder for the press to accept Jardine. He writes: [...] "Chapman's was just the kind of daredevil <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> remembered with affection and, even though it was barely a year since he had lost the leadership, his reign was being regarded through rose-coloured specs." [...] However, {{it is unlikely that the}} selectors ever considered returning to him. During the season, Chapman scored 951 runs, averaged 29.71, and led Kent to third place in the County Championship for the second year in succession.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} meta{{population}}s was defined in 1969 as [...] "a population of populations which go extinct locally and recolonize". Metapopulation ecology is another statistical <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{often used in}} conservation research. Metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches of varying levels of quality, and metapopulations are linked by the migratory behaviours of organisms. Animal migration is set apart from other kinds of movement; because, it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals from a habitat. Migration is also a population-level phenomenon, as with the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post-glacial environments. Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative to historic and contemporary climates. These migration routes involved {{an expansion of the}} range as plant populations expanded from one area to another. There is a larger taxonomy of movement, such as commuting, foraging, territorial behaviour, stasis, and ranging. Dispersal is usually distinguished from migration; because, it involves the one way permanent movement of individuals from their birth population into another population.|$|E
500|$|Throughout this apogee of avant-garde work, Takemitsu's musical style {{seems to}} have {{undergone}} a series of stylistic changes. Comparison of Green (for orchestra, 1967) and A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden (1977) quickly reveals the seeds of this change. The latter was composed according to a pre-compositional scheme, in which pentatonic modes were superimposed over one central pentatonic scale (the so-called [...] "black-key pentatonic") around a central sustained central pitch (F-sharp), and an <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> highly indicative {{of the sort of}} [...] "pantonal" [...] and modal pitch material seen gradually emerging in his works throughout the 1970s. The former, Green (or November Steps II) written 10 years earlier, is heavily influenced by Debussy, and is, in spite of its very dissonant language (including momentary quarter-tone clusters), largely constructed through a complex web of modal forms. These modal forms are largely audible, particularly in the momentary repose {{toward the end of the}} work. Thus in these works, it is possible to see both a continuity of approach, and the emergence of a simpler harmonic language that was to characterise the work of his later period.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} international versions {{were what}} then-CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole called [...] "fairly simple", consisting of dubbed {{versions of the}} show with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways. Dubbed versions of the show continued to be produced if the country's needs and resources warranted it. They utilized a variant of a flexible model called the CTW model, developed by the producers and creators of the original show, to create and produce independently produced preschool television shows in other countries. The Workshop recognized that the production model developed in the US, which reflected its needs and culture at the time, served {{as a framework for}} other countries that wanted to repeat it. Its inherent flexibility was attractive to producers in other countries, who saw the model as [...] "a methodological <b>approach</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> neither doctrinaire nor culture-bound" [...] {{that could be used to}} achieve different results in different countries. According to the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street, the producers of the co-productions repeated the [...] "experiment" [...] undertaken by the original US show, but adapted it to each specific situation. In 1969, the producers of the original show depended upon government and foundation funding, but as Sesame Workshop CEO Gary Knell stated in 2009, the US funding model would not necessarily be effective in countries with different economic and political structures. All co-productions share elements with the American show, but because of their different needs, no two are exactly alike. According to Gettas, the producers of the programs would [...] "rely on variants of the CTW model to help them create programming that faithfully reflects the linguistic, cultural, social, or religious diversity of their native lands".|$|E
