"My {{understanding}} of the original (Lanham Act) {{was that it was}} not the purpose to make (homes) ideal, but it was the purpose to build them in areas where they could be used permanently and of a standard that would be suitable for permanent residence, because in that way the Government has the best chance of recouping its investment by the sale of the homes, and, of course, this (mutual ownership plan) is different in that respect from many of these housing projects, because these are built from the standpoint of sale and recouping the expenditure insofar as possible, at the same time affording an opportunity to these industrial workers to get <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>where</b> they are permanently engaged." ...|$|E

2500|$|Polish jokes were {{everywhere}} in the 1960s and 1970s. In the late '60s a book of Polish jokes was published and copyrighted, and commercial goods, gift cards, and merchandise followed and even profited {{at the expense of}} the Poles. Polish stereotyping was deeply pervasive in America and assimilation, upward mobility, higher education, and even intermarriage did not solve the problem. In 1985, Bukowczyk recalled meeting a college student from largely Polish Detroit, Michigan who lived in <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>where</b> her Irish-American mother would sometimes call her Polish-American father a [...] "dumb Polack." [...] Polish Americans were ashamed of their identities, and thousands changed their names to fit into American society.

Unfortunately, she never enjoyed a winning season on her way to a 63–96 career record, due to pitching mostly [...] for awful teams with bad defense and a low run support.|$|E
