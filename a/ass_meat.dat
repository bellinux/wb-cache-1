The Jews, initially overconfident in their strength, failed to prepare even enough water supplies for a short siege. [...] Early in the campaign, the Muslims' hunger caused them to slaughter and cook several asses which they had taken during their conquest. Yet no one in the Muslim army had eaten that meat as Muhammad didn't see the men were at the point of starve to allow it. [...] Muhammad, who had determined that the eating of horse, mule, and <b>ass</b> <b>meat</b> was forbidden, made the exception that one can eat forbidden foods so long as scarcity leaves no other option.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that Asiatic wild asses (Equus hemionus) are being {{increasingly}} poached in a commercial fashion. Part of the meat is believed to reach the meat markets in the capital Ulaanbaatar. To test this hypothesis, we collected 500 meat samples between February and May 2006. To differentiate between domestic horse (Equus caballus) and wild <b>ass</b> <b>meat,</b> we developed a {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) assay based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We ampli fi ed and sequenced a cytochrome b fragment (335 bp) and carried out a multialignment of the generated sequences for the domestic horse, the Asiatic wild ass, the domestic donkey (Equus asinus) and the Przewalski’s horse (Equus ferus przewalskii). We detected a species-speci fi c restriction site (AatII) for the Asiatic wild ass, resulting in a speci fi c restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) band pattern. This RFLP assay represents a rapid and cost-effective method to detect wild <b>ass</b> <b>meat.</b> All of the 500 meat samples we collected and analysed within this pilot project proved to be domestic horsemeat as declared by the sales people. Thus, either the assumption that wild <b>ass</b> <b>meat</b> is sold as “cheap horse meat” is wrong, or we picked the wrong markets, products or season...|$|E

40|$|To {{compare the}} effect of pasture or total mixed ration (TMR) in the diet of Massese ewes on {{performance}} and meat quality of lambs. 20 suckling lambs were considered: 10 animals were given milk by ewes reared in pen and fed a TMR (group A) while 10 lambs were fed by mothers grazing pasture (group B) : all the lambs were slaughtered at the typical commercial weight (14 kg). Carcasses were evaluated according to the Mediterranean grid, some linear measurements were taken in them and the right proximal pelvic limb were dissected into the main tissue components. the longissimus lumborum muscle was instrumentally analysed in order to <b>asses</b> some <b>meat</b> qaulity characteristics. Lambs of group A reached the target slaughtering weight {{four days before the}} lambs of gourp B (P= 0. 03), confirmed by a higher pelvic limb percentage (30. 93 % vs 24. 39 % respectively). No differences were revealed for histological dissection of pelvic limb and for organoleptic and chemical characteristics of meat. In conclusion, it seems that the rearing technique and ewes' nutrition can induce some modification in lambs' performance without any changes in the analysed characteristics of meat...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} a {{slaughter}} house in Khartoum state to <b>asses</b> the <b>meat</b> hygiene practices. Ten critical control points were selected in a cattle slaughter line. They included working tools, hands of the workers and various parts of the carcasses. Five hundred and seventy six samples were examined bacteriologically to identify the types and species of aerobic bacteria which were present in the various critical control points. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were isolated. The Gram-positive bacteria were Staph aureus, Staph xylosus, Staph lentus, Staph auricularis, Staph hominis, Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus spp. Escherichia coli were the only Gram-negative bacteria isolated. Regarding the stages of the work {{it was found that the}} highest number of isolates appeared at the middle stage of work. while the lowest number of isolates present at the starting of the work. It was also found that the lowest number of isolates present on the outer surface of the carcass trunk. The highest number of isolates was obtained from the skinning knife (CCP٢) and the splitting saw (CCP٨). The most predominant organisms isolated in this study were Staphylococcus species. An important observation in the present study is that no Salmonella or Pseudomonas were isolated in any of the critical control points...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Actually, the {{productive}} rules of "Vitellone Bianco dell'Appennino Centrale" ban {{the use of}} maize silage in the four months before slaughtering due to the possible negative effects on meat quality, particularly on meat colour and water holding capacity. The studies on this argument are conflicting and conducted on foreign breed. So {{there is a lack}} on Chianina beef, one of the most diffuse breed for meat production in Italy, for this important topic. Aim: To compare the effect of maize silage or hay in diet during the last four month of fattening on some meat physicalchemical quality characteristics of Chianina beef. Materials and methods: 90 Chianina beef fed with hay (Group 1) or maize silage (Group 2) were slaughtered at an average age of 19 months. After the normal ageing for this meat, different for each muscles, samples of three different muscles (caput longum triceps brachii, longissimus dorsi and semimembranosus), were analysed in order to <b>asses</b> the main <b>meat</b> quality characteristics: pH, colour before and after 48 h of storage to evaluate meat shelf-life, tenderness (expressed as shear force), water holding capacity (evaluated as drip loss, cooking loss and M/T), chemical composition (dry matter, crude protein, ether extract and ash). The variance analysis was used to assess statistical differences. Results and discussion: pH values were normal and similar between muscles and groups. The use of maize silage induced small variation, detectable only instrumentally, in meat colour (L*), drip loss and ether extract of longissimus dorsi and semimembranosus muscles. No differences are shown for the quality of caput longum triceps brachii. Nevertheless, the differences are very low and the final consumer doesn't note any variation. Conclusion: From the results of this study, it seems possible to use maize silage in Chianina diet even during the last four month of fattening, without any significant change in meat quality, when there is any economic advantage for breeders...|$|R
40|$|Haemonchus contortus is a {{gastrointestinal}} nematode {{of significant}} importance in Australia and worldwide. It prevails in tropical zones, summer rainfall regions and mostly coastal areas in temperate regions. The high fecundity {{of the female}} parasite {{and its ability to}} persist in sheep for extended periods of time has helped in this parasite’s development of resistance to multiple synthetic anthelmintics. The development of parasite anthelmintic resistance has been influenced by producers’ over-reliance on these chemicals to control parasites as well as poor management practices such as under-dosing. With the increased occurrence of multiple drug resistant parasites, other more sustainable methods are being investigated, including the use of medicinal plant extracts with anthelmintic properties, such as garlic. The subsequent meat quality of the animals after being fed these herbal concoctions to control parasites is not often investigated. The aims of this thesis were to investigate the use of garlic to control the gastrointestinal nematode H. contortus and then evaluate the subsequent meat quality by consumer taste panel. To look at garlic for the control of H. contortus a 14 -week feeding trial was conducted over the summer of 2008. The trial used thirty nine Merino wether lambs in five groups fed a high quality basal ration and infected with 4000 L 3 “Kirby” H. contortus larvae. The treatment groups consisted of an untreated negative control group, a positive control group treated with abamectin 28 days post infection and three treatment groups fed 0. 9 %, 1. 8 % and 3. 6 % garlic (included into the basal ration). There was no reduction in worm egg counts between the negative control and the garlic treatment groups. There was however a significant interaction between the effects of the treatments and VFI on WEC. The 3. 6 % garlic treatment group had significantly lower final liveweight, weight gain, and feed conversion efficiencies than the 0. 9 % and 1. 8 % garlic treatment groups. The tenderloins collected from all animals at slaughter {{at the end of the}} feeding trial were used in a consumer taste panel to assess the subsequent meat quality. The meat samples were assessed by 104 untrained participants in a blind tasting. Participants were asked to <b>asses</b> the <b>meat</b> samples of flavour, acceptability as well as an optional comment section. Participants rated the flavour of the meat from the garlic and control lambs the same. The 3. 6 % garlic treatment had a significantly higher percentage of “yes” responses for the panellists’ assessment of “acceptability as lamb”. The 3. 6 % garlic also had a significantly higher percentage of positive comments about the samples, suggesting that this lamb was more acceptable than the meat from the control animals. The results from these experiments suggest that fresh garlic included in a pelleted ration does not show potential to aid in the control of H. contortus and may have negative effects on production if fed at a rate of 3. 6 %. However the inclusion of garlic in a pelleted ration improved the acceptability of lamb as assessed by consumers, so there may be the potential for a niche product...|$|R
