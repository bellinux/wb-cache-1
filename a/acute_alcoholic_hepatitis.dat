40|$|Abstract The hepatic cytosolic {{estrogen}} receptor {{content was}} measured in liver samples from patients with normal livers and from patients with nonalcoholic cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> The estrogen receptor content of normal liver was 5. 2 ± 3. 5 fmoles per mg of cytosolic protein. Levels which {{were not significantly different}} from this were found in the samples from patients with nonalcoholic cirrhosis (2. 1 ± 2. 0 fmoles per mg of cytosolic protein). The cytosolic estrogen receptor content in the livers of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who were abstaining was 4. 2 ± 3. 6 fmoles per mg of cytosolic protein, but it increased to 10. 4 ± 4. 9 fmoles per mg of protein in the livers of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who were drinking, to 17. 3 ± 8. 7 fmoles per mg of protein in the livers of patients with <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> with cirrhosis and to 22. 7 ± 15. 7 fmoles per mg of protein in the livers of patients with <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> without cirrhosis. Alcohol abuse appeared, therefore, to induce an increase in the estrogen receptor content of human liver, especially in patients who were drinking and had histological evidence of <b>acute</b> liver damage (<b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis).</b> The increase in hepatic estrogen receptor which we have observed may be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying the feminization of the liver in alcoholic males...|$|R
40|$|Many {{patients}} with liver disease {{would have to}} undergo surgery.

Child turchote pugh (CTP) and the model for end stage liver disease (MELD) are two scoring systems which are often used nowadays to stratify risk factors in patients with liver cirrhosis who will undergo surgery. Elective surgery is well tolerated in cirrhosis patients with CTP class A and permissible in patient with CTP class B with preoperative preparation, except for extensive liver resection surgery and cardiac surgery.

25|$|Excessive alcohol {{consumption}} {{is a significant}} cause of hepatitis and {{is the most common}} cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is within the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease. This ranges in order of severity and reversibility from alcoholic steatosis (least severe, most reversible), <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> cirrhosis, and liver cancer (most severe, least reversible).

40|$|Data on {{quantitative}} metabolic liver {{functions in}} the life-threatening disease <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> are scarce. Urea synthesis is an essential metabolic liver function that plays a key regulatory role in nitrogen homeostasis. The urea synthesis capacity decreases in patients with compromised liver function, whereas it increases in patients with inflammation. <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> involves both mechanisms, but how these opposite effects are balanced remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate how <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> affects the capacity for urea synthesis. We related these findings to another measure of metabolic liver function, the galactose elimination capacity (GEC), {{as well as to}} clinical disease severity. We included 20 patients with <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and 7 healthy controls. The urea synthesis capacity was quantified by the functional hepatic nitrogen clearance (FHNC), i. e., the slope of the linear relationship between the blood α-amino nitrogen concentration and urea nitrogen synthesis rate during alanine infusion. The GEC was determined using blood concentration decay curves after intravenous bolus injection of galactose. Clinical disease severity was assessed by the Glasgow <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>Hepatitis</b> Score and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The FHNC was markedly decreased in the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> patients compared with the healthy controls (7. 2 ± 4. 9 L/h vs. 37. 4 ± 6. 8 L/h, P< 0. 01), and the largest decrease was observed in those with severe <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (4. 9 ± 3. 6 L/h vs. 9. 9 ± 4. 9 L/h, P< 0. 05). The GEC was less markedly reduced than the FHNC. A negative correlation was detected between the FHNC and MELD score (rho = - 0. 49, P< 0. 05). <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> markedly decreases the urea synthesis capacity.

40|$|Alcohol is a {{major cause}} of liver {{cirrhosis}} in the Western world and accounts for the majority of cases of liver cirrhosis seen in district general hospitals in the UK. The three most widely recognised forms of alcoholic liver disease are alcoholic fatty liver (steatosis), <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> and alcoholic cirrhosis. The exact pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury is still not clear but immune mediated and free radical hepatic injury are thought to be important.

40|$|Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD) {{represents}} {{the second most}} common indication for Liver Transplantation (LT) worldwide. Outcomes of LT for ALD are comparable with those of liver transplantation for other aetiologies of liver disease; however, it&# 039;s still considered a controversial indication to LT, mainly because ALD is considered a self inflicted disease, and for the risk of relapse after LT. Most transplant programs require 6 months of abstinence in order to consider a patient suitable for LT, however the role of the length of pre transplant abstinence as predictor of alcohol relapse after LT is still controversial.

Ethanol failed to stimulate generation of chemotactic activity by either rat dermal fibroblasts, hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, or Kupffer cells. The chemotactic activity generated by ethanol-treated rat hepatocytes was recovered from culture supernatants in the lipid phase after extraction with chloroform/methanol.
