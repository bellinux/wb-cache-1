5|$|On 30 November 1974, an {{assassination}} attempt was made on Kiep, during which a man fired three shots <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of his sauna, though he remained uninjured. The assassin was never found and leads hinting towards involvement of the Red Army Faction proved inconclusive. As the German magazine Der Spiegel wrote a year later, some party colleagues allegedly considered it possible that Kiep had staged the attack himself.|$|E
5|$|Alex convinces Principal Skinner {{to have a}} school-dance {{rather than}} the regular yearly event of apple picking. Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind {{and goes to the}} school to take tickets <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but later arrives and discovers the boys and girls are standing on different sides of the room, and explains to Alex that it is like this because they are only children, not adults.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, other doctors were also experimenting with gland transplantation, {{including}} Serge Voronoff, {{who had become}} known for grafting monkey testicles into men. In 1920, Voronoff demonstrated his technique before several other doctors {{at a hospital in}} Chicago, at which Brinkley showed up uninvited. Though Brinkley was barred <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> his appearance elevated his profile in the press, which eventually resulted in his own demonstration at a hospital in Chicago. Brinkley transplanted goat testicles into 34 patients, including a judge, an alderman, a society matron and the chancellor of the now-defunct Chicago Law School (not {{to be confused with the}} University of Chicago Law School), all while the press looked on. His public profile grew, and his gland business in Milford continued at a brisk pace.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of a workhouse were {{at the mercy of}} the porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> itself or from the deck above.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Sally Sparrow enters Wester Drumlins, an {{abandoned}} house, {{to look for}} subjects to photograph. Instead she finds eerie statues and {{a message from the}} Doctor behind peeling wallpaper addressed to her, warning her about the Weeping Angels. Sally returns the next day with her friend Kathy Nightingale to explore further but Kathy disappears {{at the same time a}} young man knocks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> He claims to be Kathy's grandson and delivers a letter to Sally. The letter, written by Kathy, explains that she suddenly found herself in the 1920s in Hull. She settled down with a husband and led a peaceful life and requests that Sally tell Kathy's brother Larry of her disappearance. Sally sees a Yale key hanging from the hand of one of the statues and takes it before leaving.|$|E
5|$|Katy {{has been}} hired {{to take care of}} Hector and Tabitha's mansion while the two go out for the evening. They usually never leave the house, but have a rare event to attend. Tabitha greets Katy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and {{explains}} that the house is always kept at −3°C as Hector and Tabitha's disabled brother, Andras, needs the air to be at this temperature. The paintings on the house's walls depict the Harrowing of Hell. After meeting Hector, Katy is disturbed by Tabitha's descriptions of Andras, who, it is claimed, does not have a mouth. He instead keeps a bell, which he never uses, beside his bed. Katy is told not to go upstairs.|$|E

As Ocampo prepares to slit her throat, he is shot dead by timely arriving Doggett. Wells eventually goes to prison for his evidence suppression, a punishment he feels he deserves.|$|E

On Hallowe'en of the next year, Christine dresses up with her friend Bobby (Pemberton), a colleague at Clarks. Someone Christine assumes to be Adam enters the flat to pick up Jack. When Adam calls <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> Christine goes to Jack's room and finds Jack {{in the arms of}} the Stranger. On Bonfire Night, Christine arrives home with Jack, who has burnt his hand. Marion finds that Jack is not injured, but says that Christine was burnt when she was Jack's age.|$|E
5|$|She wore an {{imported}} black satin dress heavily beaded {{with tiny}} black jet beads, black satin slippers, beaded, and {{had on her}} rarely beautiful diamonds.... She stood before us, seemingly slight, graceful of carriage, and exquisitely beautiful even to critical eyes. Then, still standing, she faced her class as one who knew herself {{to be a teacher}} by divine right. She turned to the student {{at the end of the}} first row of seats and took direct mental cognizance of this one, plainly knocked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of this individual consciousness.... This continued until each member of the class had received the same mental cognizance. No audible word voiced the purely mental contact.|$|E
5|$|Swift {{stations}} {{were given a}} number of small improvements after the line opened. Curb bumpers were installed in June 2010 to help guide buses closer to the raised platform, and reduce the gap <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> In 2012, a queue jump signal was installed northbound {{at the north end of}} the BAT lanes at 148th Street, allow Swift buses to merge into traffic. Real-time arrival signs debuted at Swift stations in 2013, featuring a countdown to the arrival of the next bus that is estimated using GPS units on coaches. In June 2015, the Washington State Department of Transportation removed part of the refuge island at the intersection of State Route 99 and Airport Road to create a through lane exclusively for Swift buses.|$|E

5|$|The Playford family {{heritage}} can {{be traced}} back to 1759, when a baby boy was left <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of a house in Barnby Dun, Yorkshire, England, with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. The occupants of the house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed. The child grew up to be a simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 who he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this way has continued since.|$|E
5|$|British {{secret service}} agent James Bond appears <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> asking for a room, having had a flat tyre while passing. Bond quickly realises that Horror and Sluggsy are mobsters and that Viv is in danger. Pressuring the two men, he {{eventually}} gets the gangsters to agree to provide him a room. Bond tells Michel {{that he is in}} America in the wake of Operation Thunderball and was detailed to protect a Russian nuclear expert who defected to the West and who now lives in Toronto, as part of his quest to ferret out SPECTRE. That night Sluggsy and Horror set fire to the motel and attempt to kill Bond and Michel. A gun battle ensues and, during their escape, Horror and Sluggsy's car crashes into a lake. Bond and Michel retire to bed, but Sluggsy is still alive and makes a further attempt to kill them, before Bond shoots him.|$|E
5|$|Georges, an only child, showed early {{aptitude}} {{for music and}} quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons. By listening <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex chordal structures. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that {{he was ready to}} begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso {{who was a member of}} the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.|$|E

5|$|Hare was {{released}} on 5 February 1829—his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection—and was assisted in leaving Edinburgh in disguise by the mailcoach to Dumfries. At one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow-passenger, Erskine Douglas Sandford, a junior counsel who had represented Wilson's family; Sandford informed his fellow passengers of Hare's identity. On arrival in Dumfries the news of Hare's presence spread and a large crowd gathered at the hostelry where he was due to stay the night. Police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off the crowd while Hare escaped through a back window and into a carriage which {{took him to the}} town's prison for safekeeping. A crowd surrounded the building; stones were thrown <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 special constables arrived to restore order. In the small hours of the morning, escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard, Hare was taken out of town, set down on the Annan Road and instructed to make his way to the English border. There were no subsequent reliable sightings of him and his eventual fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the guests}} arrive, they then begin eating their meal, when {{suddenly}} another guest arrives <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> It is {{revealed to be}} Kevin Swanson, the son of Joe and Bonnie Swanson, whom they had presumed had died fighting {{in the war in}} Iraq. Overjoyed, they ask why the army had reported that he had died in action. Kevin then tells them a story that he was in a coma following a bomb that had been placed inside a turkey during Thanksgiving years before. Later, while having dessert, Kevin voices his distaste of the war, and reveals several inconsistencies about his time in Iraq. Kevin then tells his father that he had actually gone A.W.O.L., and because most of his unit was killed in the bombing but he miraculously survived, he faked his own death in order to leave the war and return home. Angered by his son's confession, Joe arrests him for the crime of desertion and handcuffs him {{with the rest of the}} family criticizing him for lying about being a war hero.|$|E

Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth. He looks up at {{what appears to be the}} Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade. A swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters descend on Leo, all of whom are apes.|$|E
