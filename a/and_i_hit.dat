500|$|Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957 {{when they}} were fellow {{students}} at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but {{when she said that}} she was engaged, he screamed out, [...] "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?" [...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his own story, [...] "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit.</b> I fought men <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> women. That is why I am always on about peace." ...|$|E
500|$|In his written {{confession}} {{released by}} Peruvian police, Van der Sloot recounted that he briefly left {{the hotel to}} get some coffee and bread, and returned to find Flores using his laptop computer without his permission. A police source stated {{that she may have}} found information linking him to the disappearance of Holloway. An altercation allegedly began, and she attempted to escape. According to the aforementioned written confession released by Peruvian authorities, Van der Sloot stated, [...] "I did not want to do it. The girl intruded into my private life [...] [...] [...] she didn't have any right. I went to her <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> her. She was scared, we argued and she tried to escape. I grabbed her by the neck and hit her." [...] Van der Sloot reportedly stated that he was stoned on marijuana at the time. A detective linked to the case said that Van der Sloot considered getting rid of the body in a suitcase, but decided against it because he would have been stopped at the front desk. He then reportedly drank espresso and took amphetamines to counter fatigue before fleeing.|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{reportedly}} {{trained in}} several martial art styles in his youth, primarily in Tai Chi and either boxing or kickboxing. He abandoned boxing because of two incidents: one with his boxing coach {{and one with}} Ip Man. The first incident apparently occurred because Wong accidentally struck his boxing coach during sparring. The angry coach attacked in earnest, only to be eventually knocked out by Wong; the incident caused Wong to leave boxing. In another account, however, Wong said he had defeated his boxing coach with wing chun techniques: [...] "I was sparring with my instructor <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> him very hard, he got real mad and came at me very hard. I fought back with wing chun {{and he ended up}} bleeding. Boxing was over for me!" ...|$|E

[...] Haaretz provided a similar translation of the minutes. When an Arabist at the Washington Post translated the same transcript, Bush {{was said to have}} indicated that God inspired him to, [...] "end the tyranny in Iraq," [...] instead.|$|R

2500|$|Rogue Traders {{formed as}} an Australian electronic, pop rock band in Melbourne in 2002 by {{former members of}} Union State, James Ash (aka Jamie Appleby) on {{keyboards}} and Steve Davis on guitar. The duo had met in 1989 in London where both were working as DJs. The pair first worked on a rap track, Ash recalled [...] "It was a terrible song but Steve <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> it off straight away and became fast friends". Ash relocated to Melbourne in 1992, but the pair continued {{to work together and}} formed Union State to release singles including, [...] "Out to Get You" [...] and [...] "Retrosexual". In 1994 Ash signed with Vicious Vinyl as a solo artist under the name, Thunderchild, to issue a self-named single. By 2002 the duo had formed Rogue Traders and signed with Vicious Vinyl's house music label, Vicious Grooves.|$|E
2500|$|Our {{mechanic}} {{and general}} runner was David Nice, an Englishman from Colchester, {{who was not}} unlike me in a way, for his nose appeared to be, profile view anyway, very similar to mine (poor lad!) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> on the splendid idea of putting him out on the track in my place during the neutralised period. Tracksuited, a scarf over {{the lower part of}} his face and a Russian hat that I had bought completed the disguise. He was me to anyone giving a cursory glance at the figures plodding round the track. The get-up was quite in order for it became very cold there at night as they used to turn off all the heating. Everything went well for the first night of the wheeze and I congratulated myself on the plan. It could not go on [...] for ever, though, worse luck, for on the very next night the game was up. Dave was trundling round wrapped up to the eyebrows as before when, horrors upon horrors, the track manager, who often rode a bike round himself during the quiet time, started to talk to him.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News in November 2009, Clarkson stated that while performing on the All I Ever Wanted Tour, she would also be {{in the process of}} writing new material for her fifth studio album, which she hoped for a late 2010 release. Later, during the Chart Show TV, Clarkson revealed that she wanted to do something different for the album. Her label felt the same way. On March 4, 2010, Clarkson was announced to perform on the revived Lilith Fair music festival. However, low ticket sales and scheduling conflicts led Clarkson and Norah Jones to cancel their upcoming performances. Clarkson remarked she would focus on recording for her upcoming album instead. Clarkson took a six-month break from her music career in 2010. Clarkson, who had a hectic schedule following the release of her sophomore album Breakaway, admitted that her music career had a bad effect on her health, saying [...] "Because my career went from zero to 100, there was no 'growing'. I learnt well under pressure, but, like, four years passed by <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> rock bottom, Breakaway just exploded everywhere. Everyone was making a lot of money, so everyone was pushing the train. That's when it finally all caught up with me. I came down with 'walking pneumonia' {{for the second time in}} a year. My body was physically giving up. I took six months off and went home. I love working, but at the end of the day you've got to take care of yourself." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{willingness}} {{to experiment with}} the Moog led to unexpected results, such as the time he stumbled into the signature sound for [...] "Hoedown", one of ELP's most popular tunes. He later said, [...] "We'd started working on that arrangement <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>hit,</b> <b>I</b> don't know what, I switched a blue button <b>and</b> <b>I</b> put a patch cord in there, but anyway 'whoooeee.'" ...|$|R

2500|$|At the 1985 French Open, Evert {{would play}} her {{antagonist}} in Navratilova {{in the final}} {{for the third time}} here in Paris at Roland Garros. [...] In the first set, Evert would take the first three games, which Evert held her serve steady, and she broke Navratilova during the second game. [...] Evert would lose her serve in the fifth game of the set that gave her opponent a chance to level the set at three games-all, and she did just that. [...] To wrap up the set, Evert would rally off the next three games to take the set six games to three, breaking Navratilova in the eight game. [...] In the second set, it would be rather competitive with many ebbs and flows, even more so than the first set. [...] Evert would hold serve in the second set all the way until the eighth game, which Navratilova broke her serve to get back on serve, and would hold in the ninth game to take a five games to four advantage. [...] This set was still in doubt because both could not manage to hold serves and in the eleventh and twelfth games both would take turns in breaking each other's serves. [...] This sent the second set to a tiebreaker, which Navratilova would roar out of the gates with a four to one points advantage, and Evert could not manage {{to get back in the}} breaker that ended seven points to four. [...] In the 52 minute third set, Evert would storm out to a three games to love advantage, but knowing Navratilova, Evert found herself in a tumultuous battle for the title because her opponent would break back to level the set three games-all. [...] Evert managed to stave off a crucial break point opportunity in the seventh game of the set, when Navratilova guided her forehand into the net, and the score went to four game to three. [...] Evert broke Navratilova in the eighth game of the set, which allowed Evert to serve for the match at five games to three. [...] Evert would be incapable to serve out the match during the ninth game, which Navratilova broke, so this made the score five games to four. [...] In addition, Evert would serve twice for the match, but was broken at 15 and love in those games. [...] This failure to convert would cost Evert some grief by having in the eleventh game, which was because she got down love-40 on serve. [...] It took some fantastic shot making in order to divert having to break to stay in the match, which it a twist-of-fate Evert would break her opponent in the subsequent game to take the lead at six games to five. [...] Evert serving for the match at 30-all hit a winner crosscourt, and at match point went down the line, which then the championships was hers after a two-hour and 52 minute final tussle of the clash-of-the-tennis-titans. [...] Evert said [...] "when I hit the last winner down the line I was really proud of myself...I never gave up and when I finally got to match point I went for a winner <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hit</b> it. I had held my emotions in for so long that I really kind of let go." [...] This title was her sixth French Open title and 17th slam for her career.|$|E
