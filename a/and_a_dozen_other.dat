In London, the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage, and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Empire, the 293 firemen of Paris were underpaid, untrained and poorly equipped. They usually lived at home and had second jobs, usually as shoemakers. They reported to both the Prefect of the Seine and the Prefect of Police, which caused bureaucratic disputes. They possessed only two ladders, one kept at the National Library, and other at the market of Les Halles. Their shortcomings became evident on 1 July 1810, when a fire broke out at the Austrian Embassy on the Chausée d'Antin during a ball given to celebrate the wedding of Napoleon and Marie-Louise of Austria. Napoleon and Marie-Louise escaped unharmed, but the wife of the Austrian Ambassador and the Princess de la Leyen were killed, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>other</b> guests died later from their burns. Napoleon himself wrote a report of the event, noting that only six firemen had appeared, and several of them were drunk. Napoleon issued a decree on September 18, 1811 which militarized the firemen into a battalion of sapeur-pompiers, with four companies of one hundred forty-two men each, under the Prefect of Police and the Ministry of the Interior. The firemen were required to live in four barracks built for them around the city, and to have watchmen on duty around the city.|$|E
25|$|The plot of Stargate SG-1 {{picks up}} {{a year after the}} {{conclusion}} of the events recounted in the original feature film. It follows the present-day adventures of SG-1, a military team from Earth. SG-1 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>other</b> SG teams venture to distant planets using an alien portal known as a Stargate, which in the series is housed in a top-secret United States Air Force military base known as Stargate Command (SGC) in the underground Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In the first eight seasons, the mission of the SG teams is to explore the galaxy and search for alien technology and allies to defend Earth against the Goa'uld, a snake-like parasitic alien race that takes humans as unwilling hosts. As explained in the series' backstory, the Goa'uld had transported human slaves from Earth to other habitable planets across the galaxy thousands of years ago and now pose as gods of old Earth mythologies, particularly Ancient Egypt. SG-1 eventually learns that highly evolved human-like beings, known as the Ancients, had originally built the Stargate network millions of years earlier, before ascending to a higher plane of existence, after which they pledged not to interfere in the lives of other species. The Ori, a faction of the same race as the Ancients who instead use their powers to subjugate other species by religious indoctrination, assume the role of the main antagonists in seasons Season 9 and Season 10.|$|E
