40|$|Administrative {{databases}} {{for long-term}} care frequently collect information on fixed dates of the calendar year, rather than for entire episodes of care. Patients discharged or dying prior to an evaluation date are lost to follow-up. We used one such database, the VA Patient <b>Assessment</b> <b>File,</b> to examine pressure ulcer occurrence in long-term care. Clinical studies have established that most pressure ulcers develop during the first several weeks following admission. In these data, however, pressure ulcer development was less common in patients assessed within 2 months following admission, as compared to those examined at 3 to 6 months. This finding appears {{to be related to}} the selective discharge of patients, which makes these patient populations noncomparable. These results highlight that care must be exercised when interpreting results obtained from such administrative data...|$|E
40|$|Raloxifene is marketed in France for {{prevention}} of nontraumatic vertebral fracture in postmenopausal women. In animal pharmacology studies, {{it was found}} to both agonize and antagonize estrogen. The <b>assessment</b> <b>file</b> is methodologically sound but fails to answer many practical questions. A placebo-controlled trial showed that raloxifene reduced the risk of vertebral collapse after 2 years of treatment, in both primary and secondary prevention, but demonstrated no effect on nonvertebral fractures. In this trial, raloxifene also reduced {{the risk of breast}} cancer. Two trials versus combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) showed HRT had a more favourable effect on surrogate end points reflecting the risk of fracture and cardiovascular risk (changes in bone mineral density and lipid profile). Compared with combined HRT, raloxifene reduced the incidence of menorrhagia and mastodynia, but did not relieve symptoms linked to menopause. Results of animal studies call for close clinical monitoring to detect a possible increase in the incidence of ovarian cancer...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the importance of}} case-mix adjustment in interpreting differences in rates of pressure ulcer development in Department of Veterans Affairs long- term care facilities. DESIGN: A sample assembled from the Patient <b>Assessment</b> <b>File,</b> a Veterans Affairs administrative database, was used to derive predictors of pressure ulcer development; the resulting model was validated in a separate sample. Facility-level rates of pressure ulcer development, both unadjusted and adjusted for case mix using the predictive model, were compared. SETTING: Department of Veterans Affairs long-term care facilities. PATIENTS: The derivation sample consisted of 31 150 intermediate medicine and nursing home residents who were initially free of pressure ulcers and were institutionalized between October 1991 and April 1993. The validation sample consisted of 17 946 residents institutionalized from April 1993 to October 1993. MEASUREMENT: Development of a stage 2 or greater pressure ulcer. RESULTS: 11 factors predicted pressure ulcer development. Validated performance properties of the resulting model were good. Model-predicted rates of pressure ulcer development at individual long-term care facilities varied from 1. 9 % to 6. 3 %, and observed rates ranged from 0 % to 10. 9 %. Case-mix-adjusted rates and ranks of facilities differed considerably from unadjusted ratings. For example, among five facilities that were identified as high outliers {{on the basis of}} unadjusted rates, two remained as outliers after adjustment for case mix. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term care facilities differ in case mix. Adjustments for case mix result in different judgments about facility performance and should be used when facility incidence rates are compared...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{for this study}} were to assess association between completion of any wellness coaching program and changes in health-related quality of life over one year and over two years, and to assess cumulative effects of completion of multiple wellness coaching programs and changes in health-related quality of life over one year and over two years. The data sources {{for this study were}} obtained from a health risk <b>assessment</b> <b>file,</b> eligibility files and individual health plan enrollment data for a private insurance plan cohort. The sample inclusion criteria for analysis of the one-year effect of coaching was completion of health risk assessments in two adjacent years and individuals who completed coaching in the baseline year without having completed coaching in the prior year comprised the coaching group. They were matched to individuals who hadn 2 ̆ 7 t completed wellness coaching in either of the two years. For analysis of the two-year effect of coaching, individuals who completed wellness coaching in the baseline year and completed health risk assessments two years later were included. Those who hadn 2 ̆ 7 t completed wellness coaching in the baseline year or the following year were matched to cases for analysis. ^ Sample exclusion criteria were missing at least one SF- 8 score, being pregnant, or reporting presence or absence of diseases in the baseline year which differed after one year for the one-year analysis or that differed after two years for the two-year analysis. Analysis of Covariance and Markov chain model were employed to analyze change in health-related quality of life scores. ^ ANCOVA results for cumulative effects on specific coaching programs showed that individuals who participated in nutrition wellness coaching {{were more likely to have}} increased mental component summary scores one year later than those individuals who did not participate in coaching (difference in adjusted means= 1. 018, P value= 0. 018,). ANCOVA results also showed that individuals who participated in stress management coaching were less likely to have increases in mental component summary scores over one year (P value= 0. 007, difference in adjusted means= - 1. 828) and two years (P value 3 ̆c 0. 001, difference in adjusted means= - 1. 952) and less likely to have increases in physical component summary scores over two years (P value= 0. 037, difference in adjusted means= - 0. 956) than those individuals who did not participate. Results from Markov chain models on individual domains showed that individuals who participated in any coaching were more likely to have higher social functioning scores over one year (change in cumulative log odds ratio= 0. 17, P value= 0. 027) and less likely to have higher role physical scores over two years than individuals who did not participate in any coaching. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. Background : The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were: to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born {{at the start of}} the 21 st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will require to provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229) to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and development to focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may be to emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhood to investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when available Additional objectives subsequently included for MCS were: to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion) to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom The first sweep (MCS 1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS 2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS 3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS 4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, and the fifth sweep (MCS 5) in 2012 - 2013, when they were eleven years old. Sub-sample studies : Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see SN 5614). Weighting : Users should note that the weighting section in the 'Guide to the Datasets' document recommends analysis in Stata, as SPSS is not currently able to weight the data using the survey design factors. The depositor is working on a solution for SPSS, but this is not yet available. A Stata version of the dataset is available for download by registered users, alongside the SPSS and tab-delimited versions. MCS web pages : Further information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website. MCS 4 : The objectives of MCS 4 were the same as MCS 3, namely: to continue tracking the child's physical, cognitive and behavioural development to chart continuity and change in the child's family circumstances and physical environment up to age seven to record the child's transition to primary school and their experience of the first years at school to track the child's previous experience of early education and day-care, along with current out-of-school care arrangements record the progress of the child's older siblings to re-contact families who had participated in at least one of the earlier surveys but who may not have participated in all sweeps to ask the children directly about their thoughts and experiences at age seven The first edition of MCS 4 was released in April 2010. For the second edition (November 2010), some extra materials were deposited: the MCS 4 geographically-linked data file, the main MCS 4 Technical Report and Appendix, the Teacher Survey questionnaires for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and the Teacher Survey technical report. For the third edition (August 2012), a new derived variables dataset was added to the study, along with an updated version of the household grid file and an updated 'Guide to the Datasets' document. For the fourth edition (December 2012), an updated version of the derived variables dataset was added to the study. Syntax was also run on the parent interview dataset to remove some variables that had been updated and moved to the derived variables dataset - see list in the 'READ' file for details. A new Derived Variables User Guide and an updated Guide to the Datasets have been added to the documentation. For the fifth edition (September 2015), the MCS 4 Cohort Member <b>assessment</b> <b>file</b> has been updated and now includes the Standardised Maths Score and Anonymised Interview number. For the sixth edition (November 2015), Children's Aspirations Classification data and accompanying documentation were added to the study. In August 2011, the Teacher Survey data and documentation were removed from this study. They are now available in a separate study: SN 6848 - Millennium Cohort Study: Fourth Survey Teacher Survey, 2008. Main Topics : The files currently included in the MCS 4 study comprise data from the main Parent Interview, the Household Grid, Child Measurement and Assessment and the Cohort Member self completion questionnaire. The Parent Interview file comprises data from the Main Respondent, Partner Respondent and Proxy Respondent questionnaires, which covered household information; family context; early education, schooling and childcare; child and family activities and child's behaviour; parenting activities; child's health; parent's health; employment, income and education; housing and local area; and other matters. The 'unfolding brackets' questions, used to home in on an income that was not known exactly, have been split out into separate files for ease of navigation through the dataset. The Household Grid file comprises demographic data on households and additional derived variables. The Child Assessments and Measurement files include cognitive and physical measurements, including the 'Story of Sally and Anne' cognitive protocol; the British Ability Scales covering Picture Similarities, Naming Vocabulary and Pattern Construction; and Maths Test; height; weight; and waist circumference and body fat measurement. The Cohort Member paper self completion was given to all participant children.

Portfolio assessment considers students from different perspectives and particularly focuses on students‟ affective characteristics. Therefore, in this study, studying on self-efficacy, peer and self assessment was crucial. This study was carried out with total 215 students in eight classes, from four different Higher Education units. From each department, one experimental and one control groups were randomly selected. Portfolio assessment group and traditional assessment (control group) group involved 109 and 106 students, respectively. In the first stage of the study, both experimental and control groups, in the second stage of the study, only experimental group participated to this study. The qualitative and quantitative data obtained in this study were analyzed by means of SPSS statistical analysis 11 package program. Considering the variety of the data, factor analysis and reliability test were used in the development of research instruments. In analyzing qualitative data, descriptive analysis was used. t-test, power test, sampling test and correlation test were utilized in the analysis of the quantitative data. Results show that portfolio assessment effected students‟ affective characteristics and life skills positively. The difference between portfolio assessment and traditional way of assessment was statistically meaningful in favor of portfolio assessment in terms of students‟ self-efficacy, awareness of practical skills and transforming theoretical knowledge to life skills.

40|$|Introduction: The fast {{developments}} in pharmacovigilance {{in the past}} decades have had far-reaching consequences for the way of working in national pharmacovigilance centers. Firstly, processing and distribution of adverse drug reaction reports on both national and international levels became more complicated and required an adequate working flow of the reports and quality control to meet all regulatory requirements and technical standards. Secondly, the application of quantitative approaches in signal detection enabled the detection {{of large numbers of}} possible signals, still needed to be evaluated from a clinical perspective. This requires an adequate prioritisation and efficient diffusion of the signals involved. Both developments ask for a more efficient way of report processing and signal management. In the past decades the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb developed a way of working to improve report processing and signal detection to meet the current needs. Aim: The aim of this presentation is to describe the various work flows concerning report processing and signal detection. In addition, steps taken to increase the efficiency, reliability and transparency of the system will be discussed. Description: The infrastructure of the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance centre consists of four main elements. In the first place a computerised working flow for the coding, <b>assessment,</b> <b>filing</b> and distributing the ADR reports in the database is available. Quality checks and systems are in place to ensure an effective processing of the reports. Secondly, information from other sources like literature, other databases and analysis which are previously carried out, are made automatically available for the assessors to reduce the workload. In addition, an automated signal management system ensures a transparent signal detection and handling of the publication process. Finally, a dedicated website presents the output in a transparent and automated way, both in respect to the individual case reports as for signals issued. Handling of the reports and signal detection are closely interrelated. Actions needed for processing reports are also the basis in the first steps of signal detection and diffusion of the signals, thus increasing the efficiency of the system. Conclusion: The growing number of reports and signals are a challenge for many pharmacovigilance centers and asks for tuning of these various processes in which information technology plays a pivotal role. In order to ensure a high quality of both reports and signals regulatory requirements should be realistic and easy implementable in the current routines. Transparent processes will enhance the acceptability of our work by the general public...|$|R

Once a tax return is assessed, it {{may be subject to}} review. In some cases, a tax return could be reviewed before being assessed.|$|R
40|$|The {{statistical}} survey „PDF im Web“ {{deals with the}} quantitative evaluation of the file format Portable Document Format (PDF) on the World Wide Web. The main interest {{of this paper is}} to illustrate and demonstrate a method which allows a numerical <b>assessment</b> of this <b>file</b> format on the internet. Main focus of the analysis is the calculation of the percentage of the PDF documents to certain queries and the average document size of the queried PDF files. The survey bases on search engine hit lists from Google which were generated by structured queries. The demonstrated method will be exemplary tested by a sample of 50 queries. The evaluation compares the findings for both publication languages German and English and for different complex queries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE To {{identify}} {{the incidence of}} mortality, diarrheal diseases, scabies and falls; and the prevalence of pressure ulcers - {{all of which are}} related to the safety ofinstitutionalized older adults. METHOD This was a documentary retrospective study developed in a long-term residential careinstitution for older adults in the Northeast region of Brazil. The data were gathered from records of health <b>assessment</b> indicators <b>filed</b> between January 2008 and December 2015. Analysis included absolute case frequency; the sum of monthly prevalence and incidence rates; mean values of cases; and mean annual incidence and prevalence rates. RESULTS The incidence of mortality over these nine years ranged from 9 % to 13 %; of acute diarrheic disease from 13 % to 45 %; and scabies from 21 % to 63 %. The prevalence of pressure ulcers ranged from 8 % to 23 %. Between 2012 and 2015, the incidence rate of falls without injury varied from 38 % to 83 %, and with injury from 12 % to 20 %. CONCLUSION Analysis of the health indicators revealeda high incidence of scabies and falls and a high prevalence of pressure ulcers. The identification of less than optimal rates for performance indicators canhelp improve the quality of nursing care...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{delivery of}} child health services in Australian Aboriginal communities, and to identify gaps in services required to improve the health of Aboriginal children. Design: Cross-sectional baseline audit for a quality improvement intervention. Setting and participants: 297 children aged at least 3 months and under 5 years in 11 Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, Far West New South Wales and Western Australia in 2006. Main outcome measures: Adherence to guideline-scheduled services including clinical examinations, brief interventions or advice on health-related behaviour and risks, and enquiry regarding social conditions; and recorded follow-up of identified problems. Results: Documentation of delivery of specific clinical examinations (26 %– 80 %) was relatively good, but was poorer for brief interventions or advice on health-related behaviour and risks (5 %– 36 %) and enquiry regarding social conditions (3 %– 11 %). Compared with children in Far West NSW and WA, those attending NT centres {{were significantly more likely}} to have a record of growth faltering, underweight, chronic ear disease, anaemia, or chronic respiratory disease (P < 0. 005). Only 11 %– 13 % of children with identified social problems had an <b>assessment</b> report on <b>file.</b> An action plan was documented for 22 % of children with growth faltering and 13 % with chronic ear disease; 43 % of children with chronic respiratory disease and 31 % with developmental delay had an <b>assessment</b> report on <b>file.</b> Conclusion: Existing systems are not providing for adequate follow-up of identified medical and social problems for children living in remote Aboriginal communities; development of systems for immediate and longer-term sustainable responses to these problems should be a priority. Without effective systems for follow-up, screening children for disease and adverse social circumstances will result in little or no benefit...|$|R
