5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study {{by researchers at}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison to the typical <b>American</b> <b>male,</b> NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average <b>American</b> <b>male.</b> The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This {{may be due to the}} increased momentum of collisions from speed players.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War in 1861 led to expansion {{of the federal government}} and notable growth in the District's population, including a large influx of freed slaves. President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act in 1862, which ended slavery in the District of Columbia and freed about 3,100 enslaved persons, nine months prior to the Emancipation Proclamation. In 1868, Congress granted the District's African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> residents the right to vote in municipal elections.|$|E

In London, the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage, and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns.|$|E

The 6 -year graduation rate for African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> at 4 -year public institutions and private nonprofit colleges is less than 40 %. This figure suggests that persistence toward degree attainment is a problem. The {{purpose of this study}} was to ascertain whether selected precollege- and college-level variables have a relationship to retention and graduation for African <b>American</b> <b>males.</b> Gateway University, a historically black college and university, was the site of the investigation.

5|$|Till {{was born}} and raised in Chicago and in August 1955, was visiting {{relatives}} near Money, in the Mississippi Delta region. He spoke to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant, the white married proprietor of a small grocery store there. Although what happened at the store is a matter of dispute, Till was accused of flirting with or whistling at Bryant. Decades later, Bryant disclosed that, in 1955, she had fabricated testimony that Till made verbal or physical advances towards her in the store. Till's reported behavior, perhaps unwittingly, violated the strictures of conduct for an African <b>American</b> <b>male</b> interacting with a white woman in the Jim Crow-era South. Several nights after the store incident, Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother J. W. Milam went armed to Till's great-uncle's house and abducted the boy. They took him away and beat and mutilated him before shooting him in the head and sinking his body in the Tallahatchie River. Three days later, Till's body was discovered and retrieved from the river.|$|E
5|$|A quadruple-double {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a double digit number total in four of five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—in a game. This feat is extremely rare: only four players have officially recorded a quadruple-double in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. The first <b>American</b> <b>male</b> player above the high school level to officially record a quadruple-double was Nate Thurmond, who achieved this feat in 1974 while playing for the NBA's Chicago Bulls. The first American female player above the high school level to officially record a quadruple-double was Ann Meyers, who achieved this feat in 1978 while playing for the UCLA Bruins, when women's college sports were {{under the auspices of the}} AIAW. The first male player in NCAA Division I history to record a quadruple-double was Lester Hudson in 2007. The first Division I women's player to have officially recorded a quadruple-double since the NCAA began sponsoring women's sports in 1981–82 was Veronica Pettry of Loyola of Chicago in 1989; only two other women have done so since, and none since 1993. An earlier player, Jackie Spencer of Louisville, accomplished the feat against Cincinnati during the 1984–85 season, but the NCAA did not record assists and steals throughout Division I women's basketball at that time. The Metro Conference, then home to both schools, did officially record these statistics, but the NCAA did not start doing so until 1985–86 for assists and 1987–88 for steals.|$|E

African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> {{experience}} poor academic performance, high absenteeism at school, and {{are at increased risk}} of being involved in violence than other racial groups. Given that the educational outlook for African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> appears bleak, it is important to assess the aspirations of these adolescent males in order to find the gap between aspirations and educational attainment. In order to promote positive development within this population, it is essential that factors that affect African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> be identified. A survey was administered to male students attending elementary, middle, and high schools in a local school district. A cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the career and educational aspirations of African <b>American</b> <b>males.</b> A total of 473 males were surveyed: 45 % African American, 22 % Caucasian, 13 % biracial, and 19 % Other (including Asian American, Hispanic, Native American). The results revealed that African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> aspired to attend college {{at the same rate as}} other ethnic groups. Also, African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> were more likely to aspire to be professional athletes than males from other ethnic groups.

40|$|Teaching and Learning Department {{capstone}} projectResearch {{has shown}} a disparity in educational achievement of African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> relative to their white counterparts. Many theories attempt to explain why African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> continue to lag behind in the classroom, and some have offered some solutions to this problem. Researchers believe that African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> are seen as disengaged in school and as a result, they lack confidence, self-esteem, and self efficacy. These barriers derive from not having sense of belonging and connection to school and their community. 	This paper will take a more in depth look at why African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> underachieve in schools and the role that self-efficacy plays in this. This paper will discuss the learner and learning, the environment, the curriculum, and instructional strategies and assessment and how they play an imperative role in African <b>American</b> <b>males</b> being successful in school.

Police Sergeants Sam Levy and Bill Moran arrived moments behind Gibbons and Wolff. They ran behind the duplexes at 1435 and 1439 Lakeview Road, and used the alley to get behind the Lakeview Tavern. They then moved down the driveway between the tavern and the Evans home to reach Auburndale Avenue. At this point, Moran was shot and dived behind a car parked on the street, where he was shot again.

His satisfaction at this honor was undermined by his concerns that this award was more of the industry congratulating itself for having him as a token and it would inhibit him from asking for more substantive considerations afterward.
