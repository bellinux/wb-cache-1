40|$|Surveys {{are carried}} out to assess {{the status of the}} stock of Norwegian spring {{spawning}} herring. During these surveys fish are caught and certain measurements are taken on each captured unit, such as length and age assessment. Due to the cost, both in time and money, mostly lengths are obtained. The distribution of lengths does not directly and clearly convey the necessary information to assess, for example the differences in the <b>age</b> <b>distributions</b> in different subregions, or different depths at different times, of the Vestfjord system, or the abundance by age in the region. Length is a causal effect of age and this relationship is modelled so that ages can then be calibrated from lengths.

40|$|Many {{processes}} in nature are modeled using compartmental systems (reservoir/pool/box systems). Usually, they are {{expressed as a}} set of first-order differential equations describing the transfer of matter across a network of compartments. The concepts of age of matter in compartments and the time required for particles to transit the system are important diagnostics of these models with applications {{to a wide range of}} scientific questions. Until now, explicit formulas for transit-time and <b>age</b> <b>distributions</b> of nonlinear time-dependent compartmental systems were not available. We compute densities for these types of systems under the assumption of well-mixed compartments. Assuming that a solution of the nonlinear system is available at least numerically, we show how to construct a linear time-dependent system with the same solution trajectory. We demonstrate how to exploit this solution to compute transit-time and <b>age</b> <b>distributions</b> in dependence on given start values and initial <b>age</b> <b>distributions.</b> Furthermore, we derive equations for the time evolution of quantiles and moments of the <b>age</b> <b>distributions.</b> Our results generalize available density formulas for the linear time-independent case and mean-age formulas for the linear time-dependent case. As an example, we apply our formulas to a nonlinear and a linear version of a simple global carbon cycle model driven by a time-dependent input signal which represents fossil fuel additions. We derive time-dependent <b>age</b> <b>distributions</b> for all compartments and calculate the time it takes to remove fossil carbon in a business-as-usual scenario...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} between mean age theory and conventional residence time distributions over {{a range of}} quantified mixing levels was conducted using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The system was a stirred tubular reactor. The model was validated by comparing computationally derived RTD curves with experimentally obtained RTD curves, with quantified differences less than 3 %. Mixing was quantified using the Tanks-in-Series model. Mixing levels were set by varying flow rate and impeller rpm. Mean <b>age</b> <b>distributions</b> at the outlet, where experimental RTD’s were measured, were very narrow for all levels of mixing studied. RTD’s showed expected characteristics; a wider distribution and long decay for high mixing cases and a narrow distribution centered around the mean time for cases approaching plug flow. Mean <b>age</b> <b>distributions</b> remained substantially narrower than RTD’s. RTD’s and mean <b>age</b> <b>distributions</b> were measured at several locations {{along the length of}} the reactor to determine changes in characteristics of each along the reactor. RTD’s and mean <b>age</b> <b>distributions</b> exhibited a narrowing {{along the length of the}} reactor, indicating a transition from well-mixed characteristics near the entrance to plug flow behavior near the exit. Differences in the mean age and mean residence time at the outlet increased from 7 % at low mixing to 30 % at high mixing. Ultimately, this study showed mean <b>age</b> <b>distributions</b> are not comparable to RTD curves over a range of mixing levels. Mean age theory can provide age of material throughout an entire system volume, while RTD’s provide a distribution only at a single measurable location...|$|R
