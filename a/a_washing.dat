5|$|Maraba's coffee {{plants are}} the Bourbon {{variety of the}} Coffea arabica species and are grown on fertile {{volcanic}} soils on high-altitude hills. The fruit is handpicked, mostly {{during the rainy season}} between March and May, and brought to <b>a</b> <b>washing</b> station in Maraba, where the coffee beans are extracted and dried. At several stages, the beans are sorted according to quality. The farmers receive credits based on the amount and quality of the beans they provide.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} have specifically compared baptism with the Isiac initiation described by Apuleius. Before the early fourth century CE, baptism was {{the culmination of}} a long process, in which the convert to Christianity fasted for the forty days of Lent before being immersed at Easter in a cistern or natural body of water. Like the mysteries of Isis, then, early Christian baptism involved a days-long fast and <b>a</b> <b>washing</b> ritual. Both fasting and washing were common types of ritual purification found in the religions of the Mediterranean, and Christian baptism was specifically derived from the baptism of Jesus and Jewish immersion rituals. Therefore, according to Hugh Bowden, these similarities come from the shared religious background of Christianity and the Isis cult, not from the influence of one tradition upon the other.|$|E
5|$|The chassis of the C5 {{consists}} of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, {{a subsidiary of the}} Dutch company Philips. Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by <b>a</b> <b>washing</b> machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns. The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.|$|E

5|$|The coffee {{farmers of}} Maraba first needed <b>a</b> <b>washing</b> station to remove sugar from the coating {{of the coffee}} bean, under the skin. If this sugar is not removed within 12 hours of picking, the flavour of the coffee is impaired. They built the first station in July 2001 in the Cyarumbo sector, close to the main road, with funding from UNR, the Office des Cultures Industrielles du Rwanda (OCIR-Café), ACDI/VOCA, and the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR). The opening {{was late in the}} harvest season, so only 200kilograms (441lb) of that year's harvest were {{suitable}} for washing. However, the results were reasonably good, and the station was upgraded to allow more coffee to be processed in 2002. To bring mineral water from Mount Huye to the upgraded station, ACDI/VOCA helped fund a pipeline, which opened in March 2002.|$|E
5|$|Abi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she {{has plans}} of her own. The {{launderette}} closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is {{too busy to}} visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her now-deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of <b>a</b> <b>washing</b> machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children {{that they are in}} heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an appropriate way to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns {{but it turns out that}} he's only back for his son. Dot's step granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but is left upset when Charlie leaves to go back to Ireland with Mathew, also upsetting Jack. Dot and Jack are unaware this is part of Max Branning's (Jake Wood) evil revenge for his false imprisonment.|$|E

25|$|The first {{solution}} in the 1970s was {{the development of}} water-free electrolyte systems based on organic solvents. Their advantages, among other things were lower leakage currents and nearly unlimited shelf life. But now another problem was observed. The growing mass production with automatic insertion machines requires <b>a</b> <b>washing</b> of the PCB's after soldering. The cleaning solutions contain chloroalkanes (CFC) agents. These halogens solutions sometimes permeate the sealing of the capacitors and start chlorine corrosion. Again there was a leakage current problem.|$|E

The Australian High Commissioner rejected the claim, stating that the incident was the result of partying and celebrations. Later comments by Australian officials have contradicted claims by Lalit Bhanot that they had admitted responsibility. Perry Crosswhite said that it was still unclear if athletes from other nations present in the tower at the time had been responsible.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, median family incomes {{increased}} by over 33%, while per capita expenditures on recreation and meals grew by over 40%.

By 1969, 79.6% of all households owned {{at least one}} car, 82.6% owned a refrigerator or freezer, 79% owned {{a black and white}} television set, 31.9% owned a color television set, and 70% owned <b>a</b> <b>washing</b> machine. Leisure time also increased. By 1970, it was estimated that the average workingman in America had 140 days off work each year. US work hours fell by 10.7% between 1950 and 1979, though the decline was still around half that of Western Europe.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, the American {{standard}} of living was the highest among the industrial countries, according to the OECD. Out of the 85 million households in the United States, 64% owned their own living quarters, 55% had at least two TV sets, and 51% {{had more than one}} vehicle. In terms of possession of telephones, TV sets, school enrollments, animal protein in diets, and energy consumption, the United States was far ahead of other industrialized countries. Wealthy and middle class and a majority of poor Americans had higher after-tax incomes than their counterparts almost anywhere else in the world. By 1985, the US per capita income was $11,727, one of the highest among industrialized countries. By the mid-1980s, 98% of all households had a telephone service, 77% <b>a</b> <b>washing</b> machine, 45% a freezer, and 43% a dishwasher.|$|E

25|$|Prospecting was {{successful}} and several opencasts are visible below the large tanks built along its length. The only {{exception is the}} final and very large tank, below which are two reservoirs. It is likely that this complex was used for washing powdered ore to collect the gold dust. More leats and tanks can be found below {{the line of the}} main aqueduct, some of which are shown on the map of the site. They surround the lip of the very large opencast and the tank shown at right is one which was built on the main aqueduct. It {{was successful}} in finding a vein, judging by the opencast below, but must have been modified later to feed <b>a</b> <b>washing</b> table built to the left-hand side (near the figure in the picture), probably to wash the crushed ore from the same opencast working. It is labelled Tank C in the schematic diagram. Similar tanks occur below as the Romans followed the large vein down to the road and the main opencast. Most of the opencast workings must therefore be Roman in origin, since one of the aqueducts has been confirmed by carbon 14 dating as to predate all modern workings. Just by the road itself the Carreg Pumsaint has been erected in the space beside a large mound, now thought to be a dump of waste material from mining activities.|$|E
