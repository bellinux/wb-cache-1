5|$|After the Morris {{family and}} Clay {{discover}} that the gates have been locked to prevent their escape, the monsters surround them. In anger, Lizzy tries to remove a mask {{from one of the}} monsters, which she discovers is actually the Horror's face. The Horrors explain that they are monsters, but that the visitors' experiences were part of a television show. As an apology, the monsters say that they will lead them towards a new car, but they <b>are</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> carnivorous animals.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh {{published}} The Messianic Legacy, {{a sequel}} to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. The authors assert that the Priory of Sion {{is not only the}} archetypal cabal but an ideal repository of the cultural legacy of Jewish messianism that could end the “crisis of meaning” within the Western world by providing a Merovingian sacred king as a messianic figure in which the West and, by extension, humanity can place its trust. However, the authors <b>are</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> believe by Plantard that he has resigned as Grand Master of the Priory of Sion in 1984 and that the organisation has since gone underground in reaction to both an internal power struggle between Plantard and an “Anglo-American contingent” as well as a campaign of character assassination against Plantard in the press and books written by skeptics.|$|E

Paul VI writes that Mary is rightly {{to be regarded as}} the way by which people <b>are</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> Christ. Therefore, the person who encounters Mary cannot help but encounter Christ.|$|E
25|$|Some Saudi {{men have}} also used legally {{contracted}} “temporary marriages” {{in countries such}} as Mauritania, Yemen, and Indonesia as a means by which to sexually exploit migrant workers.

25|$|By {{not asking}} about the horses, Confucius {{demonstrates}} that the sage values human beings over property; readers <b>are</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> reflect on whether their response would follow Confucius's and to pursue self-improvement if it would not have. Confucius, as an exemplar of human excellence, serves not as an all-powerful deity or a universally true set of abstract principles, but rather the ultimate model for others. For these reasons, according to many commentators, Confucius's teachings may be considered a Chinese example of humanism.|$|E

Carrie realizes that the shooting is a diversion from the actual attack, in which Brody will bomb the bunker with a suicide vest and kill everyone inside. Carrie appears at Brody's house and pleads with his daughter, Dana (Morgan Saylor), to contact her father and stop him from carrying out the attack. An alarmed Dana calls 911, leading the police to arrest Carrie.|$|E

Sancho naturally resists this course of action, leading to friction with his master. Under the Duke's patronage, Sancho eventually gets a governorship, though it is false; and he proves to be a wise and practical ruler; though this ends in humiliation as well. Near the end, Don Quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity.|$|E
25|$|This is {{especially}} noticeable {{in the temple}} reliefs in Medinat Habu that show the great attempted invasion of Egypt by the Sea Peoples. This relief shows us the Egyptian small yet maneuverable ships fighting against the larger yet slower ships of the Sea People. It portrays the ships as platforms from which archers and slingers can pepper down the enemy from. Having such fast and maneuverable ships enabled the Egyptians to constantly harass the enemy at a range {{while at the same}} time withdraw to safety and attack from a different side. At this stage, this purpose existed mostly in the New Kingdom era, although we <b>are</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> believe that it was used during the Second Intermediate Period during the siege of Avaris by Ahmose.|$|E

25|$|With our {{knowledge}} of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we <b>are</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his Republic, he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole harem, and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of Pericles.|$|E
25|$|Adulteration {{of honey}} is the {{addition}} of other sugars, syrups, or compounds into honey to change its flavor or viscosity, make it cheaper to produce, or increase the fructose content to stave off crystallization. According to the Codex Alimentarius of the United Nations, any product labeled as honey or pure honey must be a wholly natural product, although different nations have their own laws concerning labeling. Adulteration of honey is sometimes used {{as a method of}} deception when buyers <b>are</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> believe that the honey is pure. The practice was common dating back to ancient times, when crystallized honey was often mixed with flour or other fillers, hiding the adulteration from buyers until the honey was liquefied. In modern times, the most common adulteration-ingredient became clear, almost-flavorless corn syrup, which, when mixed with honey, is often very difficult to distinguish from unadulterated honey.|$|E
25|$|In May 2013, Kiki is {{introduced}} as the girlfriend of Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig) who has gotten {{into trouble with}} gambling debt. When Morgan's brother Michael (Chad Duell) forces Morgan {{to go back home}} to Port Charles, Kiki follows and moves in with Morgan and Michael. While they initially get off on the wrong foot, Kiki softens toward Michael when she learns why he is so protective of Morgan. Kiki is shocked when her mother Ava Jerome (Maura West) confesses that her father, Franco (Roger Howarth) is very much alive. In addition, Kiki is also shocked to learn that Ava is a member of powerful Jerome crime family that is challenging Michael and Morgan's father Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) for his territory. After they kiss, Michael and Kiki <b>are</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> believe they are cousins. Noticing the attraction, Morgan convinces Kiki to marry him in the summer of 2013 only for it to be revealed that Kiki is the biological daughter of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton). To divert his new bride's attention, Morgan resorts to buying Kiki expensive gifts. The marriage quickly implodes when Kiki learns that Morgan knew about her paternity before they married and she files for an annulment. Despite {{the fact that she is}} now dating Michael, Kiki is furious to discover Morgan and Ava are having an affair.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the first}} game in the series, the six former disciples of Ansem the Wise became Heartless and their Nobodies created the Organization. Members are {{numbered}} in {{the order in which}} they joined, with Xemnas, the Nobody of Xehanort, numbered one as their leader. Each member is given a cloak made of a special material that allows them to pass through the Corridors of Darkness into other worlds safely without being attacked by the Heartless there. Members are given titles indicating both their role in Organization XIII and their personality, as well as their own breed of lesser Nobodies to control, usually suited to their fighting style and unique themed powers. As Nobodies, they lack emotion and morality, and are unable to feel guilt and remorse for their actions. However, most of the members' personalities are based from what memories they have of their original selves. About half of the members were introduced in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, with the remaining members introduced in Kingdom Hearts II. In Chain of Memories, the series' protagonist Sora and his friends Donald Duck and Goofy <b>are</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a mysterious fortress called Castle Oblivion by members of the Organization, who intend to turn Sora into their pawn by manipulating his memories. Sora's friend Riku also arrives at Castle Oblivion, but in the basement where he encounters other Organization members. Sora and Riku traverse the levels of the castle to reach the top, fighting and defeating several members along the way. By Kingdom Hearts II, the actions of Sora and Riku, along with Roxas' resignation, reduce the Organization to seven members, who seek to use the power of Kingdom Hearts to become complete beings.|$|E

It introduced both the story arc about baby William which would continue to develop throughout the ninth season and AD Brad Follmer, a recurring character for the show's ninth season.
