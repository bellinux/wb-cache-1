5|$|Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971– April 8, 1990) was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana, {{who became}} a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after failing to be re-admitted to school following <b>an</b> <b>AIDS</b> diagnosis. As a hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment (Factor VIII) and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, but AIDS was poorly understood {{by the general public}} at the time. When Ryan tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Howard County rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer. A lengthy administrative appeal process ensued, and news of the conflict turned Ryan into a popular celebrity and advocate for AIDS research and public education. Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted but died in April 1990, one month before his high school graduation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{principal}} difference between decision aids and most other types of information systems is the greater reliance of decision aids on fallible algorithms [...] algorithms that sometimes generate incorrect advice. It is shown that interactive problem solving with <b>a</b> decision <b>aid</b> {{that is based on}} a fallible algorithm can easily result in aided performance which is poorer than unaided performance, even if the algorithm, by itself, performs significantly better than the unaided decision maker. This suggests that unless certain conditions are satisfied, using <b>a</b> decision <b>aid</b> as <b>an</b> <b>aid</b> is counterproductive. Some conditions under which <b>a</b> decision <b>aid</b> is best used as <b>an</b> <b>aid</b> are derived.
