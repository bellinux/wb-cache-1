500|$|.....<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to research, even I, {{as someone}} who had been paying {{attention}} {{to some of these}} sorts of things {{for a long time and}} was open to alternative explanations, even I was fairly astonished when I put it together, basically by going county by county and finding the criminal arrest records and the jail records in county after county after county from this period of time and seeing that if there had been crime waves, there had to have been records of crimes and people being arrested for crimes. And in reality, it's just not there."There's no evidence that that ever happened. In fact, it's the opposite. The crime waves that occurred by and large were the aftermath of the war and whites coming back from fighting in the Civil War and settling scores with people and all sorts of renegade activity that didn't involve black people at all, but they were blamed for it, and that was then used as a kind of ruse for why these incredibly brutal new legal measures then began to be put in place." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Confession, McGreevey {{describes}} the duality {{of his life}} before he came out as gay: [...] "As glorious and meaningful {{as it would have}} been to have a loving and sound sexual experience with another man, I knew I'd have to undo my happiness step by step <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> chasing my dream of a public career and the kind of 'acceptable' life that went with it. So, instead, I settled for the detached anonymity of bookstores and rest stopsa compromise, but one that was wholly unfulfilling and morally unsatisfactory." ...|$|E
2500|$|Patrick recounts {{that he had}} {{a vision}} a few years after {{returning}} home:I saw a man coming, as it were from Ireland. His name was Victoricus, and he carried many letters, and he gave me one of them. I read the heading: [...] "The Voice of the Irish". <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> the letter, I imagined in that moment that I heard the voice of those very people who were near the wood of Foclut, which is beside the western seaâ€”and they cried out, as with one voice: [...] "We appeal to you, holy servant boy, to come and walk among us." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{fastened}} the tow-rope to {{the rear}} axle of his car, {{to the front of}} hers. [...] "Now will you be ready to put on all your power <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to pull?" [...] he said casually, rather respectfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, miss, {{but it is}} not {{the season}} now, and only one of us waits on through the winter, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to find the water then too cold for my old limbs, I have given it up these last two winters, and come here and stop with Jane and her husband." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have since}} {{spent a couple}} of days betwixt Mount Sharon and this place, and betwixt reading, writing to thee this momentous history, forming plans for seeing the lovely Lilias, and--partly, I think, for the sake of contradiction--angling a little in spite of Joshua'a scruples--though I am rather liking the {{amusement}} better <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to have some success in it.|$|R
2500|$|I {{remember}} in 1915 when I was {{deeply involved in}} cubist sculpture but was still in many ways not certain of what I was doing, I had {{a visit from the}} writer Jules Romains, and he asked me what I was trying to do. I answered, [...] "I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal." [...] And he answered in a slightly mocking way, [...] "What do you know about crystals?" [...] At first I was upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.|$|E
2500|$|My {{encounter}} with many Evangelical Christians who write about other religions has, to some extent, helped shape my life's work. However, {{over the years}} I have been mostly disappointed with the Christian writing in this area. Instead of attempting to understand the teachings of a group, too frequently writers only compared quotes from the group's literature with biblical passages, both often out of context. Then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to visit the groups, I often encountered the anger at the church many members had because of Christian writers who had written supposedly authoritative books but who had distorted members' positions and had condemned them for believing things they had never taught ... I have always thought the church deserved better, and many years ago I committed myself to providing it with the information it needed both to live at peace with its new neighbors and to carry on its missional life {{with a high level}} of integrity.|$|E

6000|$|I {{answered}} him that <b>I</b> was, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> spoke <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to divest myself {{of the clothes}} I wore. [...] "Pack my suit of pearl grey in the valise, with what changes of linen I possess; then call Master Coupri that I may settle with him. It may be some time before we return." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{glanced at}} the paper with open pleasure, but the other checked me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wherefore didst thou hasten {{away just}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to speak, Hilda?" [...] he said, {{somewhat}} reproachfully, {{as he sat}} down beside her.|$|E
6000|$|There is a {{still more}} {{characteristic}} sonnet of Alfieri's, with which I shall close, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began,</b> {{in the very}} open air of his autobiography: ...|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [complacently]. She's rather full of it, {{as you may}} imagine. Poor Nora! Well, Mr Keegan, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said, <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to see my way here. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to see my way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I shall {{keep my eyes}} on all points," [...] said he, [...] "as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to feel {{a spirit}} of fight rising up within me. If I thought I could keep them off until Rynders gets here, I almost wish they would then come. I would like to kill a lot of them." ...|$|R
60|$|I drank seven cups; <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> the eighth, <b>I</b> heard a crash, and {{the next}} moment a man leaped into the room through the broken window.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't think Lowell will trouble me much again," [...] I replied, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to dress. [...] "If he does I'll do what I can {{to defend}} myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Bignall," [...] he said, again {{wearing that}} grace of manner which became him so well, [...] "it is {{my duty to}} follow your motions in this interview. I will now return to my ship; and if, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to suspect we are in these seas on a similar errand, we can concert at our leisure a system of co-operation, which, {{properly}} matured by your experience, may serve {{to bring about the}} common end we have in view." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{thought this}} {{better and better}} still, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to pull on my hose, recalling the man's impudent mendicancy at Prestongrange's, I {{determined}} to pursue {{what seemed to be}} my victory.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want {{a bit of}} tin-foil, Shaynor," [...] he said. [...] "Good-evening. My uncle told me {{you might}} be coming." [...] This to me, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> {{the first of a}} hundred questions.|$|E
60|$|To {{conclude}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began.</b> My position is, {{that if we}} {{have anything}} {{to learn from the}} Noble Savage, it is what to avoid. His virtues are a fable; his happiness is a delusion; his nobility, nonsense.|$|E
60|$|He halted before me, erect {{and very}} stern--indeed almost threatening. And <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to grow afraid; for, after all, I had a {{kindness}} for Gervasio, and I would not willingly {{engage in a}} quarrel with him.

6000|$|... "I {{heard the}} thing just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> to undress," [...] Granet explained. [...] "I rushed downstairs and found Collins {{out in the}} garden. ... Where the devil is Collins, by-the-bye?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At last, just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> to feel <b>as</b> though <b>I</b> {{were being}} mesmerised, a move was made. Without the {{slightest}} warning, {{a man from}} the other side of the circle called out in a loud voice-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Your town," [...] I said, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to {{make ready}} to depart (which {{is the time for}} smooth generalities), [...] "seems to be a quiet, sedate place. A home town, I should say, where few things out of the {{ordinary}} ever happen." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> {{to regain}} {{strength}} and the doctors pronounced me fit to leave the sick-room, she began to display signs of uneasiness, and often looked at me in a singular kind of way, as though there were something which she would say to me.|$|E
