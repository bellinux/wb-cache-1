25|$|The {{following}} year, as the Germans {{launched a}} major offensive on the Western Front, they were {{thrust into the}} line {{in a desperate attempt}} to hold the line in front of the vital railhead of Amiens. There, the 33rd took part in heavy fighting when the Australians counter-attacked at Hangard Wood on 30 March, before finally turning back the German attack on Villers-Bretonneux on 4 April. At the end of the month, the battalion amalgamated with the 36th Battalion, as part of a general re-organisation of the AIF necessitated by heavy casualties and falling recruitment, which saw the disbandment of three battalions– the 36th, 47th and 52nd– in order to reinforce others. In August, the Allies launched their own offensive– the Hundred Days Offensive– which ultimately brought about an end to the war. The 33rd was committed to the battle on 8 August, tasked with capturing <b>Accroche</b> Wood. A series of advances followed as the Allies broke through the German defences along the Hindenburg Line. After attacking around Road Wood in late August, they were withdrawn for three weeks training before taking part in a joint American-Australian attack at Bellecourt in late September. Following up the Americans, the 33rd held off a strong counter-attack by German forces around Gillemont Farm, before carrying out mopping-up operations towards Bony. After this, in early October, the battalion was pulled back to the Abbeville area, taking up billets in Citerne, where they remained until the armistice was signed in November.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the attack}} was launched, the 21st Battalion went in on the left, and {{supported}} by the creeping barrage and tanks, overcame relatively light German resistance. The 23rd also advanced [...] "smoothly", although it was resisted more strongly. The 25th, however, fared the worst. Due to their exposed position on the right of the Australian line, the 25th Battalion was supported by the Australian Heavy Trench Mortar Battery; nevertheless the 25th suffered heavily, losing almost two entire platoons as German machine-gun positions cut through their ranks. As the Germans launched a counter-attack, a request for emergency artillery support was sent via a distress flare, and another platoon was brought up to stem the tide and eventually the 25th secured their objective north of the Roman Road. The tanks were instrumental in breaking the German will for further counter-attacks, aggressively pushing [...] beyond the Allied line, moving into <b>Accroche</b> Wood to harass the German rear during {{the second phase of the}} attack.|$|E

[...] Avec de coursiers efflanques, [...] En ligne droites issus de Rosinante, [...] Et des paysans en postillons masques, [...] Dutors de race impertinente, [...] Notre carrosse en cent lieux <b>accroche,</b> [...] Nous allions gravement, d'une allure indolente, [...] Gravitant contre les rochers. [...] Les airs emus par le bruyant tonnerre, [...] Les torrents d'eau repandus sur la terre, [...] Du dernier jour menacaient les humains; [...] Et malgre notre impatience, [...] Quatre bons jours en penitence [...] Sont pour jamais perdus dans les charrains.|$|E

50|$|The {{instrumentation}} of Dusapin’s {{music is}} often based upon available players, {{and during the}} 1980s and 1990s, he often wrote for the Ensemble <b>Accroche</b> Note, a Strasbourg-based new music group founded by a singer and clarinetist. Ian Pace proposes that {{the influence of the}} group’s clarinetist Armand Angster might be a reason for the prominence of the clarinet in much of Dusapin’s music from this time period. Griffiths, too, makes note of the important role of the clarinet in the series of shorter pieces that Dusapin wrote after the completion of his first opera, Roméo et Juliette (1985-89). Dusapin’s tendency to write for specific instrumentalists (in this case, clarinetist Angster) reveal a practical and realistic side of the composer.|$|E

5000|$|Morshead again led the 33rd Infantry Battalion in the Battle of Amiens. For the {{fighting}} in August 1918, {{he was awarded the}} French Légion d'honneur in the grade of Chevalier. His citation, written by his new division commander, Major General John Gellibrand, read: For gallantry, initiative and ability in action during the operations on SOMME in August 1918. On 8 August 1918, during the attack east of Hamel, Lieutenant Colonel Morshead was in command of the special force for the purpose of clearing <b>Accroche</b> Wood. He executed this task with great skill, and then fought his battalion to its objectives, capturing 500 prisoners, many guns and a large quantity of materiel at very little cost to his own force.Subsequently during the advance north of Bray on 22 to 24 August 1918, when the situation on his left flank was uncertain, Lieutenant Colonel Morshead gallantly maintained his position refusing his left flank, thus enabling the remainder of his brigade to maintain its position.On 30/31 August, north of Cléry, he again fought his battalion with great ability and success.His military ability, fine fighting spirit and cheerfulness under all circumstances had a most inspiring effect upon all ranks and contributed greatly {{to the success of the}} operation.|$|E
