5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers <b>also</b> <b>keep</b> their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
5|$|While {{awaiting}} the first delivery of stone, Simson {{noticed that the}} battlefield landscape features were beginning to deteriorate. Seeing an opportunity to not only preserve {{a portion of the}} battlefield but <b>also</b> <b>keep</b> his staff occupied, Simson decided to preserve a short section of trench line and make the Grange Subway more accessible. Labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall, on both the Canadian and German sides of the Grange crater group, in concrete. The workforce also built a new concrete entrance for the Grange Subway and, after excavating a portion of the tunnel system, installed electric lighting.|$|E

25|$|They {{move about}} mainly by sidewinding: a method {{at which they}} are {{considerably}} proficient and alarmingly quick. They are also capable of other forms of locomotion, but sidewinding seems to be best suited to moving about in their usual sandy habitats. It may <b>also</b> <b>keep</b> them from overheating too quickly, as {{there are only two}} points of contact with the hot surface in this form of locomotion.|$|E

25|$|One should <b>also</b> <b>keep</b> {{the purpose}} of the {{analysis}} in mind when choosing the prior distribution. In principle, uninformative and flat priors, that exaggerate our subjective ignorance about the parameters, may still yield reasonable parameter estimates. However, Bayes factors are highly sensitive to the prior distribution of parameters. Conclusions on model choice based on Bayes factor can be misleading unless the sensitivity of conclusions to the choice of priors is carefully considered.|$|E

25|$|Pet clips can be {{as simple}} or as {{elaborate}} as owners wish. The hair under the tail should always be kept short to keep feces from matting in the dog's curls. Most owners <b>also</b> <b>keep</b> the feet and face clipped short to prevent dirt from matting between toes, tear stains on lighter-coated poodles and food from matting around the dog's muzzle. Beyond these sanitary requirements, desired clips depend on owners' preferences. Some owners maintain a longer clip in winter than summer.|$|E
25|$|The welder must add {{the filler}} rod to the molten puddle. The welder must <b>also</b> <b>keep</b> the filler metal {{in the hot}} outer flame zone when not adding it to the puddle to protect filler metal from oxidation. Do not let the welding flame burn off the filler metal. The metal will not wet into the base metal and will look {{like a series of}} cold dots on the base metal. There is very little {{strength}} in a cold weld. When the filler metal is properly added to the molten puddle, the resulting weld will be stronger than the original base metal.|$|E

It included a total of 64 recommendations concerning supervision, training, technology and equipment, communications, and aftercare. The review revealed that there were complications in communication between officers during the shootings because multiple officers were sending radio transmission at once, and {{that none of the}} first responding officers were wearing their body armor. It has been publicly announced that the RCMP accepted and will implement all of the recommendations, and will <b>also</b> <b>keep</b> the public updated on their progress.|$|E
25|$|Keep in {{mind that}} LDL-C is not a {{measurement}} of actual LDL particles; LDL-C is only an estimate (not measured from the individual's blood sample) of how much cholesterol is being transported by all LDL particles; either a smaller concentration of large particles or {{a high concentration of}} small particles. <b>Also</b> <b>keep</b> {{in mind that}} LDL particles carry many fat molecules (typically 3,000 to 6,000 fat molecules per LDL particle); this includes cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and others. Thus even if the hundreds to thousands of cholesterol molecules within an average LDL particle were measured, this does not reflect the other fat molecules or even the number of LDL particles.|$|E
