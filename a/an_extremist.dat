5|$|Hitler made a {{prominent}} {{appearance at the}} trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hans Ludin, in late 1930. Both were charged with membership in the NSDAP, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel. The prosecution argued that the NSDAP was <b>an</b> <b>extremist</b> party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on Hitler to testify. On 25 September 1930, Hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections, which won him many supporters in the officer corps.|$|E
5|$|Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; {{this caused}} her {{popularity}} in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and <b>an</b> <b>extremist,</b> an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government {{took an interest in}} her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While {{she and her husband were}} travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.|$|E

25|$|The LSSP began fraternal {{relations}} with the Congress Socialist Party (CSP) of India. Mrs Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya of the CSP was invited by the LSSP for a highly successful political tour of the island.

25|$|The {{east coast}} {{hostilities}} {{came at the}} close of the Waikato wars and before the outbreak of Te Kooti's War, both fought nearby, but sprang from causes more closely related to the Second Taranaki War—namely, Māori resentment of punitive government land confiscation coupled with the rise of the so-called Hauhau movement, <b>an</b> <b>extremist</b> part of the Pai Marire religion (also called the Hauhau), which was strongly opposed to the alienation of Māori land and eager to strengthen Māori identity.|$|E
25|$|In July 1990, <b>an</b> <b>extremist</b> Muslim group {{held the}} prime {{minister}} and members of parliament hostage for 5 days while rioting and looting shook Port of Spain.

25|$|In 1862 the {{so-called}} Hauhau Movement emerged among Taranaki Māori. The movement was <b>an</b> <b>extremist</b> {{part of the}} Pai Mārire religion that was both violent and vehemently anti-Pākehā. Adherence to the Hauhau movement, which included incantations, a sacred pole, belief in supernatural protection from bullets, and occasionally beheadings, {{the removal of the}} hearts of enemy and cannibalism, spread rapidly through the North Island from 1864, welding tribes in a bond of passionate hatred against the pakeha.|$|E
25|$|On December 28, 2011, Federal Judge Galina Butenko {{rejected}} the prosecutor's plea for a ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is.

25|$|The Federal Party (FP) {{launched}} {{a movement of}} non-violent resistance (satyagraha) against the bill, which prompted Bandaranaike {{to reach an agreement}} (Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam Pact) with S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, leader of the FP, to resolve the looming ethnic conflict. The pact proved ineffective in the face of ongoing protests by opposition and the Buddhist clergy. The bill, together with various government colonisation schemes, contributed much towards the political rancour between Sinhalese and Tamil political leaders. Bandaranaike was assassinated by <b>an</b> <b>extremist</b> Buddhist monk in 1959.|$|E

The US and Pakistan governments have denied all such claims.|$|E
25|$|The conflict, which {{overlapped}} {{the wars}} in Waikato and Tauranga, was fuelled {{by a combination of}} factors: lingering Māori resentment over the sale of land at Waitara in 1860 and government delays in resolving the issue; a large-scale land confiscation policy launched by the government in late 1863; {{and the rise of the}} so-called Hauhau movement, <b>an</b> <b>extremist</b> part of the Pai Marire syncretic religion, which was strongly opposed to the alienation of Māori land and eager to strengthen Māori identity. The Hauhau movement became a unifying factor for Taranaki Māori in the absence of individual Māori commanders.|$|E
