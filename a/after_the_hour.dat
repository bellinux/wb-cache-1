5|$|Alexis Sánchez was one {{of three}} players who made their {{competitive}} debuts for Arsenal in the match; for Manchester City, goalkeeper Willy Caballero was selected ahead of Joe Hart. Arsenal began the game more strongly and took the lead when Santi Cazorla scored in the 22nd minute. Their lead was extended two minutes before half time, as Aaron Ramsey finished off a counter-attacking move. Arsenal scored their third of the match soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark; Olivier Giroud's shot from outside the penalty box dipped over Caballero and into his goal.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Johnson {{was called}} {{up for his}} native Jamaica by Brazilian coach René Simões. He made his debut against Trinidad and Tobago on 28 March, coming on as a half-time {{substitute}} for Paul Hall in a 2–0 loss in Port of Spain, and then scored in a 3–0 victory over Paraguay in Kingston three days later, after coming on for Ricardo Fuller at half-time. He made another substitute appearance in May 1999, coming on for Theodore Whitmore in the 56th minute of Jamaica's 2–1 friendly defeat to Sweden in Stockholm. Another appearance followed in September 1999, with Johnson again replacing Whitmore shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark of Jamaica's 2–2 draw with the United States; Johnson scored Jamaica's second goal in the 79th minute. Despite appearing four times for Jamaica in friendly games, he was still eligible to play for another national team as FIFA's regulations at the time did not bind players to a nation until they had played a competitive game.|$|E
5|$|Luton {{came close}} to scoring their second goal of the match when Harford got away from Caesar and ran towards the left byline. His cross into the penalty area was met by Brian Stein's head, but Lukic made a crucial save, tipping the ball wide. Both {{managers}} brought on substitutes <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark – Mark Stein came on for Harford, while Martin Hayes replaced Groves. The latter substitution worked to Arsenal's advantage, as it brought about their equaliser in the 72nd minute. Davis' free kick delivered in was only half cleared by Foster and amongst the scramble, Hayes drove {{the ball in the}} net. Arsenal continued to pile on pressure, and took the lead three minutes later, when Smith received a pass from Thomas to score.|$|E

When they did, Bradshaw started the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA). In reality, the gimmick of the tag team was created by Bradshaw. To further enhance their gimmick, the APA began to appear weekly {{backstage}} in an office, dubbed the APA Office. After protecting many WWF superstars, the APA began a feud with Bull Buchanan and The Big Bossman. The feud began on the April 10, 2000 edition of Raw, where Buchanan and Bossman attacked the APA during a match, where they protected Kai En Tai. The APA, however, was unsuccessful in winning a tag team match against them at Backlash. On the May 18, 2000 edition of SmackDown!, the APA were hired to protect Crash Holly for an hour, {{to prevent him from}} losing his WWF Hardcore Championship. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> was up, the APA left, allowing Gerald Brisco to pin Holly for the Hardcore Championship. The situation resulted in Holly challenging Bradshaw in a Hardcore match, which Bradshaw won. Later that week on SmackDown!, Faarooq defeated Holly in a Hardcore match.|$|E

25|$|The Ducali saw March's last full {{complement}} of fixtures out with a trip to virtually relegated Cesena, who were 14 points adrift of safety (Parma) prior to kick off with just ten games remaining. Parma had not won in seven, but the home side's run without a win was ten. Both runs went on longer in a match that was full of chances. Parma's Sergio Floccari opened the scoring just before half-time with a neat and powerful finish after Giovinco's square ball, but both sides could have had any number of goals before the halfway point. The second half started in disastrous fashion for the away side; Cesena took the lead with goals from Mario Santana and Simone Del Nero in the first ten minutes. Paletta's header just <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> brought the scores level. Chances continued to flow, but the game ended 2–2. This preserved Parma's 5-point buffer from relegation because nineteenth-placed Novara played out a goalless draw with eighteenth-placed Lecce.|$|E

The game ended 41 to Stevenage, with Yemi Odubade, Chris Beardsley and a Lee Boylan brace {{ensuring}} the home side earned a comfortable win. Three weeks later, Stevenage beat Kettering Town 20 at Broadhall Way. Borough {{took the lead}} just <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark when substitute Tim Sills headed {{the ball into the}} path of Stacy Long, who rifled the ball past Nathan Abbey from just outside the area. Long doubled his tally in injury-time, rounding Abbey to slide the ball home. Stevenage lost their third league match of the season at The Lamb Ground; a 10 defeat to Tamworth, a game in which both Ronnie Henry and Darren Murphy were sent-off. Three days later, Borough bounced back with a 31 victory over Mansfield Town at Broadhall Way. Stevenage trailed at the interval thanks to a Jon Shaw strike just before half-time. But Yemi Odubade, who also missed a late penalty, fired Borough level from 15 yards after the break and his low drive {{from the edge of the}} box gave Borough the lead. Substitute Andy Drury's strike sealed the win and Mansfield's misery was complete when Luke Jones was sent off. Stevenage lost their second successive away game, losing 10 at Rushden & Diamonds. Ten days later, Borough picked up a 10 win in North Wales against Wrexham thanks to a goal from David Bridges just before the interval.|$|E

However, {{he was given}} a {{straight}} red card after head-butting Norwich midfielder Bradley Johnson, Barton's first dismissal since May 2009. With QPR down to ten men they went on to lose the match 2–1. When Warnock was replaced as manager by Mark Hughes in January 2012, Hughes confirmed that Barton would remain captain. Barton's performance in QPR's 3–2 home victory against Liverpool saw him booed by the QPR fans, who promptly cheered when he was substituted just <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark. Barton admitted that his performance was [...] "awful" [...] and the [...] "worst I've ever played in my career" [...] but also criticised the QPR fans for not sticking with the team in their battle against relegation. After being dropped for the club's next match, an away defeat to Sunderland, he returned to the line-up for the home match against Arsenal. Barton led QPR to a 2–1 victory and he was cheered by the supporters and praised by Hughes, who described his performance as [...] "top-class". Barton's third goal for the club came in a 3–0 victory at home to Swansea on 11 April 2011.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Morison {{scored in}} {{pre-season}} friendlies against AFC Wimbledon and Stevenage respectively. He started the season by assisting two of Millwall's {{goals in the}} club's 3–0 win against Bristol City at Ashton Gate. In the club's following league match, he scored two headed goals as Millwall beat Hull City comprehensively at The Den. He scored his third goal of the season from the penalty spot as Millwall beat Middlesbrough 2–1 in the League Cup. Four days later, Morison was on the scoresheet again, scoring a penalty to seal Millwall's 3–1 win against Coventry City. He also provided the assist for Millwall's first goal. He scored his fifth goal in six games in Millwall's 1–1 draw with Nottingham Forest at The City Ground, giving Millwall {{the lead in the}} fifth minute with a header. Ten days later, Morison added to his goal tally when he scored against Ipswich Town in the League Cup, scoring <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark in a 2–1 home defeat. In October, Morison scored his seventh goal of the campaign in Millwall's 2–0 win against Derby County, the club's first home win since August. Two weeks later, Morison scored the opening goal of the game against Doncaster Rovers at the Keepmoat Stadium, but was unable to prevent Millwall from losing the match 2–1. He went three games without scoring through November 2010, before scoring two late goals in Millwall's televised victory over Scunthorpe United in early December 2010. On 15 December 2010, it was widely reported that Millwall had rejected a £2million offer for Morison from Nottingham Forest, with Millwall manager Kenny Jackett claiming there is [...] "no chance" [...] that Morison will be sold in the January transfer window. A day later, Jackett said the club had not received a formal bid for Morison from Forest. Morison's eleventh goal of the season came in Millwall's last game of 2010; scoring the first goal in a 2–0 home win over Leicester City. He went on to score goals in home victories against Ipswich Town and Barnsley respectively. Morison signed a new 2 ½ year contract with Millwall on 5 February 2011, ending transfer speculation about his long term commitment to the club, he stated [...] "I'm looking forward to playing my part in the future success of Millwall". After a run of six games without a goal, Morison scored in Millwall's 2–0 win over eventual Championship winners Queens Park Rangers, netting Millwall's first goal in the 63rd minute. Eleven days later, Morison scored a lobbed effort against Cardiff City to restore parity in a game that ended 3–3. His sixteenth goal of the 2010–11 campaign came on 2 April 2011, scoring another lobbed effort, this time in a 1–0 away win at Hull City. A week later, Morison was on hand to score Millwall's third goal in a 3–2 home win over Leeds United. He was sent-off just three days later in the club's 0–0 draw with Bristol City, receiving the red card for a [...] "reckless lunge" [...] on Bristol City's Jamal Campbell-Ryce. This subsequently meant Morison served a three-game suspension, returning for Millwall's two final league games of the season. Morison ended the season having scored 17 goals for Millwall in 43 appearances.|$|E

2500|$|After {{years of}} heavy {{investment}} in {{roads in the}} postwar years, the share of rail in the total passenger market in Switzerland had been significantly reduced {{by the end of}} the 1960s. At this time, Swiss Federal Railways decided that changes were necessary to increase rail patronage. [...] More trains were operated in order to increase frequencies; this led to a 75% increase in passengers between 1971 and 1983 on the Bern–Zürich route. In the 1970s, the Swiss government and SFR decided to make further improvements in rail services. In 1972, the SFR introduce a regular interval timetable (German: Taktfahrplan). Under this timetable, trains arrive and leave each station at the same minute past every hour. Services at Zurich station were reorganised so that trains arrived on each line before the hour or half-hour and left <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> or half-hour, making it easier to change to trains on other lines.|$|E

Rundstedt's biographer writes: [...] "This was something for which some Germans, while they were prepared to forgive him everything else, could and cannot excuse him." [...] Speidel, {{despite the fact that he}} was spared, was bitterly critical of Rundstedt after the war, when he became a senior officer in the new West German Army.
