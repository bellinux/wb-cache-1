500|$|As Seen On TV was {{a highly}} {{acclaimed}} show in the United Kingdom {{by the time it}} ended in 1987. Wood, having just received a BAFTA for the first series, said at the time: [...] "I was very pleased to win, but it really put pressure on me. I was already writing the new series <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> looked at the award I kept on thinking that people would be expecting so much more now and I just wouldn't be able to live up to it. In the end, I just put the thing away." [...] The series then went on to win BAFTAs for its entire run.|$|E
500|$|In {{a series}} of couplets, Goldfrapp sings [...] "I {{borrowed}} bones, I borrowed skin / To save me from the hell I'm in / Your fantasy / <b>And</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> think of you / I see the dark, I hear their hooves", which registers a theme of transformation, according to Chris White from musicOMH. Towards the song's end, she repeats [...] "they're coming for you" [...] in a [...] "reedy and distorted" [...] voice. The track's sound was compared to the works of Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails by David Chiu of Consequence of Sound. Furthermore, Chris Gerard, a writer for PopMatters, compared the production's sound to being intoxicated.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, {{opposite}} Sacha Parkinson, {{who plays}} Sian Powers, Thompson filmed his first screen kiss. He {{said of the}} experience, [...] "It was bizarre because Sacha had done one before and I hadn't. I knew the line I had to say and then kiss her.

I mean I don't get nervous when I go on stage or anything like that, {{but it was just}} bizarre. It {{was one of those things}} that I got really nervous about." [...] The on-screen romance was part of a controversial New Year's Eve storyline which featured the two characters attempting to see in 2010 by losing their virginities, only to be discovered by Ryan's adoptive mother Michelle. In May 2012, it was confirmed that Ryan would be recast and played by Sol Heras, because Thompson chose not to return.|$|E

500|$|The EP {{has been}} seen by critics simply as [...] "unapologetic {{hardcore}} punk" [...] and being the most aggressive work Gallows had done so far. A more Americanised influence can be heard throughout the EP as it's been likened to bands like Cancer Bats <b>and</b> <b>Every</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Die. MacNeil had always stated the EP helped build on what he has always liked about Gallows; he considers it being [...] "Four songs like {{a kick in the}} teeth". In the writing of the new extended play the band focused on less typical song structures and focused on the chaotic sound from live shows. MacNeil believed that [...] "sometimes you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Obviously, we're trying to write music that’s chaotic and is going to be something that comes across vicious-sounding live... you don’t repeat it four times, you do it once, and you don’t have a bridge." [...] Gallows guitarist Laurent Barnard said how the EP would not sound similar to the band's third studio album by saying [...] "If you're going to make a punk rock EP, you might as well make it the most punk rock thing you can really." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> see {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} an inspirational message of inner strength, and finds Carey {{reaching out to}} listeners. The song uses a rainstorm {{as a metaphor for}} troubles in life, while encouraging others to [...] "make it through the rain" [...] through perseverance. The first chorus begins: [...] "When you get caught in the rain / With no where to run / When your distraught and in pain without anyone / When you keep crying out to be saved", illustrating a moment in an individual's life where they are surrounded by conflict. The chorus then serves as a guide to those still suffering, [...] "I can make it through the rain, I can stand up once again on my own / And I know that I'm strong enough to mend / <b>And</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith / And I live one more day and I make it through the rain". Similarly, the second verse once again revisits difficult times when [...] "shadows grow close", before continuing into the second chorus and climax. While the song in meant for listeners to gain confidence and strength, it also allows them into Carey's personal struggles she endured throughout 2001. Lola Ogunnaike of The New York Times described the song as a [...] "triumph over adversity", while a writer from the Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "it's an insight into her recent troubles." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Carey described the song's lyrical content in depth: ...|$|E

Taylor recalled: Frank sat in the grandstand <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> walked out to the pitching mound he kept talking to me with his fingers.

2500|$|Over the years, The Exorcists {{critical}} reputation {{has grown}} considerably. The film currently has an 87% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, based on 67 reviews the website collected. Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel {{placed it in}} the top five films released that year. BBC film critic Mark Kermode believes the film to be the best film ever made saying [...] "There's a theory that great films give back to you whatever it is you bring to them. It's absolutely true with The Exorcist—it reflects the anxieties of the audience. Some people think it's an outright horror-fest, but I don't. It was written by a devout Catholic who hoped it would make people think positively about the existence of God. William Peter Blatty, who wrote the book, thought that if there are demons then there are also angels and life after death. He couldn't see why people thought it was scary. I've seen it about 200 times <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> see something I haven't seen before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scientologists also later {{complained of}} bigotry towards the Church in {{comments}} made by Sweeney during interviews with Scientology members. Sweeney's outburst toward Tommy Davis prompted John Travolta to lobby British MPs {{in an attempt to}} stop the documentary from being aired. Both Sweeney and Sandy Smith apologised for his (Sweeney's) behaviour. Sweeney stated that it was a by-product of the [...] "hijacking of the Holocaust" [...] by the Scientology exhibition which was where the outburst occurredas well as attempts to control his mind. Sweeney said of the incident: [...] "I apologised almost immediately, Tommy carried on {{as if nothing had happened}} but meanwhile Scientology had rushed off copies of me losing it to my boss, my boss's boss and my boss's boss's boss, the Director-General of the BBC." [...] Later, he added: [...] "I look like an exploding tomato and shout like a jet engine <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> see it, it makes me cringe." [...] At the time the Church of Scientology posted its own material regarding the matter on the Internet, one of its spokesmen denied Sweeney's statement regarding a quick apology.|$|E

She said, [...] "It has such a {{beautiful}} quality on it, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> looked at a record , it would be engineered and mixed by Bruce Swedien. I was like, 'Who is this guy? I want this guy.' So I tracked him down and he was like, 'I want to do something with her. I know exactly what she needs. I'm coming in.' And it made a huge difference." [...] Lopez worked closely with longtime producer Cory Rooney on the album. Discussing the process, Rooney stated, [...] "This is by far the best record that I've ever worked on or done [...] In the beginning of the recording [...] she said it's important that she makes a record that is a few notches above everything else she did.
