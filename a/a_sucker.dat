5|$|The {{interior}} {{surfaces of}} the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an infundibulum and a central hollow cavity called an acetabulum, {{both of which are}} thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When <b>a</b> <b>sucker</b> attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed. The infundibulum provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.|$|E
5|$|The {{underside}} {{consists of}} a muscular foot, which has adapted to different purposes in different classes. The foot carries a pair of statocysts, which act as balance sensors. In gastropods, it secretes mucus as a lubricant to aid movement. In forms having only a top shell, such as limpets, the foot acts as <b>a</b> <b>sucker</b> attaching the animal to a hard surface, and the vertical muscles clamp the shell down over it; in other molluscs, the vertical muscles pull the foot and other exposed soft parts into the shell. In bivalves, the foot is adapted for burrowing into the sediment; in cephalopods it is used for jet propulsion, and the tentacles and arms are derived from the foot.|$|E
5|$|April {{opened with}} United playing the {{defending}} MLS Cup champions, Colorado Rapids {{at their home}} ground, DSG Park on 2 April. The match was almost postponed due to snow earlier in the day. However, the match was still called on, as a smaller crowd of around 9,000 braved the wintry conditions. The match saw Colorado take a first half lead off recently purchased Irish-international Caleb Folan. In the 67th minute of play, the United leveled the score thanks to a strike from Santino Quaranta.The tie was short-lived, as the Rapids immediately struck back with a 68th-minute goal from Scottish-international Jamie Smith. Ten minutes later, Folan gave the Rapids a 3–1 lead, and in injury time, Jamaican-international Omar Cummings gave <b>a</b> <b>sucker</b> punch goal, resulting in a 4–1 defeat for United to the Rapids.|$|E

500|$|Lynch {{described}} {{the attractiveness of}} the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: [...] "I'm <b>a</b> <b>sucker</b> for a continuing story... Theoretically, you can get a very deep story and you can go so deep and open the world so beautifully, but it takes time to do that." [...] The story included normal and surreal elements, much like Lynch's earlier series Twin Peaks.

500|$|The {{next stage}} in {{development}} is a brachiolaria larva and involves the growth of three short, additional arms. These are [...] at the anterior end, surround <b>a</b> <b>sucker</b> and have adhesive cells at their tips. Both bipinnaria and brachiolaria larvae are bilaterally symmetrical. When fully developed, the brachiolaria settles on the seabed and attaches itself with a short stalk formed from the ventral arms and sucker. Metamorphosis now takes place with a radical rearrangement of tissues. The {{left side of the}} larval body becomes the oral surface of the juvenile and the right side the aboral surface. Part of the gut is retained but the mouth and anus move to new positions. Some of the body cavities degenerate but others become the water vascular system and the visceral coelom. The starfish is now pentaradially symmetrical. It casts off its stalk and becomes a free-living juvenile starfish about [...] in diameter. Starfish of the order Paxillosida have no brachiolaria stage, with the bipinnaria larvae settling on the seabed and developing directly into juveniles.|$|E
50|$|A monostome is a worm {{with one}} sucker (oral). Flukes with <b>an</b> oral <b>sucker</b> and <b>an</b> {{acetabulum}} at the posterior {{end of the}} body are called Amphistomes.

These terms are common in older literature, when they were thought to reflect systematic relationships within the groups. They have fallen out of use in modern digenean taxonomy.|$|R

500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} budget problems created strong character development potential for Leslie and comedic opportunities for Ron. Fowler also enjoyed that the normally-dissolute Tom formed an authentic romantic connection, and said Chris Pratt brought [...] "a certain naturalness" [...] to {{a role that}} could otherwise have been overly idiotic. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club strongly praised the episode, praising Rob Lowe and the entire regular cast. He declared Parks and Recreation the best television show since Arrested Development, and said, [...] "As much as I like the '50 jokes a minute' style of comedies ... I'm <b>a</b> <b>sucker</b> for a show where the characters are as well-wrought and as purely funny as they are on this show." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall praised {{the implementation of the}} new characters, particularly the fact that the script did not rely too heavily on them. Sepinwall also said the episode balanced well the workplace humor with the romantic subplots between Leslie and Ben, April and Andy, and Ann and Chris.|$|E
500|$|Nando Di Fino of Mediaite also {{complained that}} the episode may have gone too far, and {{compared}} it to previous episodes in the series that had been banned from airing on television, noting, [...] "The show has dipped into sensitive material before, and Fox has actually refused to air two episodes — one dealing with abortion, the other with heavy Jewish themes. Sunday night's episode, if reaction to {{it can be used}} as a good measure, may have been better joining those two episodes in exile." [...] Whitney Jefferson of Jezebel, a website centered on women's issues, also strongly criticized the episode for its storyline involving Brenda and her boyfriend, Jeff: [...] "Personally, I'm way beyond being offended by the show — I've long been numbed to shock-value offensiveness — and had stopped watching years ago anyhow. But being <b>a</b> <b>sucker</b> for a Halloween-themed episodes, I tuned in to Fox's [...] "Animation Domination" [...] comedy block last night. What I saw was seriously awful."

500|$|Until March 26, 2008, a -tall {{member of}} the species was a {{prominent}} [...] "centerpiece" [...] of the sculpture garden at the Noguchi Museum in the Astoria section in the borough of Queens in New York City. The tree had been spared by the sculptor Isamu Noguchi when in 1975 he bought the building which would become the museum and cleaned up its back lot. The tree {{was the only one}} he left in the yard, and the staff would eat lunch with Noguchi under it. [...] "n a sense, the sculpture garden was designed around the tree", said a former aide to Noguchi, Bonnie Rychlak, who later became the museum curator. By 2008, the old tree was found to be dying and in danger of crashing into the building, which was about to undergo a major renovation. The museum hired the Detroit Tree of Heaven Woodshop, an artists' collective, to use the wood to create benches, sculptures and other amenities in and around the building. The tree's rings were counted, revealing its age to be 75, and museum officials hoped it would regenerate from <b>a</b> <b>sucker.</b>|$|E

[...] Gordon also hoped for a happy ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding: [...] "If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset." [...] Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are [...] "the ultimate couple". She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending, that it would be with Jack. The Daily Telegraph commented on the Martha and Jack situation, saying it is played out in a [...] "classic soapie technique". They said [...] "Bring {{the characters}} together, push them apart, but always leave open the possibility that they could get back together.

500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was {{generally}} positive {{on most of}} the songs featured in the episode.
