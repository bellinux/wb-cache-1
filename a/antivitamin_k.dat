During the hospitalization, the clinical evolution was unusual and characterised as follows: a) the extent of pulmonary embolism justified a thrombolysis by streptokinase; b) an acute thrombocytopenia occurred a few days later, preceded by a slower, but significant decrease of platelet count; c) a non-occlusive aortic thrombosis developed, distal to renal arteries, causing distal embolisation, successfully treated by local fibrinolysis. The prompt correction of platelet count after interruption of heparin therapy confirmed the diagnosis, before the detection of antibodies against heparin-PF 4 complexes.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Antivitamin</b> <b>K</b> {{anticoagulant}} (AVK) rodenticides {{are commonly}} used to control rodent pests worldwide. They specifically inhibit the VKORC 1 enzyme essential for the recycling of vitamin K, and thus prevent blood clotting and cause death by haemorrhage. Numerous mutations or polymorphisms of the Vkorc 1 gene were reported in rodents, and some led to resistance to rodenticides. In house mice (Mus musculus domesticus), adaptive introgression of the Vkorc 1 gene from the Algerian mouse (Mus spretus) was reported. This adaptive introgression causes the substitution of four amino acids in M. musculus domesticus. RESULTS: The consequences of introgression were assessed by (i) the characterisation of the in vivo resistant phenotype of adaptive Vkorc 1 spr-introgressed mice, (ii) the characterisation of the ex vivo resistance phenotype of the liver VKOR activity and (iii) the comparison of these results with the properties of recombinant VKORC 1 spr protein expressed in yeast. The resistance factor (from 1 to 120) induced by the four introgressed polymorphisms obtained using these three approaches was dependent on the AVKs used but were highly correlated among the three approaches. CONCLUSION: The four introgressed polymorphisms were clearly {{the cause of the}} strong resistant phenotype observed in the field.

40|$|International audienceThe optimal {{duration}} of anticoagulation after venous thromboembolism (VTE) is determined {{according to the}} risk of recurrent VTE after stopping anticoagulant therapy and the risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding while on <b>antivitamin</b> <b>K.</b> Clinical risk factors appears to be determinant to predict the risk of recurrence whereas the influence of biochemical and morphological tests is uncertain. The risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism is low when the initial episode was provoked by a reversible major risk factor (surgery) : 3 months of anticoagulation is optimal. Conversely, this risk is high when venous thromboembolism was unprovoked or associated with persistent risk factor (cancer) : 6 months or more prolonged anticoagulation is warranted. After this first estimation, the {{duration of}} anticoagulation may be modulated according to the presence of additional minor risk factors (major thrombophilia, chronic pulmonary hypertension, massive pulmonary embolism) : 6 months if VTE was provoked and 12 to 24 months if VTE was unprovoked. If the risk of anticoagulant related bleeding is high, the duration of anticoagulation should be shortened (3 months if VTE was provoked and 6 or 3 months if it was unprovoked). Lastly, if VTE occurred in the setting of a cancer, anticoagulation should be conducted for 6 months or more while cancer is active or on ongoing treatment. Despite an increasing knowledge of the risk factors of recurrent VTE, a number of issues remain unresolved; randomised trial comparing different duration of anticoagulation are needed...|$|E

They specifically inhibit the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC 1), which is an enzyme encoded by the Vkorc 1 gene, involved in the recycling of vitamin K. Therefore, they prevent blood clotting. Numerous mutations of Vkorc 1 gene were reported in rodents, and some {{are involved in the}} resistant to rodenticides phenotype. Two hundred and sixty-six mice tails were received from 65 different locations in France. Coding sequences of Vkorc 1 gene were sequenced in order to detect mutations.

40|$|AbstractThe {{systematic}} use of <b>antivitamin</b> <b>K</b> anticoagulants (AVK) as rodenticides {{caused the}} selection of rats resistant to AVKs. The resistance is mainly associated to genetic polymorphisms in the Vkorc 1 gene encoding the VKORC 1 enzyme responsible for the reduction of vitamin K 2, 3 -epoxide to vitamin K. Five major mutations, which are responsible for AVK resistance, have been described. Possible explanations for the biological cost of these mutations have been suggested. This biological cost might be linked {{to an increase in}} the vitamin K requirements. To analyze the possible involvement of VKORC 1 in this biological cost, rVKORC 1 and its major mutants were expressed in Pichia pastoris as membrane-bound proteins and their catalytic properties were determined for vitamin K and 3 -OH-vitamin K production. In this report, we showed that mutations at Leu- 120 and Tyr- 139 dramatically affect the vitamin K epoxide reductase activity. Moreover, this study allowed the detection of an additional production of 3 -hydroxyvitamin K for all the mutants in position 139. This result suggests the involvement of Tyr- 139 residue in the second half-step of the catalytic mechanism corresponding to the dehydration of vitamin K epoxide. As a consequence, the biological cost observed in Y 139 C and Y 139 S resistant rat strains is at least partially explained by the catalytic properties of the mutated VKORC 1 involving a loss of vitamin K from the vitamin K cycle through the formation of 3 -hydroxyvitamin K and a very low catalytic efficiency of the VKOR activity...|$|E

In this study, we genotyped the HGDP-CEPH Panel for six VKORC 1 SNPs and downloaded chromosome 16 genotypes from the HGDP-CEPH database in order to characterize the geographic distribution of footprints of positive selection within and around this locus. A unique VKORC 1 haplotype carrying the promoter mutation associated with AVK sensitivity showed especially high frequencies in all the 17 HGDP-CEPH East Asian population samples. VKORC 1 and 24 neighboring genes were found to lie in a 505 kb region of strong linkage disequilibrium in these populations. Patterns of allele frequency differentiation and haplotype structure suggest that this genomic region has been submitted to a near complete selective sweep in all East Asian populations and only in this geographic area. The most extreme scores of the different selection tests are found within a smaller 45 kb region that contains VKORC 1 and three other genes (BCKDK, MYST 1 (KAT 8), and PRSS 8) with different functions.

Twenty-five patients had thrombophilia, 16 patients had factor V Leiden (R 506 Q) mutation, and seven patients had MTHFR C 677 T mutation. Ninety-two percent of patients screened for thrombophilia were positive. Screening was requested in young patients (16), patients with recurrent (11), spontaneous (8), and extensive (5) venous thrombosis, familial history (5), pregnancy (4), estroprogestative treatment (3), and air travel (1). Nine patients had one, 11 patients had two, and five had three of these conditions. Follow-up (6 to 120 months) of these 25 patients treated with <b>antivitamin</b> <b>K</b> did not reveal recurrences or complications related to venous thromboembolism. Conclusion: Factor V Leiden mutation followed by MTHFR mutation are the most commonly observed genetic abnormalities in these series. Defining risk factors and screening for thrombophilia when indicated reduce recurrence rate and complications. Recommendations for thrombophilia screening will be proposed.

Methods A total of 7651 patients were selected among 15, 147 recipients of SES, {{included in the}} worldwide e-SELECT registry, only from those centers which included at least one patient requiring VKA: 296 were pretreated with a VKA agent (VKA group), whereas 7355 patients from the same enrolling medical centers were not (NON-VKA group). The rates of 1) major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including all-cause deaths, myocardial infarction (MI) and target lesion revascularization, 2) stent thrombosis (ST) and 3) major bleeding (MB) in the 2 study groups were compared at 1, 6 and 12 months. Results The patients in VKA group were on average older as compared to those in NON-VKA group (67. 7 ± 9. 9 vs. 62. 9 ± 10. 7, P < 0. 001). The indications for pre-procedural anticoagulation were atrial fibrillation in 177 (59. 8 %), presence of a prosthetic valve in 21 (7. 1 %), embolization of cardiac origin in 17 (5. 7 %), pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis in 17 (5. 7 %), and miscellaneous diagnoses in 64 (21. 6 %) patients. At 1 year, the rates of MACE and MB {{were higher in the}} VKA vs. The NON-VKA group (8. 3 % and 3 % vs. 5. 3 % and 1. 2 %, P < 0. 04 and P < 0. 002, respectively). The 1 -year rates of definite and probable ST were remarkably low in both groups (0. 38 % vs. 1. 1 %, p = 0. 4). Conclusions Selected patients anticoagulated with VKA agent may safely undergo SES implantation. Those patients may receive a variety of APT regimen at the cost of a moderate increased risk of MB. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundIn dental surgery, to {{take charge}} of heart disease {{patients}} treated with <b>antivitamin</b> <b>K</b> remains a common practice problem. ObjectiveTo research the factors which increase bleeding after dental extractions in patients treated by acenocoumarol. Material and methodsCohort study in which dental extractions are realized in heart disease patients treated by acenocoumarol, with an International Normalized Ratio (INR 1) the day before the act between 2. 00 and 4. 50, using in all cases the local hemostatic measures : oxycellulose mesh (surgicel*) + sutures + compression gutter. The day of extraction, a pre-operative INR control (INR 2) was systematic. The degree of dental traumatism corresponded to the extracted root number / session. The results are expressed with confidence intervals at 95 %. Results 229 extraction sessions are realized in 135 patients, 50. 32 + 2. 12 years old with a 1. 25 sex ratio, an extractions number / subject / session of 1. 96 + 0. 23 teeth and a degree of dental traumatism of 2. 89 + 0. 24. The INR 1 and INR 2 were respectively of 3. 30 + 1. 10 and 3. 40 + 1. 59. Bleeding complicated 9 extraction sessions (3. 93 %) and occurred after the 48 th hour in 4 cases (44. 44 %). In the bleeding group, INR 2 was 3. 33 + 7. 02 against 3. 40 + 1. 64 in absence of haemorrhage, p = 0. 86. The degree of dental traumatism was 4. 89 + 3. 11 in cases of bleeding against 2. 80 + 0. 22, p = 0. 02.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the results and the complications of the treatment of hemorrhoids with circular stapler with a follow-up of 18 months, and to review the complications in the literature. METHODS: From April 1998 to August 1999, 140 patients (83 males and 57 females) with an average age of 43. 8 years (range: 19 - 83 years) underwent haemorrhoidectomy using a circular stapler in three university hospital centers. The degree of hemorrhoids has been classified: three cases of degree II, 97 cases of degree III, and 40 cases of degree IV. All the patients were prospectively evaluated at two weeks, two and 18 months after surgery. RESULTS: The average length of the operation was 18 minutes (range: 8 - 60 minutes). Mean hospital stay was 36 hours (range: 8 - 72 hours). There was no intraoperative complication. There was no mortality. The postoperative complication rate was 7. 8 % (N = 11) : there were five cases of bleeding that two complicated by a submucosal hematoma (one was infected and needed a rectotomy on day 21), two cases of urinary retention, and two cases of external hemorrhoid thrombosis. The bleeding occurred in the 12 hours after surgery except for one patient with <b>antivitamin</b> <b>K</b> whith presented a secondary bleeding on day 16. At 18 months, five patients presented a moderate asymptomatic stricture dilated on digital examination. Two patients complained of persistent skin tags. Neither functional trouble nor incontinence to gas, liquids, or solids was presented. With a mean follow-up of 40 months, 90 % (N = 112) of the patients were fully satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of hemorrhoids with circular stapler appears to be effective with 96 % of patients fully satisfied at 18 months. The morbidity rate was low, and no higher than the diathermy excision hemorrhoidectomy. The results are directly dependent on the practice that required a learning, and not on the technique itself...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundPatient {{adherence}} is {{an essential}} factor in obtaining an efficient oral anticoagulation using <b>antivitamin</b> <b>K</b> drugs (AVK), a situation with a narrow therapeutic window. Therefore patient education and awareness are crucial for a good management and {{should be based on}} a correct estimation of the current situation. Material and methods: This study included 67 hospitalized chronically anticoagulated patients (pts) (mean age: 62. 6 ± 13. 1 years; men 45. 6 %) who responded to a 25 -items questionnaire to assess their knowledge on AVK therapy management. Laboratory and clinical data were used to determine INR value at admission, as well as to calculate CHADS 2 -VASC and HAS-BLED scores for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). ResultsThe majority of pts (61. 8 %) were receiving AVK for AF, the others having a mechanical prosthesis and previous thromboembolic disease or stroke. In the AF group, mean CHADS 2 -VASC score was 3. 1 ± 1. 5, while average HAS-BLED score was 1. 8 ± 1. 2. More than half of all pts (52. 9 %) had at admission an INR outside of the therapeutic range, with the majority (42. 1 %) having a low INR. A correct INR value was predicted by the education level (higher education), the diagnostic indication (pts with mechanical prosthesis being best managed), and the concomitant use of other antithrombotic therapies. Pts presenting with a therapeutic INR had a trend towards longer treatment duration than those outside the therapeutic range (62 ± 72 vs 36 ± 35 months, p= 0. 06). There was no correlation between admission INR and pts living conditions, INR monitoring frequency, bleeding history. ConclusionsIn a tertiary cardiology center, more than half pts receiving AVK are admitted with an INR outside the therapeutic range. Pts with mechanic prosthesis and complex antithrombotic regimens appear as most careful with INR monitoring. Identifying pts groups with lowest therapeutic range rate could help attending physicians educate pts focusing on specific awareness issues...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionMore {{and more}} frequently, silent atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) events are detected in intracardiac electronic device (ICED) memory (“infraclinical AF” or “had atrial high rate events AHRE”). In MOST trial, AHRE {{were seen in}} almost 50 % of patients treated for sinus node dysfunctionand were {{associated with an increased}} risk of stroke (1. 69 % per year if CHADS score> 2) in ASSERT study. Nevertheless currently there are no antithrombotic recommendations for these patients. We tried to describe the different therapeutic alternatives in usual practice. Materials and methods: We started a prospective registry of patients with silent AF detected in DDD or CRT PMK/ICD of all constructors. Inclusion criteria were: age > 18 y, AHRE diagnosed by device algorithms and > 6 minutes duration, confirmation by atrial endocavitary electrogram. We excluded patients with a previous history of “clinical AF”or valvular AF. The antithrombotic strategy was decided by the referent physician. ResultsFrom November 2013 to May 2014, 43 patients were included. The median age was 77 years old. 26 patients (60 %) had a DDD PMK (10 for sinus node dysfunction (23 %), 15 for AV block (35 %), 1 for obstructive CMP), 10 patients (23 %) a DDD ICD (6 (14 %) for primary prevention and 4 (9 %) for secondary prevention) and 7 patients a CRT-D (16 %). The median CHADS 2 score was 2, the median CHADS 2 VASCscore was 4 (mean respectively 2. 36 and 3. 56) : 5 patients had a history of embolic event (11 %). Only 28 patients (65 %) were on anticoagulation therapy: 15 (35 %) <b>antivitamin</b> <b>K</b> and 13 (30 %) new oral anticoagulants. 10 patients (23 %) received aspirin and 5 patients the association aspirin/clopidogrel (11 %). 2 patients did not receive any antithrombotic treatment. There were no difference in CHADS and CHADSVASC scores between patients treated or not with anticoagulants (respectively p= 0. 21 and p = 0. 57) ConclusionMost of patients in this study received an anticoagulation therapy as a stroke prevention strategy.

Therefore, patient education and awareness are crucial for good management. Auditing the current situation would help to identify {{the magnitude of the}} problem and to build tailored education programs for these patients. Methods: This study included 68 hospitalized chronically anticoagulated patients (mean age 62. 6 ± 13. 1 years; males, 46 %) who responded to a 26 -item questionnaire to assess their knowledge on VKA therapy management. Laboratory and clinical data were used to determine the international normalized ratio (INR) at admission, as well as to calculate CHA 2 DS 2 -VASC and HAS-BLED scores for patients with atrial fibrillation. Results: The majority of patients (62 %) were receiving VKA for atrial fibrillation, the others for a mechanical prosthesis and previous thromboembolic disease or stroke. In the atrial fibrillation group, the mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASC score was 3. 1 ± 1. 5, while the average HAS-BLED score was 1. 8 ± 1. 2. More than half of the patients (53 %) had an INR outside of the therapeutic range at admission, with the majority (43 %) having a low INR. A correct INR value was predicted by education level (higher education) and the diagnostic indication (patients with mechanical prosthesis being best managed). Patients presenting with a therapeutic INR had a trend toward longer treatment duration than those outside the therapeutic range (62 ± 72 months versus 36 ± 35 months, respectively, P= 0. 06). There was no correlation between INR at admission and the patient’s living conditions, INR monitoring frequency, and bleeding history. Conclusion: In a tertiary cardiology center, more than half of patients receiving VKAs are admitted with an INR falling outside the therapeutic range, irrespective of the bleeding or embolic risk. Patients with a mechanical prosthesis and complex antithrombotic regimens appear to be the most careful with INR monitoring, especially if they have a higher level of education. Identifying patient groups with the lowest time interval spent in the therapeutic range could help attending physicians educate patients focusing on specific awareness issues.
