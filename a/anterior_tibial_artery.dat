In an effort to conserve autogenous saphenous vein, we used expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts in 45 patients over a 12 -month period. We used Gore-Tex* to reconstruct 17 circulatory access grafts, 16 carotid arteries, two brachial arteries, seven femoral arteries, and three popliteal <b>anterior</b> or posterior <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries.</b> The indications for reconstruction were chronic occlusion of the access grafts, trauma to the brachial and <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries,</b> and atherosclerotic disease of the carotid, femoral, and popliteal-tibial arteries. Of the reconstructed circulatory access grafts, one failed immediately because of technical problems in the conduit, and one failed 11 months after reconstruction. All other grafts have functioned well and have produced a marked improvement in flow. Of the 28 patients who underwent reconstruction of arteries measuring 3 mm or less, two had patent arteries but died shortly after operation. The remaining 26 have been followed for one to 43 months.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Antiphospholipid {{antibodies}} (APLs), which {{consist of}} anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLs) or lupus anticoagulant (LA), {{are associated with}} venous thrombosis, stroke, and cardiac events. Although they are present in many patients with lower extremity atherosclerotic occlusive disease (LEAOD), the relationship between APL and the progression of LEAOD has not been reported. A comparison of progression of LEAOD as determined with direct imaging studies in patients with and without APL forms the basis for this report. Methods: APL+ patients (immunoglobulin M [IgM] or IgA or IgG ACL > 3 SD units above control mean or positive LA) who underwent lower extremity bypass grafting between January 1990 and June 1999 (n = 79) were compared with an APL control group (n = 68). Members {{of the study and}} control groups were similar with respect to age, procedure, sex, length of follow-up, and multiple atherosclerosis risk factors. Progression of LEAOD was determined by comparing preoperative arteriograms with postoperative imaging studies (arteriograms or duplex scanning). External iliac, common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal arteries were graded as < 50 % stenosis, ≥ 50 % stenosis, or occluded. Posterior <b>tibial</b> and <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries</b> were graded as patent or occluded. Progression was defined as any increase in stenosis category. Results: The mean follow-up period was 31 months for APL+ and 35 months for APL– patients (P = not significant). Progression of LEAOD occurred in 58 (73 %) of 79 APL+ patients and in 25 (37 %) of 68 APL– patients (P <. 001). There was no difference in progression in external iliac or common femoral arteries. Differences in progression were noted in more distal arteries; APL+ patients had significantly more progression in superficial femoral (45 % vs 16 %, P <. 01), popliteal (31 % vs 12 %, P <. 01), posterior tibial (29 % vs 13 %, P <. 05), and <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries</b> (29 % vs 14 %, P <. 05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a significant independent association between the presence of APL and progression of LEAOD (P <. 0001). Conclusion: In this study, the presence of APL in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass operations was a significant independent risk factor for progression of LEAOD. We conclude that this patient group should be closely monitored in the postoperative period and appears ideally suited for prospective studies of therapies to modify LEAOD progression.

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{vascular}} pattern of proximal fibula {{with use of}} embalmed cadaveric specimens. Material and Method: The present study was done on 33 lower extremities from 19 embalmed human, adult cadavers. The average ages of the cadavers were 68. 6 years (range from 36 to 98 years), 11 females and 8 males. The size and site of vessels around the proximal fibula were recorded. Results: There were three main blood supplies of proximal fibular, the epiphyseal artery, the lateral genicular artery, and the periosteal blood supply. They are <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> recurrent <b>artery</b> and posterior <b>tibial</b> <b>artery</b> or artery of the neck of fibula posteriorly. Inferior lateral genicular artery was seen in all specimens (33 / 33). Among them, 42. 4 % (14 / 33) had a single artery with double accompanied veins. The average diameter of artery and veins were 1. 71 mm (0. 75 - 2. 25), and 1. 69 mm (1. 30 - 2. 10), respectively. The others were single artery and single vein. The average diameter of artery and veins were 1. 66 mm (0. 65 - 2. 14), and 2. 1 mm (0. 95 - 2. 30) respectively. <b>Anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> recurrent <b>artery</b> was seen in 31 of 33 specimens (94 %). The average size of artery and accompanying vein were 1. 24 mm (0. 8 - 2. 1), and 1. 86 mm (0. 8 - 2. 6), respectively. Posterior <b>tibial</b> recurrent <b>artery</b> was an inconsistent branch that appeared in only 11 of 33 specimens (33 %). Artery of the neck of fibula appeared in 24 of 33 specimens (72. 7 %). The others were replaced by the predominant posterior <b>tibial</b> recurrent <b>artery</b> (7 / 33) and neither of them was found in two specimens...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeWe {{examined}} whether preoperative duplex {{ultrasound scanning}} (DU) could replace contrast material–enhanced arteriography (CA) in selecting the recipient <b>artery</b> of <b>tibial</b> or peroneal <b>artery</b> bypass grafts. MethodsIn patients who underwent <b>tibial</b> or peroneal <b>artery</b> bypass grafting because of critical ischemia, images were obtained {{of the lower}} extremity arterial circulation with both DU and CA. Vascular surgeons, blinded to the operation performed, reviewed either DU or CA images for arterial visualization and patency. The <b>tibial</b> or peroneal <b>artery</b> best suited to receive the bypass graft was selected by surgeons using only data from either DU or CA images. This selection was compared with the artery actually used at bypass surgery. ResultsPreoperative DU and CA data for 40 lower extremities in 38 patients undergoing bypass grafting {{at the level of}} the tibia provided 110 arteries: 38 <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries,</b> 32 peroneal arteries, and 40 posterior <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries.</b> Ten arteries (8 peroneal, 2 <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial)</b> were not identified with DU, and 1 <b>artery</b> (<b>anterior</b> <b>tibial)</b> was not identified with CA. DU enabled prediction of the artery actually used in 88 % of patients (35 of 40), whereas CA enabled prediction of the artery actually used in 93 % of patients (37 of 40; P =. 59). Duplicate findings at DU and CA enabled selection of 85 % of arteries actually used (95 % confidence interval, 71 %- 93 %). Arteries used for bypass grafting had significantly higher peak systolic velocity (35 cm/s vs 25 cm/s; P =. 04), higher end-diastolic velocity (15 cm/s vs 9 cm/s; P =. 005), and greater diameter (2. 4 mm vs 1. 7 mm; P =. 003) compared with arteries not selected for bypass grafting. ConclusionFindings at DU and CA typically agree when used to select <b>tibial</b> or peroneal <b>arteries</b> for bypass grafting. With DU there is occasional difficulty in identification of the peroneal artery, but selection of the actual artery used is accurate. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and diameter characteristics correlate with arteriographic criteria for <b>tibial</b> bypass target <b>artery</b> selection. If DU enables adequate identification of a target artery for bypass grafting, and especially if the peroneal artery is seen, findings at CA are not likely to alter bypass execution...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of duplex scanning (DS) and pulse generated run-off (PGR) with ia-DSA {{for the assessment}} of cruropedal outflow and explore the reliability of clinical decision making based on a work-up with DS/PGR in candidates for peripheral bypass surgery. METHODS: Popliteal, crural and pedal arteries were evaluated independently with DS and ia-DSA in 126 limbs of 120 consecutive patients for claudication (16 %) or critical ischaemia (84 %). Arterial segments were graded with DS and ia-DSA as normal, stenosed, or occluded and compared using weighted kappa (kappa) analysis. PGR was used to select the best crural artery for bypass. Proposed management based on DS/PGR and, if applicable, anastomosis site were compared to definitive treatment based on ia-DSA. RESULTS: Overall agreement between DS and ia-DSA for popliteal and crural arteries was moderate (kappa 0. 51, 95 % CI 0. 48 - 0. 55) with good agreement within the popliteal (kappa 0. 67) and <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> (kappa 0. 61) arteries. Agreement was moderate within the pedal arterieds (kappa 0. 32, 95 % CI 0. 24 - 0. 40). In 74 / 126 (59 %) limbs proposed management with DS/PGR was identical to ia-DSA. In 23 / 29 (79 %) femoropopliteal and 15 / 37 (41 %) femorocrural bypasses DS/PGR agreed perfectly with ia-DSA with regard to acceptor artery and anastomosis site. CONCLUSION: DS can accurately assess the popliteal and <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>arteries.</b> In a substantial number of patients with severe lower limb ischaemia decisions for conservative management, PTA and femoropopliteal bypass can be based on a DS/PGR work-u...|$|R
