25|$|Phased array antennas are {{composed}} of evenly spaced similar antenna elements, such as aerials or rows of slotted waveguide. Each antenna element or group of antenna elements incorporates a discrete phase shift that produces a phase gradient across the array. For example, array elements producing a 5 degree phase shift for each wavelength across the array face will produce a beam pointed 5 degrees away from the centreline perpendicular to the array face. Signals travelling along that beam will be reinforced. Signals offset from that beam will be cancelled. The amount of reinforcement is <b>antenna</b> <b>gain.</b> The amount of cancellation is side-lobe suppression.|$|E
25|$|Neglecting {{electrical}} inefficiency, the <b>antenna</b> <b>gain</b> {{is equal}} to the directive gain, which is 1.5 (1.76 dBi) for a short dipole, increasing to 1.64 (2.15 dBi) for a half-wave dipole. For a 5/4 wave dipole the gain further increases to about 5.2 dBi, making this length desirable for that reason even though the antenna is then off-resonance. Longer dipoles than that have radiation patterns that are multi-lobed, with poorer gain (unless they are much longer) even along the strongest lobe. Other enhancements to the dipole (such as including a corner reflector or an array of dipoles) can be considered when more substantial directivity is desired. Such antenna designs, although based on the half-wave dipole, generally acquire their own names.|$|E

2500|$|Aperture {{blockage}} - In front-fed parabolic dishes {{where the}} feed antenna {{is located in}} front of the dish in the beam path (and in Cassegrain and Gregorian designs as well), the feed structure and its supports block some of the beam. [...] In small dishes such as home satellite dishes, where the size of the feed structure is comparable with the size of the dish, this can seriously reduce the <b>antenna</b> <b>gain.</b> [...] To prevent this problem these types of antennas often use an offset feed, where the feed antenna is located to one side, outside the beam area.

2500|$|<b>Antenna</b> <b>gain</b> is {{sometimes}} measured as decibels {{relative to a}} half-wave dipole, {{which means that the}} antenna in question is being compared to a dipole, and has a certain amount of gain relative to a dipole antenna tuned to the same operating frequency. In this case, one says the antenna has a gain of [...] "x dBd" [...] (see decibel). More often, gains are expressed relative to an isotropic radiator, which is an imaginary antenna that radiates equally in all directions. In this case one uses dBi instead of dBd (see decibel). As it is impossible to build an isotropic radiator, gain measurements expressed relative to a dipole are more practical when a reference dipole aerial is used for experimental measurements. 0 dBd is often considered equal to 2.15 dBi.|$|E

2500|$|The {{radiation}} {{pattern of the}} feed antenna has to be tailored {{to the shape of}} the dish, because it has a strong influence on the aperture efficiency, which determines the <b>antenna</b> <b>gain</b> (see Gain section below). [...] Radiation from the feed that falls outside the edge of the dish is called [...] "spillover" [...] and is wasted, reducing the gain and increasing the backlobes, possibly causing interference or (in receiving antennas) increasing susceptibility to ground noise. [...] However, maximum gain is only achieved when the dish is uniformly [...] "illuminated" [...] with a constant field strength to its edges. [...] So the ideal {{radiation pattern}} of a feed antenna would be a constant field strength throughout the solid angle of the dish, dropping abruptly to zero at the edges. [...] However, practical feed antennas have radiation patterns that drop off gradually at the edges, so the feed antenna is a compromise between acceptably low spillover and adequate illumination. [...] For most front feed horns, optimum illumination is achieved when the power radiated by the feed horn is 10 dB less at the dish edge than its maximum value {{at the center of the}} dish.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of direct and heterodyne detection optical intersatellite communication links are evaluated and compared. It is {{shown that the}} {{performance of}} optical links is very sensitive to the pointing and tracking errors at the transmitter and receiver. In the presence of random pointing and tracking errors, optimal <b>antenna</b> <b>gains</b> exist that will minimize the required transmitter power. In addition to limiting the <b>antenna</b> <b>gains,</b> random pointing and tracking errors also impose a power penalty in the link budget. This power penalty is between 1. 6 to 3 dB for a direct detection QPPM link, and 3 to 5 dB for a heterodyne QFSK system. For the heterodyne systems, the carrier phase noise presents another major factor of performance degradation that must be considered. In contrast, the loss due to synchronization error is small. The link budgets for direct and heterodyne detection systems are evaluated. It is shown that, for systems with large pointing and tracking errors, the link budget {{is dominated by the}} spatial tracking error, and the direct detection system shows a superior performance because it is less sensitive to the spatial tracking error. On the other hand, for systems with small pointing and tracking jitters, the <b>antenna</b> <b>gains</b> are in general limited by the launch cost, and suboptimal <b>antenna</b> <b>gains</b> are often used in practice.

However, gain is always less than directivity by a factor called radiation efficiency, η. Whereas directivity is entirely a function of wavelength and the geometry and type of <b>antenna,</b> <b>gain</b> takes into account the losses that always occur in the real world. Specifically, accelerating charge (time varying current) causes electromagnetic radiation per Maxwell's equations. Therefore, antennas use a current distribution on radiating elements to generate electromagnetic energy that propagates away from the antenna. This coupling is never 100% efficient (by Laws of Thermodynamics), and therefore <b>antenna</b> <b>gain</b> will always be less than directivity by this efficiency factor.|$|E
