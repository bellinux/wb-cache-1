Depending on the mature {{size and the}} purpose for which the onion is used, these may be {{referred}} to as pearl, boiler, or pickler onions, but differ from true pearl onions which <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> species. Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E

5|$|Visual scene {{displays}} <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> {{method of}} organizing and presenting symbols. These are depictions of events, people, objects, and related actions in a picture, photograph, or virtual environment representing a situation, place, or specific experience. They {{are similar to}} activity displays in that they contain vocabulary {{that is associated with}} specific activities or routines. For example, a photo of a child's room may be included in the child's AAC system. Objects and events within the photograph are then used as symbols for communication. Research suggests that visual scene displays are easier than grid displays for young children or those with cognitive impairments to learn and use.|$|E
5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E

Over any vector space without topology, we may also notate the vectors by kets and the linear functionals by bras. In these more general contexts, the bracket {{does not have}} the meaning of an inner product, because the Riesz representation theorem does not apply.|$|E
25|$|The show {{makes it}} clear that every Stargate {{originally}} had its own DHD, located {{directly in front of the}} gate and facing it. Over time, however, some DHDs have been damaged or lost. This has been the source of plot difficulties for the protagonists on several occasions, as it is still possible to travel to a Stargate that lacks a DHD, meaning that dialing home again will be much more difficult, if not impossible. One of the primary functions of the MALP that precedes an SG team is to confirm the presence of a DHD. In the absence of a DHD, a user must select the address by manually rotating the inner ring of the Stargate, and use an external power source, as the ring will not rotate unless it is energised. Pegasus Galaxy Stargates do not have a movable ring, so manually dialing these is impossible. Travelers can also emulate a DHD through a Dialing computer as present at Stargate Command. Remote dialers have been used by several races like the Goa'uld and Asgard in various episodes. As the Stargates in Stargate Universe <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> (less advanced model) the crew of the Destiny are forced to use such a device as no planet visited so far has any variation of DHD present.|$|E
500|$|CBC Sports head of {{programming}} Trevor Pilling {{explained that the}} large number of events being held, along with the stature of the Pan American Games in comparison to the Olympics, were a factor in the structure of CBC's coverage, stating that [...] "I do think we are the victim of our own success in that having Olympic coverage that is around the clock, but the Olympics <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> event than these Pan Am Games. But I feel like we've done the athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage, or with reporters on site. We've tried to make sure we're at all the significant events, and with Canada winning over 180 medals, that's a tall task." ...|$|E

500|$|Davies took a {{different}} approach while writing the episode. David Tennant and Sarah Lancashire noted the character of Miss Foster had good intentions but was morally ambiguous. The premise of the Adipose pill was equally ambiguous with rare side-effects, but was a [...] "win-win situation" [...] for anyone involved. Davies based the character of Miss Foster on Supernanny star Jo Frost and Argentine philanthropist and politician Eva Per√≥n, and Lancashire compared her character to Mary Poppins. The Adipose <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> style to regular Doctor Who villains; antagonists such as Lazarus in [...] "The Lazarus Experiment" [...] or the werewolf in [...] "Tooth and Claw" [...] were singular monsters designed to scare the audience; the Adipose were written as [...] "cute" [...] to provide a [...] "bizarre [...] surreal" [...] experience.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical style varies {{depending}} on culture, denomination, and country. For example, in Northern Europe the bands with Lutheran members usually prefer a personal lyrical approach, which is seldom meant to [...] "convert" [...] in an aggressive manner, since evangelism has been more typical among American bands. Christian bands never deny their conviction but typically avoid preaching, and sometimes the matter is left unexpressed, leaving religion as a private issue of the listener. Certain bands choose to deal with everyday life experiences from a Christian perspective in order to draw both Christian and non-Christian listeners. In such cases, identifying a [...] "Christian band" [...] can be difficult. Secular bands that occasionally deal with Christian topics <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> matter altogether. Defining a Christian band is a much debated issue on Christian metal forums. A Christian band {{is expected to have}} either professed Christian members or a Christian message, preferably both.|$|E

2500|$|Hazard {{identification}} or {{assessment is}} an important step in the overall risk assessment and risk management process. It is where individual work hazards are identified, assessed and controlled/eliminated as close to source (location of the hazard) as reasonably as possible. As technology, resources, social expectation or regulatory requirements change, hazard analysis focuses controls more closely toward the source of the hazard. Thus hazard control is a dynamic program of prevention. Hazard-based programs also have the advantage of not assigning or implying there are [...] "acceptable risks" [...] in the workplace. A hazard-based program {{may not be able to}} eliminate all risks, but neither does it accept [...] "satisfactory" [...] ‚Äì but still risky ‚Äì outcomes. And as those who calculate and manage the risk are usually managers while those exposed to the risks <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> group, workers, a hazard-based approach can by-pass conflict inherent in a risk-based approach.|$|E
