The chlorinating agent, CCl 4, and the antimony-bearing compound are encapsulated in a small glass ampoule, and reaction takes place at 575 °C in ca. 6 min. <b>A</b> <b>crushing</b> <b>device</b> is used to introduce the volatile chlorination products into the g. l. c. system; the SbCl 5, produced by chlorination is converted quantitatively to SbCl 3, which does not react with the column packing materials. The proposed method is rapid, simple, precise (relative error ± 0. 5 %), selective and sensitive. Antimony, arsenic and tin can be determined simultaneously in some alloys. © 1977...|$|E
40|$|Descrevem-se surtos de intoxica��ão por Vernonia rubricaulis em bovinos em nove fazendas no Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul, entre setembro de 1999 e maio de 2001. No total morreram pelo menos 954 animais. Alguns fatores foram aparentemente importantes para a ocorrência da intoxicação: a utilização de técnicas que favorecem a brotação da planta incluindo a utilização da roçadeira ("trilho") para o controle de plantas invasoras, assim como a queima ou o desmatamento do campo; o transporte de animais procedentes de outras fazendas ou de outros piquetes da mesma fazenda, com ou sem {{manejo de}} animais no curral; e a superlotação de piquetes. O curso clínico variou de 12 a 48 horas. Os sinais clínicos foram, principalmente, agressividade ou depressão, salivação, cegueira, gemidos, incoordenação, retração de abdômen, fezes ressecadas com muco e estrias de sangue, focinho seco e decúbito. A letalidade foi de 100 %. Os principais achados de necropsia foram observados no fígado. As lesões hepáticas variavam num mesmo animal e entre diferentes animais. Áreas focais vermelhas de hemorragias com tamanhos variando entre 1 mm e 25 cm, foram observadas em meio ao tecido hepático amarelado em alguns casos. Fígados inteiros ou áreas hepáticas com aspecto de noz-moscada e fígados difusamente amarelados com ou sem hemorragias petequiais, também foram observados. Ocorriam, também, hemorragias em diferentes tecidos e órgãos. As principais alterações histológicas caracterizaram-se por necrose centrolobular com vacuolização dos hepatócitos das áreas periportais e intermediárias ou necrose massiva e vacuolização difusa dos hepatócitos. A intoxicação foi reproduzida experimentalmente em três bovinos. A menor dose que causou morte foi de 3 g/kg da planta verde fresca em fase de brotação. Os sinais clínicos e as lesões macro e microscópicas observadas foram semelhantes às apresentadas pelos animais intoxicados naturalmente. Outbreaks of {{poisoning}} by Vernonia rubricaulis in cattle were observed on nine farms, {{in the state}} of Mato Grosso do Sul, between September 1999 and May 2001. At least 954 cattle died. Several conditions seemed to be important for the occurrence of the outbreaks: the use of practices that induced sprouting of the plant, including the control of weeds with <b>a</b> <b>crushing</b> <b>device,</b> made with three pieces of rail, or burning or jungle clearing of the paddocks; transportation of cattle from other farms or their change from one paddock to another on the same farm, and high stocking rate. The clinical course varied from 12 to 48 hours. Clinical signs were agressivity or dullness, salivation, blindness, groaning, incoordination, abdominal retraction, dry feces with mucus and blood, dry nose, and recumbency. Lethality was 100 %. Main gross lesions were found in the liver. They varied from animal to animal and within the same liver. In some cases, a variable number of focal hemorrhages 1 mm up to 25 cm in diameter were observed within the yellow liver tissue. Nutmeg appearance was frequently seen. A diffuse yellow liver, occasionally with petechial hemorrhages, was also observed. Hemorrhages were seen also in other tissues. Main histologic lesions were liver necrosis, mainly centrilobular, with severe vacuolation of midzonal and periportal hepatocytes. The gross red areas corresponded to diffuse necrosis, and the yellow areas to diffuse vacuolation of hepatocytes. The poisoning was produced experimentally in three cattle, causing death with 3 g of the green sprouting plant per kilogram body weight. Gross and histologic lesions were similar to those observed in spontaneous cases...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSpeleothem inclusion-water isotope {{compositions}} are {{a promising}} new climatic proxy, but their applicability {{is limited by}} their low content in water and by analytical challenges. We have developed a precise and accurate isotopic technique {{that is based on}} cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS). This method features <b>a</b> newly developed <b>crushing</b> apparatus, <b>a</b> refined sample extraction line, careful evaluation of the water/carbonate adsorption effect. After crushing chipped speleothem in <b>a</b> newly-developed <b>crushing</b> <b>device,</b> released inclusion water is purified and mixed with a limited amount of nitrogen gas in the extraction line for CRDS measurement. We have measured 50 – 260 nL of inclusion water from 77 to 286 mg of stalagmite deposits sampled from Gyokusen Cave, Okinawa Island, Japan. The small sample size requirement demonstrates that our analytical technique can offer high-resolution inclusion water-based paleoclimate reconstructions. The 1 σ reproducibility for different stalagmites ranges from ± 0. 05 to 0. 61 ‰ for δ 18 O and ± 0. 0 to 2. 9 ‰ for δD. The δD vs. δ 18 O plot for inclusion water from modern stalagmites is consistent with the local meteoric water line. The 1000 ln α values based on calcite and fluid inclusion measurements from decades-old stalagmites are in agreement with the data from present-day farmed calcite experiment. Combination of coeval carbonate and fluid inclusion data suggests that past temperatures at 9 – 10 thousand years ago (ka) and 26 ka were 3. 4 ± 0. 7 °C and 8. 2 ± 2. 4 °C colder than at present, respectively...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study is to analyze the influence of crushing speed on the rupture behavior and the energy absorption capability of composite materials. Two materials are tested: a carbon-epoxy unidirectional prepreg, and a carbon-epoxy fabric. For both materials, three different plate configurations are tested (three different stacking sequences). The <b>crushing</b> <b>device</b> is <b>an</b> improved plate <b>crushing</b> setup with stabilizing guides, which can be used both on a standard static traction/compression test machine, or on a drop tower. For static tests, a 20 mm/min velocity is applied to the specimen all along the 100 mm crushing stroke. For dynamic tests, only the initial velocity can be imposed. Three initial speeds were chosen: 2, 5 and 9 m/s. A high-speed camera is used during tests to visualize the global behavior of the plate, and the rupture modes in the crushing front. The load is also recorded, which enables to calculate the load/displacement curve of plates crushing and determinate the energy absorption capability. The analysis of these results enables to discuss on the influence of crushing speed both on the rupture modes and, as a consequence, on the energy absorption capability...|$|R

40|$|Bilateral {{asymmetry}} of the paired claws of {{the lobster}} Homarus americanus is determined {{during the fourth}} and fifth juvenile stages by differential reflex activity; the side with the greater activity becomes the crusher while the contralateral side becomes the cutter. Juvenile lobsters reared during this critical period with a substratum that could not be grasped or with reduced input from predominantly internal mechanoreceptors (proprioceptors) (achieved by cutting the dactyl and its chordotonal organ or by tenotomizing the claw opener or closer muscles) failed to develop <b>a</b> <b>crusher</b> claw and hence remained bilaterally symmetrical: they developed paired cutter claws. Therefore, the proprioceptive component of the reflex activity is implicated in bringing about the initial lateralization of the claw ganglion into <b>a</b> <b>crusher</b> and <b>a</b> cutter side. Moreover, lobsters with a single claw reared without a substratum developed <b>a</b> <b>crusher</b> on the intact side only if the intact claw was exercised. In the unexercised condition, differences in reflex activity between the side with a claw and the side without one were insufficient for the development of <b>a</b> <b>crusher</b> claw on the intact side. A minimal amount of reflex activity is necessary for the development of <b>a</b> <b>crusher.</b> Lobsters reared with this minimal amount of activity in both claws developed asymmetrical claws rather than paired crusher claws. This means that initial lateralization of the claw ganglion into <b>a</b> <b>crusher</b> side, on <b>a</b> random basis, inhibited the opposite side from also becoming <b>a</b> <b>crusher.</b> This would explain why we failed to produce lobsters with paired crusher claws and why they were seldom found in the wild...|$|R
