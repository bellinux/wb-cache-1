5|$|On June 28, 2008, a 17-year-old South Carolina {{teenager}} was decapitated {{after being}} struck by the Batman roller coaster at Six Flags Over Georgia. The teen, who was {{on a trip to}} the park with his church's youth group, scaled two fences with a friend into a restricted area <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the ride's path. Although witnesses stated he was trying to retrieve his hat, a Cobb County police spokesman reported the teens were attempting to take a shortcut into the park.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' {{defenses}} {{controlled the}} third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first incompletion, which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little {{success in the}} third quarter, being held to {{only a few yards}} gained and turning the ball over once. In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly lined up in a punt formation, and the center snapped the ball over the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their left guard, James Bryan, to become an eligible receiver. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it just short of the goal line <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the end zone for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14.|$|E
5|$|Located in St John's Lodge in the Inner Circle of Regent's Park, the IOA {{was founded}} in 1937, largely by {{archaeologist}} Mortimer Wheeler, but until 1946 relied primarily upon volunteer lecturers. Childe's relationship with the conservative Wheeler was strained, the latter being intolerant of the shortcomings of others, something Childe made an effort never to be. He was popular among students, who saw him as a kindly eccentric; they commissioned a bust of Childe from Marjorie Maitland Howard. His lecturing was nevertheless considered poor, as he often mumbled <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> an adjacent room to find something while continuing to talk. He consistently referred to the socialist states of eastern Europe by their full official titles, and called towns by their Slavonic rather than Germanic names, further confusing his students. He was deemed better at giving tutorials and seminars, where he devoted more time to interacting with his students. As Director, Childe was not obliged to excavate, though he did undertake projects at the Orkney Neolithic burial tombs of Quoyness (1951) and Maes Howe (1954â€“55).|$|E

5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E

25|$|Between 1985 and 1986 the CIA lost every spy {{it had in}} Eastern Europe. The {{details of}} the {{investigation}} into the cause were obscured from the new Director, and the investigation had little success, and has been widely criticized. In June 1987, Major Florentino Aspillaga Lombard, the chief of Cuban Intelligence in Czechoslovakia drove into Vienna, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the American Embassy to defect. He revealed that every single Cuban spy on the CIA payroll was a double agent, pretending to work for the CIA, but secretly still being loyal to Castro. On February 21, 1994, FBI agents pulled Aldrich Ames out of his Jaguar. In the investigation that ensued, the CIA discovered that many of the sources for its most important analyses of the USSR were based on Soviet disinformation fed to the CIA by controlled agents. On top of that, it was discovered that, in some cases, the CIA suspected {{at the time that the}} sources were compromised, but the information was sent up the chain as genuine.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} World Heavyweight Championship between {{champion}} Batista and Triple H. In the opening seconds Flair grabbed Batista's leg, providing the distraction necessary for Triple H to attack Batista and gain an early advantage. Both men attempted to hit their finishers early on, but both attempts failed. Triple H went for another Pedigree attempt, but was backdropped over the top rope to the floor. Batista returned to the ring <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> a spinebuster for a two count. Batista then went for a Batista Bomb, but Triple H hit Batista {{in the head with}} the championship belt. Batista performed a spinebuster on Triple H, but there was no referee to make the pin. Jack Doan then ran put and made the pin, but only got a two count. A second Batista Bomb attempt was stopped with a low blow by Triple H. Triple H then backed Batista into a corner and punched him ten times. Batista then performed another Batista Bomb to win the match and retain the championship. After the match, Triple H pedigreed referee Mike Chioda, while Batista celebrated on the entrance ramp.|$|E

500|$|Friday {{was marked}} {{during the game}} by Mark Lawrenson, who so {{frustrated}} the Cardiff forward with his close attention that Friday waited for Lawrenson to attempt a slide tackle and then {{kicked him in the}} face. After receiving a red card, Friday left the ground with the game still going on; according to legend, before leaving he broke into the Brighton dressing room and defecated in Lawrenson's kit bag. Cardiff eventually lost 4â€“0. [...] "I am sick and tired of it", Andrews told the South Wales Echo on 1 November. [...] "To be sent off in his first game back is as much as a man can stand". Friday was transfer-listed and served a three-match suspension before making his final appearance on 10 December in Cardiff's 6â€“3 away defeat against Bolton. Liza was by now the mother of Friday's second daughter, Arabella, but around this time began divorce proceedings. Friday claimed that he had had enough of people telling him what to do, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> Andrews's office on 20 December 1977 to announce that he was retiring from professional football. The club promptly released him and cancelled his contract.|$|E
500|$|Joseph P. Kennedy {{had been}} a patron of Le Pavillon, but after DecrÃ© and Meyzen opened their new restaurant, Kennedy {{switched}} his patronage to La Caravelle, dining there regularly when in New York. [...] It became a popular place for the Kennedy family to visit. Fessaguet chose and trained RenÃ© Verdon to be chef at the White House when John F. Kennedy was elected president the year after opening. Verdon spent some weeks working with Fessaquet on the Kennedy family's favorite dishes. President Kennedy was especially fond of La Caravelles vichyssoise and chicken in champagne sauce. [...] He often requested them as [...] "take out" [...] orders and would have them heated up on the plane as he traveled. DecrÃ© and Meyzen renamed the dish on their menu; Poularde Maison Blanch then became [...] "White House Chicken". In 1964, the Kennedys held a family reunion at La Caravelle; one of the subjects of discussion at the reunion {{was said to be}} whether Robert F. Kennedy should ask to be nominated as vice president at the upcoming 1964 Democratic National Convention. Joseph P.

2500|$|At this point, the Confederate hold on Fort Fisher was untenable. The seaward {{batteries}} {{had been}} silenced, {{almost all of}} the north wall had been captured, and Ames had fortified a bastion within the interior. Terry, however, had concluded to finish the battle that night. Ames, ordered to maintain the offensive, organized a flanking maneuver, sending some of his men to advance outside the land wall, and come up behind the Confederate defenders of the last traverse. Within a few minutes the Confederate defeat was unmistakable. Colquitt and his staff rushed back to their rowboats just moments before Abbott's men seized the wharf. Major Reilly held up a white flag <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the Union lines to announce the fort would surrender.

2500|$|The film also {{extensively}} used computer-generated imagery for {{the first}} time in the franchise.

Anderson's death scene in which he is stabbed in the forehead and walks a few feet while talking before finally falling to his death, was not in the script but was inspired by a [...] "real-life medical emergency" [...] Craven had seen in a documentary about a person being stabbed through their head <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> an emergency room. He thought it was [...] "extraordinary if somebody was stabbed in the head and still be alive for a while".

Nicholas went at lengths in explaining how the legal uncertainty set by Alexander lured him into pledging allegiance to Constantine. He specifically required [...] "that the time of Our accession to the Throne be counted from the 19th day of November 1825", the day of Alexander's death, sealing the fact that Constantine had never reigned and that the oath to Constantine was merely a misunderstanding rectified by Nicholas.
