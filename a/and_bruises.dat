5|$|Albert {{was seriously}} ill with stomach cramps in August 1859. During {{a trip to}} Coburg {{in the autumn of}} 1860 he was driving alone in a {{carriage}} drawn by four horses that suddenly bolted. As the horses continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were cuts <b>and</b> <b>bruises.</b> He told his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{recalled}} The Original Series, {{and said}} that she was pleased to be remembered as an Orion slave girl. However, she was not pleased with the make-up process which took between four and five hours to apply, and required each actress to be sprayed with green make-up over their whole body. Removal of the makeup was via the showers in the Paramount lot's executive gym. The make-up team also needed to apply fake sweat <b>and</b> <b>bruises</b> to other members of the cast to represent the results of the increased aggression shown by them in the episode's plot.|$|E
5|$|Sastre's {{team had}} been the one setting the pace in the peloton just before the climb, but fell off when Philip Deignan spun out and tumbled off the road into a ditch. Deignan's bike was damaged and he {{sustained}} numerous visible scrapes <b>and</b> <b>bruises,</b> but he managed to continue and finish the stage with the last gruppetto. Sastre himself seemed to be off the form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell from third to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti moving up to third.|$|E

5|$|Actor Rishi Kapoor was {{subsequently}} cast as Rauf Lala, an underworld Don. Kapoor, {{who had never}} played a completely negative character in his entire career, was initially hesitant to sign the film. In an interview with Daily News and Analysis he stated that when Malhotra had offered him the role, he considered {{it to be a}} joke and thought that he would be the reason for the film's failure. Kapoor subsequently insisted on a test look before principal photography could begin, so that he could comfortably fit into the Muslim character of Lala, who wears kohl in his eyes, a karakul cap and is dressed in traditional kurta-pajamas. While shooting for the action sequences, Kapoor suffered several bad falls <b>and</b> <b>bruises,</b> but continued shooting and was thereby praised by co-star Hrithik Roshan for his professionalism.|$|E
5|$|Royton {{railway station}} {{lay at the}} end of a branch from Royton Junction on the Oldham Loop Line, which was part of the route which {{connected}} Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale. The station was opened in 1864 and closed in April 1966. It featured steep gradients on the line up to Royton Junction, which, in October 1908, caused an accident when a goods train ran out of control on the gradient down to the station, killing a fireman. In February 1961, a four-coach runaway train crashed through the buffers at Royton railway station and continued on over High Barn Street. Five houses were damaged. The driver of the train was injured, but there were no fatal or severe injuries to the public. Five people from the damaged houses were taken to hospital suffering from shock <b>and</b> <b>bruises,</b> and in one case a fractured clavicle.|$|E
5|$|Abi {{moves to}} Albert Square {{with her parents}} Max Branning (Jake Wood) and Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), and sister Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan), where she befriends Ben Mitchell (Charlie Jones). Abi is hit by Dean Wicks's (Matt Di Angelo) car, {{suffering}} a broken wrist, cuts <b>and</b> <b>bruises,</b> but she recovers with no long-term impairment. Abi later learns that Ben's father, Phil Mitchell's (Steve McFadden), girlfriend Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson) is abusing him, so due to this, Abi and Ben plan to run away, but fail as they are caught by their parents. Abi then stands up to Stella and tells Ben to do the same, leading Stella to kill herself when Ben reveals the abuse. In December 2007, she chooses the name for her newborn baby brother, Oscar. Soon after, when Max's affair with Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) is revealed, Max and Tanya separate. Abi begins to live sporadically with each parent, frequently defending Max to Tanya and Lauren, until Max and Tanya reunite in 2009, however Abi leaves with Tanya after learning of Max's financial problems. In September 2009, Abi and Jordan Johnson (Michael-Joel David Stuart) find Jordan's mother Trina Johnson's (Sharon Duncan Brewster) body in the summerhouse at the allotments having been accidentally killed by Jordan's father, Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet).|$|E
50|$|The {{doctor who}} treated Tsang at the Accident and Emergency Department of Ruttonjee Hospital noted {{extensive}} injuries including swelling <b>and</b> <b>bruising</b> of the forehead, upper face, <b>and</b> chin; <b>bruising</b> of the neck; bruising of the clavicle; circular reddish bruises {{all over the}} chest; bruising of {{both sides of the}} abdomen; bruising of the back; bruising of the left wrist; abrasions <b>and</b> <b>bruising</b> of the left arm and hand; and abrasion of the left knee. Doctors testified that the distinctive circular bruises were likely caused by forceful jabbing of retracted police batons.|$|R
40|$|Injection site-pain <b>and</b> <b>bruising</b> {{are common}} {{side effects of}} {{subcutaneous}} heparin injections. These adverse outcomes are problematic for both {{the patient and the}} nurse. Specifically, site-pain causes the patient discomfort <b>and</b> <b>bruising</b> limits possible sites for subsequent injections. It is important that nurses use an injection technique that minimises the incidence of adverse outcomes when administering subcutaneous heparin injections. This study examines the effect of duration of subcutaneous heparin injection on site-pain intensity <b>and</b> <b>bruise</b> size experienced by a group of patients being treated with heparin for ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attacks. A quasiexperimental design with subjects serving as their own control was used to address the study objectives. The independent variable was the duration of the injection and the dependent variables were site-pain <b>and</b> <b>bruise</b> size. A convenience sample of 34 subjects receiving 5000 units of a subcutaneous Fragmin injection twice a day were recruited from a large teaching hospital. Subjects rated the level of perceived site-pain intensity during injection using the vertical Visual Analogue Scale. Injection-site bruising was measured at 48 and 60 hours after injection. Data were analysed using the Wilcoxon Sign-Rank test. Results indicated that injection technique B (30 -second injection duration) resulted in significantly less intense site-pain during administering the injection and fewer <b>and</b> smaller <b>bruises.</b> The findings {{of this study indicate that}} injecting subcutaneous heparin over a longer duration may reduce injection site-pain <b>and</b> <b>bruising...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Mumbai Police {{announced}} its move to put Raj under their custody on 13 February, which created an upsurge {{of violence in}} the state and led to two deaths. Attacks on North Indians were reported from Mumbai, Pune, Jalna, Beed, Aurangabad and Latur. Shops, offices and other business establishments were shut down in different parts of Mumbai, as MNS workers threatened violence in case their leader was arrested. Central Mumbai localities were most affected, especially around Dadar and Shivaji Park, the strongholds of both the MNS and the Shiv Sena. The police blocked roads in front of the residence of Raj in the Shivaji Park area. A civic activist named James John was assaulted by suspected MNS workers while he was attempting to photograph them forcing shop owners to down shutters in JB Nagar, Andheri. John suffered two rib fractures <b>and</b> <b>bruises</b> on his lungs. In Nashik, an employee of the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, a Maharashtrian, died during a stone pelting on state-run buses by MNS supporters. A migrant from Bihar, who was a security guard with a private company at Igatpuri in Nashik district, was killed by a mob.|$|E
