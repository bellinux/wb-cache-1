[...] The rule reads in part: We will identify, on a prospective basis, individuals who receive Disability Insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act (Act) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments under title XVI of the Act and who also meet certain other criteria, including an <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> {{based on a}} finding that the individual's mental impairment meets or medically equals the requirements of section 12.00 of the Listing of Impairments (Listings) and receipt of benefits through a representative payee. We will provide pertinent information about these individuals to the Attorney General on not less than a quarterly basis. As required by the NIAA, at the commencement of the adjudication process we will also notify individuals, both orally and in writing, of their possible Federal prohibition on possessing or receiving firearms, the consequences of such prohibition, the criminal penalties for violating the Gun Control Act, {{and the availability of}} relief from the prohibition on the receipt or possession of firearms imposed by Federal law.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Assess {{the odds}} of having an initial claim for {{statutory}} sickness benefit awarded (ascribed to mental disorder as the main registered diagnosis), in relation to institutional, clinical, sociodemographic and welfare factors in Juiz de Fora-MG, Brazil. METHOD: Two models of logistic regression, {{taking into account the}} categories of the medical examiners, were built with the aim of characterizing the relative weight of several variables affecting the medical conclusion. RESULTS: The factors more strongly related to an <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> were a claimant assessed by a physician without a specialization in psychiatry; with a diagnosis of psychosis; up to 29 years of age; with other non-psychiatric (musculoskeletal and cardiovascular) co-morbidities; registered with the national insurance system as employed; and male. DISCUSSION: In both models, examiners with a specialization in psychiatry were associated with a lower likelihood <b>of</b> <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit.</b> This suggests that examinations undertaken by doctors having a specialty related to the diagnosis supporting the sickness benefit claim are stricter than those undertaken by non-specialists. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that benefit award odds were associated with the specialty of the examiner, medical diagnosis, age, gender and claimant category...|$|R

This was seen as especially embarrassing because Zarelli had a well-established political identity as a fiscal conservative. Zarelli defended himself by arguing that the State Employment Security Department had found him to be eligible for benefits, and there were never any allegations of unsavory dealings behind the <b>awarding</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> The controversy soon passed.|$|R

50|$|For example, {{assume that}} the maximum {{permitted}} housing benefit that could be paid for an individual who attracted the full rate <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> were £100. Assume further that this claimant is not entitled to the full amount because his income exceeds the applicable amount by £60; that is, he has excess income of £60. The maximum possible benefit will be reduced by 65% of £60 to a value of £100 - (65% X £60) = £100 - £39 = £61; his <b>award</b> <b>of</b> housing <b>benefit</b> using the current taper is thus £61 instead of the maximum possible amount of £100.|$|R

OBJETIVO: Avaliar a chance de deferimento em relação a fatores institucionais, clínicos, sociodemográficos e previdenciários em exames periciais iniciais de requerentes de auxílio-doença com registro de algum transtorno mental como diagnóstico principal em Juiz de Fora-MG. MÉTODO: Considerando as categorias de peritos médicos avaliadores, foram construídos dois modelos de regressão logística buscando caracterizar o peso relativo de diversas variáveis sobre a conclusão médico-pericial. RESULTADOS: Os fatores que se mostraram fortemente associados a maior chance de deferimento foram: segurado avaliado por perito médico sem especialidade em psiquiatria; com diagnóstico de psicoses; na faixa etária de até 29 anos de idade; com outras comorbidades clínicas que não as psiquiátricas, osteomusculares e cardiovasculares; vinculado ao INSS como empregado; e do sexo masculino. DISCUSSÃO: Nos dois modelos estudados, os peritos médicos especialistas em psiquiatria se associaram a menor chance de deferimento. Isto sugere que profissionais especializados na área relativa ao diagnóstico dos segurados sejam mais rigorosos em suas avaliações periciais que os peritos não especialistas. CONCLUSÃO: Os resultados sugerem que a chance de deferimento esteve associada à especialidade do perito médico examinador, ao diagnóstico, idade, sexo e categoria de segurado...|$|R
40|$|This article {{systematically}} examines {{government regulation}} of medicines in the U. K. and the U. S. with specific reference to carcinogenic risk assessment. By taking four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as case studies, {{it is argued}} that there have been inconsistencies between regulatory practice and the scientific standards supposed to have been upheld by drug regulatory agencies. Moreover, those inconsistencies are shown to form a trend over time which suggests an erosion and neglect of regulatory rigour during the 1980 s.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the role of}} social insurance, namely old-age pensions, {{disability}} insurance and healthcare, in accounting for the differing labor supply patterns of older individuals across OECD countries. To this end, we develop a life cycle model of labor supply and health with heterogeneous agents. The key features of the framework are: (1) people choose when to stop working, and when/if to apply for disability and pension <b>benefits,</b> (2) the <b>awarding</b> <b>of</b> disability insurance <b>benefits</b> is imperfectly correlated with health, and (3) people can partially insure against health shocks by investing in health, the cost of which is dependent on health insurance coverage. We find that the incentives faced by older workers differ hugely across countries. In fact, based solely on differences in social insurance programs, the model predicts even more cross-country variation in the employment rates of people aged 55 - 64 than we observe in the data...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyGovernments of the ECLAC {{region have}} promulgated labour regimes which support port workers' desire for stable wages and job security, isolate them from market signals and create {{cargo-handling}} monopolies. The advent {{of a global}} economy, the introduction of export-led growth policies, the acquisition of advanced cargo-handling equipment and electronic information systems, and the participation of private interests in the offer of port services permit enterprises to compare, purchase and employ raw materials, labour and service inputs worldwide, and have transformed the traditional concept of competition between comparable finished goods into input-to-final product competition. Port labour {{is only one of}} the inputs in the distribution process and must be organized on a commercial basis in order to make possible competition with other ports in the world. The free play of market mechanisms offers an external standard to control the size of the workforce, harmonize the desires of dockworkers and maritime employers, and compel each to progressively improve productivity, reduce costs, innovate and make needed investments. Reforms of port labour regimes should remove regulatory impediments to the free play of market mechanisms; decentralize and deregulate the labour market; utilize antimonopoly laws which are applicable to maritime employers and labour unions to avoid misuses of market mechanisms; eliminate direct government participation in port operations, collective negotiations and informal dispute resolution, and promote opportunity-oriented social equity in the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> worker <b>benefits.</b> With a commercial port labour regime, maritime transport employers would come to recognize that their commercial objectives and the social goals of port labour are intertwined, and cannot be attained independently...|$|R
