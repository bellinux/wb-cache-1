5000|$|In digital imaging, a pixel, pel, dots, or {{picture element}} is a {{physical}} point in a raster image, or the smallest <b>addressable</b> <b>element</b> in an all points addressable display device; so it is the smallest controllable element of a picture represented on the screen. The address of a pixel corresponds to its physical coordinates. LCD pixels are manufactured in a two-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots or squares, but CRT pixels correspond to their timing mechanisms [...]|$|E
50|$|Multiple bits may be {{expressed}} and represented in several ways. For convenience of representing commonly reoccurring groups of bits in information technology, several units of information {{have traditionally been}} used. The most common is the unit byte, coined by Werner Buchholz in June 1956, which historically was used to represent the group of bits used to encode a single character of text (until UTF-8 multibyte encoding took over) in a computer {{and for this reason}} it was used as the basic <b>addressable</b> <b>element</b> in many computer architectures. The trend in hardware design converged on the most common implementation of using eight bits per byte, as it is widely used today. However, because of the ambiguity of relying on the underlying hardware design, the unit octet was defined to explicitly denote a sequence of eight bits.|$|E
30|$|As an {{important}} application issue, scalability {{refers to the}} capability of effectively displaying large amounts of data [11]. Pixel is the smallest <b>addressable</b> <b>element</b> in a display device, so screen resolutions become the limiting factor for scalable visualizations. Larger displays with higher resolutions are being developed for visualization [12] (e.g. the large wall at the AT&T Global Network Operations Center [13]). Therefore, scalability for high resolutions and large data sets become crucial for visualizing big data.|$|E
50|$|Belt {{machines}} have smaller instructions {{than other}} common styles of machines, due to not needing a destination address for results. This saving {{can make a}} significant difference for fixed-length instruction formats, which normally use power-of-two instruction widths. If there are thirty-two <b>addressable</b> <b>elements</b> (registers on a general-register machine, belt positions on a belt machine), then each element address occupies five bits in the instruction, needing 15 bits for the three-address format of a general-register machine, but only 10 bits using the two-address format of a belt machine. Because bits are also needed for opcode and other information in the instruction, the (power-of-two constrained) instruction width often determines {{the maximum number of}} <b>addressable</b> <b>elements</b> possible in a design. Typically a belt machine instruction can support the encoding of double the number of <b>addressable</b> <b>elements</b> compared to a general-register machine of the same instruction width. There are similar gains in variable-length instruction encodings.|$|R
50|$|Many {{display and}} image-acquisition systems are, for various reasons, {{not capable of}} {{displaying}} or sensing the different color channels at the same site. Therefore, the pixel grid is divided into single-color regions {{that contribute to the}} displayed or sensed color when viewed at a distance. In some displays, such as LCD, LED, and plasma displays, these single-color regions are separately <b>addressable</b> <b>elements,</b> which have {{come to be known as}} subpixels. For example, LCDs typically divide each pixel vertically into three subpixels. When the square pixel is divided into three subpixels, each subpixel is necessarily rectangular. In display industry terminology, subpixels are often referred to as pixels, as they are the basic <b>addressable</b> <b>elements</b> in a viewpoint of hardware, and hence pixel circuits rather than subpixel circuits is used.|$|R
5000|$|In {{computer}} science, {{random access}} (more precisely and more generally called direct access) {{is the ability}} to access any item of data from a population of <b>addressable</b> <b>elements</b> roughly as easily and efficiently as any other, no matter how many elements may be in the set. It is typically contrasted to sequential access.|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} requirements {{that appear in}} addressable fire detection and alarm systems and the shortcomings of the existing addressing methods were discussed. A new method of addressing of detectors was proposed. The basic principles of addressing and responding of a called element are stated. Extinguishing module is specific subsystem in classic fire detection and alarm systems. Appearing of addressable fire detection and alarm systems didn't caused essential change {{in the concept of}} extinguishing module because of long calling period of such systems. Addressable fire security system based on counting addressing method reaches high calling rates and enables integrating of the extinguishing module in addressable system. Solutions for command <b>addressable</b> <b>element</b> and integrated extinguishing module are given in this paper. The counting addressing method was developed for {{specific requirements}} in fire detection and alarm systems, yet its speed and reliability justifies its use in the acquisition of data on slowly variable parameters under industrial conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|The Aerodynamic Data Analysis and Integration System (ADAIS), {{developed}} as a highly interactive computer graphics program capable of manipulating large quantities of data such that <b>addressable</b> <b>elements</b> of a data base can be called up for graphic display, compared, curve fit, stored, retrieved, differenced, etc., was described. The general nature {{of the system is}} evidenced by the fact that limited usage has already occurred with data bases consisting of thermodynamic, basic loads, and flight dynamics data. Productivity using ADAIS of five times that for conventional manual methods of wind tunnel data analysis is routinely achieved. In wind tunnel data analysis, data from one or more runs of a particular test may be called up and displayed along with data from one or more runs of a different test.

40|$|The surface-sensitive optical {{technique}} of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging {{is an ideal}} method {{for the study of}} affinity binding interactions of unlabeled biological molecules in a multiplexed format. This approach has been widely applied to monitor DNA–DNA, DNA–RNA, peptide–protein, and protein–protein interactions as well as surface enzyme reactions. The suc-cess of SPR imaging measurements relies on the robust attachment of biomolecules in an array format. In this chapter, we introduce two different surface attachment chemistries that covalently immobilize DNA and peptides onto gold surfaces through the modification of self-assembled alkanethiol monolayers. Array fabrication approaches for the creation of individually <b>addressable</b> <b>elements</b> through the use of either gold dot patterns or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchan-nels are detailed. The utility of SPR imaging for the study of protein interactions is demonstrated with two biological systems: the binding of response regulator proteins, VanR and OmpR, onto a DNA array, and the interaction of S protein with an array of S-peptide variants. Furthermore, the application of real-time SPR imaging to the multiplexed determination of S-protein adsorp-tion/desorption kinetics is described.

40|$|The higher {{performance}} of relaxor-based piezocrystals compared with piezoceramics is now well established, notably including improved gain-bandwidth product, and these materials {{have been adopted}} widely for biomedical ultrasound imaging. However, their use in other applications, for example {{as a source of}} focused ultrasound for targeted drug delivery, is hindered in several ways. One of the issues, which we consider here, is in shaping the material into the spherical geometries used widely in focused ultrasound. Unlike isotropic unpoled piezoceramics that can be shaped into a monolithic bowl then poled through the thickness, the anisotropic structure of piezocrystals make it impossible to machine the bulk crystalline material into a bowl without sacrificing performance. Instead, we report a novel faceted array, inspired by the geodesic dome structure in architecture, which utilizes flat piezocrystal material and maximizes fill factor. Aided by 3 D printing, a prototype with f# ≈ 1. 2, containing 96 individually <b>addressable</b> <b>elements</b> was manufactured using 1 - 3 connectivity PMN-PT piezocrystal - epoxy composite. The fabrication process is presented and the array was connected to a 32 -channel controller to shape and steer the beam for preliminary performance demonstration. At an operating frequency of 1 MHz, a focusing gain around 30 was achieved and the side lobe intensities were all at levels below - 12 dB compared to main beam.

First, the salient characteristic features of two canonical localized wave solutions to the scalar wave equation are discussed. Second, novel azimuthally polarized focus wave mode-type and X wave-type localized electromagnetic fields are derived using a vector-valued spectral approach. Third, all reported experiments dealing with the generation of localized waves are discussed and a concise report on field depth measurements, together with practical implications, is presented.

40|$|Redox cycling is an {{electrochemical}} {{technique that}} cycles the reversible redox species between its oxidative states repeatedly on generator and collector electrodes. Two or more individually-addressable microelectrodes located {{close to each}} other allow redox cycling to be possible. Electrochemical behavior of a biologically important molecule, dopamine is examined under redox cycling conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on detection of physiological concentration of dopamine in presence of up to 100 times excess ascorbate with the use of redox cycling, without the involvement of polymer coating such as Nafion®. Microfabrication was used to produce different geometries (parallel bands and concentric rings) with feature size of 4 µm or 25 µm and inter-electrode spacing of 4 µm or 25 µm on a single substrate (microelectrode arrays). Comparison of the individual electrochemical response of different arrangements of individually <b>addressable</b> <b>elements</b> composing generator and collector electrodes on band and ring microelectrode arrays is presented. The individually addressable nature of microelectrodes allowed the study of different combinations of anodic and cathodic electrodes and the current at the individual elements composing the generator and the collector. Reversible electroactive species hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride in a 0. 5 M potassium chloride electrolyte solution was used to perform the electrochemical characterization and comparisons of the microelectrode arrays. Behavior of band and ring microelectrodes in an array format during redox cycling is compared to each other {{as well as to the}} available theory. The optimized geometry and arrangement of microelectrodes is used to exhibit detection of dopamine with and without redox cycling. Comparison of dopamine behavior in presence and absence of redox cycling and other available methods of detection is provided. Detection of dopamine in presence of some of the common interferences (ascorbate and 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) is shown with and without redox cycling on unmodified electrodes as well as on electrodes modified with Nafion®. These studies indicate that redox cycling can detect dopamine at physiologically relevant concentrations in presence of interferences, but will require the coating of electrodes with Nafion in addition to broaden the range of interfering compounds that can be eliminated. Traditional voltammetric methods to detect dopamine cannot measure resting, or static dopamine concentrations where redox cycling would be of further interest. Redox cycling provides elimination from the interfering ascorbate signal, enhancing the sensitivity toward the analyte simultaneously. Based on the knowledge gathered from comparison of different electrodes and redox cycling of dopamine, an interdigitated microelectrode probe design suitable for investigation of redox cycling of dopamine is fabricated. The probe contains array having dimensions that will be suitable for tissue insertions studies. The knowledge gained through this project will eventually lead to a new class of multi-electrode probes for in vivo studies of neurotransmitters in neurosciences...|$|R

Lizzi Center for Biomedical Engineering, Riverside Research, New York, NY, USA Abstract: The use of focused {{ultrasound}} {{to obtain}} diagnostically significant {{information about the}} eye {{goes back to the}} 1950 s. This review describes the historical and technological development of ophthalmic ultrasound and its clinical application and impact. Ultrasound, like light, can be focused, which is crucial for formation of high-resolution, diagnostically useful images. Focused, single-element, mechanically scanned transducers are most common in ophthalmology. Specially designed transducers have been used to generate focused, high-intensity ultrasound that through thermal effects has been used to treat glaucoma (via cilio-destruction), tumors, and other pathologies. Linear and annular transducer arrays offer synthetic focusing in which precise timing of the excitation of independently <b>addressable</b> array <b>elements</b> allows formation of a converging wavefront to create a focus at one or more programmable depths. Most recently, linear array-based plane-wave ultrasound, in which the array emits an unfocused wavefront and focusing is performed solely on received data, has been demonstrated for imaging ocular anatomy and blood flow. While the history of ophthalmic ultrasound extends back over half-a-century, new and powerful technologic advances continue to be made, offering the prospect of novel diagnostic capabilities.

40|$|One of {{the current}} {{challenges}} in materials science is establishing {{a simple way to}} generate an ultradense arrays of <b>addressable</b> nanoscopic <b>elements</b> on macroscopic scales. The addressability of nanomaterials is essential for many applications, ranging from high-density magnetic storage to high-density, ultrahigh resolution displays to photovoltaics. Among the strategies available, 2 ̆ 2 photocombing 2 ̆ 2 has been proposed as a promising route to create long-range ordered nanostructures in self-assembled block copolymers (BCPs) over macroscopic distances through a photocontrollable ordering transition. In this process, bands of light act as a 2 ̆ 2 comb 2 ̆ 2 to sweep across BCP thin films unidirectionally, reversibly bringing the BCPs through an ordering transition, like the disorder-to-order transition (DOT) and the order-to-order transition (OOT). Thus, defects are 2 ̆ 2 combed 2 ̆ 2 out, forming arrays of highly ordered BCP microdomains on a macroscopic length scale. It is similar in principle to the classic zone refining method, which is used to produce large single crystals of metals and semiconductors. ^ In this dissertation, I will focus on three systems to investigate photocombing. System I is the supramolecular assembly of poly(2 -vinylpyridine) -block-poly(n-butyl methacrylate) and polystyrene-block-poly(2 -vinylpyridine) di-BCPs with azobenzene-containing 2 -(4 -hydroxyphenylazo) benzoic acid chromophores. In these systems, an ordering transition from lamellae to hexagonally packed cylinders was observed after one hour of UV radiation at 150 °C. System II is the deuterated polystyrene-block-poly(n-butyl methacrylate) BCPs with photoisomerizable azobenzene functionalities. They exhibit an entropy-driven lower DOT, the characteristic of 2 ̆ 2 compressibility 2 ̆ 2, similar to their parent BCPs. System III is anthracene-functionalized tri-BCPs containing deuterated polystyrene (d 8 -PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blocks, as well as a small middle block of poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylates) that is randomly functionalized by anthracene. Under UV exposure, the junction between d 8 -PS and PMMA blocks in the tri-BCPs is joined together through anthracene photodimers, thereby resulting in a significantly increase in the total molecular weight of the tri-BCPs. As a consequence, the tri-BCPs undergo an ordering transition from a disordered state to an ordered state, when it is phase-mixed but close to the boundary of the ordering transition. ...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic imaging is a {{well-established}} technology {{that provides a}} safe method for imaging into optically opaque structures. These images can be generated by mechanically scanning a single transducer element, using tomography or by using a multiple-element transducer array, where the latter provides the most focussed images due to the precise positioning of the transmitting and receiving elements. An ultrasonic array comprises a number of individually <b>addressable</b> active piezoelectric <b>elements</b> and is controlled by a Phased Array Controller instrument to manipulate the ultrasonic pressure field within the load medium. Such arrays are typically used for sonar, medical diagnosis and non-destructive evaluation, however {{they have not yet}} been applied in the field of industrial process analysis. This paper aims to highlight how ultrasonic transducer arrays can be used to acquire in-situ images of dynamic process streams and how these images can provide valuable spatial information about the process, such as particle size distribution. The impact of this means that visualisation of a process stream will no-longer be limited to those systems that are optically transparent, therefore creating a greater breadth of spatial measurements within process analysis. This paper will be divided into two parts: image acquisition optimisation and image processing. The first part will outline the method used to determine the optimum number of array elements (active aperture) within the transducer array to acquire stable images of a dynamic system. For this work, the size of the active aperture will range from 16 to 128 elements, corresponding to an image region width of 11 to 90 mm. However, larger images require a longer data acquisition time and therefore produce a poorer image resolution when the target is dynamic in nature. The second part will show how relevant information about the process can be extracted from these ultrasonic images and how these measurements can be calibrated using a static system. The conclusion of this paper will discuss how an array ultrasonic image acquisition and processing system has the potential to become a new class of process analytical technology...|$|R
40|$|This review book, without pretending {{of being}} exhaustive, {{will focus on}} protein and peptide arrays {{highlighting}} their technical challenges and presenting new directions {{by means of a}} set of selected recent applications. It has been structured in three main chapters that treat the single basic themes of applications, types and realization of protein chips, to face the matter with a multidisciplinary approach involving: biology for capture molecules, chemistry for methods of immobilization, material engineering for support fabrication, physics for detection systems. In recent years, protein microarrays have {{become one of the most}} invaluable research tools in the field of large-scale and high-throughput biology, and their use in basic research, diagnostics and drug discovery has emerged as a great promise of medicine. The fast growth of protein chip technology is fuelled by the continuous growth of genomic information; the integration of large datasets from different approaches will result in the generation of a huge network and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of life. The actual impact of the new technology on proteomic and medical research are yet to be fully realized, opening a new era of collection and analysis information. During the last few decades, scientists have extended their investigations beyond molecular level into the field of the so-called “supramolecular chemistry”. Basic themes such as molecular self-assembly, folding, molecular recognition, host-guest chemistry, and nanoscience are often associated with this area of research. Broadly speaking, supramolecular chemistry is the study of interactions between, rather than within, molecules. While traditional chemistry focuses on strong association forces such as covalent and ionic bonds (used to assemble atoms into discrete molecules), supramolecular chemistry examines the weaker and reversible noncovalent interactions between molecules (used to organize and hold together supramolecular assemblies), including hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, hydrophobic forces, van der Waals forces, hydrophilic-hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic effects. In nature, organization on the nanometer scale is crucial for the remarkable properties and functional capabilities of biological systems; thus, the use of these principles led to an increasing understanding of many biological processes based on protein structure and function. Concomitantly, nanotechnologists began to be able to take these concepts and apply them to synthetic systems based on noncovalent interactions. The development of selective “host-guest” complexes in particular, in which a host molecule recognizes and selectively binds a certain guest, can be cited as an important contribution to protein chip technology. In addition, the need for improved miniaturization and device performance in the microelectronics industry has inspired many investigations into supramolecular chemistry. It is conceivable that “bottom up” materials fabrication approaches based on supramolecular chemistry will provide a solution to the anticipated size limitations of “top down” approaches, such as photolithography, thereby providing the means to fabricate ultrasmall electronic components. Hybrid devices integrate the outstanding electronic and photonic properties of nonmolecular hard materials such as silicon to the excellent bio-recognition, chemical sensing, and related properties of designed, soft molecular materials to yield structures capable of performing disease diagnosis, environmental monitoring, controlled drug delivery, and so on. Miniaturized and parallel assay systems, in particular microarray-based analyses, allow fast, easy and parallel detection of thousands of <b>addressable</b> <b>elements</b> in a single experiment. They are applied to analyse antibody-antigen, protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid, protein-lipid and protein-small molecule as well as enzyme-substrate interactions. New trends in protein chip technology include surface chemistry, capture molecules, labeling and detection methods, high-throughput protein production, and applications to analyse entire proteomes. The challenges are to elucidate the basic cellular events mediating complex processes and those causing diseases. It is well recognised that the complexity of the proteome far exceeds that of the genome. When variables such as alternative gene splicing events, post-translational modifications and individual coding variants are taken into account, the number of different molecular protein species is likely to be at least 1 - 2 orders of magnitude greater than the number of genes. Conventional proteome analysis by 2 D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, while highly effective, has limitations and in particular may miss many proteins of interest when expressed at low abundance and is unsuited to diagnostic applications. Since the little abundant proteins are often those of the greatest diagnostic interest (e. g. cytokines and biomarkers in plasma), there is therefore an acknowledged need for other highly sensitive, specific and accessible high throughput technologies for protein detection, quantization and differential expression analysis in health and disease. For this reason, protein arrays are poised to become a central technology at the research and biotechnology levels. Protein arrays generally fall into three types. In protein function arrays, a large set of purified proteins or peptides or even an entire proteome is spotted and immobilized, then the array is used for parallel screening of a range of biochemical interactions. Protein function arrays are generally aimed at discovering protein function in fundamental research and can be used to study the effect of substrates or inhibitors on enzyme activities, protein-drug or hormone-effector interactions, or epitope mapping. In protein detection microarrays (usually referred as analytical microarrays), an array of affinity reagents (antigens or antibodies, but also peptides or aptamers), rather than the native proteins themselves, is immobilized on a support and used to determine protein abundances in a complex matrix such as plasma/serum or tissue extracts. Analytical arrays can be used to assay antibodies (for diagnosis of allergy or autoimmunity diseases) or to monitor protein expression on a large scale. In a third category of protein arrays (usually referred as reverse phase microarrays), tissues, cell lysates, or serum samples are spotted on the surface and probed with one antibody per analyte for a multiplex readout. For construction of arrays, sources of proteins include cell-based expression systems for recombinant proteins, purification from natural sources, production in vitro by cell-free translation systems, and synthetic methods for peptides. Many of these methods can be automated for high throughput production. Recent advances involve the use of whole phage as selective and specific probes, possessing distinct advantages as durability, stability, standardization and low-cost production. For capture arrays and protein function analysis, it is clearly important that proteins should be correctly folded and functional. On the other hand, arrays of denatured proteins are useful in screening antibodies for cross-reactivity, identifying auto-antibodies and selecting ligand binding proteins, where linear epitopes are recognised. The immobilisation method used should be reproducible, applicable to proteins of different properties (size, hydrophilic, hydrophobic), amenable to high throughput and automation, and compatible with retention of fully functional protein activity. Both covalent and noncovalent methods of protein immobilisation are used with various pros and cons. What is required from any method is optimal sensitivity and specificity, with low background to give high signal to noise. Protein analytes binding to antibody arrays may be detected directly or via a secondary antibody in a sandwich assay. Direct labelling is used for comparison of different samples with different fluorophores. Where pairs of antibodies directed at the same protein ligand are available, sandwich immunoassays provide high specificity and sensitivity and are therefore the method of choice for low abundance proteins such as cytokines; they also give the possibility of detection of protein modifications. On the other hand, label-free detection methods, including Mass Spectrometry and Surface Plasmon Resonance, avoid alteration of ligand. The design of capture arrays, particularly when exposed to heterologous mixtures such as plasma and tissue extracts, needs to take into consideration the problems of cross-reactivity which will occur particularly with highly multiplexed assays. Antibodies can be surprisingly cross-reactive, which in the high throughput microarray field can render results misleading or, at worst, useless. Successful multianalyte analysis will therefore require careful screening of each polyclonal antiserum, hybridoma or recombinant clone for cross-reactions against all antigens on the array. The use of combinations of antibodies against individual targets in sandwich assays should help to minimize cross-reactions, or the linkage to mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of bound ligands. As diagnostic devices, microarrays exploit the power of multiplexing simultaneous analyses of different samples and repeated analyses of the same samples in automated way. Diagnostics formats include arrays of antibodies, as in detection of cytokines, and antigens to detect serum antibodies in screens for infections, autoimmune diseases and allergies. Highly parallel analysis on arrays will allow determination of tumour markers in extracts with only a minimum of biopsy material, creating new possibilities for monitoring cancer treatment and therapy. Discovery of new autoantibody specificities is possible by screening patient sera against arrays of human proteins. The quantitative detection of proteins in cells and tissues and comparison in different conditions (health, disease, differentiation, drug treatment, etc) is a central aim of proteomics. The array format is well established for the rapid, global analysis of nucleic acids, as in the use of oligonucleotide and cDNA arrays for gene expression (transcription) profiling. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis technology, on which most proteome profiling is based currently, is also limited in various ways, particularly, as stated above, in the difficulty of finding and quantitatively estimating low abundance proteins. For information about the expression of the proteome, protein and peptide arrays are becoming major tools, and the information that will be obtained from them in the future will complement transcriptional data. Capture arrays sensitively and accurately detect low levels of proteins with minimal technical know-how on the part of the user, and we can expect them to be used widely to measure differential protein expression. They will provide a powerful and reliable platform for extending molecular analysis beyond the limitations of DNA chips. On the other hand, it is difficult to store large-scale protein arrays in a functional state for long periods of time, due to the sensitivity and heterogeneity of proteins, unlike DNA that is a highly stable molecule capable of long-term storage. Therefore, an interesting concept nowadays is to make protein arrays directly from DNA, either co-distributed or pre-arrayed, using cell free protein expression systems, to create the proteins on the arrays on demand as and when required. Thus, in situ methods address the three main issues in protein array technology: efficient global protein expression and availability; functional protein immobilization and purification, and on-chip stability over time. The stability and lifetime of protein arrays in different formats needs to be considered. Detection methods are another important consideration, with requirements of sensitivity, accuracy and quantization over a wide range. The design of the array will be influenced by the readout system. Finally, standardization is an issue common to all high throughput technologies: the existence and development of many alternative formats and conditions inevitably leads to problems in comparison of results. Standards for protein arrays and a framework for their implementation will need to be established at an international level...|$|R
