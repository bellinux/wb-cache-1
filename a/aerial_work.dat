5|$|The GA sector {{operates}} {{a range of}} aircraft, including balloons and airships, gliders, hang gliders, paragliders, microlights, gyrocopters, helicopters, amateur built and mass-produced light aircraft, ex-military aircraft, and business jets. Flights can be broadly categorised as public transport, <b>aerial</b> <b>work,</b> and private flying, the first {{two of which are}} commercial activities.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{operations}} are remunerated activities which {{fall within the}} ICAO definition of CAT. Some are, however, closely aligned to, and considered part of, the GA sector. Public transport {{operations are}} non-scheduled, on-demand services flying between points specified by the customer, providing a more flexible service than airline travel. Air taxi operations offer charter services for third parties, and business or corporate aviation uses company-owned aircraft to transport employees and clients. Aircraft used in these operations include business jets, helicopters, and twin piston-engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people. An example {{of this type of}} operation is the transport by helicopter of spectators to the British Formula One grand prix at Silverstone. This involves so many flights that, according to Cranfield Aviation Services, on race day the heliport is temporarily the world's busiest airport. <b>Aerial</b> <b>work</b> is a small but important component of the commercial GA sector, characterised in its simplest form as remunerated non-transport activities, such as surveying, crop spraying, and emergency services work (air ambulance and police).|$|E
5|$|General {{aviation}} in the United Kingdom {{has been}} defined as a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule or military aviation. Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition, some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general aviation (GA) in the UK. The sector operates business jets, rotorcraft, piston and jet-engined fixed-wing aircraft, gliders of all descriptions, and lighter than air craft. Public transport operations include business (or corporate) aviation and air taxi services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are <b>aerial</b> <b>work,</b> such as surveying and air ambulances, and flight training, which {{plays an important role in}} the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport (CAT) industry. Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of air sports, such as racing, aerobatics, and parachuting, at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition.|$|E

5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as <b>aerial</b> <b>work</b> and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{transport}} pilot licencehelicopter {{is restricted}} to <b>aerial</b> <b>work</b> only if the night and instrument flight time requirements are not met. This means that the licence is restricted to commercial flying {{that does not include}} air transport (transportation of commercial passengers) nor flight training.|$|E

500|$|Organisations in the United Kingdom (UK) {{describe}} GA in {{less restrictive}} terms that include elements of commercial aviation.

The General Aviation Awareness Council applies the description [...] "all Civil Aviation operations other than scheduled air services and non-scheduled air transport operations for remuneration or hire". For the purposes of a strategic review of GA in the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) defined the scope of GA as [...] "a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule", and considered it necessary to depart from the ICAO definition and include <b>aerial</b> <b>work</b> and minor CAT operations.|$|E

60|$|We haven't these officers, and we can't {{make them}} in a hurry. It takes {{at least five years}} to make an officer who knows his trade. It needs a special gift, in {{addition}} to that knowledge, to make a man able to impart it. And our Empire is at a peculiar disadvantage in the matter, because India and our other vast areas of service and opportunity overseas drain away a large proportion of just those able and educated men who would in other countries gravitate towards the army. Such small wealth of officers as we have--and I am quite prepared to believe that the officers we have are among the very best in the world--are scarcely enough to go round our present supply of private soldiers. And the best and most brilliant among this scanty supply are being drawn upon more and more for <b>aerial</b> <b>work,</b> and for all that increasing quantity of highly specialised services which are manifestly destined to be the real fighting forces of the future. We cannot spare the best of our officers for training conscripts; we shall get the dismallest results from the worst of them; and so even if it were a vital necessity for our country to have an army of all its manhood now, we could not have it, {{and it would be a}} mere last convulsion to attempt to make it with the means at our disposal.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{wind-powered}} drive location and functioning pecularities of agricultural airplane special equipment. The data on the advantages and prospects {{of the use of}} the wind-powered drive on agricultural aircraft as well as the experimental and analytical data on discontinuity of the wind stream in the zone of the wind-powered drive installa- and parameters of its operation at aerial spraying on the example of specially equipped An- 2 are presented. A mathe- matical model of a wind propeller in discontinuous wind stream is developed. Software package to comprehensively assess wind-powered drive conditions and performance indicators is generated and tested taking into account experimental data, as well as airplane performance and flight modes. The typical data on the wind propeller and the wind-powered drive in the spraying process are received; specific features of the dynamics at the wind-powered drive turning-on and the wind propel- ler rotation at zero load are determined and the data on the wind-propeller blades load imbalance at spraying and transient processes are defined. The author made a quantitative estimation of how the standard change of flight parameters and the operation of the aircraft power plant at spraying influence on the factors of wind-powered drive operation and working liq- uids suppey. The main tendencies, qualitative and quantitative aspects of a wind-powered drive use are defined when per- forming <b>aerial</b> <b>works</b> and the proposals and recommendations for improving and using it in the future are made.
