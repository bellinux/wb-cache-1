40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} Chinese small-scale farmer's {{response to}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>risks</b> by using MOTAD model. Based on the household's {{data from the}} two villages Wangjia and Damao in Zhejiang province, we established "representative rural household" {{for each of the}} sampling villages. The results show that farmers in Zhejiang are quite sensitive to <b>agricultural</b> <b>risks.</b> However, different farming systems, the ratio of agricultural income to total family income, as well as the size of arable land, differentiates their risk response. The decision maker's risk preference not only affects the type of agricultural activities and corresponding scales they selected, but also have further effects on the micro agricultural production structure and stable growth of household's income. Given the amount of productive resources such as arable land, capital and labor force, the combination of production activities with a higher level of expected income/risk would be selected if the decision maker is willing to take risks. In a higher level of risks, capital is invested prior to manpower, implying that the latter has a much higher opportunity cost. For those combinations with a lower risk level, diversification might reduce risks to some extent at a cost of total return. Current agriculture structure needs to be adjusted and improved.

40|$|Syria is an {{agricultural}} developing country, characterized by semi-arid climate and high population growth rate, facing challenges related to mainly agriculture sector and food insecurity. The {{resolution of the}} latter {{is one of the}} Millennium Development Goal, which can be explicated by the goal to “eradicate extreme poverty and hunger”. Within such a framework the present thesis is devoted to study the food security situation in Syria and the peculiar factors affecting the income of the poor household. In specific, the work investigates food security situation and explores the <b>agricultural</b> <b>risks</b> by studying their main types, current strategies, public management policies and the future possible improvements for risk management. A variety of analytical approaches have been used since the main methodologies for carrying out the research depending essentially on quantitative as qualitative analyses. As preliminary analysis, secondary data were used to investigate the food security situation, while secondary data on farm semi-structured survey and an ad hoc Delphi method survey have been implemented to examine the <b>agricultural</b> <b>risks</b> and risk management strategies. The food security situation seems very similar to that of other Middle Eastern countries like Jordan and Lebanon. Food aggregate and per capita availability have an acceptable level which is also applied to food accessibility and supply stability. In contrast, food utilization exhibits low level compared to other countries, and lies under the world average in some cases e. g. for many vitamins intake. Therefore, The Government of Syria (GOS) should fill in the gap of food deficiencies both by developing the agricultural products and introducing reforms to the trade sector especially those related to importing/exporting food stuff. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>risks</b> in Syria are related mainly to production, price and policy change risks. The mentioned risks are quite different both in type and intensity according to the different zones (Farming Systems). The yield risks result mostly from the increasing incidence of drought, frost, storm, flood and diseases, while price risks are related largely to the marketing constraints of the freely marketed crops (e. g. citrus, fruits and vegetables). Policy change risks (e. g. changes in macroeconomic policies or input/output prices) affect mainly the strategic crops (cotton, wheat and sugar beet) that are marketed by the state. Finally, idiosyncratic risks (individual or personal) seem not very relevant, on average, at the national level. Agricultural risk management policies and strategies are also different according to Syrian zones. In general, diversification of income sources and cultivated crops are the main strategies adopted by farmers, while adopting a risk sharing strategy like “agricultural insurance” is still unfavorable one. Finally, GOS institutions contribute to agricultural risk management by several means like the agricultural supporting policies including the agricultural disasters relief. However, much effort must be done by GOS to manage the <b>agricultural</b> <b>risks</b> including the establishment of agricultural insurance framework...|$|E

Secondly, cooperative economic organization can settle the problem of peasants' low systematization.

Firstly, cooperative economic organization has limited coverage and small sire of organization, which is harmful to the diversification of <b>agricultural</b> <b>risks.</b> Secondly, cooperative economic organization lacks capital funds and its development is not standard, which is not perfect for the function exertion as a carrier.
