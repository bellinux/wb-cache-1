Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact.

5000|$|<b>Anterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>artery</b> {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} [...] "anterior spinal cord syndrome") {{is a medical}} condition where the <b>anterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>artery,</b> the primary blood supply to the anterior portion of the spinal cord, is interrupted, causing ischemia or infarction of the spinal cord in the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord and medulla oblongata.

50|$|Due to the {{branches}} of the aorta that supply the <b>anterior</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>artery,</b> the most common causes are insufficiencies within the aorta. These include aortic aneurysms, dissections, direct trauma to the aorta, surgeries, and atherosclerosis.

Within days, flaccid limbs become spastic and hyporeflexia (underactive nerve responses) turns into hyperreflexia (overactive nerve responses) and extensor plantar nerve responses.

The spinal cord, an extension of the medulla, passes through the foramen magnum as it exits the cranial cavity.

40|$|Introduction The perimedullary {{arteriovenous}} fistulas {{are located}} on the pial surface and are usually supplied by <b>spinal</b> medullary <b>arteries,</b> that is, either by the <b>anterior</b> or posterior <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries,</b> with no intervening nidus between the feeder arteries and the venous drainage. The clinical findings are, more commonly, caused by progressive radiculomedullary ischemic processes secondary to steal vascular mechanism. As the vascular supply to the spinal cord and to the arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) is not shared with one another, the vascular steal phenomenon cannot be implicated in this case`s physiopathology. Most probably, the mass effect caused by the giant venous dilatation was the pathophysiological mechanism involved in this lesion Case report The authors describe {{the case of a}} 6 -year-old girl with an intradural ventral arteriovenous fistula, with a giant venous dilatation, fed directly by L 2 and L 3 radiculomedullary arteries at the conus medullaris. There was no arterial supply to the fistula from the <b>anterior</b> or posterior <b>spinal</b> <b>arteries.</b> Selective <b>spinal</b> angiography showed an arteriovenous fistula supplied directly by two radiculomedullary arteries, with a large draining vein caudally. Interposing the arterial and venous vessels was a giant venous aneurysmal dilatation located ventral to the conus medullaris and extending from L 3 to T 6. The patient was successfully treated by a surgical approach through a laminotomy from L 3 to T 11.

Selective spinal cord angiography en-ables this lesion to be distinguished from other, more common dural or intradural vascular mal-formations. These GAVFs are usually revealed in childhood by subarachnoid hemorrhage or by a progressive neurologic deficit. We report the clinical and radiologic findings of 12 consecu-tive cases of GAVFs and present the outcome of endovascular treatment.

40|$|Vascular changes after acute {{spinal cord}} trauma are {{important}} factors that predispose quadriplegia, {{in most cases}} irreversible.

A spinal cord section and vascular clamping of the <b>spinal</b> <b>anterior</b> <b>artery</b> at C 5 –C 6 model was used to determine critical ischemia time.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Imaging of the <b>anterior</b> {{superficial}} <b>spinal</b> cord <b>arteries</b> by MR angiogra-phy is {{hindered by}} their small calibers and the similarity in configuration with the <b>anterior</b> superficial <b>spinal</b> cord veins. To validate {{the location and}} spatial configuration of the great anterior radiculomed-ullary artery, (ie, the Adamkiewicz artery [AKA]), contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) was compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHODS: Fifteen patients with suspected spinal cord vascular pathology underwent both spinal CE-MRA and selective spinal DSA. Two phase CE-MRA was performed {{with the use of}} a centric k-space filling scheme synchronized to the contrast bolus arrival. The level and side of the AKA origin were scored on the DSA and CE-MRA images and compared regarding image quality in terms of vessel conspicuity, contrast, continuity, sharpness, and background homogeneity on a relative 5 -point scale. RESULTS: Localization and spatial configuration of the AKA by CE-MRA was in agreement with DSA findings in 14 of 15 cases. One mismatch of 1 vertebral level (not side) appeared as a result of the tangled vascular pathology. Comparison of image quality revealed that DSA is superior to CE-MRA concerning vessel continuity, sharpness, and background homogeneity (P. 001). Overall vessel conspicuity and contrast were judged to be similar...|$|R
