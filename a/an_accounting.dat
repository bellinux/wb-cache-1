5|$|Fund {{accounting}} is <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> {{system for}} recording resources whose use {{has been limited}} by the donor, grant authority, governing agency, or other individuals or organisations or by law. It emphasizes accountability rather than profitability, and is used by Nonprofit organizations and by governments. In this method, a fund consists of a self-balancing set of accounts and each are reported as either unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently restricted based on the provider-imposed restrictions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades {{following}} the journal's establishment, leading authors in The Accounting Review tended to write articles that would {{be of interest to}} accounting practitioners. The journal published articles that focused on accounting education and issues related to particular industries and trade groups, with many articles using anecdotal evidence and hypothetical illustrations. The longest-serving editor during this period was Eric Kohler, <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> practitioner; Kohler served as editor from 1928 to 1942.|$|E

It is similarly regional in focus, serving corporate customers in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Like Dunder Mifflin, its original product line (rubber stamps) was something other than paper, and it faces stiff competition from national and international chains. It, too, has a branch office in Stamford, but Mason's has remained open. In 2009, it had <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> scandal {{that resulted in a}} $545,000 payment to corporate customers, much as Dunder Mifflin {{had to deal with the}} arrest of Ryan Howard for fraud the year before.|$|E

5|$|The main centre for {{administration}} {{was at the}} entrance to the prison, which included the warden's office. The office contained a desk with radio and telegraph equipment, typewriter, and a telephone. The administrative office section also had the offices of the associate warden and secretary, mail desk, captain's desk, a business office, a clerk's office, <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> office, a control room which was added with modern technology in 1961, the officer's lounge, armory and vault, and a visitation centre and restrooms. The basement of Alcatraz prison contained dungeons and the showers. The main stairway to the dungeon lay along Sunrise Alley at the side of A-Block, but the dungeons were also accessible by a staircase in a trapdoor along the corridor of D-Block. All visits to Alcatraz required prior written approval from the warden.|$|E

Supplemental forms could be filed by those eligible for certain exemptions; for example, Egyptian farmers could register fields as fallow and tax-exempt depending on flood patterns of the Nile. Tax obligations were determined by the census, which required each head of household {{to appear before the}} presiding official and provide a head count of his household, as well as <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> of property he owned that was suitable for agriculture or habitation.|$|E

5|$|The {{rates were}} {{determined}} by the Council of the European Union, based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one European Currency Unit (ECU) would equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; {{it was not a}} currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the pound sterling) that day.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{was married}} twice. His first wife was Blanche Julia Prowse (1853–1885), the {{daughter}} of William Prowse, a piano manufacturer, music publisher and booking agent. As a teenager, she had participated in amateur theatricals with Carte. They married in 1870 and had two sons, Lucas (1872–1907) and Rupert. Blanche died of pneumonia in 1885, and in 1888, Carte married his assistant, Helen. Their wedding {{took place in the}} Savoy Chapel, with Arthur Sullivan as the best man. Rupert received training in <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> firm and then became his father's assistant in 1894. Lucas, who was not involved in the family businesses, became a barrister. He was appointed Private Secretary to Lord Chief Justice Charles Russell in 1899 in connection with the Venezuelan boundary arbitration in Paris. There he contracted tuberculosis and later died of that disease at the age of 34.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> teacher arrives, believing demonstrations {{are being}} held to {{determine}} which class will be cut, much to the anger of Ron. He gives a very boring accounting lecture, which puts Justin to sleep. The next day, Leslie is before the Pawnee Disciplinary Committee on charges of abuse of power. Leslie calls Justin as a witness and questions him {{as to whether he}} enjoyed the party, to which he answers an emphatic yes. Afterward, the committee rules no further action will be taken, mainly because Leslie turned herself in and paid $1,000 restitution to the recreation center so no classes would be cut. When Ann asks why she did it, Leslie said it was to get an honest answer from Justin about the date, under penalty of perjury. The episode ends with Justin encouraging Tom to ask Wendy out.|$|E

5|$|The name euro {{was officially}} adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid. The euro was {{introduced}} to world financial markets as <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> currency on 1 January 1999, replacing the former European Currency Unit (ECU) {{at a ratio of}} 1:1 (US$1.1743). Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002, making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members, and by May 2002 had completely replaced the former currencies. While the euro dropped subsequently to US$0.8252 within two years (26 October 2000), it has traded above the U.S. dollar since the end of 2002, peaking at US$1.6038 on 18 July 2008. Since late 2009, the euro has been immersed in the European sovereign-debt crisis which has {{led to the creation of}} the European Financial Stability Facility as well as other reforms aimed at stabilising the currency. In July 2012, the euro fell below US$1.21 for the first time in two years, following concerns raised over Greek debt and Spain's troubled banking sector. As of October 2017, the euro–dollar exchange rate stands at ~US$1.18.|$|E
5|$|With few ties in Britain, {{he decided}} to emigrate to Canada, {{arriving}} in Nova Scotia in 1907, where he gained work {{on a farm in}} Saskatchewan. From 1909 to 1911 he worked at a confectioner's warehouse, and then for a further nine months at a logging camp, before gaining a job as <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> clerk at the British Columbia Electric Railway in April 1912. He had come to loath Christianity and the Victorian moral systems that he associated with it; instead he began reading about Eastern religion, yoga, and Western esotericism. While at work, he met Charles Stansfeld Jones, a Thelemite who shared Smith's interest in these subjects and who lent him copies of Aleister Crowley's Book 4 and volume one, number one of The Equinox. Intrigued, Smith paid to join Crowley's Britain-based magical order, the A∴A∴, in doing so obtaining more of Crowley's writings. He began performing many of the practices encouraged by the group, including yoga and the keeping of a diary recording his magical endeavours.|$|E
5|$|The Pipe rolls are {{the records}} of the audits of the sheriffs' accounts, usually {{conducted}} at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury. Until the chancery records began in the reign of King John of England, they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government. They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered. Although the rolls use <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> system, it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance {{until the end of the}} 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in installments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt. If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed. Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.|$|E
