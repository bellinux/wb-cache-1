5000|$|Also in 2014, Kevin Kamenetz {{proposed}} a controversial plan for shifting IT positions within the BCPL system.

Ultimately, Rob Stradling, head of the County's OIT admitted that library officials were not fully informed, saying [...] "communication was probably not as good as it should've been," [...] while he added that procedures would be put in place in the future to make sure such mis-communication did not occur. In lighter news, Paula Miller, formerly the head of the Pikes Peak Library District in El Paso County, Colorado, was chosen as the new administrator of the BCPL library system. Not only was she [...] "the first woman to serve in that role" [...] but she was the fourth director of the system since 1948.|$|R

5000|$|On September 8, 2002, Michael R. Gordon and Judith Miller {{published}} {{a story in}} the New York Times titled [...] "U.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest for A-Bomb Parts":In the last 14 months, Iraq has sought to buy thousands of specially designed aluminum tubes, which American officials believe were intended as components of centrifuges to enrich uranium. American officials said several efforts to arrange the shipment of the aluminum tubes were blocked or intercepted but declined to say, citing the sensitivity of the intelligence, where they came from or how they were stopped. The diameter, thickness and other technical specifications of the aluminum tubes had persuaded American intelligence experts that they were meant for Iraq's nuclear program, officials said, and that the latest attempt to ship the material had taken place in recent months. The attempted purchases are not the only signs of a renewed Iraqi interest in acquiring nuclear arms. President Hussein has met repeatedly in recent months with Iraq's top nuclear scientists and, according to American intelligence, praised their efforts as part of his campaign against the West....Bush <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> the quest for thousands of high-strength aluminum tubes is one of several signs that Mr. Hussein is seeking to revamp and accelerate Iraq's nuclear weapons program. Officials say the aluminum tubes were intended as casing for rotors in centrifuges, which are one means of producing highly enriched uranium. The Washington Times reported in July that Iraq sought to acquire stainless steel for centrifuges on one occasion. Officials say that the material sought was special aluminum tubes and that Iraq sought to acquire it over 14 months.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} senior <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> have {{on political}} decisions at the municipal level in Denmark {{is the focus}} for this paper. The study is based on research on how three different dimensions - paradigms, the effects of governmental regulations {{and the relationship between}} senior <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> and politicians – affect the role and job of the senior <b>administration</b> <b>official.</b> The project concludes that three paradigms, Traditional Bureaucracy, New Public Management (NPM) and New Public Governance (NPG) is present and affects the municipal level but that the emergence of NPM and later NPG has increased the “zone” in which senior <b>administration</b> <b>officials</b> and politicians both act. This has resulted in a bigger influence on the political level for the senior <b>administration</b> <b>official.</b> Furthermore, it’s concluded that the governmental regulations have more of an effect on the politicians than the senior administration official; however, if any effect it’s to the benefit of the senior <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> in the dialog with the politician. Lastly, it’s concluded that the politician appears more dependent on the senior <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> than the reverse. In addition, any possibility of influence the senior <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> may have on political decisions is mostly related {{to the way in which}} the senior <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> recommends the decisions, and therefore, as an indirect power. Despite this fact, the senior <b>administration</b> <b>official</b> seemingly attempts to recommend decisions in a way they believe corresponds to the wishes of the politicians. There are also indications, in some cases, that the official’s personal beliefs do play a role when recommending decisions. This indicates that the official do have significant influence on political decisions...|$|R
