For example, enzymes called ADP-ribosyltransferases add the <b>ADP-ribose</b> moiety of this molecule to proteins, in a posttranslational modification called ADP-ribosylation. ADP-ribosylation involves either {{the addition of}} a single <b>ADP-ribose</b> moiety, in mono-ADP-ribosylation, or the transferral of <b>ADP-ribose</b> to proteins in long branched chains, which is called poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Mono-ADP-ribosylation was first identified as the mechanism of a group of bacterial toxins, notably cholera toxin, but it is also involved in normal cell signaling.

In addition to these functions within the cell, a group of extracellular ADP-ribosyltransferases has recently been discovered, but their functions remain obscure.|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. It {{acts as a}} coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of <b>ADP-ribose</b> moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic <b>ADP-ribose,</b> as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E
5|$|The non-redox {{roles of}} NAD(P) are a recent discovery. The {{first of these}} {{functions}} to be identified {{was the use of}} NAD as the <b>ADP-ribose</b> donor in ADP-ribosylation reactions, observed in the early 1960s. Later studies in the 1980s and 1990s revealed the activities of NAD and NADP metabolites in cell signaling– such as the action of cyclic <b>ADP-ribose,</b> which was discovered in 1987. The metabolism of NAD has remained an area of intense research into the 21st century, with interest being heightened after the discovery of the NAD-dependent protein deacetylases called sirtuins in 2000, by Shin-ichiro Imai and coworkers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.|$|E
5|$|Another {{function}} of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic <b>ADP-ribose,</b> which is produced from NAD by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, {{as part of}} a second messenger system. This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. It does this by binding to and opening a class of calcium channels called ryanodine receptors, which are located in the membranes of organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{consumed}} by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2. These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the <b>ADP-ribose</b> moiety of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly {{seem to be}} involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation of aging.|$|E
25|$|Fragment A {{inhibits}} {{the synthesis}} of new proteins in the affected cell by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor EF-2—a protein that {{is essential to the}} translation step of protein synthesis. This ADP-ribosylation involves the transfer of an <b>ADP-ribose</b> from NAD+ to a diphthamide (a modified histidine) residue within the EF-2 protein. Since EF-2 is needed for the moving of tRNA from the A-site to the P-site of the ribosome during protein translation, ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 prevents protein synthesis.|$|E
500|$|Chromatin {{relaxation}} occurs rapidly at {{the site}} of a DNA damage. [...] In one of the earliest steps, the stress-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylates SIRT6 on serine 10 in response to double-strand breaks or other DNA damage. [...] This post-translational modification facilitates the mobilization of SIRT6 to DNA damage sites, and is required for efficient recruitment of poly (<b>ADP-ribose)</b> polymerase 1 (PARP1) to DNA break sites and for efficient repair of DSBs. [...] PARP1 protein starts to appear at DNA damage sites in less than a second, with half maximum accumulation within 1.6 seconds after the damage occurs. [...] PARP1 synthesizes polymeric adenosine diphosphate ribose (poly (<b>ADP-ribose)</b> or PAR) chains on itself. [...] Next the chromatin remodeler ALC1 quickly attaches to the product of PARP1 action, a poly-ADP ribose chain, and ALC1 completes arrival at the DNA damage within 10 seconds of the occurrence of the damage. [...] About half of the maximum chromatin relaxation, presumably due to action of ALC1, occurs by 10 seconds. This then allows recruitment of the DNA repair enzyme MRE11, to initiate DNA repair, within 13 seconds.|$|E

[...] In further steps, Poly (<b>ADP-ribose)</b> polymerase 1 (PARP1) is required and may be an early step in MMEJ. [...] There is pairing of microhomology regions followed by recruitment of flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 (FEN1) to remove overhanging flaps. [...] This is followed by recruitment of XRCC1–LIG3 to the site for ligating the DNA ends, leading to an intact DNA. MMEJ is always accompanied by a deletion, so that MMEJ is a mutagenic pathway for DNA repair.|$|E

[...] The lymphocytic cells of centenarians have characteristics typical of cells from young people, both in their capability of priming the mechanism of repair after H2O2 sublethal oxidative DNA damage and in their PARP capacity.|$|E
2500|$|The A subunit of an AB5 toxin is {{the portion}} {{responsible}} for catalysis of specific targets. For Shiga toxin family, the A subunit hosts a Trypsin-sensitive region which gives out two fragmented domains when cleaved. This region {{has not been}} confirmed for the other AB5 toxin families as yet. In general, the two domains of the A subunit, [...] named A1 and A2, are linked by a disulfide bond. Domain A1 (approximately 22kDa in cholera toxin or heat labile enterotoxins) {{is the part of}} the toxin responsible for its toxic effects. Domain A2 (approximately 5kDa in cholera toxin or heat labile enterotoxin) provides a non-covalent linkage to the B subunit through the B subunit's central pore. The A1 chain for cholera toxin catalyzes the transfer of <b>ADP-ribose</b> from Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(NAD) to arginine or other guanidine compounds by utilizing ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). In the absence of arginine or simple guanidino compounds, the toxin mediated NAD+ nucleosidase (NADase) activity proceeds using water as a nucleophile.|$|E

50|$|Other {{common names}} for <b>ADP-ribose</b> diphosphatase include <b>ADP-ribose</b> pyrophosphatase and ADPRase. <b>ADP-ribose</b> is {{commonly}} referred to as ADPR.|$|E
5000|$|<b>ADP-ribose</b> is an {{intermediate}} that is produced during the metabolism of NAD+, mono- or poly-unsaturated proteins, and cyclic-ADP ribose. <b>ADP-ribose</b> is a protein-glycating agent, and excess levels of <b>ADP-ribose</b> {{in the cell}} can cause non-enzymatic ADP-ribosylation. Non-enzymatic ADP-ribosylation can inactivate protein targets that contain nucleotide-binding sites when the adenylate moiety of <b>ADP-ribose</b> binds to them, and it can also interfere with metabolic regulation that occurs via enzymatic ADP-ribosylation. [...] For example, actin polymerization is inhibited by non-enzymatic ADP-ribosylation at a Cys residue. Thus, {{it is believed that}} ADPRase functions in general as a house-cleaning enzyme to eliminate potentially deleterious <b>ADP-ribose</b> from the cell.|$|E

50|$|The first {{suggestion}} of ADP-ribosylation surfaced {{during the early}} 1960s. At this time, Pierre Chambon and coworkers observed the incorporation of ATP into hen liver nuclei extract.

Several years later, the enzymes responsible for this incorporation were identified and given the name poly (<b>ADP-ribose)</b> polymerase.
