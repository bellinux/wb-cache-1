40|$|Immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs) {{form part}} of the middle {{molecule}} group of uremic toxins. Accumulation of FLCs has been observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim {{of the present study}} was to measure FLC levels in patients at different CKD stages and to assess putative associations between FLC levels on one hand and biochemical/clinical parameters and mortality on the other. One hundred and forty patients at CKD stages 2 - 5 D were included in the present study. Routine clinical biochemistry assays and assays for FLC kappa () and lambda () and other uremic toxins were performed. Vascular calcification was evaluated using radiological techniques. The enrolled patients were prospectively monitored for mortality. Free light chain <b>and</b> <b>levels</b> were found to be elevated in CKD patients (especially in those on hemodialysis). Furthermore, FLC <b>and</b> <b>levels</b> were positively correlated with inflammation, aortic calcification <b>and</b> the <b>levels</b> of various uremic toxins levels. A multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that FLC <b>and</b> <b>levels</b> were independently associated with CKD stages <b>and</b> 2 microglobulin <b>levels.</b> Elevated FLC <b>and</b> <b>levels</b> appeared to be associated with mortality. However, this association disappeared after adjustment for a propensity score including age, CKD stage and aortic calcification. In conclusion, our results indicate that FLC <b>and</b> <b>levels</b> are elevated in CKD patients and are associated with inflammation, vascular calcification <b>and</b> <b>levels</b> of other uremic toxins. The observed link between elevated FLC <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> mortality appears to depend on other well-known factors...|$|R
