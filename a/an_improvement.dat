The team scored 255 points, conceding 25. Warner considered the team <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> because its defense was more dominant than the previous year's.

Among the changes from the CFM56-5A is the option of a double-annular combustor that reduces emissions (particularly NOx), a new fan in a longer fan case, and a new low-pressure compressor with a fourth stage (up from three in earlier variants). It is the most numerous engine supplied to Airbus.|$|E
