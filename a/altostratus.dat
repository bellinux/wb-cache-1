5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as <b>altostratus</b> or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and <b>altostratus.</b> The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
25|$|Cirrostratus {{is a thin}} non-convective {{stratiform}} ice crystal veil {{that typically}} gives rise to halos caused by refraction of the sun's rays. The sun and moon are visible in clear outline.Cirrostratus often thickens into <b>altostratus</b> ahead of a warm front or low-pressure area.|$|E
25|$|One {{group of}} {{supplementary}} features are not actual cloud formations, but precipitation that falls when water droplets or ice crystals {{that make up}} visible clouds have grown too heavy to remain aloft. Virga is a feature seen with clouds producing precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground, these being of the genera cirrocumulus, altocumulus, <b>altostratus,</b> nimbostratus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus.|$|E
25|$|The mamma feature {{forms on}} {{the bases of}} clouds as downward-facing bubble-like protuberances caused by {{localized}} downdrafts within the cloud. It is also sometimes called mammatus, {{an earlier version of}} the term used before a standardization of Latin nomenclature brought about by the World Meterorological Organization during the 20th century. The best-known is cumulonimbus with mammatus, but the mamma feature is also seen occasionally with cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, <b>altostratus,</b> and stratocumulus.|$|E
25|$|This is a mid-level stratocumuliform {{cloud layer}} of limited {{convection}} {{that is usually}} appears {{in the form of}} irregular patches or more extensive sheets arranges in groups, lines, or waves. Altocumulus near the top of its range may resemble cirrocumulus but is usually thicker and composed of water droplets so that the bases show at least some light-grey shading. Opaque altocumulus associated with a weak frontal or low-pressure disturbance can produce virga, very light intermittent precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground. If the altocumulus is mixed with moisture-laden <b>altostratus,</b> the precipitation may reach the ground.|$|E
25|$|When the {{precipitation}} {{reaches the}} ground without completely evaporating, it is {{designated as the}} feature praecipitatio. This normally occurs with <b>altostratus</b> opacus, which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation, and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development. Of the latter, upward-growing cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers, while downward growing nimbostratus is capable of heavier, more extensive precipitation. Towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events, but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts. Showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds. Cumulonimbus, the largest of all cloud genera, {{has the capacity to}} produce very heavy showers. Low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation, but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this cloud genus lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of virga.|$|E
500|$|Cirrostratus clouds {{can appear}} as a milky sheen in the sky or as a {{striated}} sheet. They are sometimes similar to <b>altostratus</b> and are distinguishable from the latter because the sun or moon is always clearly visible through transparent cirrostratus, in contrast to <b>altostratus</b> which tends to be opaque or translucent. Cirrostratus come in two species, fibratus and nebulosus. The ice crystals in these clouds vary depending upon the height in the cloud. Towards the bottom, at temperatures of around [...] to , the crystals tend to be long, solid, hexagonal columns. Towards {{the top of the}} cloud, at temperatures of around [...] to , the predominant crystal types are thick, hexagonal plates and short, solid, hexagonal columns. These clouds commonly produce halos, and sometimes the halo is the only indication that such clouds are present. They are formed by warm, moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude. When a warm front approaches, cirrostratus clouds become thicker and descend forming <b>altostratus</b> clouds, and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later.|$|E
500|$|In the {{intermediate}} range, from [...] to [...] in temperate regions, are the mid-étage clouds. They comprise {{two or three}} genera depending on the system of height classification being used: <b>altostratus,</b> altocumulus, and, according to WMO classification, nimbostratus. These clouds are formed from ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, or liquid water droplets.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} main genera {{in the family}} of high clouds: cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus. Cirrostratus clouds {{commonly}} produce halos because they are composed almost entirely of ice crystals. Cirrocumulus and cirrostratus are sometimes informally referred to as [...] "cirriform clouds" [...] because of their frequent association with cirrus. They are given the prefix [...] "cirro-", but this refers more to their altitude range than their physical structure. Cirrocumulus in its pure form is actually a high cumuliform genus, and cirrostratus is stratiform, like <b>altostratus</b> and lower based sheet clouds.|$|E
500|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} a genus of free-convective low-étage cloud {{along with the}} related limited-convective {{cumuliform}} or stratocumuliform cloud stratocumulus. These clouds form from ground level to [...] at all latitudes. Stratus clouds are also low-étage. In the middle étage are the alto clouds, which consist of the limiited-convective cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud altocumulus and the stratiform cloud <b>altostratus.</b> Middle-étage clouds form from [...] to [...] in polar areas, [...] in temperate areas, and [...] in tropical areas. The high-étage clouds are all cirriform, one of which, cirrocumulus, is also cumuliform of limited convection or stratocumuliform. The other clouds in this étage are cirrus and cirrostratus. High-étage clouds form [...] in high latitudes, [...] in temperate latitudes, and [...] in low, tropical latitudes. Cumulonimbus clouds, like cumulus congestus, extend vertically rather than remaining confined to one étage.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Altostratus</b> is a mid-level opaque or {{translucent}} non-convective veil of grey/blue-grey {{cloud that}} often forms along warm fronts and around low-pressure areas. [...] <b>Altostratus</b> is usually composed of water droplets {{but may be}} mixed with ice crystals at higher altitudes. Widespread opaque <b>altostratus</b> can produce light continuous or intermittent precipitation. Precipitation commonly becomes heavier and more widespread if it thickens into nimbostratus.|$|E
2500|$|The weather {{conditions}} {{at the time of}} the accident were [...] "dark night due to 7/8 (broken) stratocumulus at [...] and to 8/8 coverage (overcast) by <b>altostratus</b> at [...]" [...] According to the Brazilian Air Ministry, the {{weather conditions}} did not contribute to the accident.|$|E
2500|$|Non-convective {{stratiform}} clouds {{appear in}} stable airmass conditions and, in general, have flat sheet-like structures that can form at any altitude in the troposphere. [...] Very low stratiform cloud results when advection fog is lifted above surface level during breezy conditions. [...] The stratiform group is divided by altitude range into the genera cirrostratus (high-level), <b>altostratus</b> (mid-level), stratus (low-level), and nimbostratus (multi-level).|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{stratiform}} group, high-level cirrostratus comprises two species. [...] Cirrostratus nebulosus has {{a rather}} diffuse appearance lacking in structural detail. [...] Cirrostratus fibratus is a species made of semi-merged filaments that are transitional {{to or from}} cirrus. Mid-level <b>altostratus</b> and multi-level nimbostratus always have a flat or diffuse appearance and are therefore not subdivided into species. Low stratus is of the species nebulosus except when broken up into ragged sheets of stratus fractus (see below).|$|E
2500|$|This genus type is a stratocumuliform {{cloud layer}} of limited convection, {{usually in the}} form of {{irregular}} patches or more extensive sheets similar to altocumulus but having larger elements with deeper-gray shading. [...] Opaque stratocumulus can produce very light intermittent precipitation. This cloud often forms under a precipitating deck of <b>altostratus</b> or high-based nimbostratus associated with a well-developed warm front, slow-moving cold front, or low-pressure area. This can create the illusion of continuous precipitation of more than very light intensity falling from stratocumulus.|$|E
2500|$|Non-vertical {{clouds in}} the middle level are prefixed by alto-, {{yielding}} the genus names altocumulus (Ac) and <b>altostratus</b> (As). These clouds can form as low as [...] above surface at any latitude, but may be based as high as [...] near the poles, [...] at mid latitudes, and [...] in the tropics. [...] As with high clouds, {{it is not possible}} to distinguish between individual forms or genera using satellite photography alone. [...] Without the support of human observations, these clouds are usually collectively identified as middle-type on satellite images.|$|E
2500|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. [...] The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with <b>altostratus.</b> [...] It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. [...] It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.|$|E
2500|$|All cloud {{varieties}} {{fall into}} one of two main groups. [...] One group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level cloud structures and comprises the varieties translucidus (thin translucent), perlucidus (thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks), and opacus (thick opaque). [...] These varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity. [...] All three are associated with the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus. [...] However, only two varieties are seen with <b>altostratus</b> and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a perlucidus variety. [...] Opacity-based varieties are not applied to high clouds because they are always translucent, {{or in the case of}} cirrus spissatus, always opaque. [...] Similarly, these varieties are also not associated with moderate and towering vertical clouds because they are always opaque.|$|E
2500|$|A {{second group}} {{describes}} the occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface-based observer (cloud fields usually being visible {{only from a}} significant altitude above the formations). These varieties are not always present with the genera and species {{with which they are}} otherwise associated, but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation. Intortus and vertebratus varieties occur on occasion with cirrus fibratus. [...] They are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes, and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns, usually by uneven wind currents that favor the formation of these varieties. [...] The variety radiatus is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at the horizon. [...] It is sometimes seen with the fibratus and uncinus species of cirrus, the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus, the mediocris and sometimes humilis species of cumulus, and with the genus <b>altostratus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|This is a diffuse dark-grey non-convective {{stratiform}} layer {{with great}} horizontal extent and moderate to deep vertical development. [...] It lacks towering structure and looks feebly illuminated from the inside. Nimbostratus normally forms from mid-level <b>altostratus,</b> and develops at least moderate vertical extent when the base subsides into {{the low level}} during precipitation that can reach moderate to heavy intensity. [...] It commonly achieves deep vertical development when it simultaneously grows upward into the high level due to large scale frontal or cyclonic lift. [...] The nimbo- prefix refers to its ability to produce continuous rain or snow over a wide area, especially ahead of a warm front. This thick cloud layer may be accompanied by embedded towering cumuliform or cumulonimbiform types. [...] Meteorologists affiliated with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) officially classify nimbostratus as mid-level for synoptic purposes while informally characterizing it as multi-level. [...] Independent meteorologists and educators appear split between those who largely follow the WMO model and those who classify nimbostratus as low-level, despite its considerable vertical extent and its usual initial formation in the middle altitude range.|$|E

50|$|Genitus mother clouds: <b>Altostratus</b> altocumulogenitus forms {{due to the}} fusing of {{altocumulus}} elements. <b>Altostratus</b> cumulonimbogenitus {{results from}} the spreading of the middle part of a cumulonimbus cloud.|$|E
50|$|<b>Altostratus</b> is a mid-level opaque or {{translucent}} non-convective veil of grey/blue-grey {{cloud that}} often forms along warm fronts and around low-pressure areas. <b>Altostratus</b> is usually composed of water droplets {{but may be}} mixed with ice crystals at higher altitudes. Widespread opaque <b>altostratus</b> can produce light continuous or intermittent precipitation. Precipitation commonly becomes heavier and more widespread if it thickens into nimbostratus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Altostratus</b> {{tends to}} form {{ahead of a}} warm or {{occluded}} front, the <b>altostratus</b> gradually thickening into rain bearing nimbostratus. However it can also occur together with cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus at a cold front.|$|E
50|$|Mutatus mother clouds: Cirrostratus can thicken into <b>altostratus</b> cirrostratomutatus, usually {{ahead of}} an {{approaching}} disturbance. Nimbostratus associated with an organized weather system may lift and change into to <b>altostratus</b> nimbostratomutatus, especially if the disturbance is weakening or moving out of a particular area.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Altostratus</b> {{translucidus}} with cumulus humilis below ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Altostratus</b> {{is formed}} by the lifting of a large mostly stable air mass that causes {{invisible}} water vapor to condense into cloud. It can produce light precipitation, often {{in the form of}} virga. If the precipitation increases in persistence and intensity, the <b>altostratus</b> cloud may thicken into nimbostratus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Altostratus</b> is {{a middle}} {{altitude}} cloud genus {{belonging to the}} stratiform physical category characterized by a generally uniform gray to bluish-green and sheet or layer. It is lighter in color than nimbostratus and darker than high cirrostratus. The sun can be seen through thin <b>altostratus,</b> but thicker layers can be quite opaque.|$|E
50|$|Nimbostratus occurs along a {{warm front}} or {{occluded}} front where the slowly rising warm air mass creates nimbostratus along with shallower stratus clouds producing less rain, these clouds being preceded by higher-level clouds such as cirrostratus and <b>altostratus.</b> Often, when an <b>altostratus</b> cloud thickens and descends into lower altitudes, {{it will become}} nimbostratus.|$|E
50|$|For mid-level {{altocumulus}} and <b>altostratus,</b> {{the range}} is 0 to -20 °C.|$|E
50|$|Pattern-based varieties: Radiatus, duplicatus, and {{undulatus}} are all occasionally {{associated with}} <b>altostratus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Accessory cloud: Pannus {{forming in}} {{precipitation}} is sometimes seen with <b>altostratus</b> and is coded CL7.|$|E
50|$|Mutatus mother clouds: Nimbostratus {{can form}} {{due to the}} {{complete}} transformation of altocumulus, <b>altostratus</b> and stratocumulus.|$|E
50|$|Precipitation-based {{supplementary}} features: <b>Altostratus</b> opacus can be {{thick enough}} to produce both virga or praecipitatio features.|$|E
