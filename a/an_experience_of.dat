5|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown higher rates of same sex {{attraction}} in intersex people, with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, thus research on intersex subjects {{has been used to}} explore means of preventing homosexuality. As <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> being born with sex characteristics that do not fit social norms, intersex can be distinguished from transgender, while some intersex people are both intersex and transgender.|$|E
5|$|Abuse during {{childhood}} is {{accepted as a}} primary social factor increasing the incidence of self-harm, as is bereavement, and troubled parental or partner relationships. Factors such as war, poverty, and unemployment may also contribute. Self-harm is frequently described as <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> depersonalisation or a dissociative state. As many as 70% of individuals with borderline personality disorder engage in self-harm. An estimated 30% of individuals with autism spectrum disorders engage in self-harm at some point, including eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting, and head-banging.|$|E
5|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Bart exit the Magic Palace's gift shop, only {{to end up in}} another gift shop. The scene was based on <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order to exit the Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, had to pass through a gift shop. The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result {{completed}} late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom scene, but they were stuck {{trying to come up with}} an ending after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided that the trial was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing scene that closed the episode.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} uses {{dance and}} film {{to investigate the}} creation and conveyance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kinesthetic <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> place. The choreographer, dancers, and videographer {{participating in the study}} aimed to create <b>a</b> kinesthetic <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> place by engaging the senses in <b>a</b> sensory <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> place and exploring the different feeling states of place. The study utilized choreographic methodologies of site-specific dance and screendance to facilitate a creative process rehearsed, performed, and filmed in the Oregon Dunes National Recreation area at Eel Creek. The footage from this choreographic process was edited into a screendance intended to convey <b>a</b> kinesthetic <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> place to viewers. The pilot study, At Eel Creek, and the final screendance, ensō, can be viewed through supplemental files included with this document. The evaluation of the study has resulted in key discoveries into the components necessary for the creation and conveyance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kinesthetic <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> place...|$|R

5|$|Sultan Iskandar is {{reputed to}} have been a staunch disciplinarian, with {{willingness}} to occasionally voice personal opinions on governmental issues. On the personal side, subjects who have personally approached the Sultan in his later years described him as a person with a warm and generous personality. However, past critics had also argued that Sultan Iskandar was a person with a turbulent temper. These claims were made by citing records of past notorious incidents, which include <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> being disinherited from being the Tunku Mahkota of Johor (or Crown Prince in English) by his father, in 1961, as well as a series of alleged criminal acts occurring between the 1970s and the 1990s which were published in the press and provoked widespread moral outrage within the Malaysian public.|$|E
5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily {{interview with the}} director. The process begins with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E
5|$|Development of the PlayStation Vita port began {{shortly before}} the start of the game's service in 2014. The team formed a {{partnership}} with Sony to develop the title, but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the same quality as the mobile version, along with adjusting the controls from touch-based to the button and joystick controls of the Vita. There was also some resistance from staff surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face of suggestions that it would be better to make a completely new game. When the project was proposed to Sony, the Unity technology built into the Vita was fairly new and did not make full use of the platform's processing power. In addition, the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita. The team needed cooperation from both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform. By the time of the Vita version's announcement, only the preliminary development work had been completed, but development was proceeding according to plan. Technical troubles related to the game's performance persisted beyond this point, resulting in the release being delayed into the following year.|$|E

25|$|R. C. Zaehner distinguishes three {{fundamental}} {{types of}} mysticism, namely theistic, monistic and panenhenic ("all-in-one") or natural mysticism. The theistic category includes most forms of Jewish, Christian and Islamic mysticism and occasional Hindu examples such as Ramanuja and the Bhagavad Gita. The monistic type, {{which according to}} Zaehner is based upon <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the unity of one's soul, includes Buddhism and Hindu schools such as Samhya and Advaita vedanta. Nature mysticism seems to refer to examples that do not fit {{into one of these}} two categories.|$|E

25|$|Peace of mind, serenity, and calmness are {{descriptions}} of a disposition {{free from the}} effects of stress. In some meditative traditions, inner peace is believed to be a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various types of meditation, prayer, t'ai chi ch'uan (太极拳, tàijíquán), yoga, or other various types of mental or physical disciplines. Many such practices refer to this peace as <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> knowing oneself. An emphasis on finding one's inner peace is often associated with traditions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and some traditional Christian contemplative practices such as monasticism, {{as well as with the}} New Age movement.|$|E

25|$|Ignatius of Loyola (1491–1556): St. Ignatius had {{a number}} of mystical {{experiences}} in his life, the most significant was <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> enlightenment by the river Cardoner, in which, he later stated, he learnt more in that one occasion than he did in the rest of his life. Another significant mystical experience was in 1537, at a chapel in La Storta, outside Rome, in which he saw God the Father place him with the Son, who was carrying the Cross. This was after he had spent a year praying to Mary for her to place him with her Son (Jesus), {{and was one of the}} reasons why he insisted that the group that followed his 'way of proceeding' be called the Society of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|The same {{situation}} is in evidence in everyday life, however, whenever attention is fixated {{with a question}} or <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the amazing, the unusual, or anything that holds a person's interest.

Their eyes may actually close, their bodies tend to become immobile (a form of catalepsy), certain reflexes (e.g., swallowing, respiration, etc.) may be suppressed, and they seem momentarily oblivious to their surroundings until they have completed their inner search on the unconscious level for the new idea, response, or frames of reference that will restabilize their general reality orientation. We hypothesize that in everyday life consciousness is in a continual state of flux between the general reality orientation and the momentary microdynamics of trance...|$|E
25|$|The Encyclopedia was {{the fruit}} of a {{continuing}} processing of documents gathered {{from many of the}} thousands of the international organizations profiled in the Yearbook of International Organizations. Many such bodies regularly produce a wide range of material on the areas of their concern, many regularly send documents to the UIA, and many, when requested more specifically, supplied documents for the Encyclopedia. The following organizations provided documents in the greatest quantity: FAO, ILO, UNICEF, UNESCO, UNCTD, WHO, Commonwealth Secretariat, Council of Europe, OECD, World Bank group. Furthermore, the United Nations Library in Geneva facilitated access to other material over two decades. The Institute of Cultural Affairs International was contractually associated at one point to the edition and other aspects of the Encyclopedia project. The Goals, Processes and Indicators of Development project (led by Johan Galtung) of the United Nations University, in which Anthony Judge participated on behalf of the UIA between 1978 and 1982, was <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> learning and research that {{had a significant impact on}} the editorial content of the Encyclopedia. Another noticeable influence came from futures studies, with which Judge has long been associated. He reports in Encyclopedia Illusions how the narrow focus of the Club of Rome on a few socio-economic aspects of futures research prompted the much vaster exploration concerning world problems and human potential.|$|E
