5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet <b>apart,</b> <b>at</b> each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{flattened}} {{in general}} shape. The front part {{is short and}} broad. The broad interorbital region (located between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped, with squared edges and weakly developed beading. A postorbital ridge is present, obscuring the suture (joint) between the frontal and squamosal bones, a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The interparietal bone is wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> the back and converge toward the front. The jugal bone is small.|$|E

5|$|The lithosphere, which rides {{atop the}} asthenosphere, {{is divided into}} a number of tectonic plates that are {{continuously}} being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. Oceanic crust and tectonic plates are formed and move <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> mid-ocean ridges. Abyssal hills are formed by stretching of the oceanic lithosphere. Consumption or destruction of the oceanic lithosphere occurs at oceanic trenches (a type of convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary) by a process known as subduction. Oceanic trenches are found at places where the oceanic lithospheric slabs of two different plates meet, and the denser (older) slab begins to descend back into the mantle. At the consumption edge of the plate (the oceanic trench), the oceanic lithosphere has thermally contracted to become quite dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction. The subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere, so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old. The overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the Supercontinent cycle, first proposed by Canadian geophysicist and geologist John Tuzo Wilson.|$|E
5|$|The proto-Scotland landmass moved northwards, {{and from}} 460–430 Ma, sandstone, {{mudstone}} and limestone were {{deposited in the}} area that is now the Midland Valley. This occurred in shallow tropical seas at the margins of the Iapetus Ocean. The Ballantrae Complex near Girvan was formed from this ocean floor and is similar in composition to rocks found at The Lizard in Cornwall. Nonetheless, northern and southern Britain were far <b>apart</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of this period, although the gap began to close as the continent of Avalonia broke away from Gondwana, collided with Baltica and drifted towards Laurentia. The Caledonian orogeny began forming a mountain chain from Norway to the Appalachians. There was an ice age in the southern hemisphere, and the first mass extinction of life on Earth took place {{at the end of this}} period.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey façade to Viaduct Road is E-shaped and regular, with a {{symmetrical}} seven-bay plan. The {{first and}} seventh bays project further forward than the centre (fourth) bay, which is formed by an elevated entrance porch. This has lancet {{windows on the}} sides, grouped under single hood moulds and with a string course. The doorway is under a segmental arch which is topped by a gable. The rest of the ground floor has larger lancets arranged in pairs and with a small trefoil above. The south-facing walls have two pairs together, while on the inward-facing walls {{of the first and}} seventh bays there are two sets of paired windows placed some distance <b>apart.</b> <b>At</b> first-floor level, similar paired lancets and trefoils rise as gabled dormers above the roofline. The south walls of the first and seventh bays have prominent five-light oriel windows, canted to form a 1–3–1 pattern of trefoil-headed panes. These oriel windows are supported on ornate corbels. Above these at first-floor level, and also above the entrance porch, there are three-light trefoil-headed windows set under a segmental arch-shaped hood mould. Many of the windows on the south side have plate tracery.|$|E

25|$|Alkenes are {{produced}} by hydrocarbon cracking.

The mixture is feedstock and temperature dependent, and separated by fractional distillation. This is mainly used for the manufacture of small alkenes (up to six carbons).|$|E
