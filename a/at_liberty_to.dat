5|$|Eyre {{returned}} to Britain, arriving at Spithead on 10 December 1826, and was almost immediately offered command of a squadron fitting out for Lisbon. The changes in climate had brought on {{an attack of}} gout, and on being informed that as Sir Thomas Hardy's squadron {{was already on the}} spot, he was <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> refuse the offer. Eyre did so, and retired ashore. He appears to have had no further commands, and was advanced to vice-admiral in 1830. He had married Georgiana Cooke, the daughter of Sir George Cooke, 7th Baronet, at Doncaster on 1 November 1800, with whom he had a family of eight children, including two sons named George-Hardolf and William. Sir George Eyre died on 15 February 1839 at the rectory, Carlton, Derbyshire.|$|E

25|$|Based on {{the fact}} that Category Three {{officials}} represented by both the SRFA and the Scottish Association of Referees (SAR) had not been represented at the strike meeting, the SSFRA informed them on 23 November that as far as they were concerned, they were <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> choose whether or not they accepted appointments for the weekend.|$|E
25|$|Estonian Scouting was {{not broken}} by the {{liquidation}} of their organizations by the Soviet occupational authorities in 1940; nor was it crushed by the following German occupation of 1941-1944.

25|$|Two {{months after}} the law began to operate, Congress {{resolved}} that the chief of any bureau of the navy department should be <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> reject the offers {{of those who had}} failed as principals or sureties on previous contracts to furnish naval supplies. In those made with the same bureau, one contractor could not be received as surety for another; every contract should require the delivery of a specified quantity, and no bids having nominal or fictitious prices could be considered.|$|E

25|$|Working with non-disabled {{children}} in the Casa dei Bambini in 1907, Montessori began to develop her own pedagogy. The essential elements of her educational theory emerged from this work, described in The Montessori Method in 1912 and in The Discovery of the Child in 1948. Her method was founded on the observation of children <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> act freely in an environment prepared to meet their needs. Montessori {{came to the conclusion}} that the children's spontaneous activity in this environment revealed an internal program of development, and that the appropriate role of the educator was to remove obstacles to this natural development and provide opportunities for it to proceed and flourish.|$|E
25|$|In this fourth Edition I {{have made}} no {{alterations}} of any kind. I now, however, find myself <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge my very great obligations to Mr. HENRY HOP of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E
25|$|According to verse 4:32 of Islam's sacred text, {{both men}} and women have an {{independent}} economic position: 'For men is a portion of what they earn, and for women is a portion of what they earn. Ask God for His grace. God has knowledge of all things.' Women therefore are <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> buy, sell, mortgage, lease, borrow or lend, and sign contracts and legal documents. Additionally, women can donate money, act as trustees and set up a business or company. These rights cannot be altered, irrespective of marital status. When a woman is married, she legally has total control over the dowerthe mahr or bridal gift, usually financial in nature, while the groom pays to the bride upon marriageand retains this control in the event of divorce.|$|E

25|$|The Cavalry Corps {{had been}} created on 26 December 1939, {{containing}} both then existing armoured divisions of the Cavalry, the 1re Division Légère Mécanique ("1st Mechanised Light Division") and the 2e DLM. On 26 March 1940 however, 1st DLM was given the mission, {{in case of an}} invasion, to establish a connection with the Dutch Army near Breda; this experienced active division was therefore removed from the Cavalry Corps. It was replaced by the 3e DLM, recently constituted on 1 February, manned with reservists and still insufficiently trained. Nevertheless, Prioux still considered his forces sufficient to either contest a river-crossing at Maastricht, or wage a manoeuvre battle or, as a third alternative, defend an improvised line. He was <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> choose any option, provided the enemy was kept from Gembloux long enough. He decided to keep all possibilities open and act as the situation would demand.|$|E
25|$|In primates, {{reproductive}} synchrony {{usually takes}} the form of conception and birth seasonality. The regulatory 'clock', in this case, is the sun's position in relation to the tilt of the earth. In nocturnal or partly nocturnal primates—for example, owl monkeys— the periodicity of the moon may also come into play. Synchrony in general is for primates an important variable determining the extent of 'paternity skew'—defined as the extent to which fertile matings can be monopolised by a fraction of the population of males. The greater the precision of female reproductive synchrony—the greater the number of ovulating females who must be guarded simultaneously—the harder it is for any dominant male to succeed in monopolising a harem all to himself. This is simply because, by attending to any one fertile female, the male unavoidably leaves the others <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> mate with his rivals. The outcome is to distribute paternity more widely across the total male population, reducing paternity skew (figures a, b).|$|E
25|$|In 1930, {{workshops}} {{were completed}} at the airfields at Zagreb and Mostar, allowing for repairs and modifications {{to be carried}} out without transferring aircraft to the main factories and workshops closer to the capital. In May of that year, the first aircraft of entirely Yugoslav manufacture was completed at Kraljevo, and it was estimated that factory was capable of producing 100 Breguet 19 aircraft per year. At this time, the factory had a French workforce and was under French management, but the contract was due to expire in 1932, after which the Yugoslav government would be <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> produce whichever aircraft it could obtain licences to build. The privately owned Ikarus plant at Zemun continued to produce seaplanes of its own design as well as Potez 25 aircraft under licence. The strength of the air force was estimated at 26 squadrons of about twelve aircraft each, indicating a total of approximately 312 aircraft, although there were almost no reserve aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Essex {{continued}} his march to Drumcondra, while O'Neill returned to camp. At the planned conference on September 8 O'Neill was present, but not Essex. A cessation of arms was agreed {{for six weeks}} to six weeks, until May Day, either side being <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> break it on giving fourteen days warning; the English had liberty to attack O'Neill's confederates if they refused to be bound. The terms also provided for restitution of all spoils within 20 days after the warning, and the rebels were to hold all they then possessed, with no garrisons {{to be placed in}} new stations, free passages to be assured, all English garrisons to be apprised of the cessation, and commissioners for the borders between the English and Irish zones to be appointed. O'Neill was to ratify this on oath, Essex on his word. The terms were committed to writing and signed by O'Neill. The next day Essex dispersed his army and went to take physic at Drogheda, while O'Neill retired with all his forces into the heart of his country.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} was desirous of attracting wealthy Jews to the country, {{but it was}} equally careful to keep out itinerant door-to-door sellers of trinkets, {{quite a number of}} whom had in previous years entered Sweden from Germany. Any foreign Jew who landed in Sweden was accordingly required to report, within eight days of his arrival, to the local authorities, and to produce his passport and a certificate of character, as well as a statement of his purpose in coming to the country. These certificates were issued by the elders of the congregation to which the immigrant belonged in his native country, and had to be verified by the municipal authorities of the place in which the immigrant had last resided. If the certificates were unsatisfactory, the authorities were <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> expel the holder; but in case he was admitted he was directed to Stockholm, Gothenburg, or Norrköping. Jews who were residents of the country prior to the promulgation of this ordinance were called upon to present their certificates of character to the proper authorities, together with a statement setting forth in which city they desired to settle and make their living. The ordinance enumerated the different trades the Jews were permitted to follow, and it stipulated also that they should apprentice their sons to Swedish tradesmen in one of the three cities mentioned above. In order to prevent the overcrowding of the mercantile field it was prescribed that no foreign-born Jew should be allowed to start in business unless he possessed at least 2,000 Swedish riksdaler in cash or negotiable securities; a native-born Jew need have only 1,000 riksdaler. Rabbis were exempt, and according to previous ordinances, poor Jews were to be deported from the country.|$|E
500|$|During 1777–1785, Vermont was {{repeatedly}} denied {{representation in the}} Continental Congress, largely because New York insisted that Vermont was legally a part of New York. [...] Vermont took the position that because its petitions for admission to the Union were denied, {{it was not a}} part of the United States, not subject to Congress, and <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> negotiate separately with the British. [...] The latter Haldimand negotiations led to some exchanges of prisoners of war. [...] The peace treaty of 1783 that ended the war included Vermont within the boundaries of the United States. On March 2, 1784, Governor George Clinton of New York asked Congress to declare war for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Vermont, but Congress made no decision.|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} the stately Commodore slowly emerges from his cabin, and soon stands leaning alone against the brass rails of the after-hatchway.

500|$|Producing {{films in}} this manner meant Chaplin took longer to {{complete}} his pictures {{than almost any other}} filmmaker at the time. If he was out of ideas, he often took a break from the shoot, which could last for days, while keeping the studio ready for when inspiration returned. Delaying the process further was Chaplin's rigorous perfectionism. According to his friend Ivor Montagu, [...] "nothing but perfection would be right" [...] for the filmmaker. Because he personally funded his films, Chaplin was <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> strive for this goal and shoot as many takes as he wished. The number was often excessive, for instance 53 takes for every finished take in The Kid. For The Immigrant, a 20 minute-short, Chaplin shot 40,000 feet of film – enough for a feature-length.|$|E
500|$|Novel-writing was {{a suspect}} {{occupation}} {{for women in the}} early 19th century, because it imperiled their social reputation by bringing them publicity, viewed as unfeminine. Therefore, like many other female writers, Austen published anonymously. Eventually, though, her novels' authorship became an open secret among the aristocracy. During one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her, through his librarian, James Stanier Clarke, to view his library at Carlton House; his librarian mentioned that the Regent admired her novels and that [...] "if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> dedicate it to the Prince". Austen, who disapproved of the prince's extravagant lifestyle, did not want to follow this suggestion, but her friends convinced her otherwise: in short order, Emma was dedicated to him. Austen turned down the librarian's further hint to write a historical romance in honour of the prince's daughter's marriage.|$|E
500|$|Justice McHugh drew analogies {{between the}} {{legislation}} {{at issue in}} the case, and previous legislation which had authorised indefinite administrative detention, such as the arrangements under the War Precautions Act 1914. Regulations made under that and other acts allowed the internment of several thousand people, including German Australians during World War I and Japanese Australians during World War II. McHugh noted that those arrangements had been challenged, and upheld, in the High Court (for example in the 1915 case of Lloyd v Wallach), and emphasised that at no time had anyone questioned that detention for protective purposes, as opposed to punitive purposes, would conflict with Chapter III. He concluded that although the situation at hand was [...] "tragic", the courts were not <b>at</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>to</b> question the propriety of decisions made by the Parliament of Australia on moral or human rights grounds, given {{the absence of a}} bill of rights in Australia.|$|E
