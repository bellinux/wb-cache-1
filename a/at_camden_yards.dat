5|$|The Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum {{is located}} at 216 Emory Street, a Baltimore row house where Ruth was born, and three blocks west of Oriole Park <b>at</b> <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> where the AL's Baltimore Orioles play. The {{property}} was restored and {{opened to the public}} in 1973 by the non-profit Babe Ruth Birthplace Foundation, Inc. Ruth's widow, Claire, his two daughters, Dorothy and Julia, and his sister, Mamie, helped select and install exhibits for the museum.|$|E
5|$|The Modells' {{collaboration}} with U2 {{for the film}} was facilitated by their involvement with the band in researching LED display technology in 1997 for use at Ravens Stadium <b>at</b> <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards.</b> At the time, the only giant LED display in existence was being used by U2 on their PopMart Tour. To learn about the technology, David Modell toured with U2 on-and-off {{for a period of}} six months. During that time, he befriended Catherine Owens, who served as the group's art director since their 1992 Zoo TV Tour.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 2014, Ramirez {{made his}} Orioles {{debut in the}} ninth inning against the Texas Rangers, {{relieving}} Ubaldo Jiménez after pitching 8 innings only allowing 1 run pass. This was not a save opportunity since the Orioles were winning 7-1 in Baltimore. He allowed one walk and had two strikeouts. He helped Jimenez get his first win <b>at</b> <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> of the 2014 Major League Baseball season. Ramírez had never met the Orioles manager Buck Showalter before his debut with the Orioles which has never happened to Buck in his Career. He was designated for assignment on July 6, 2014.|$|E

5000|$|With {{substantial}} {{completion of}} construction in 2008, there were complaints that {{views of the}} city's skyline are now blocked from most sections of Oriole Park <b>at</b> <b>Camden</b> <b>Yard's</b> grandstand. The Baltimore Sun said on April 21, 2008, [...] "There's just {{a glimpse of the}} Bromo Seltzer Tower's crenellated top just {{to the right of the}} new Hilton Baltimore Convention Center hotel ... something's drastically different at Oriole Park this year ... the sweeping view of downtown Baltimore that fans have enjoyed for the past 16 seasons has changed considerably..." [...] Sportswriter Peter Schmuck complained, [...] "the big, antiseptic convention hotel ... looms over <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> ... and has blocked out the best part of the Baltimore skyline". A Washington Post columnist called it a [...] "cruel cubist joke on a previously perfect ballpark", although others said they were pleased with new construction downtown as indicative of urban revitalization.|$|R
5|$|The {{second game}} {{was held at}} Oriole Park <b>at</b> <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> in Baltimore on May 3, 1999, in front of 47,940 fans. By May 3, the Orioles had a 7–17 win-loss record in the 1999 MLB season. The Cuban {{national}} team, meanwhile, was stronger than during the first game, as the 1998–99 Cuban National Series had concluded and players who were not available for {{the first game of}} the exhibition joined the Cuban team. A 300-person delegation accompanied the Cuban team, including members of the Cuban media, students, and retired players. MLB requested the Federal Aviation Administration clear the airspace above Camden Yards for the game, in response to an attempt by a Miami-based pilot and veteran of the Bay of Pigs invasion, to drop anti-Castro leaflets over Estadio Latinoamericano during the first game.|$|E
5|$|MD295 {{continues}} northeast on Russell Street, {{where it}} is unsigned {{for the remainder of}} the route, through a mix of industrial and commercial areas, heading to the northwest of the Baltimore Greyhound Terminal at Haines Street and the Horseshoe Casino Baltimore. Farther north, the street passes over CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision railroad line before it heads to the west of M Bank Stadium, where the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League play. Past here, the road features an interchange with Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, which becomes I-395 south of Russell Street. After this interchange, MD295 runs west of Oriole Park <b>at</b> <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> home to Major League Baseball's Baltimore Orioles, as a four-lane divided street. Immediately after Camden Yards, MD295 splits into a one-way pair at the intersection with Washington Boulevard with northbound traffic following Eislen Street northeast briefly before heading north on Paca Street and southbound traffic following Greene Street. Along the one-way pair, the route intersects many major streets in downtown Baltimore, including Pratt Street, Lombard Street, Baltimore Street, Fayette Street, and Saratoga Street.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park <b>at</b> <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E

50|$|In Baltimore, Maryland, <b>at</b> the <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> {{baseball}} park, {{there is}} a statue of Babe Ruth, the famous New York Yankee player. Although he became famous as a Yankee, George Herman Ruth’s roots are from Baltimore. Babe Ruth was born {{and grew up in}} Baltimore, where he learned how to play baseball. The statue of Ruth portrays him as a young man, about the time he started out as a rookie. The statues name is “Babe’s Dream,” because the artist, Susan Luery, wanted to portray Babe’s longing for the big leagues, or at least an escape from his harsh childhood.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} memorable City-Poly games {{occurred}} on Thanksgiving Day 1965, at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium, with some 25,000fans in attendance. City beat Poly 52–6, and completed a 10–0 season with the team finishing the season ranked eighth in the nation by a national sports poll. City's 52–6 victory over Poly in that game is the largest margin of victory {{in the history of the}} series. Former Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke was the quarterback and Maryland Delegate Curt Anderson was the captain. The game is no longer played on Thanksgiving or at Memorial Stadium, but is now located at the home of the Baltimore Ravens, M Bank Stadium, <b>at</b> <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> in downtown Baltimore.

On April 20, {{he became the}} first player to hit a ball onto Eutaw Street which runs behind right field <b>at</b> Baltimore's <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards.</b> In a poll of American League managers prior to the 1992 All-Star Game, Tettleton came out on top as their choice to be the starting All-Star catcher. However, the fans voted for Sandy Alomar, Jr. Tettleton produced a [...]238 batting average, a career-high 32 home runs, 83 runs batted in, a [...]379 on-base percentage, and led the American League with 122 base on balls, to win his third Silver Slugger Award.

The 6th Regiment fired on the mob, killing 10 and wounding 25, and several members of both regiments were injured by stones and bricks.

5000|$|The president-elect, Abraham Lincoln, was {{traveling}} {{from his home}} in Springfield, Illinois, to the Capital via a train tour that was to stop at notable cities along the way. His published program showed that Lincoln's last leg of the journey was from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to Washington, D.C. Due to the configuration of the rail system, all southbound trains required a transfer to be made in Baltimore, Maryland. The northbound station ended at Calvert Street and the southbound train station started <b>at</b> <b>Camden</b> Street (now the <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards</b> station). The distance between these two stations were about a mile by carriage ride.|$|R

Oriole Park <b>at</b> <b>Camden</b> <b>Yards,</b> a facility designed specifically for baseball, was constructed near the proposed Baltodome site and opened in 1992.
