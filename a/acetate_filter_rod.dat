40|$|Triethyl citrate (TEC) {{was applied}} in the {{preparation}} of cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>rods</b> by two approaches. One was to utilize TEC as a plasticizer sprayed onto the surface of cellulose acetate (CA) fibers. The other was to apply TEC as an additive coated onto the cellulosic paper of acetate-paper dual filters. Three types of cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>rods,</b> namely, triethyl citrate-cellulose <b>acetate</b> (TEC-CA) <b>filter</b> <b>rods,</b> triethyl citrate-cellulose acetate-paper (TEC-CA-paper) dual <b>filter</b> <b>rods</b> and cellulose acetate-paper-triethyl citrate (CA-paper-TEC) dual <b>filter</b> <b>rods,</b> were manufactured. In order to promote the curing of CA rods, high-frequency radiation was introduced into the procedure of filter manufacture. Then Virginia type cigarettes, combined with the three kinds of prepared <b>filter</b> <b>rods</b> were manufactured and the removal efficiency of phenols from the cigarette mainstream smoke was investigated. The results revealed that no matter where the triethyl citrate was applied as plasticizer or coating additive, the content of phenol, o-, m-and p-cresol in cigarette mainstream smoke could be greatly reduced. The optimal removal efficiency for phenol was 50 % compared with the control. [Beitr. Tabakforsch. Int. 26 (2014) 176 - 182...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} use of {{cellulose}} <b>acetate</b> <b>filter</b> <b>rods</b> as a technique for tear collection. METHOD: The cellulose acetate rod (CR) was compared with the 'standard' glass capillary tube (CT), {{in a series of}} experiments, to assess: sample collection by collected volume size; the effect of tear stimulation on total tear protein concentration and major tear protein concentrations; and technique invasiveness. RESULTS: No difference was found in concentrations for total protein, IgA (secretory immunoglobulin A), lactoferrin and lysozyme (p > 0. 05) with no clinically significant increase in serum albumin to show serum leakage. Sample volume was higher for CR (p < 0. 005) and sample volume increased for stimulated collection with CR (p = 0. 001). Dilution effect of a stimulated sample size was reliably shown only with CR (r = - 0. 66, p = 0. 011). Using bovine albumin standard with CR and CT, a smaller sample volume (p < 0. 001) and a higher protein concentration (p < 0. 001) were extracted with CR. CONCLUSION: The cellulose rod offers a suitable alternative to the glass CT. It is able to quickly absorb a sample, allowing use {{for a wide range of}} sample sizes, while being minimally invasive...|$|R

The comparison with activated sludge was performed by two parallel treatment lines. Organic substance, ammonia and TP removal was investigated over four month period.

COD removal percentages of 94. 55 %, and 81. 62 % were achieved for IFAS and activated sludge system, respectively. Also, ammonia concentration significantly decreased by increasing the HRT in both systems.

40|$|Abstract. A {{series of}} {{compounds}} were applied as plasticizer in the cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>filter</b> of cigarette. The {{data showed that}} the tested filters with proper plasticizers could effectively remove phenolic compounds from mainstream cigarette smoke. In the test models, Triethyl citrate (TEC) exhibited significant absorption capacity to phenolic compounds in cigarette smoke, and the removal efficiency exceeded 49 % in contrast to triacetin. Similar result was obtained in different type of cigarette with TEC tips. The removal efficiency of phenolic compounds was significantly affected by the loading of TEC when the loading of TEC was less than 9 wt%. However, when the loading of TEC was between 9 - 15 wt%, the removal efficiency showed only slight difference. Intorduction Phenol and other simple phenolic compounds in cigarette smoke have drawn great attention in tobacco industry. The reason is that these compounds have been reported as being contributors to the carcinogenic activity of cigarette smoke [1]. And they are claimed to be detrimental to the cilia in the bronchial tubes [2]. So the removal of phenolic compounds from cigarette smoke is indispensable. Although it is reported that a cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>filter</b> can considerably remove phenolic compounds in cigarette smoke [3], it can’t yet {{meet the demands of}} reducing tobacco hazard.

40|$|Cellulose acetate 0. 45 -mu m syringe filters {{could be}} used to filter {{environmental}} samples containing steroidal hormones, such as estradiol, prior to analysis. Such pretreatment may result in significant loss of analyte due to either adsorption of analyte to the filter material or association with retained colloidal and particulate materials.

At all concentrations the experiments indicated that below pH 11, up to 50 % of estradiol in the feed was adsorbed on the filter. This occurred regardless of the presence of bulk organic matter in solution, and was related to dissociation of estradiol with pH and subsequent changes in filter interaction.
