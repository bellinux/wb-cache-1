It is susceptible to moisture, so must be laid on a course that stops rising dampness, must be roofed or covered to keep out water from above, and may need protection through some sort of plaster, paint or sheathing.|$|E
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
5|$|The reactivities of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. This {{is the result of}} a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.|$|E

5|$|In the War of the Fourth Coalition, Klein {{fought in}} the Grande Armée under command of Joachim Murat. After the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt, Klein was with his {{division}} of dragoons {{in the village of}} Weissensee, the only escape route open to the Prussian General Blücher. Blücher was surprised to find Klein in possession of the village, but convinced him an armistice has been concluded between Prussia and Napoleon. Reports differ on the conduct of Klein and Blücher. William Milligan Sloane insists that Frederick William III of Prussia was with Blücher and that only the old general's bluff prevented the King's capture. Some historians assert that Klein believed him, and learned too late that he had been deceived. Others assert that Klein's force was too weak to resist the greater Prussian numbers. He had only 800 cavalry and Antoine Lasalle, to the west, had two regiments. Blücher had either 7,000, according to Charles Mullié, or more than 12,000 Prussian infantry, artillery and horse. Regardless, Klein and Lasalle either pragmatically maintained the fiction or fell for the ruse; Blücher and his Prussians passed through the village. Charles Mullié maintains that Klein vowed revenge; with his division, he pursued and attacked Blücher force the following day. He took 10Prussian standards and 1,000 prisoners, including a general officer, although he did not capture Blücher. Frances Lorraine Petrie gives that credit to Soult, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> Adolphe Thiers; furthermore, Petre maintains, Klein's dragoons were sent to guard the communications lines between Erfurt and Weimar, where several groups of Prussians had skirmished with the French rear guard.|$|E

25|$|Work {{experience}} {{will be considered}} physics-related if it uses physics directly or significantly utilizes the modes of thought (such as the approach to problem-solving) developed in your education and/or experience as a physicist, in all cases {{regardless of whether the}} experience is in academia, industry, government, or elsewhere.

25|$|Combined, 'semi-rational' {{approaches}} are being investigated {{to address the}} limitations of both rational design and directed evolution. Beneficial mutations are rare, so large numbers of random mutants have to be screened to find improved variants. 'Focussed libraries' concentrate on randomising regions thought to be richer in beneficial mutations for the mutagenesis step of DE. A focussed library contains fewer variants than a traditional random mutagenesis library <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> not require such high-throughput screening.|$|E
25|$|Patterns that {{incorporate}} discontinuous street types such as crescents and culs-de-sac have not, in general, regarded pedestrian {{movement as a}} priority and, consequently, have produced blocks that are usually in the 1000-foot range and often exceed it. As a result, street frequency drops <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> the total street length and, therefore, the cost. In general, {{it is not the}} street pattern per se that affects costs but the frequency of streets that it either necessitates or purposely incorporates.|$|E

25|$|Here Descartes {{notes that}} automata {{are capable of}} {{responding}} to human interactions but argues that such automata cannot respond appropriately to things said in {{their presence in the}} way that any human can. Descartes therefore prefigures the Turing Test by defining the insufficiency of appropriate linguistic response as that which separates the human from the automaton. Descartes fails to consider the possibility that future automata might be able to overcome such insufficiency, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> not propose the Turing Test as such, even if he prefigures its conceptual framework and criterion.|$|E
25|$|All {{steps of}} {{glycolysis}} {{take place in}} the cytosol <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> the reaction catalysed by GAPDH. In red blood cells, GAPDH and several other glycolytic enzymes assemble in complexes {{on the inside of the}} cell membrane. The process appears to be regulated by phosphorylation and oxygenation. Bringing several glycolytic enzymes close to each other is expected to greatly increase the overall speed of glucose breakdown. Recent studies have also revealed that GAPDH is expressed in an iron dependent fashion on the exterior of the cell membrane a where it plays a role in maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis.|$|E

25|$|For {{positive}} real x, y and s, x'y/y → 0, when (x, y) → (0, s). This {{seems to}} justify setting γ(s, 0) = 0 for real s > 0. However, matters are somewhat {{different in the}} complex realm. Only if (a) the real part of s is positive, and (b) values u'v are taken from just a finite set of branches, they are guaranteed to converge to zero as (u, v) → (0, s), <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> γ(u, v). On a single branch of γ(b) is naturally fulfilled, so there γ(s, 0) = 0 for s with positive real part is a continuous limit. Also note that such a continuation {{is by no means}} an analytic one.|$|E
25|$|Boötes is {{in a part}} of the {{celestial}} sphere facing away from the plane of our home Milky Way galaxy, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> not have open clusters or nebulae. Instead, it has one bright globular cluster and many faint galaxies. The globular cluster NGC 5466 has an overall magnitude of 9.1 and a diameter of 11 arcminutes. It is a very loose globular cluster with fairly few stars and may appear as a rich, concentrated open cluster in a telescope. NGC 5466 is classified as a Shapley-Sawyer Concentration Class 12 cluster, reflecting its sparsity. Its fairly large diameter means that it has a low surface brightness, so it appears far dimmer than the catalogued magnitude of 9.1 and requires a large amateur telescope to view. Only approximately 12 stars are resolved by an amateur instrument.|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel {{exhibits}} cytotoxic {{activity on}} breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, gastric, renal and prostate cancer cells. Docetaxel does not block disassembly of interphase microtubules <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> not prevent {{entry into the}} mitotic cycle, but does block mitosis by inhibiting mitotic spindle assembly. Resistance to paclitaxel or anthracycline doxorubicin does not necessarily indicate resistance to docetaxel. Microtubules formed {{in the presence of}} docetaxel are of a larger size than those formed in the presence of paclitaxel, which may result in improved cytotoxic efficacy. Abundant formation of microtubules and the prevention to replicate caused by the presence of docetaxel leads to apoptosis of tumour cells and is the basis of docetaxel use as a cancer treatment. It is unknown if pathophysiological interactions with docetaxel exist at this stage, however tumour type has been shown to have efficacy on cellular activity. Docetaxel activity is significantly greater in ovarian and breast tumours than for lung tumours.|$|E
