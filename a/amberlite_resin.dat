40|$|The direct {{determination}} of toxic metal ions, in environmental samples, {{is difficult because}} of the latter's presence in trace concentration in association with complex matrices, thereby leading to insufficient sensitivity and selectivity of the methods used. The simultaneous removal of the matrix and preconcentration of the metal ions, through solid phase extraction, serves as the promising solution. The mechanism involved in solid phase extraction (SPE) depends {{on the nature of}} the sorbent and analyte. Thus, SPE is carried out by means of adsorption, ion exchange, chelation, ion pair formation, and so forth. As polymeric supports, the commercially available <b>Amberlite</b> <b>resins</b> have been found very promising for designing chelating matrices due to its good physical and chemical properties such as porosity, high surface area, durability and purity.

Two SPE methods were compared: one using <b>Amberlite</b> XAD- 2 <b>resin</b> and another one using a C 18 cartridge. A gradient high performance liquid chromatography system with an RP 18 column and photodiode array detector was utilized to analyze the extracted polyphenols. The mean percent of recovery from the C 18 cartridges was 74. 2 %, while that from the <b>Amberlite</b> XAD- 2 <b>resin</b> was 43. 7 %. The recoveries of vanillic acid, naringin, and rutin were excellent (> 90 %); however, gallic acid was not obtained when C 18 cartridges were used. Additionally, the reusability of <b>Amberlite</b> XAD- 2 <b>resin</b> was investigated, revealing that the mean recovery of polyphenols decreased from 43. 7 % (1 st extraction) to 29. 3 % (3 rd extraction).

40|$|Combinatorial {{chemistry}} {{was used}} to extend the knowledge of beer thiols by synthesizing 13 mercapto primary alcohols and 6 other compounds (mercapto ketones and corresponding alcohols). Their respective mass spectra, retention indices on two columns, odor descriptors, and best estimated-gas chromatography-lowest amounts detected sniffing (BE-GC-LoADS) are reported. The descriptor "cheese", commonly associated with mercapto aldehydes and thioesters, was rarely used for mercapto alcohols or mercapto ketones. Polyfunctional thiols containing at least six carbon atoms usually gave a delicate odor of rhubarb/carrot, whereas most of the mercapto primary alcohols of intermediate size were described as onion-like, plastic-like, or pungent. Sensorial analysis of beers spiked with copper(II) ions allowed confirmation of the participation of thiols in the overall odor of fresh beer. The finding of 4 -mercapto- 4 -methyl- 2 -pentanone and 3 -mercaptohexanol in an XAD- 2 <b>Amberlite</b> <b>resin</b> beer extract indicates a requirement for a more efficient thiol extraction procedure allowing identification of relevant polyfunctional thiols for brewing scientists...|$|E

The pH and contact time effects on adsorption were evaluated. The adsorption capacity was dependent on pH and higher at pH less than pKa 1. The kinetic adsorption is faster onto FAU and *BEA zeolites than onto XAD 16 resin. Maximum adsorption capacities were calculated for the target compounds for pH= 3. 5 by using the Langmuir isotherm model. They reached higher values for zeolites than for XAD 16 and are respectively of 139, 122 and 109 mg g- 1 for ferulic, p-coumaric and cinnamic acids. Values around 30 mg g- 1 were observed for XAD 16. Desorption ratios are close to 100 % for *BEA zeolite and XAD 16 resin in the presence of ethanol 96 %.

Functional reconstitution of OsPIP 1; 1 was further confirmed by the low Arrhenius activation energy (3. 37 kcal/mol) and sensitivity to HgCl 2, a known AQP blocker, of the PIP 1; 1 -mediated osmotic water conductance.

40|$|Background—Various {{nutrients}} {{are known}} to alter small intestinal motility patterns although their effect on transit of fluids and solids in man is not clear.  Aims—To determine small intestinal transit of solids and liquids during perfusion with lipids, protein, and non-energy solutions.  Methods—Twenty eight healthy volunteers received a jejunal infusion (1 ml/ minute for 30 minutes) of one of four solutions: a lipid or a protein solution (4. 18 J/ml), a non-absorbable electrolyte solution containing polyethylene glycol, or 0. 9 % sodium chloride.

Lipid infusion accelerated transit through the small intestine but delayed transport of chyme along the ileocolonic junction. After protein small intestinal transit was slowest; ileocolonic transit on the other hand was fastest with protein. Transit of the non-energy solutions was in between that of the nutrient solutions.  Conclusions—Transit times through the small intestine and the ileocolonic junction were influenced by the luminal contents.

40|$|Natural {{organic matter}} is an {{important}} driver of biotic and abiotic processes in aquatic environments. Wastewater treatment plants discharge {{a substantial amount of}} organic matter into the environment; however effluent organic matter has not been well studied. In this study, traditional organic geochemical techniques were applied to characterize effluent organic matter. Effluent organic matter was isolated by DAX 8 (hydrophobic fraction) and XAD 4 (transphilic fraction) <b>Amberlite</b> <b>resins.</b> Extraction efficiencies of effluent organic matter by DAX 8 resins ranged from 18 to 42 percent as a result of larger content of hydrophilic organic matter than natural organic matter. Average organic matter molecular weights by size exclusion chromatography were from 450 - 670 Daltons with higher weights for hydrophobic than transphilic fractions. Fluorescence characterization showed both humic and fulvic like fluorescence as well as tryptophan and tyrosine like fluorescence, the latter not commonly observed in terrestrial organic matter. Fluorescence indices were between 1. 5 and 1. 9 with lower values for hydrophobic organic matter than transphilic. Specific ultraviolet absorbance was measured between 0. 8 and 3. 0 L mg- 1 m- 1. Together these characterization techniques indicate that extracted effluent organic matter is similar in characteristics to microbially derived organic matter. Comparisons of effluent from different plants suggest the characteristics of effluent organic matter are similar regardless of treatment plant...|$|R
