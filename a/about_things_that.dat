5|$|In couples' counseling, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{have been}} told to express {{appreciation}} for the things their spouse does for them, be frank <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> make them unhappy, and refer to anything {{they do not want to}} do but must as an opportunity. Their exercising of these three habits is stiff and formal to begin with, and becomes increasingly snarky as the day goes on. Despite this, as Jim leaves the office to return to his business, he confesses to Pam that he thinks the three habits are helping and that they should keep them up. After he leaves, Pam runs after him to give him an umbrella. Jim takes the umbrella, and then embraces his wife, who finds that she lacks the emotional conviction to hug him back. It then flashbacks to their wedding with Michael, Dwight and the gang, she remembers that by marrying Jim she promised to love him in spite of any hardships, and she lovingly embraces him and kisses him.|$|E
25|$|He {{developed}} a reputation as being very friendly with children. He carried candy in his pockets for the street urchins in Mantua and Venice, and taught catechism to them. During papal audiences, he would gather children around him {{and talk to them}} <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> interested them. His weekly catechism lessons in the courtyard of San Damaso in the Vatican always included a special place for children, and his decision to require the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish was partly motivated by a desire to reclaim children from religious ignorance.|$|E
25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing things that go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E

In fact, some were invented from almost the beginning to almost the end." [...] The Rebbe leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger: That means you are writing lies! I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defense. Yet, I had to justify myself: [...] "Things are not that simple, Rebbe. Some events do take place but are not true; others are—although they never occurred." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{thematic}} framework hearkens back to Poe, James, {{and early}} gothic fiction, {{as well as}} films such as Shadow of a Doubt (1943) and The Night of the Hunter (1955) and the entire notion of film noir. Lynch has called it a [...] "film <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are hidden—within a small city and within people." [...] Like many other Lynch films, Blue Velvet is immersed in pop culture imagery, both from the 1950s and the 1960s, {{as well as the}} 1980s.|$|E
500|$|The artwork for The Blackening was {{designed}} by Robb Flynn, longtime Machine Head collaborator Paul Brown, and Deanna Alcorn. Based on a metal carving in the 16th century, these carvings were used to scare people about going to Hell and for propaganda purposes. It features a skeleton on a throne that is standing {{on top of the}} world, and the words [...] "The mirror which flatters not." [...] Flynn thought [...] "this whole record is like holding up a mirror to ourselves. It's talking <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are going on now, but it's not necessarily specific to this time." ...|$|E

We're nothing like that. - Baatin ...|$|R

500|$|Diane Johnson, who co-wrote the {{screenplay}} for The Shining with Kubrick, {{notes that he}} [...] "always {{said that it was}} better to adapt a book rather than write an original screenplay, and that you should choose a work that isn't a masterpiece so you can improve on it. Which is what he's always done, except with Lolita". When deciding on a subject for a film, {{there were a number of}} aspects that he looked for, and he always made films which would [...] "appeal to every sort of viewer, whatever their expectation of film". According to his co-producer Jan Harlan, Kubrick mostly [...] "wanted to make films <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> mattered, that not only had form, but substance". Kubrick himself believed that audiences quite often were attracted to [...] "enigmas and allegories" [...] and did not like films in which everything was spelled out clearly.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{collaboration}} with Ja Rule, Milian {{signed a deal}} with Island Def Jam Music Group in 2000. Milian traveled to Sweden and recorded her self-titled debut album, working with the popular producers of that time. Milian collaborated with Bloodshy & Avant, Jermaine Dupri, Focus, Irv Gotti, Mark Hill, Montell Jordan and Evan Rogers. Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times later suggested that instead of launching her career off the success of [...] "Between Me and You", and by recording in Sweden without the [...] "platinum production touch" [...] of Irv Gotti, the owner of The Inc. Records, the momentum created by the song had evaporated. Milian received writing credit for eleven of the twelve songs on the album. It was during {{the production of the}} album that Milian had first started to write songs, and wrote <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> she could relate to at the time.|$|E
500|$|Released on 5 October 2009, Nilsen's first record, Vi som ser i mørket (We Who See in the Dark), {{features}} songs written {{mostly in}} Norwegian, {{but also in}} English (Nilsen has mentioned that her American mother {{found it difficult to}} not want to proofread her English lyrics). [...] The album was produced by musician Jan Martin Smørdal. [...] Music critics were similar in their appraisal of Nilsen's voice and lyrics. Norway's largest newspaper, Aftenposten described Nilsen as [...] "an artist who had already found her own voice." [...] It described her music as ranging from [...] "sensitive melancholy moods to light and playful tones", and [...] "imparting joy and peace of mind.." [...] Nilsen's lyrics are often described as [...] "personal".

500|$|Hooper has cited {{changes in}} the {{cultural}} and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the [...] "film {{you are about to}} see is true", was a response to being [...] "lied to by the government <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were going on all over the world", including Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, and [...] "the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War". The [...] "lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things" [...] that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by [...] "showing brains spilled all over the road", led to his belief that [...] "man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film". The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper {{while he was in the}} hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed his way through the crowd.|$|E
500|$|Milian {{received}} writing {{credit for}} nine {{songs on the}} album. Milian {{did not try to}} write mainstream records for the radio; rather, she wrote about [...] "everything, about your life and concentrate on you doing you." [...] For previous albums, Milian wrote <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> had happened in the past, whereas for So Amazin, she focused on the present. She compared the writing process to writing a diary; whenever she would experience something that she thought would be important, she would write it down for future reference. Milian felt that by writing down true experiences, her songs were like [...] "captured emotion". When writing songs, Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied. It would depend on what she was writing about, {{what was going on in}} her life, and if it pertained to that exact moment. Sometimes the process was quick, but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song.|$|E
500|$|The Kite Runner {{has been}} accused of 'hindering' Western {{understanding}} of the Taliban by portraying its members as representatives of various social and doctrinal evils that the Taliban and their supporters do not consider typical and which they feel portray Taliban in an unfavourable light. Examples of this would be: Assef's pedophilia, Nazism, drug abuse, and sadism, {{and the fact that he}} is an executioner. The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most-challenged books of 2008, with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to its [...] "offensive language, sexually explicit , and unsuit age group." [...] Afghan American readers were particularly hostile towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed. Hosseini responded in an interview, [...] "They never say I am speaking <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are untrue. Their beef is, 'Why do you have to talk about these things and embarrass us? Don't you love your country?'" ...|$|E

500|$|In mid-2003, MCA Records {{was absorbed}} by Universal Music Group label Geffen Records, which {{resulted}} in MCA's staff and roster being moved to Geffen. At the time, guitarist Josh Partington said: [...] " [...] can't worry <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are out of your control ... I can't {{do anything about it}} so you just keep doing what you're doing." [...] On July 12, 2003, North was announced for release. From mid-July to late August, the band supported 311 on their tour of the US. [...] "Space" [...] was released as a single on September 8, and released to modern rock radio a day later. A music video for the song was premiered by Fox Broadcasting Company on September 16. The video was filmed in August during the band's tour with 311 by director Mike Piscitelli. It featured five pillars, all of them fitted with video monitors, placed in various locations within Los Angeles, such as in an alleyway or at a bus stop. In September, the band supported Good Charlotte on their arena tour of the US.|$|E

500|$|In 1872, Hobart ran as a Republican for the New Jersey General Assembly from Passaic County's third {{legislative}} district. [...] He {{was easily}} elected, taking {{nearly two-thirds of}} the vote. [...] The General Assembly was then elected annually and he was successful in winning re-election the following year, although his margin of victory was cut in half. [...] In 1874, still only age30, he was voted Speaker of the Assembly. [...] At the time, it was customary to step down after two terms, and he did so, although Hobart biographer David Magie maintained that he was urged to seek re-election. [...] Instead, he campaigned for the Republican nominee for his seat, who was elected. [...] In 1876, Hobart was nominated for the New Jersey Senate seat for Passaic County. [...] He was elected to a three-year term, and was re-elected in 1879. [...] In 1881 and 1882, he served as President of the state Senate, becoming the first man to lead both houses of the legislature. [...] In 1883, he was the Republican nominee in the election for United States Senate—until 1913, senators were elected by state legislatures. [...] As the Democrats had more legislators, a Republican had no chance of election—the nomination was simply a way of honoring Hobart for his political service. [...] When he was asked his feelings about the nomination, he responded, [...] "I do not worry <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> do not come my way." [...] The [...] "complimentary" [...] nomination would prove to be Hobart's only electoral defeat.|$|E

500|$|The English dub was {{recorded}} at Cup of Tea Productions, and {{was directed by}} Sam Riegel, who also voiced Phoenix, having previously voiced the role in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Hsu was present for the recording, as she knew the story and was the translator of the scripts, and thus could explain {{what was happening in}} each scene and what the motivations behind the lines were, as well as how she wanted the voice actors to deliver certain lines. Because Horiyama had attended the Japanese voice recording sessions, he was also present, so he could give advice <b>about</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> sounded too different from the Japanese version, and give consultation about technical issues within the game. The voice actors took turns recording their lines to near-final versions of the cutscenes, so they could match the characters' lip flaps. In addition to the voice acting, some sound effects had to be localized, due to sound being used differently in Japanese and Western films, resulting in different things sounding natural; one such case was the opening cutscene for the fourth episode. Due to the English voice acting occasionally becoming unintelligible when sound effects or music was played on top, the localization team had to lower the volume of the music at some points, move the sound backwards or forwards slightly, or raise the volume of certain consonants; the largest such issue was the voice clip for the [...] "Objection!" [...] interjection, where the [...] "b" [...] consonant initially was drowned by the sound effect.|$|E
