500|$|The <b>Trustee</b> <b>Investments</b> Act 1961 (c 62) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} where {{trustees}} can invest trust funds. Given the royal assent on 3 August 1961, it removed the [...] "Statutory Lists" [...] system {{and replaced it}} with sets of specific investment areas. The Act was heavily criticised for the way it set these areas out, particularly the requirement that trusts trying to invest in multiple areas would need to be permanently divided. [...] A 1997 Law Commission paper called its terms [...] "overly cautious and restrictive", suggesting that some trusts were underperforming as a result. The passing of the Trustee Act 2000 effectively nullified the 1961 Act's terms in relation to <b>trustee</b> <b>investment,</b> and the 2000 Act is now the principal piece of legislation in this area.|$|R

500|$|The Act was {{considered}} a bad one, since it required a [...] "very conservative investment policy for trustees". The powers given to <b>investment</b> <b>trustees</b> were restrictive and narrow, and the trustees were expected to go through expensive and complicated procedures to exercise them. The Act was criticised almost immediately for its complexity and outdatedness. A 1997 paper by the Law Commission called it [...] "overly cautious and restrictive", and suggested that some trusts were underperforming {{because of the difficulty}} of complying with the Act's provisions.

Individual pensions were uncommon and generally either self funded by the employer as in the case of banks and the public service or were effected through contractual arrangements such as insurance or purchased annuities. A national culture focussed on the availability of the Australian Government pension and a reluctance to embrace the concept of superannuation by many employers and employees. Limitations on <b>trustee</b> <b>investment</b> inhibited the growth of superannuation funds. ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1854, a girls' {{institution}} (later {{known as}} the [...] "Ladies College") was opened to complement the boys' academy.

50|$|In {{the wake}} of the college's recent {{financial}} difficulties that led to the School dismantling its 150 year mission of free tuition, many faculty, students and alumni questioned Campbell's actions and intentions as President. According to John Hechinger in 2009, George Campbell helped the school sidestep a crisis. Although by October 31, 2011 Jamshed Bharucha announced an insurmountable deficit that allegedly could not keep the institution sustainable without tuition, in May 2013 former Board of <b>Trustees</b> <b>investment</b> committee chair John Michaelson admitted the school could have continued to use the endowment to cover deficits and would have survived until 2018, when the higher payments from the Chrysler lease start.|$|R
50|$|Some Acts have schedules, {{a type of}} addendum, {{which give}} {{additional}} information. Schedules are commonly used to provide lists of amendments to other Acts, but may be used anywhere {{it may not be}} appropriate to include the information in the Act's main text. For example, section 1 of the Charities and <b>Trustee</b> <b>Investment</b> (Scotland) Act 2005 gives a general definition of the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator, while schedule 1 to that Act gives more detail; and schedule 1 to the Budget (Scotland) Act 2016 sets out the purposes for which money will be allocated to the Scottish Government, and how much money will be allocated to those purposes.|$|R
500|$|While {{some critics}} feared that {{granting}} the courts unlimited jurisdiction would create [...] "a most undignified {{game of chess}} between the Chancery Division and the legislature", and that it allowed tax planners another way to hide funds, the Act received general approval at the time.

[...] The second class of beneficiaries covered in Section 1(1) caused problems for the courts; since it only allows the court to alter a trust document where a person [...] "may be entitled", nothing can be done once this entitlement is confirmed.|$|R

500|$|Investment {{powers and}} limits on those powers are {{set out in}} Part II of the Act. Section 3(1) states that [...] "subject to the {{provisions}} of this part, a trustee may make any kind of investment {{that he could make}} if he was absolutely entitled to the assets of the trust". This is far looser than the previous provisions, which were contained in the <b>Trustee</b> <b>Investments</b> Act 1961. The 1961 Act was repeatedly criticised for its [...] "very conservative investment policy for trustees". The powers of <b>investment</b> <b>trustees</b> were given were restrictive and narrow, {{and at the same time}} the trustees were expected to go through expensive and complicated procedures to exercise them. This new power of investment is treated as a default provision - it is overridden if the trust instrument itself restricts the ways trust money can be invested. If the trust instrument was created prior to 3 August 1961, however, its provisions regarding investments are treated as void. The new provisions apply retrospectively, i.e. to trusts created before the passage of the Act. They do not, however, apply to trusts governed by the Charities Act 1993, Authorised Unit Trusts or occupational pension schemes.|$|R
