How often have you told me that there was no degree of business which you found irksome? Now you are all dispersed and scattered: no discussions, no committees, little correspondence--and you yourself are ever brooding and ever in conclave, with persons too who I know, for Stephen has told me so, are the preachers of violence: violence perhaps that some of them may preach, yet will not practise: both bad; traitors it may be, or, at the best, hare-brained men." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} six months of war, all the major engagements had been victories. As the tide turned in the summer of 1942 with the battle of Midway and the landing of the American forces on Guadalcanal and Tulagi in August, the Emperor {{recognized}} the potential danger and pushed the navy and the army for greater efforts. In September 1942, Emperor Hirohito signed the Imperial Rescript condemning to death American Fliers: Lieutenants Dean E. Hallmark and William G. Farrow and Corporal Harold A. Spatz and commuting to life sentences: Lieutenants Robert J. Meder, Chase Nielsen, Robert L. Hite and George Barr and Corporal Jacob DeShazer. When informed in August 1943 by Sugiyama that the American advance through the Solomon Islands could not be stopped, the Emperor asked his chief of staff to consider other places to attack: [...] "When and where <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> going to put up a good fight? And when <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> going to fight a decisive battle?" [...] On August 24, the Emperor reprimanded Nagano and on September 11, he ordered Sugiyama to work with the Navy to implement better military preparation and give adequate supply to soldiers fighting in Rabaul.|$|E

5000|$|One day I {{was about}} to enter court {{and one of my}} student interns, a WCL Washington College of Law student, asked me, he said, [...] "Well, Judge, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> afraid when you walk into the {{courtroom}}? Is it fear that you experience?" [...] I stopped and I thought about it and I said, You know, we’re never afraid as we enter a courtroom or as we begin a presentation, fear suggests that we’re not prepared or that we’re inadequate. What we experience as we’re about to enter a courtroom as lawyers to present a case is what I call [...] "the adrenaline of excellence." [...] I call it [...] "the adrenaline of excellence," [...] I call it that because, as you walk into a room, what you experience is your body and your muscles tighten, your heart and your mind concentrate, and your body and your heart and mind are telling you that you’re prepared to deliver peak performance, so I call the feeling of what you’re about to do [...] "the adrenaline of excellence." ...|$|E

During the pogrom, attackers break into a Jewish home, destroy much of the meager {{property}} inside and threaten to kill {{the man of the}} house. The terrified man pleads for his life and is finally spared under the condition that he teach the Czar’s dog to talk within one year. If he fails, his attackers promise they will come back and kill him. When the attackers leave, the man’s wife says to him “Are you crazy?

40|$|Perception drives {{discussion}} in philosophy and the cognitive sciences because it forms our most intimate sort of acquaintance with the world. In perception, the world appears before us as available to {{our thoughts and}} susceptible to our deeds. What we perceive shapes our thinking and guides our action. The variety and the flux are impressive. Philosophical work on perception traditionally concerns whether perceptual acquaintance with {{things in the world}} is compatible with the possibility of illusions and hallucinations. Given that you cannot tell definitively if you are hallucinating, how <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> acquainted with things like tomatoes, barns, collisions, colors, sounds, and odors? The contemporary cognitive science of perception attempts to understand perceiving in naturalistic terms. Cognitive science aims to explain the processes and mechanisms by which perceiving takes place in organisms understood as biological systems. The objective is to describe and explain how a creature accomplishes the feat of perceiving given constraints imposed by its physiology, environment, and goals. How, for instance, do your body and brain, which are made of cells and neural tissue, ground your awareness of {{the sights and sounds of}} a tomato being squashed...|$|E

40|$|Suppose {{you see a}} ripe tomato {{drop from}} above and strike the {{pavement}} with a resounding splat.
