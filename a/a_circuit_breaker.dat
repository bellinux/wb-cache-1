5|$|Washington {{passed through}} the area still {{occupied}} by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on Ayanami with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, South Dakota suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into series, making her radar, radios, and most of her gun batteries inoperable. However, she continued to follow Washington towards {{the western side of}} Savo Island until 23:35, when Washington changed course left to pass to the southward behind the burning destroyers. South Dakota tried to follow but had to turn to right to avoid Benham, which resulted in the ship's being silhouetted by the fires of the burning destroyers and made her a closer and easier target for the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|It was determined, however, {{that both}} crewmembers aboard the Marine F-4B could {{have survived the}} collision. Further {{investigation}} by the NTSB revealed a design flaw in the ejector seat and canopy assemblies of the fighter plane whereby the pilot would probably {{not be able to}} eject if the radar intercept officer ejected first. Since the specific design of ejector seats installed in the F-4B were not intended to be fired through the aircraft's canopy, <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> kept the seat from ejecting if the canopy was in place. Once the canopy was manually unlocked, the ejector seat circuit was completed and could be fired. This specific design of ejector seat, however, had a tendency of being unable to complete the circuit in the pilot's ejector seat if the aft ejector seat was fired first. The F-4B aircraft {{were in the process of}} being modified with a newly designed canopy when the collision occurred. Aircraft based at MCAS El Toro were slated to begin upgrades in July 1971; at the time of the collision, BuNo 151458 was still operating with the original canopy configuration, and the pilot was consequently unable to eject from the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is an {{automatically}} operated {{electrical switch}} {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current, typically resulting from an overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected.

Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect low-current circuits or individual household appliance, up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is an {{automatically}} operated {{electrical switch}} {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit.

Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect an individual household appliance up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. Inspired by the works of American scientist Joseph Henry and English scientist Michael Faraday, the circuit breaker was invented by an American, Charles Grafton Page.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The use of {{generator}} <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> {{in power}} stations was investigated and evaluated. A feasibility {{study to determine}} if the additional capital cost required, when using <b>a</b> generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> in <b>a</b> power station could be justified by the advantages it provides. The background to the study is provided through a technology and literature survey. Included in the technology review and the literature study is information on interruption mediums, the historic developments of <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> and generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> application theory. This data was used to determine the practicality of using a specific interruption medium within <b>a</b> generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> application. The requirements of generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> were determined and used to evaluate the interruption mediums in question. To ensure practical results, commonly used layouts were used to determine the effect of using <b>a</b> generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> on the reliability, availability and the mean time to repair of a power station electrical distribution layout. Furthermore, the effect of the protection on the generator and generator transformer was evaluated. It was found that increased selectivity of the protection system by using <b>a</b> generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> limits the extent of equipment damage in case of failure. Practical layouts were used to determine the effect on reliability. The analysis was conducted using assumed values of operational costs to determine the cost incurred through the change in reliability of the power station. By adding <b>a</b> generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker,</b> the station transformer and associated equipment is regarded as back-up or redundant equipment. This increases the reliability of the power station dramatically and limits the risk of income lost due to failures. The full evaluation included the estimation of the capital investment costs and the impact that the additional cost has on the operational requirements of a power station. The study determined that the capital cost required to use <b>a</b> generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> results in no additional income for a power station. Through the increased protection, higher availability and the possible omission of power station ancillary equipment, the use of generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> will result in more power being delivered and more income generated by a power station. The study proved that the generator <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is <b>a</b> critical part of a power station layout and is a necessary capital requirement to ensure the sustainability of the power station.

25|$|Fuses {{have the}} {{advantages}} of often being less costly and simpler than <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> for similar ratings. The blown fuse must be replaced with a new device which is less convenient than simply resetting a breaker and therefore likely to discourage people from ignoring faults. On the other hand, replacing a fuse without isolating the circuit first (most building wiring designs do not provide individual isolation switches for each fuse) can be dangerous in itself, particularly if the fault is a short circuit.|$|E
500|$|Sunsoft was not {{interested}} in the game for PC, and was instead focused on the video game console market. At the time, consoles had no hard drives and small memory buffers, meaning the game had to be designed around these technical constraints. To solve this issue, they compartmentalized parts of the game's environments into the different Ages. The Millers decided that most people did not like puzzles. Thus, a good puzzle would feel familiar and part of the world—not like a puzzle, but something for players to figure out like <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> in their house, using observation and common sense. Cyan did not have fans to please, and did not know exactly who the game would appeal to; Robyn felt like {{they did not have to}} second-guess their choices and could [...] "explore the world as we were designing" [...] and build a game for themselves. In a 2016 interview, Rand Miller stated that they strived to design the puzzles in Myst and their subsequent games by trying to balance three aspects: the puzzles themselves, the environment, and the story. Rand also stated they wanted to make sure that clues to the solutions to puzzles were apparent and presented to the player in a manner for these connections to be made: [...] "once the player finds the solution, if they blame us, then we haven’t done a good job. But if they blame themselves, then we have." ...|$|E
