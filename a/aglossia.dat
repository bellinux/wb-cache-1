40|$|Introduction <b>Aglossia</b> {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{caused by}} failure of the tongue embryogenesis process (in the fourth to eighth weeks of gestation). The tongue is an organ used in different activities such as sucking, swallowing, chewing, and talking. It is also responsible for shaping palate dental arches (in its absence, they become atrophic). There are few similar cases reported in the literature. Objective To describe a rare case of <b>aglossia</b> and the multidisciplinary professionals working together for 5 years to treat the patient. Resumed Report An 8 -year-old girl with <b>aglossia</b> had an assessment comprising: (1) clinical assessment of the stomatognathic system related to resting posture, tonus, and mobility; (2) orthodontic assessment; (3) surface electromyography of the chewing muscles; (4) swallowing videofluoroscopy. Conclusion The authors confirmed the need of multidisciplinary cooperation to improve the patient's quality of life, because agenesia implicates many activities/functions that depend on the tongue to fully work. Multiprofessional cooperation helps the patient learn compensation mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|Our {{aim is to}} {{show how}} {{in the image of}} the barbarian, of the 'otherness', the Greek culture has largely made use of the {{linguistic}} aspect, the voices, the sounds of the non-Greek world. The Greek attitude to link the barbarian language to the animal sphere and to recognize a sort of pathological state in it, is clearly present in meaningful passages from epic literature, drama works, historiography, Aristotelian and Aristotelian school treatises. It is a 'non-language' totally equivalent to utter silence due to its negative effects on communication and social relationships. In its most radical aspects the barbarian world is given the connotation of <b>aglossia,</b> i. e. absolute silence and extreme end between the Greek and barbarian distinction...|$|E

40|$|Developing Xenopus embryos treated during {{gastrulation}} with 22 micrograms/l of salmar calcitonin in {{the ambient}} water develop into larvae exhibiting {{a decrease in}} interocular distance. In view of the hypocalcaemic properties of calcitonin {{and the importance of}} calcium ions in cell aggregation, this phenomenon has been attributed to an alteration in cell adhesion which results in faulty cell migration during gastrulation with consequent abnormalities of the prechordal region of the archenteron roof and the overlying neural plate. Histological examination of affected specimens shows that the principal defect arising from the prechordal mesoderm and prechordal plate is <b>aglossia</b> and a severely reduced oral cavity. This results in narrowing of the head and consequent decrease in interocular distance. Accompanying this effect is distortion of the diencephalon and third ventricle, which may indicate faulty induction of the neural plate by the perturbed subjacent prechordal region...|$|E
40|$|Otocephaly {{is a rare}} lethal neurocristopathy {{of first}} branchial arch, {{characterized}} by agnathia (agenesis of mandible), ventro-medial displacement and midline fusion of external ears (synotia), microstomia (small mouth) and <b>aglossia</b> (absence of tongue) or microglossia (small tongue). This anomaly {{is a consequence of}} failure of migration of neural crest cells from hind brain which contributes to the development of maxillary and mandibular prominences of the first arch. A female fetus of 28 weeks gestation, spontaneously aborted, was received for autopsy. On external examination, the fetus exhibited ventrally placed malformed ears in the neck region, agnathia, microstomia and microglossia. Internal examination revealed situs inversus totalis, atrial septal defect and bilateral absence of mandibular nerves. Our case is unique, and here rendered for publication, due to association of otocephaly with situs inversus totalis in the absence of holoprosencephaly.

40|$|Background: Since making {{communication}} with others {{is the most}} important function of speech, undoubtedly, any type of disorder in speech will affect the human communicability with others. The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate reasons behind the [high] prevalence rate of stammer, producing disorders and <b>aglossia.</b> Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 118 male and female students, who were studying in a primary school in Zahedan; they had referred to the Speech Therapy Centers of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences in a period of seven months. The speech therapist examinations, diagnosis tools common in speech therapy, Spielberg Children Trait and also patients ' cases were used to find the reasons behind the [high] prevalence rate of speech disorders. Results: Psychological causes had the highest rate of correlation with the speech disorders among the other factors affecting the speech disorders. After psychological causes, family history and age of the subjects are the other factors which may bring about the speech disorders (P< 0. 05). Bilingualism and birth order has a negative relationship with the speech disorders. Likewise, another result of this study shows that only psychologica...|$|E
40|$|A 5 -day-old newborn, {{product of}} non-consanguineous marriage, {{presented}} with inability to completely open oral cavity and feeding difficulty. On examination, {{there was a}} good sucking reflex and limited mouth opening (Fig. A) with retrognathia (Fig. B). Maxillary CT with 3 D reconstruction revealed hypo-plasia of the ascending branches of the mandible; the temporomandibular joints were normal (Fig. C, D) with bilateral Maxillomandibular Syngnathia (Fig. E, F). Congenital fusion of the maxilla and mandible is a rare anomaly which is usually diagnosed at birth owing to inability to open mouth and feed. Congeni-tal synostosis of the mandible and maxilla is even less common than synechiae, with only 25 cases re-ported in the literature [1]. Congenital maxillo-mandibular fusion may be associated with other anomalies such as Van der Woude syndrome, or Bilateral Maxillo-Mandibular Syngnathia in a Newborn Journal of Neonatal Surgery Vol. 3 (4); 2014 aglossia-adactylia syndrome [2]. Dawson et al [3] di-vided bony syngnathia into two broad categories: Type 1 - simple syngnathia without any associated congenital anomalies of head and neck and Type 2 -complex syngnathia with associated congenital anomalies of head and neck. This is further sub classified into Type 2 a with associated <b>aglossia</b> and Type 2 b with associated agenesis or hypoplasia of proximal mandible [3].

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that maternal folic acid (FA) deficiency during pregnancy {{is a risk}} factor for abnormal development. The tongue, with multiple genes working together in a coordinated cascade in time and place, has emerged as a target organ for testing the effect of FA during development. A FA-deficient (FAD) diet was administered to eight-week-old C 57 /BL/ 6 J mouse females for 2 – 16 weeks. Pregnant dams were sacrificed at gestational day 17 (E 17). The tongues and heads of 15 control and 210 experimental fetuses were studied. In the tongues, the maximum width, base width, height and area were compared with width, height and area of the head. All measurements decreased from 10 % to 38 % with increasing number of weeks on maternal FAD diet. Decreased head and tongue areas showed a harmonic reduction (Spearman nonparametric correlation, Rho = 0. 802) with respect to weeks on a maternal FAD diet. Tongue congenital abnormalities showed a 10. 9 % prevalence, divided in <b>aglossia</b> (3. 3 %) and microglossia (7. 6 %), always accompanied by agnathia (5. 6 %) or micrognathia (5. 2 %). This {{is the first time that}} tongue alterations have been related experimentally to maternal FAD diet in mice. We propose that the tongue should be included in the list of FA-sensitive birth defect organs due to its relevance in several key food and nutrition processes...|$|E
40|$|Lower jaw {{development}} is a complex process in which multiple signaling cascades establish a proximal-distal organization. These cascades are regulated both spatially and temporally and are constantly refined through both induction of normal signals and inhibition of inappropriate signals. The connective tissue of the tongue arises from cranial neural crest cell-derived ectomesenchyme within the mandibular portion of the first pharyngeal arch {{and is likely to}} be impacted by this signaling. Although the developmental mechanisms behind later aspects of tongue development, including innervation and taste acquisition, have been elucidated, the early patterning signals driving ectomesenchyme into a tongue lineage are largely unknown. We show here that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Hand 2 plays key roles in establishing the proximal-distal patterning of the mouse lower jaw, in part through establishing a negative-feedback loop in which Hand 2 represses Dlx 5 and Dlx 6 expression in the distal arch ectomesenchyme following Dlx 5 - and Dlx 6 -mediated induction of Hand 2 expression in the same region. Failure to repress distal Dlx 5 and Dlx 6 expression results in upregulation of Runx 2 expression in the mandibular arch and the subsequent formation of aberrant bone in the lower jaw along with proximal-distal duplications. In addition, there is an absence of lateral lingual swelling expansion, from which the tongue arises, resulting in <b>aglossia.</b> Hand 2 thus appears to establish a distal mandibular arch domain that is conducive for lower jaw development, including the initiation of tongue mesenchyme morphogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The primary cilium is a ubiquitous, microtubule-based {{organelle}} that cells utilize to transduce molecular signals. Ciliopathies are a {{group of}} diseases that are caused by a disruption in the structure or function of the primary cilium. Over 30 % of all ciliopathies are primarily defined by their craniofacial phenotypes, which typically include midfacial defects, cleft lip/palate, micrognathia, <b>aglossia</b> and craniosynostosis. The frequency and severity of craniofacial phenotypes in ciliopathies emphasizes the importance of the cilium during development of the craniofacial complex. Molecularly, many ciliopathic mutants, including the avian talpid 2 (ta 2), report pathologically high levels of full-length GLI 3 (GLI 3 FL), which can go on to function as an activator (GLIA), and reduced production of truncated GLI 3 (GLI 3 T), which can go on to function as a repressor (GLIR). These observations suggest that the craniofacial phenotypes of ciliary mutants like ta 2 are caused either by excessive activity of the GLIA or reduced activity of GLIR. To decipher between these two scenarios, we examined GLI 3 occupation at the regulatory regions of target genes and subsequent target gene expression. Using in silico strategies we identified consensus GLI binding regions (GBRs) in the avian genome and confirmed GLI 3 binding to the regulatory regions of its targets by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). In ta 2 mutants, there was a strikingly low number of GLI 3 target genes that had significantly increased expression in facial prominences compared to the control embryo and GLI 3 occupancy at GBRs associated with target genes was largely reduced. In vitro DNA binding assays, further supported ChIP results, indicated that the excessive GLI 3 FL generated in ta 2 mutants did not bind to GBRs. In light of these results, we explored the possibility of GLI co-regulator proteins playing a role in regulatory mechanism of GLI-mediated transcription. Taken together our studies suggest that craniofacial ciliopathic phenotypes are produced via reduced GLIT production, allowing for target gene transcription to be mediated by the combinatorial code of GLI co-regulators...|$|E
