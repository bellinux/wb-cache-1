5|$|Images of Bhikshatana {{are found}} {{throughout}} Shaiva temples of South India, but are almost unknown in Northern India. Sculpted in stone adorning the temple walls {{of every other}} South Indian temple, images of Bhikshatana are also cast in bronze as processional icons. In South Indian temples, Bhikshatana is prescribed to be enshrined as an avarana-devata (a deity depicted on the circumambulatory path encircling the central shrine). Similarly in Orissan temples, Bhikshatana may be worshipped and depicted as parshva-devata (<b>an</b> <b>attendant</b> deity) or avarana-devata.|$|E

Several of his poems {{had been published}} in magazines and small collections, including Goblin Feet and , a reworking of the nursery rhyme Hey Diddle Diddle.

5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed <b>an</b> <b>attendant</b> next to the painting to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E
5|$|Jemima {{tells her}} life story to Maria and Darnford, {{explaining}} {{that she was}} born a bastard. Jemima's mother died {{while she was still}} an infant, making her already precarious social position worse.

5000|$|Jisha (侍者), {{along with}} the titles inji and sannō, are Japanese terms used in {{reference}} to the personal <b>attendant</b> of <b>a</b> monastery's abbot or teacher in Zen Buddhism. In the Rinzai school, the term is usually either inji or sannō. According to the book 3 Bowls: Vegetarian Recipes from an American Zen Buddhist Monastery, [...] "While the jikijitsu is the stern father of the zendo, the jisha is the den mother, balancing the strictness that his counterpoint establishes. The jisha prepares for and greets all guests, tends {{to the needs of the}} students, takes care of the sick, and organizes the cleaning of the monastery." [...] According to author Victor Sōgen Hori, [...] "In the Northern Sung period, a master of a large monastery had two attendants, but by the Yüan period the number of attendants had increased to five: <b>an</b> incense <b>attendant,</b> <b>a</b> secretary <b>attendant,</b> <b>a</b> guest <b>attendant,</b> <b>a</b> robe <b>attendant,</b> and <b>a</b> 'hot water and medicine' attendant who cooked for him." ...|$|R

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Shashthi's roots {{can be traced}} to Hindu folk traditions. References to this goddess appear in Hindu scriptures as early as 8th and 9th century BCE, in which she is associated with children as well as the Hindu war-god Skanda. Early references consider her a foster-mother of Skanda, but in later texts she is identified with Skanda's consort, Devasena. In some early texts where Shashthi appears as <b>an</b> <b>attendant</b> of Skanda, she is said to cause diseases in the mother and child, and thus needed to be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth. However, over time, this malignant goddess became seen as the benevolent saviour and bestower of children.|$|E

The Wellbeing Centre is a multi-purpose facility with a swimming pool, dance studio, library, gym, meeting rooms, and café.|$|E

5|$|Walpole's {{taste for}} {{adventure}} did not diminish {{in his last}} years. In 1939 he was commissioned to report for William Randolph Hearst's newspapers on the funeral in Rome of Pope Pius XI, the conclave to elect his successor, and the subsequent coronation. A fellow correspondent was Tom Driberg, whose memoirs tell of a lunch à deux at which Walpole arrived flushed with excitement from a sexual encounter that morning with <b>an</b> <b>attendant</b> in the Borghese Palace. In the weeks between the funeral and Pius XII's election Walpole, with his customary fluency, wrote much of his book Roman Fountain, a mixture of fact and fiction about the city. This was his last overseas visit.|$|E
5|$|A deck {{decompression}} chamber (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two compartment {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient space in the main chamber for two or more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows <b>an</b> <b>attendant</b> to be locked in or out during treatment of the occupant(s) of the main chamber. There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most {{deck decompression chamber}}s are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gonzalo {{originated}} in a tropical wave {{that emerged from}} the western coast of Africa on October 4 and trekked across the Atlantic. Despite <b>an</b> <b>attendant</b> expanse of clouds and thunderstorms, hostile winds from an upper-level trough hindered cyclogenesis. On October 10, after encountering an eastward-propagating Kelvin wave, the system developed more concentrated convection. With conditions increasingly favorable for further development, the disturbance gradually became better organized, forming a small low pressure area by October 11. In turn, a tropical depression formed at 00:00UTC on October 12, located approximately 390mi (630km) east of the Leeward Islands. Continued maturation amid warm waters and low wind shear yielded Tropical Storm Gonzalo 12 hours later. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not begin issuing advisories on the cyclone until midday on October 12, after a Hurricane Hunter flight into the system reported surface winds of 40mph (65km/h).|$|E

50|$|Hochschild gives a clear example on how {{companies}} {{maximize their}} profits {{through the use}} of feeling rules by viewing the job of <b>a</b> flight <b>attendant.</b> <b>A</b> flight <b>attendant's</b> job requires emotional labor. The flight attendance uplifts the customer through his or her demeanor and expression of feelings. <b>A</b> flight <b>attendant</b> who is constantly smiling or asking the customer how they are doing is more comforting to a customer versus if <b>a</b> flight <b>attendant</b> who rolls their eyes and rarely smiles. The feeling rules for <b>a</b> flight <b>attendant</b> calls for them to be happy, calm, and to suppress their negative feelings. Customers who see the way the flight attendant upholds themselves are more likely to come back if the experience was pleasant. Which is why many airlines like Delta, which was rated {{as one of the top}} airlines calls and requires these feeling rules at the workplace. In a way, this is beneficial to the companies and the customer because the customer is satisfied and keeps coming back, which makes the company more money. However, at the same time, it can be harmful to the flight attendant because they are not able to express their feelings, but rather suppress their feelings for the benefit of others.|$|R

The sleeping woman beside the tomb is either another such, or <b>an</b> <b>attendant</b> on the princess. As Constantina sleeps, Agnes, holding her lamb, appears to her, saying Si in xpm (Christum) credideris sanaberis ("If you believe in Christ you will be healed", an adaptation of the text in the source).
