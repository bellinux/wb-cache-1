40|$|Language is {{a special}} means of {{communication}} for people. People can express their needs and requests {{by means of the}} language. Thanks to the richness of the vocabulary, {{people will be able to}} express themselves in a right way. At this point, tale books are the most important resources in the development of childrens’ vocabulary. The children gain sensitivity for books in pre-school period and in first years of primary school, so for the first time in these periods they meet tales, one of the most important products of children literature. Therefore, the tales has a crucious role in the development of children’s language. This importance has increased more in 2012 – 2013 <b>education</b> year <b>as</b> <b>our</b> <b>education</b> system has changed. This study is a descriptive inquiry in the model of searching, so, at first we had an inquiry and gave the definitions of language development and vocabulary and underlined their importance. Secondly we have tried to define in what ways the tales make contribution to children’s vocabulary. We explained the identified features in details through the world and Turkish classical tales and we also gave some activtiy examples that will improve primary school children’s vocabulary. In this study, our aim is to explain the importance of the tales for primary school children and to improve children’s word and concept stocks by preparing activities with the help of novels...|$|R

So we were fascinated and inspired by “Learning from the Extremes, ” a recent paper from Charlie Leadbeater and Annika Wong. Its core argument is that the developed world has much to learn from entrepreneurial approaches to providing learning opportunities found in the developing world. This is an important and valuable insight for <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> around the world. In <b>our</b> work with <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> we often see a significant gap between inspiring stories and examples, and the reality of leading and driving improvement education while managing political, cultural, and financial pressures. Those pressures have never been more challenging. We have recognized that leaders who want to transform education systems, who are on the road to ”Education 3. 0, ” need to steer not only their formal school system but also a wider ecosystem of new providers, cultural organizations, and new opportunities for informal learning. They {{need to be able to}} harness the power of innovative approaches, to learn from what works. Leadbeater and Wong looked at innovative responses to very different circumstances and contexts to see whether these provide ideas about how we could solve common root problems and support different modes of learning.

40|$|Student-generated {{feedback}} is an Assessment for Learning practice which, when used well, {{can lead to}} strong student engagement and self-regulation. In the New Zealand context high value {{is placed on the}} principles of Assessment for Learning, yet teachers struggle to implement strategies successfully. In order to evaluate the impact of the use of student-generated feedback practices in essay writing in the English classroom student perceptions have been sought. This practitioner research has used a mixed methods approach to gather students’ perceptions by means of a Likert scale questionnaire, one-on-one semi-structured interviews, a teacher diary and feedback artefacts. The results show that students perceived student-generated feedback practices to be beneficial for themselves and their learning. There is evidence that these practices led to significant student engagement, as well as the development of student self-regulation. When seen from a social constructivist perspective, student-generated feedback practices created new identities for students and the teacher in the classroom, impacting on power dynamics and classroom culture. While the teacher continued to be a valuable guide and contributor to learning, students saw themselves as agents of their own learning, in an apprentice-like relationship with their teacher. The findings of this study are relevant to teachers who want to improve their practice by using student-generated feedback {{as part of a broader}} picture of partnership with students. This is becoming increasingly important for all teachers <b>as</b> <b>our</b> <b>education</b> system moves away from a traditional top-down, teacher-led style of teaching and learning towards a student–teacher collaborative approach...|$|R

This research extends studies done by S. Irlbeck (2001) and K. C. Newtzie (2002) to determine the leadership attributes most descriptive of effective distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders.</b> Irlbeck and Newtzie specifically studied transformational leadership attributes in distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> and determined that transformational leadership qualities were used. This author went beyond transformational leadership to determine what additional attributes were useful to distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders.</b> Using the Leadership Attributes Inventory (LAI) Survey developed by Moss, Lambrecht, Jensrud, & Finch in 1994, this researcher surveyed current distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> to determine what attributes they felt were most descriptive of effective distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders.</b> With {{a response rate of}} 34. 6 %, 191 distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> rated “Committed to the Common Good”; “Ethical”; “Dependable, Reliable”; “Adaptable, Open to Change”; “Accountable”; “Willingness to Accept Responsibility”; “Integrity”; “Visionary”; and “Initiating ” as the most descriptive attributes. The survey data supports the idea that transformational leadership attributes help to make effective distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders,</b> but adds to this information with additional attributes that will be useful to distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders.</b> These survey results provide institutions with the knowledge necessary to hire effective distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders.</b> In addition, the results will support future development of educational and professional training opportunities for distance education leadership. ii...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Nursing)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The nursing <b>education</b> <b>leader</b> {{provides}} visionary {{leadership to}} his/her organisation, {{as well as}} to the profession of nursing, and must have t he authority and resources necessary to ensure nursing education and training standards are met. This link between professional practice and operational activity of the organisation leads to greater involvement in decision making and fosters collaboration within nursing education and training and interdisciplinary teams. A collaborative approach contributes to quality education and training. It involves lecturers participating in a common vision for their workplaces and being recognised for their unique contribution. Nursing education leadership is required to work out work schedules and to ensure that proper service rendering is at the order of t he day. Nursing <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> are appointed according to their academic achievement and not their managerial or leadership skills. Policies, t he environment, and the workplace have, however changed significantly over the past couple of years. This has left nursing <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> without a proper model to manage and lead the structure of their Nursing Education Institutions. As part of the process of reaching the academic level, leadership skills will play a secondary role. Although this. is the reality, leadership skills need to be addressed as part of the total armour of the nursing <b>education</b> <b>leader.</b> Based on the problem statement the following research questions were posed: -• How can a model for transformational leadership be developed for nursing <b>education</b> ?<b>leaders</b> in Nursing <b>Education</b> Institutions. To answer this question the following sub questions were posed: -• What are the concepts and related concepts in transformational leadership for nursing <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> in the context of Nursing Education Institution? • What is the relationship between these concepts and how can these relationships be constructed for the development of a model for transformational leadership for nursing education in the Nursing Education Institution? As it is the researcher's intention to identify the concepts from an emic perspective, the following questions were formulated: • What are the expectations of the lecturers, students and administrative personnel of nursing <b>education</b> <b>leaders?</b> • What are present leadership styles used by nursing <b>education</b> <b>leaders?</b> The overall aim of this study was to: • Develop a model for transformational leadership for nursing <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> in Nursing <b>Education</b> Institutions. In order to achieve this aim the following objectives were formulated: PHASE 1 OBJECTIVES The objectives of phase 1 were formulated to enable the identification and classification of concepts in relations to transformation to transformational leadership of nursing <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> in the Nursing Education Institutions. These objectives were as follows: • Phase 1 (a) To explore and describe the expectations of the nurse educators, students and administrative personnel from nursing <b>education</b> <b>leaders.</b> To describe the present leadership styles used by nursing <b>education</b> <b>leaders.</b> PHASE 2 OBJECTIVES To develop and describe a model for transformational leadership for nursing <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> in the Nursing Education Institutions, the following objectives were formulated: Phase 2 (a) : To describe the concepts in the model for transformational leadership for nursing <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> in the Nursing Education Institutions Phase 2 (b) : To construct relational statements between concepts, Phase 2 (c) : To critically reflect on the model for transformational leadership for nursing <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> in the Nursing Education InstitutionsDoctora...|$|R

Between 1997 – 2001, a system-wide innovation of distance education was adopted by the 23 colleges in the VCCS. ^ Research participants were distance <b>education</b> faculty and <b>leaders</b> in the Virginia Community College System. The Multifactor College Leadership Questionnaire (MCLQ-III) was used with permission to identify transformational leadership qualities in distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders.</b> Web-based surveys were e-mailed to 546 distance education faculty members and distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> in the 23 institutions. Dependent variables of distance education student enrollment, institutional size, and location of college were used to determine possible differences in transformational leadership qualities in distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders.</b> No significant differences were found when testing for those variables. ^ Interviews with distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> focused on decreasing faculty resistance to change, and their roles when integrating distance education into their colleges. Focus groups, composed of distance education faculty members from various colleges in the VCCS, identified (a) leadership behaviors and qualities associated with successes in distance education, and (b) common themes of leadership for success in a distance learning initiative. Qualitative findings generally supported survey responses on the existence of transformational leadership qualities in distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> during organizational change. ^ Leader-follower congruence, a state of similarity or agreement between leaders and followers, was examined quantitatively and qualitatively. In this study, transformational leadership qualities were identified among selected distance <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> in the VCCS during a time of systemic change. However, findings were inconclusive concerning the relationship between transformational leadership qualities and institutionalization of change to distance education throughout colleges in the VCCS. ...|$|R

40|$|The current {{technological}} development {{has led to}} an increase in the complexity of reality which in turn has complicated the task of the <b>education</b> <b>leader</b> as manager. The <b>education</b> <b>leader</b> has become a personnel manager responsible for the management of both staff and pupil activities in order to realize the school's objectives effectively. These tendencies indicate that the <b>education</b> <b>leader</b> must be capable of adapting his management style to the needs of his staff {{in order to be able}} to increase the producti= vity of his staff. The <b>education</b> <b>leader</b> must also have the necessary flexibility to select from a variety of management styles according to the demands of the specific situation. Situational Leadership is ideally suited to meet the demands of the task of the <b>education</b> <b>leader,</b> because it accommodates the level of task maturity of each staff member. The emphasis is placed on the relationship between the leader and the follower with the needs of the follower as the most crucial factor in the relationship. Three aspects are essential for successful Situational Leadership, viz., the correct amount of task behaviour or direction by the leader; the correct amount of relationship behaviour or support by the leader cor= relating with the level of task maturity of the followers. However, other situational variables, such as superiors, the organization and time must also be taken into consideration. Situational Leadership also makes prov 1 s 1 on for contracting for a leadership style whereby the <b>education</b> <b>leader</b> and the teacher come to an agreement about the appropriate leadership style to be used to help the teacher accomplish his/her objectives. The developmental aspect of Situational Leadership provides the means by which the <b>education</b> <b>leader</b> can contribute meaningfully to the development of his staff, e. g. leadership potential, motivation, morale, commitment to objectives, decision-makirrg, communication and problem solving.

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{religious}} <b>education</b> <b>leader</b> {{is a relatively new}} role within Catholic education in Australia. This leadership position has evolved since the time of its emergence in the decades following Vatican II; however, {{there appears to be a}} lack of clarity and understanding about the role and its impact upon a school. While {{the religious}} <b>education</b> <b>leader</b> plays a significant role in building a school community, a recent study which sought to discover the kinds of support these leaders need found that many religious <b>education</b> <b>leaders</b> encountered experiences of disconnectedness in their own school communities. Drawing on the insights emerging from that study, this paper provides an overview of the development of the role. While the general trend associated with these developments in religious education leadership have been oriented towards raising the profile of religious education leadership in Catholic schools there remains a lack of clarity about the role. This has contributed to experiences of disconnectedness amongst many religious <b>education</b> <b>leaders.</b> This paper aims to identify some of these experiences and suggest practical ways of overcoming them...|$|R
