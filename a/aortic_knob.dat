30|$|On radiographs, double arches {{appear as}} {{bilateral}} <b>aortic</b> <b>knobs</b> with midline compression of the trachea. Pulmonary overinflation {{can result from}} air trapping. Lateral radiographs show focal tracheal narrowing and anterior bowing. Oesophagography shows bilateral oesophageal indentation on the AP projection and posterior indentation on the lateral projection. On axial CT images, the characteristic appearance of the double arch is the “four-artery sign” (Fig.  2 b), referring to a symmetrical trapezoidal or square appearance of the four arch branch vessels {{at the level of}} the thoracic inlet. Two arches are seen originating from the ascending aorta and extending on either side of the trachea and oesophagus to form a complete ring. The descending thoracic aorta is located on the left.|$|R

5000|$|According to Stephen Parker, who {{reviewed}} Brecht's {{writings and}} unpublished medical records, Brecht contracted rheumatic fever as a child, {{which led to}} an enlarged heart, followed by lifelong chronic heart failure and Sydenham's chorea. A report of a radiograph taken of Brecht in 1951 describes a badly diseased heart, enlarged to the left with a protruding <b>aortic</b> <b>knob</b> and with seriously impaired pumping. Brecht's colleagues described him as being very nervous, and sometimes shaking his head or moving his hands erratically. This can be reasonably attributed to Sydenham's chorea, which is also associated with emotional lability, personality changes, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and hyperactivity, which matched Brecht's behavior. [...] "What is remarkable," [...] wrote Parker, [...] "is his capacity to turn abject physical weakness into peerless artistic strength, arrhythmia into the rhythms of poetry, chorea into the choreography of drama." ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{determine}} the usefulness of the <b>aortic</b> <b>knob</b> width (AKW) in the assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients. Methods: In this study on diagnostic accuracy, 374 consecutive hypertensive patients with at least one cardiovascular risk factor were enrolled. AKW was measured on chest X-ray. Cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) was measured by VaSera- 1000 CAVI instrument. The diagnostic value of AKW was assessed using ROC analysis. Results: There was a significant correlation between <b>aortic</b> <b>knob</b> width and CAVI (r= 0. 45, p< 0. 001), age (0. 39, p< 0. 001), systolic (r= 0. 17, p< 0. 001), diastolic (r= 0. 23, p< 0. 001) and mean (r= 0. 2, p< 0. 001) blood pressures. In linear regression analysis CAVI (β= 0. 3, 95 % CI 0. 33 - 0. 98, p< 0. 001), age (β= 0. 3, 95 % CI 0. 09 - 0. 21, p< 0. 001) and diastolic blood pressure β= 0. 2, 95 % CI 0. 08 - 1. 9, p< 0. 001) were independently associated with AKW. It was significantly higher in patients with subclinical atherosclerosis (CAVI ≥ 9) than borderline (8 ≤CAVI < 9) (41. 4 ± 5. 5 versus 36. 7 ± 5. 3 mm, p< 0. 001) and healthy (CAVI < 8) subjects (41. 4 ± 5. 5 versus 35. 5 ± 4. 3 mm, p< 0. 001). Analysis using the ROC curve has demonstrated that <b>aortic</b> <b>knob</b> of 41 mm constitutes the cut-off value for the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis with 71 % sensitivity and 77 % specificity (AUC- 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 51 - 0. 82). Conclusion: Observation of <b>aortic</b> <b>knob</b> on chest X-ray in hypertensive patients may provide important predictive information of subclinical atherosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{tried to}} {{determine}} the validity of sixteen well-known signs indicating an acute traumatic rup-ture of the aorta on plain chest radio-graphs of 22 patients. Angiograph-ically 11 of the patients had a tear at the aortic isthmus. It turned out that seven of the sixteen signs (widened mediastinum, loss of the <b>aortic</b> <b>knob</b> contour, opacification of the aorto-pulmonary window, bulging of the vascular pedicle predominantly to the left, left apical cap, depression of the left main stem bronchus, and dis-placement of the right paraspinous interspace) are of great diagnostic value...|$|E
40|$|A right {{aortic arch}} usually {{produces}} several abnormal shadows {{on a standard}} frontal film of the chest. The <b>aortic</b> <b>knob</b> protrudes from {{the right side of}} the medi-astinum, the trachea is deviated to the left, and the descending aorta can be identified along {{the right side of the}} spine. A more conclusive diagnosis can be made from the indentation produced by the arch on the barium-filled esophagus. This also serves to distinguish the two types of right aortic arch. The presence of a large indentation on the posterior aspect of the esophagus is characteristic of the type of arch most frequently associated with a vascular ring. A right arch without a posterior component is commonly associated with significant congenital heart disease. THE DIAGNOSIS of a right aortic arch can be made from a frontal film of the chest when the <b>aortic</b> <b>knob</b> is identified along the right border of the mediastinum. How-ever, when the knob is not particularly prominent, it can be obscured by the shadows of the other mediastinal structures, and the anomalous position of the aortic arch may be overlooked. On the other hand, a dilated or tortuous aorta can produce a sizable bulge on the mediastinal contour and may be mistaken for a tumor of the mediastinum or of the lung. In general, these diagnostic problems are easily resolved if the patient is given barium to drink and additional films are made. Not only can the aortic arch be localized from the esophagram, but the two different types of right aortic arch, the mirror-image arch and the arch with a posterior diverticulum, can be accurately differentiated from the pattern of the indentations they produce on the esopha-gus. At an early stage in the development of the heart and great vessels, the ascending and descending portions of the aorta are connect...|$|E
40|$|In our hospital, 30 % {{of plain}} chest radiographs are {{performed}} in patients over 70. Somewhat surprisingly, few papers specifically {{dealing with the}} aging lung {{are available in the}} radiological literature. It is obvious however that the differential diagnosis of a chest lesion is not the same if the patient is 40 or 70. A false positive diagnosis is a frequent potential mistake in aging subjects, for example: chondral calcification versus pulmonary nodule, hyperinflation versus emphysema, "normal aging" bronchial and tracheal calcification versus hypercalcemia, diaphragmatic defect versus tumor, diaphragmatic pseudotumor versus lymph node, false diagnosis of <b>aortic</b> <b>knob</b> dissection, false diagnosis of syphilitic aortitis, inaccurate CT-detection of valvular and coronary calcifications, confusion between valvular and annular mitral calcification.

30|$|Incomplete medial {{migration}} {{of the right}} posterior cardinal vein, a precursor of the azygos vein, gives rise to an azygos lobe of the right lung in 0.4  %– 1  % of the population. This anomaly can be easily indentified on CT scans, which show the azygos vein more laterally than the usual anterior arching before entering the superior vena cava (SVC) or right brachiocephalic vein. An aortic nipple can be identified when the left superior intercostal vein, draining the left second, third and fourth posterior intercostal veins, connects to the left brachiocephalic vein, forming the aortic nipple. It {{can be seen on}} a frontal radiograph as a small soft-tissue density adjacent to the lateral border of the <b>aortic</b> <b>knob</b> in about 10  % of normal patients. Contrast-enhanced chest CT images show a curvilinear contrast-filled vessel along the left lateral border of the aorta that can usually be traced from the left brachiocephalic vein to the region of the accessory hemiazygos vein [3].|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{life-threatening}} aortic transection with concomitant mitral papillary muscle rupture and severe lung contusion caused by a failed parachute jump. This blunt thoracic injury was treated by early stabilization with extracorporeal mem-brane oxygenation followed by successful delayed graft repair of the descending aorta and mitral valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis. (Tex Heart Inst J 2003; 30 : 65 - 7) n August 1998, a 32 -year-old man experienced a serious deceleration trauma during a parachute jump when the parachute only partially opened. The pa-tient was transferred immediately to a local hospital where artificial ventilation was started. Chest radiography showed a widened mediastinum with obscuring of the <b>aortic</b> <b>knob.</b> Other f indings were lung contusion, especially in {{the upper part of}} the left lung, and fractures of the left clavicle, left maxilla, and left rib cage.

40|$|Background and Purpose: We {{studied the}} {{frequency}} and grade of atherosclerotic changes in the thoracic aorta and their significance as embologenic lesions in patients with stroke. Methods: Using transesophageal echocardiography, we evaluated complicated lesions in the thoracic aortas of 62 patients who met our clinical criteria for embolic stroke. A complicated lesion {{was defined as a}} raised lesion with an irregular surface or acoustic shadow based on a comparative study of echocardiographic and histopathologic findings. The results were compared with plain radiographic findings and in some cases with computed tomographic or aortographic findings. Results: Twenty-six patients (42 %) showed complicated aortic arch lesions on echocardiogram. Transesophageal echocardiography brought us more abundant information than other techniques. <b>Aortic</b> <b>knob</b> calcification by plain radiography correlated well with the presence of echocardiographically complicated lesions, suggesting its utility for rough screening of atherosclerotic changes. Fifty-two patients had other potential embolic sources in the heart or cervical arteries. Among the remaining 10 patients without extra-aortic embolic sources, three showed complicated lesions and were diagnosed as having aortogenic embolic stroke. Conclusions: Aortic atherosclerosis should be recognized as an embolic source of stroke and th...|$|E
40|$|To aid in {{diagnostic}} chest film {{interpretation of}} coal workers' pneumoconiosis, a composite profile of common radiologic patterns {{was developed in}} 98 Appalachian former coal miners who were diagnosed as having coal miner's pneumoconiosis and who applied for black lung benefits. The mean age was 61 years, with a lifetime coal mine dust exposure of 18. 7 years. Results showed that chest radiographs of coal workers' simple pneumoconiosis contained small irregular linear opacities more frequently (47 %) than small rounded opacities. Sparse profusion of all small opacities was the rule. Small opacities involved two out of six lung zones simultaneously 39 % of the time while other combinations occurred less frequently. Lower zones were involved more frequently than upper ones. Thickened pleura occurred in 18 % of radiographs. Other frequent radiographic abnormalities were parenchymal calcifications (19 %), marked emphysema (12 %), and inactive tuberculosis (12 %). Calcification of the <b>aortic</b> <b>knob,</b> a degenerative process reflecting age, occurred in 9 %. Only one instance of complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis (progressive massive fibrosis) was encountered (0. 7 %). Many of the descriptive features of coal workers' pneumoconiosis noted in the literature were not observed in this study. Only one instance of complicated pneumoconiosis was encountered...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of data {{regarding}} the nor-mal anatomical variations of the <b>aortic</b> <b>knob</b> (AK) on routine postero-anterior chest radi-ographs (PACR). The aims {{of the present study}} were to document and analyze the anatomical variations of the AK on PACRs ’ in an adult Indian population. This was a cross-sectional study of PACRs ’ in a tertiary care hospital with attached medical college in Ban-galore, India. The AKs ’ in 108 (77 males and 31 females) PACRs ’ of normal, healthy adults were studied using the following measure-ments: minimum distance of the left edge of the aortic knuckle from the midline (AKW); straight and curved length of the AK (AKS and AKC). The ratio of the AKC to the AKS was calculated and termed the AK index (AKI). The mean and standard deviation were determined for AKW, AKS and AKI. The unpaired t-test was used to check for signifi-cant sex differences in the above parameters. Spearman’s rank order correlation coefficient of the AKW, AKS and AKI with the age, BMI, CD, CA and CTR was calculated. The mean value of the AKW was significantly higher in males as compared to females. The majority of the values of AKI were between 1 and 1. 2 in both sexes. The AKW showed sig-nificant positive correlations with age, the body mass index and cardiac diameter. The AKI showed a weak, although significant pos-itive correlation with the age and the cardio-thoracic ratio. The present study describes the anatomical variations of the AK, using the AKI to quantify its prominence...|$|E
40|$|Accelerated {{atherosclerosis}} is {{very common}} in hemodialysis (HD) patients and is related to morbidity and mortality. The <b>aortic</b> <b>knob</b> width (AKW), which can easily be calculated on chest radiographs has also {{been found to be}} related to atherosclerosis in patients with normal renal function. The importance of AKW in HD patients is not known. The current study is aimed to investigate factors associated with increased AKW in HD patients. The study participants had their medical history taken and a physical examination conducted, with calculation of dialysis adequacy and AKW. AKW was calculated from the chest x-rays {{at the end of the}} dialysis session, when the patients were in their dry weight. A total of 91 HD patients and 65 patients with normal renal function (as a control group) were included. The mean of the AKW was 35. 0 ± 5. 8 mm in HD patients and 26. 6 ± 4. 3 mm in the control group (P < 0. 0001). Stepwise linear regression analysis of both groups combined revealed that age (P: 0. 001), male gender (P < 0. 0001), systolic BP (P < 0. 0001), presence of HD treatment (P: 0. 016), and albumin levels (P: 0. 021) were inde-pendently related with increased AKW. On the other hand, in HD patients stepwise linear regression showed that age (P < 0. 0001), pre-dialysis systolic BP (P: 0. 003), male gender (P < 0. 0001), being a non-smoker (P: 0. 002), total cholesterol (P: 0. 001), and intact parathormone levels (P: 0. 005) were independently associated with increased AKW. In conclusion, AKW is increased in HD patients when compared with the normal population. These preliminary findings may enhance the use of chest radiography as a screening method, and if confirmed, can assist risk stratification in HD patients...|$|E
