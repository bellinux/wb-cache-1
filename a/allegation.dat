5|$|It was {{a serious}} <b>allegation</b> to make against a physician. Reich wrote in his diary that the mother had been {{attracted}} to him and had made the <b>allegation</b> to damage him. She later committed suicide and Reich blamed himself. If Kahn did have an abortion, Turner wrote, {{she was the first}} of four of Reich's partners to do so: his first wife had several, and his long-term partners Elsa Lindenberg and Ilse Ollendorf (his second wife) each had one at Reich's insistence.|$|E
5|$|The core <b>allegation</b> of the Keating Five affair is that Keating {{had made}} {{contributions}} of about $1.3 million to various U.S. Senators, {{and he called}} on those Senators to help him resist regulators. The regulators backed off, to later disastrous consequences.|$|E
5|$|Bright Tunes Music v. Harrisongs Music {{finally went}} to the United States {{district}} court on 23 February 1976, to hear evidence on the <b>allegation</b> of plagiarism.

5000|$|Disjunctive <b>allegations</b> are <b>allegations</b> in a {{pleading}} {{joined together}} by an [...] "or". In a complaint, disjunctive <b>allegations</b> are usually [...] defective because such a pleading does {{not put the}} party on notice of which <b>allegations</b> they must defend.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{how certain}} {{doctoral}} practices come to count as scandalous {{and with what}} effects on universities. To do so, it engages {{with a number of}} recent media <b>allegations</b> that relate to doctoral practice in Australia and elsewhere. The analysis of these <b>allegations</b> is developed in terms of three broad categories, namely <b>allegations</b> of silliness in relation to thesis content, <b>allegations</b> of softness in relation to entry, rigour and assessment, and <b>allegations</b> of suspect conduct and/or credentials. The impact of such <b>allegations</b> on university governance is then addressed...|$|R
5|$|In April 2007, {{a case of}} {{copyright}} infringement was filed on the film's producer and director that prompted a court to stall the screening of the film. The <b>allegation</b> {{pointed out that the}} film was made based on a compilation of short stories that was released in 1997.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 2017, Mayor Murray {{announced}} he would not seek re-election following a lawsuit alleging sexual abuse of several teenaged boys in the 1980s. Murray resigned as mayor on September 12, 2017, effective at 5p.m. on September 13, 2017, hours after the Seattle Times reported a fifth <b>allegation</b> of child sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{never left}} the box, but instead conferred {{together}} and found Thornton not guilty in six minutes. They were then resworn on the rape <b>allegation.</b> The prosecution informed the court {{that it had no}} evidence to offer on that count, and Mr Justice Holroyd directed the jury to find the prisoner not guilty of rape, which they did. Thornton was set free.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} 2007/8 period, Wiltshire Police {{received}} 234 complaints and 460 <b>allegations.</b> Wiltshire has an above-average 358 <b>allegations</b> per 100 officers, spread across five categories.

50|$|Of the 11,000 <b>allegations</b> {{reported}} by bishops in the John Jay study, 3,300 were not investigated because the <b>allegations</b> were made after the accused priest had died. 6,700 <b>allegations</b> were substantiated, leaving 1,000 {{that could not}} be substantiated.|$|R
5|$|Demosthenes {{was born}} in 384 BC, {{during the last year}} of the 98thOlympiad or {{the first year of the}} 99thOlympiad. His father—also named Demosthenes—who belonged to the local tribe, Pandionis, and lived in the deme of Paeania in the Athenian countryside, was a wealthy sword-maker. Aeschines, Demosthenes' {{greatest}} political rival, maintained that his mother Kleoboule was a Scythian by blood—an <b>allegation</b> disputed by some modern scholars. Demosthenes was orphaned at the age of seven. Although his father provided well for him, his legal guardians, Aphobus, Demophon and Therippides, mishandled his inheritance.|$|E
5|$|Followers of Biko's ideas re-organised as the Azanian People's Organisation (AZAPO), which {{subsequently}} {{split into}} the Socialist Party of Azania and the Black People's Convention. Several figures {{associated with the}} ANC denigrated Biko during the 1980s. For instance, members of the ANC-affiliated United Democratic Front assembled outside Biko's Ginsberg home shouting U-Steve Biko, I-CIA!, an <b>allegation</b> that Biko was a spy for the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). These demonstrations resulted in clashes with Biko supporters from AZAPO.|$|E
5|$|Following Reinboldt's death, {{around the}} time that the Mark Foley scandal broke in 2006, Burdge unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to bring the charges against Hastert to light; she contacted ABC News and the Associated Press on an off-the-record basis, and also contacted some advocacy groups. ABC News and the AP could not corroborate Jolene's <b>allegation</b> at the time, and Hastert denied the accusation to ABC News at the time, so the claim was not published.|$|E
40|$|If <b>allegations</b> {{of sexual}} abuse of a child are made after parents separate, the {{challenges}} of resolving custody and visitation issues are greatly increased, with the abuse <b>allegations</b> overshadowing other considerations. These are high conflict cases, and settlement may be very difficult (or inappropriate) to arrange. The involvement {{of a number of}} agencies and professionals, with overlapping responsibilities and potentially conflicting opinions, may complicate the resolution of these cases. A significant proportion of <b>allegations</b> of child abuse made in the context of parental separation are true, but this is a context with a relatively high rate of unfounded <b>allegations.</b> While some cases of untrue <b>allegations</b> are due to fabrication, more commonly unfounded <b>allegations</b> are made in good faith. Preexisting distrust or hostility may result in misunderstandings and unfounded <b>allegations,</b> especially in cases where the children involved are young and the <b>allegations</b> are reported through a parent. Some cases of unfounded <b>allegations</b> may be the product of the emotional disturbance of the accusing parent. This paper discusses how parental separation affects the making of child sexual abuse <b>allegations,</b> with particular emphasis on how separation may contribute to unfounded <b>allegations.</b> Recent research is reviewed, and national data from Canada on <b>allegations</b> of abuse and neglect when parents have separated is presented. Legal issues that arise in these cases are discussed in the context of American and Canadian case law. The authors discuss factors that can help distinguish founded from unfounded cases. The paper concludes by offering some practical advice about the handling of this type of case by mental health professional, judges, and lawyers...|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{reported}} acts of sexual abuse involved fondling or unspecified abuse. There were <b>allegations</b> of forced acts of oral sex and intercourse. Detailed information {{on the nature of}} the abuse was not reported for 26.6% of {{the reported}} <b>allegations.</b> 27.3% of the <b>allegations</b> involved the cleric performing oral sex on the victim. 25.1% of the <b>allegations</b> involved penile penetration or attempted penetration.|$|R

5|$|Hersh's U.S. and Pakistani {{intelligence}} sources {{stated that the}} U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through a Pakistani walk-in seeking the $25 million reward, and not through tracking a courier. NBC News and Agence France-Presse subsequently reported that their sources indicated a walk-in was an extremely valuable asset, though the sources disputed that the walk-in knew the location of bin Laden. Pakistan-based journalist Amir Mir in the News International reported the walk-in's identity to be Usman Khalid, though that <b>allegation</b> was denied by Khalid's family. The White House denied Hersh's report.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Madeleine's Fund hired Oakley International, a Washington, D.C.-registered detective agency, {{for over}} £500,000 for six months.

Led by Henri Exton, a former British police officer {{who had worked for}} MI5, the team engaged in undercover operations within the Ocean Club and among paedophile rings and the Roma community.|$|E
5|$|Official {{documents}} {{support the}} <b>allegation</b> of interference by the 610 Office. In 2009, two separate documents from Jilin province and Liaoning Province described how legal cases against Falun Gong practitioners {{must be approved}} and/or audited by the 610 Office. The 610 Office's organizational proximity to the CPC's Political and Judicial Committee better enables it to exercise influence with the Supreme People's Court and Ministry of Justice, both at the central level and with their counterparts at local levels.|$|E

25|$|Burden {{of proof}} refers most {{generally}} to {{the obligation of}} a party to prove its <b>allegations</b> at trial. In a civil case, the plaintiff sets forth its <b>allegations</b> in a complaint, petition or other pleading. The defendant is then required to file a responsive pleading denying {{some or all of}} the <b>allegations</b> and setting forth any affirmative facts in defense. Each party has the burden of proof of its <b>allegations.</b>|$|R

5|$|On 14August1942, Herring {{was ordered}} to Esk, Queensland, to assume command of II Corps with the {{temporary}} rank of Lieutenant General. As such, {{he was responsible for}} the defence of Brisbane. At this time he was criticised in Federal Parliament by Arthur Calwell for allegedly issuing a verbal order whilst commander of the 6th Division that no officer was to be commissioned unless they had at least attained an Intermediate Certificate. There was no evidence that such an order was ever issued, but the <b>allegation</b> reflected a suspicion that Herring was an elitist.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 1943, a {{response}} to the Australian protest arrived. It stated that the Japanese Government had no information justifying the <b>allegation</b> made, and therefore took no responsibility for what happened. The reply counter-protested that nine Japanese hospital ships had been attacked by the Allies, although these claims were directed against the United States, not Australia. Although several later exchanges were made, the lack of progress saw the British Government inform the Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would be made on the loss of Centaur.|$|E
5|$|Some contemporaries {{alleged that}} Bonaparte was put {{under house arrest}} at Nice for his {{association}} with the Robespierres following their fall in the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794, but Napoleon's secretary Bourrienne disputed the <b>allegation</b> in his memoirs. According to Bourrienne, jealousy was responsible, between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy (with whom Napoleon was seconded at the time). Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defense {{in a letter to}} the commissar Saliceti, and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing.|$|E

50|$|Largely {{coincident}} to this, {{there were}} <b>allegations</b> of financial improprieties between Brown {{and a business}} partner, Nolanda Hill.

5|$|Strafford {{had become}} the {{principal}} target of the Parliamentarians, particularly John Pym, {{and he went on}} trial for high treason on 22 March 1641. However, the key <b>allegation</b> by Sir Henry Vane that Strafford had threatened to use the Irish army to subdue England was not corroborated and on 10 April Pym's case collapsed. Pym and his allies immediately launched a bill of attainder, which simply declared Strafford guilty and pronounced the sentence of death.|$|E
5|$|The {{denomination}} {{with the}} longest history of objection to Freemasonry is the Catholic Church. The objections {{raised by the}} Catholic Church {{are based on the}} <b>allegation</b> that Masonry teaches a naturalistic deistic religion which is in conflict with Church doctrine. A number of Papal pronouncements have been issued against Freemasonry. The first was Pope Clement XII's In eminenti apostolatus, 28 April 1738; the most recent was Pope Leo XIII's Ab apostolici, 15 October 1890. The 1917 Code of Canon Law explicitly declared that joining Freemasonry entailed automatic excommunication, and banned books favouring Freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|The low {{turnout was}} {{attributed}} {{in part to}} poor voter registry maintenance. The registry allegedly contains up to 900,000 nonexistent voters due to poor database maintenance, especially in updating the registry using death certificates and change of residence records. This <b>allegation</b> {{was supported by the}} 2011 census. The poor voter records were subsequently cited as the cause of the low formal turnout, which would otherwise have exceeded 50%. It was later estimated that the actual turnout in Croatia itself, without the diaspora, was 61%.|$|E

5000|$|Findings of {{multiple}} studies performed between 1987 and 1995 {{suggested that the}} rate of false <b>allegations</b> ranged from a low of 6% to a high of 35% of reported child sexual abuse cases. Experts have argued that the reason for the wide range of differences in the rates resulted from different criteria used in various studies. In particular, a lower rate was found in studies that considered false <b>allegations</b> to be based on intentional lying, whereas the higher rates were reported in studies that also added unintentional false <b>allegations</b> resulting from suggestive questioning. [...] A 1992 meta-analysis suggests that false <b>allegations</b> represent between two and ten percent of all <b>allegations.</b>|$|R
