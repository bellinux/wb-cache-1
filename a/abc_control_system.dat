40|$|PURPOSE: Extensive {{radiotherapy}} volumes for tumors of {{the chest}} are partly caused by interfractional organ motion. We evaluated the feasibility of respiratory observation tools using the active breathing <b>control</b> (<b>ABC)</b> <b>system</b> and the effect on breathing cycle regularity and reproducibility. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-six patients with unresectable {{tumors of the}} chest were selected for evaluation of the ABC system. Computed tomography scans were performed at various respiratory phases starting at the same couch position without patient movement. Threshold levels were set at minimum and maximum volume during normal breathing cycles and at a volume defined as shallow breathing, reflecting the sujective maximal tolerable reduction of breath volume. To evaluate the extend of organ movement, 13 landmarks were considered unsing commercial software for image coregistration. In 4 patients second examinations were performed during therapy. RESULTS: Investigating the differences in a normal breathing cycle versus shallow breathing, a statistically significant reduction of respiratory motion in the upper, middle an lower regions of the chest could be detected, representing potential movement reduction achieved through reduced breath volume. Evaluating interfraction reproducibility, the mean displacements ranged between 0. 24 mm (chest wall/tracheal bifurcation) to 3. 5 mm (diaphragm) for expiration and shallow breathing and 0. 24 mm (chest wall) to 5. 25 mm (diaphragm) for normal inspiration. CONCLUSION: By modifying regularity of the respiratory circle through reduction of breath volume a signigicant and reproducible reduction of the chest and diaphragm motion is possible, enabling reduction of treatment margins...|$|R
50|$|The W220 {{featured}} a new pneumatic suspension system (Airmatic) with Adaptive Damping System (ADS) which adjusts the shock absorbers to difficult road conditions. Drivers can select a comfort or two sports suspension programmes {{as well as}} increased ride height (+25 mm) via switches on the dash. The increased ride height is automatically canceled after 5 minutes of 55 MPH driving or manually through driver's input. The hydraulic Active Body <b>Control</b> (<b>ABC)</b> <b>system</b> (premiere in 1999 on the Mercedes-Benz C215 coupe) is technically more advanced than Airmatic and keeps the car level even in fast corners, provides a comfort and sports setting. Also, just like Airmatic equipped vehicles, the ride height can be raised by using a button (2 settings, compared with Airmatic's single setting), increasing ground clearance for driving on difficult terrain such as roads with deep ruts or snow. Prior to September 2002, only higher end models (e.g. S600, ABC available only) lowered themselves automatically at higher speeds by 15 mm {{in order to achieve}} greater stability (lower center of gravity) as well as better fuel efficiency through a slightly improved aerodynamic drag coefficient. As of September 2002 all models, regardless of engine and drivetrain type (ABC or Airmatic) were able to do so as well. Furthermore, at highway speeds the suspension computer automatically engages sport mode (Airmatic - Sport mode 1 or 2 depending on the current speed), thus aiding safety by significantly reducing body roll in sharp turns.|$|R
