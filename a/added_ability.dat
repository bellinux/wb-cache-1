[...] Named [...] "EagleCash", the overseas system functions similarly to the EZpay system, but with the <b>added</b> <b>ability</b> of soldiers to attach personal bank accounts to the card, allowing them to load, and reload, without having to access their financial institutions back home. [...] As 386th Air Expeditionary Wing financial manager, Catherine Miles explained in a 2007 article, [...] "It's like a gift card. [...] You can put as little or as much money as you want on it and it comes from your checking account." [...] Unlike regular debit cards, the Eagle Cash is managed on-base, using batch processing which ensures that the cards remained useful even when connections to banks and credit unions State-side are severed.

The cake becomes like a donut with even pressure applied almost equally to all parts of the cake. The benefits of this style is a usually even amount of pressure applied to the cake as well as an <b>added</b> <b>ability</b> to help cool the must if the bladder is filled with cold water. A disadvantage is the labor intensiveness of cleaning and empty and the potential high oxygen exposure if the tank is not enclosed.|$|E
2500|$|... and {{potential}} customers. The company can present {{a more personal}} picture of their brand, and by doing so the company conveys a better and true picture of itself. The idea of Instagram pictures lies on on-the-go, {{a sense that the}} event is happening right now, and that adds another layer to the personal and accurate picture of the company. In fact, Thomas Rankin, co-founder and CEO of the program Dash Hudson, stated that when he approves a blogger's Instagram post before it is posted on the behalf of a brand his company represents, his only negative feedback is if it looks too posed. [...] "It's not an editorial photo," [...] he explained, [...] "We're not trying to be a magazine. We're trying to create a moment." [...] Another option Instagram provides the opportunity for companies to reflect a true picture of the brandfrom the perspective of the customers, for instance, using the user-generated contents thought the hashtags encouragement.
