40|$|Under the {{influence}} of gonadotropins or growth factors, a close cooperation develops between cumulus cells and the oocyte that is implicated in transmitting signals involved in maintaining or releasing the meiotic arrest in the oocyte. While cyclic <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (cAMP) is a key molecule in maintaining the meiotic arrest, calcium (Ca 2 +) {{may play a role}} in controlling either spontaneous or gonadotropin-induced oocyte maturation, possibly by modulating intracytoplasmic cAMP concentrations via Ca 2 +-sensitive adenylate cyclases.

40|$|In several {{bacterial}} diseases, the clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings {{result from}} the elaboration by the organism of a toxic product that binds to and may enter the host cell to alter its metabolism. In some cases, the intracellular mediators of toxin action are the cyclic nucleotides, cyclic <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine 5 -monophosphate (cGMP), the ubiquitous second messengers through which numerous hormones, neurotransmitters, and drugs exert their effects. Certain toxins act by enhancing the activity of cellular enzymes that synthesize cAMP or cGMP; and others, by themselves catalyzing cAMP synthesis after entering the cell.

40|$|Background and Purpose—The role of brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B, in control of cerebral circulation is poorly understood. The present {{study was designed to}} investigate the cerebral vascular effects of BDNF in vivo. Methods—Replication incompetent adenovirus encoding either rat BDNF (AdBDNF) or green fluorescent protein was injected intracisternally into rabbits. Forty-eight hours later, animals were euthanized. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of BDNF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, vasomotor function of isolated basilar arteries was studied in organ chambers, protein expression in the basilar arteries was studied by Western blotting, prostanoid levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cyclic <b>adenosine</b> 3, <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Results—The levels of BDNF in the cerebrospinal fluid were significantly elevated in AdBDNF-treated rabbits as compared with adenovirus encoding green fluorescent protein-treated rabbits (375 ng/mL versus 0. 0060. 003 ng/mL, respectively; P 0. 05; n 14). Western blotting studies revealed that in basilar arteries, AdBDNF increased protein expression of prostacyclin synthase, whereas expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and phosphorylated (Ser 1177) endothelial nitric oxide synthase remained unchanged.

The intake of the ARP formulated diet starting from birth elicited an increase of cAMP production in broiler liver. However, when this diet was offered after the 21 st day of age, the hepatic cAMP production in broilers was not significantly (P> 0. 05) affected, suggesting {{that the effect of}} high fluorine present in Araxá rock phosphate, on hepatic cAMP of broiler chicks depends on the age in which the experimental diet is started...|$|R

Very recently, acute downregulation of ENaC by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) was demonstrated in several studies. The mechanism, however, by which CFTR exerts its inhibitory effect on ENaC remains obscure. We demonstrate that cytosolic domains of human CFTR are sufficient to induce inhibition of rat epithelial Na+ currents (rENaC) when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes and stimulated with 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX). Moreover, mutations of CFTR, which occur in cystic fibrosis, abolish CFTR-dependent downregulation of rENaC. Yeast two hybrid analysis of CFTR domains and rENaC subunits suggest direct interaction between the proteins. Enhanced Na+ transport as found in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients is probably {{due to a lack}} of CFTR dependent downregulation of ENaC...|$|R
40|$|The photophysical {{properties}} of Pt(ii) meso-tetrakis(4 -N-methylpyridyl) porphyrin (PtTMPyP 4) {{have been investigated}} {{in the presence of}} purine mononucleotides using emission and transient UV/visible/near-IR spectroscopy. While both <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ?<b>-monophosphate</b> (AMP) and guanosine 5 ?-monophosphate (GMP) form 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 complexes with PtTMPyP 4, the effect on the triplet lifetime is different. With AMP, complexation gives rise to an enhancement of lifetime and quantum yield due to shielding from dissolved oxygen and a slight decrease in the non-radiative decay rate. When complexed with GMP, quenching is observed consistent with photoinduced electron transfer from guanine to triplet-excited PtTMPyP 4, due to both dynamic quenching of the porphyrin and to short-lived emission from 1 : 1 (67 ns) and 1 : 2 (400 ns) complexes. No charge-separated photoproducts are observed by transient UV/vis/near-IR absorption spectroscopy on the nanosecond timescale, suggesting that rapid reverse electron transfer may prevent type 1 DNA damage...|$|E
40|$|The oxygen-dependent {{inactivation}} of glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (ATase) {{is demonstrated}} in cell extracts of Bacillus subtilis. The rate of inactivation of ATase in vitro is apparently first order {{with respect to}} oxygen concentration and ATase activity. ATase inactivation in vitro (or in vivo) cannot be reactivated {{by a variety of}} reductants. ATase is significantly stabilized to oxygen-dependent inactivation in vitro in the presence of tetrasodium phosphoribosylpyrophosphate and glutamine together. The effects of the end product inhibitors, <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (AMP) and guanosine 5 -monophosphate (GMP), on the stability of ATase are antagonistic. AMP stabilizes ATase, whereas GMP destabilizes the enzyme. The stability of ATase can be manipulated over wide ranges by variations in the AMP/GM ratio. The effects of AMP and GMP on the inactivation of ATase in vitro are very specific. ATase is partially inhibited by 1, 10 -phenanthroline, suggesting that the enzyme contains iron (or some other chelatable metal ion). The inactivation of ATase in vitro is proposed to present a model for the reconstruction of the inactivation of ATase in stationary-phase cells of B. subtilis...|$|E

The time-course UV-Visible spectroscopy of {{the reaction of the}} mono- and dinuclear complexes with guanosine 5 -monophosphate (GMP) showed the movement of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band to lower wavelengths, accompanied by a hypochromism effect. The formation of the aqua complex and phosphate-bound intermediates in the reaction were detected by the time-course 1 H NMR and 31 P NMR experiments, which also demonstrated that the complex bound to the N 7 guanine was the major product.

40|$|Neurotrophins at axonal {{terminals}} {{signal to}} cell bodies to regulate neuronal development via signaling endosomes containing activated Trk receptor tyrosine kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Requirements {{for the formation}} of signaling endosomes remain, however, poorly characterized. Here we show that a novel Trk-interacting protein, NTRAP (neurotrophic factor receptor–associated protein), plays a crucial role in this signaling process. NTRAP interacts with the Trk intracellular domain through its C 2 H 2 zinc fingers in a kinase-dependent manner. It is associated with vesicles, some of which contain markers for signaling endosomes. Inhibition of NTRAP function suppresses neurotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth in PC 12 cells by altering TrkA endocytic traffic, inhibiting the formation of endosomes containing persistently active MAPKs. In compartmentalized sensory neuron cultures, down-regulation of NTRAP abolishes the ability of neurotrophins applied to distal axons to activate the transcription factor <b>adenosine</b> 3 !, <b>5</b> !<b>-monophosphate</b> response element-binding protein (CREB) and to promote neuronal survival.

40|$|Formation of multiple-protein {{macromolecular}} complexes at specialized subcellular microdomains {{increases the}} specificity {{and efficiency of}} signaling in cells. In this study, we demonstrate that phosphodiesterase type 3 A (PDE 3 A) physically and functionally interacts with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel. PDE 3 A inhibition generates compartmentalized cyclic <b>adenosine</b> 3, <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (cAMP), which further clusters PDE 3 A and CFTR into microdo-mains at the plasma membrane and potentiates CFTR channel function. Actin skeleton disruption reduces PDE 3 A–CFTR interaction and segregates PDE 3 A from its interacting partners, thus compromising {{the integrity of the}} CFTR-PDE 3 A– containing macromolecular complex. Consequently, compartmentalized cAMP signaling is lost. PDE 3 A inhibition no longer activates CFTR channel function in a compartmentalized manner.

Hypertension-associated abnormalities of cyclic <b>adenosine</b> 3, <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (AMP) metabolism were studied in human platelets. Platelets from hypertensive subjects had an enhanced cyclic AMP accumulation response to prostaglandin E, (twofold increase in prostaglandin Ei sensitivity). The degree of adenylate cyclase activation {{in response to}} both prostaglandin E] (receptor-mediated) and forskolin (non-receptor-mediated) was greater in hypertensive than normo-tensive subjects, and prostaglandin E,-stimulated and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity correlated directly (r = 0. 71, p< 0. 001, n = 26). This finding suggests that the catalytic subunit of the enzyme is the rate-limiting step of this hormonal information transduction. Platelets from hyperten-sive subjects were more sensitive to epinephrine-induced inhibition of the stimulatory effects of prostaglandin E, on both cyclic AMP accumulation (fourfold) and activation of cyclic AMP-depen-dent protein kinase. These {{findings suggest that the}} enhanced cyclic AMP metabolic response to prostaglandin E, in platelets from subjects with established essential hypertension may function as a negative feedback mechanism to protect the cells against calcium overload and to reduce their stimulated participation in hemostatic and thrombotic processes.

40|$|Background: A key {{therapeutic}} {{approach to}} asthma, which {{is characterized by}} chronic airway inflammation, is inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). This study evaluated the association of symptom control with changes in lung function, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) after ICS treatment in asthmatic children. Methods: A total of 33 children aged between 5 and 12 years with mild to moderate persistent asthma were treated with 160  μg ciclesonide per day for 3 months. At days 0 and 90, the following parameters were assessed: asthma symptom scores; lung function, including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow at 25 – 75 % of forced vital capacity (FEF 25 – 75 %); BHR to methacholine and <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (AMP); and eNO. Results: Asthma symptom scores, lung function parameters, BHR to methacholine and AMP, and eNO levels at day 90 were significantly improved versus day 0 (all p <  0. 001). Symptom scores at day 90 {{were not correlated with}} changes in lung function and BHR to methacholine during the follow-up period, whereas those at day 90 were more closely correlated with changes in BHR to AMP (r =  0. 511, p =  0. 003) than with eNO (r = − 0. 373, p =  0. 035). Additionally, changes in PC 20 AMP were correlated with changes in PC 20 methacholine (r =  0. 451, p =  0. 011) and eNO (r = − 0. 474, p =  0. 006). Conclusions: Changes in the BHR to AMP, {{and to a lesser extent}} eNO, correlate with asthma symptom control after ICS treatment.

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} lung disease with considerable unmet medical requirement {{for new and}} effective therapies. Cytosolic phospholipase A(2) α (cPLA(2) α) is the rate-limiting enzyme ultimately responsible for production of eicosanoids implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma. We investigated a novel cPLA(2) α inhibitor, PF- 5212372, to establish the potential for this drug {{as a treatment for}} asthma. PF- 5212372 was a potent inhibitor of cPLA(2) α (7 nM) and was able to inhibit prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) and cysteinyl leukotriene release from anti-IgE stimulated human lung mast-cells (0. 29 nM and 0. 45 nM, respectively). In a mixed human lung cell population, PF- 5212372 was able to inhibit ionomycin-stimulated release of leukotriene B(4), thromboxane A(2) and PGD(2) (2. 6 nM, 2. 6 nM and 4. 0 nM, respectively), but was significantly less effective against prostaglandin E(2) (> 301 nM, p< 0. 05). In an in vitro cell retention assay, PF- 5212372 retained its potency up to 24 h post wash-off. In a sheep model of allergic asthma, inhalation of PF- 5212372 significantly inhibited late-phase bronchoconstriction (78 % inhibition, p< 0. 001) and airway hyper-responsiveness (94 % inhibition, p< 0. 001) and isolated sheep lung mast cell assays confirmed species translation via effective inhibition of PGD(2) release (0. 78 nM). Finally, PF- 5212372 was assessed for its ability to inhibit the contraction of human bronchus induced by <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (AMP). PF- 5212372 significantly inhibited AMP induced contraction of human bronchus (81 % inhibition, p< 0. 001) and along with the ability of this drug to be effective in a wide-range of pre-clinical asthma models, suggests that inhibition of cPLA(2) α using PF- 5212372 may represent a new therapeutic option for the treatment of asthma...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} {{of growth in}} Bacteroides melaninogenicus by sugars in described. Monosaccharides such as D-glucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, and D-fructose are inhibitory at low concentrations, whereas the disaccharides sucrose and lactose are not inhibitory even at high concentrations. The major inhibitory effect of the sugar is found during the transition of lag to logarithmic growth phases. There was no primary effect of D-glucose on protein, ribonucleic acid, or deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis on cells in transition from lag to logarithmic growth. However, the addition of glucose or galactose completely abolished the induction of 3 -ketodihydrosphingosine synthetase by vitamin K in vitamin K-depleted cells. Futhermore, in cells which were not vitamin K depleted, the level of this enzyme was drastically reduced {{by the addition of}} the sugar. Cyclic <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> was unable to reverse the growth inhibition produced by glucose. In actively growing cultures, addition of sugar slows the growth rate. In these experiments the level of 3 -ketodihydrosphingosine synthetase fell only after the cells had assumed the slower rate of growth. There were two indications that D-galactose was more inhibitory than D-glucose; in the presence of 0. 1 % D-galactose cells in lag phase did not show the increase in turbidity found in similar cells placed in medium with 0. 1 % D-glucose, and also D-galactose caused a greater decrease in the growth rate of actively growing cultures than was found with D-glucose. These studies suggest that the inhibitory effect of monosaccharides in lag leads to logarithmic growth transition can be ascribed to an effect on enzyme induction. On the other hand, the ability of many monosaccharides to inhibit growth, and the greater inhibitory property of D-galactose compared with D-glucose, suggests that other mechanisms may be operative as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{activated state}} of cyclic <b>adenosine</b> 3, <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> (cAMP) is modelled by two nucleoside cyclic 3, 5 Pv-TBP compounds 3 and 4. The {{reason for the}} design of compound 3, in which a probe fragment (OCH 2 CH 2 OCH 3 group) is linked to phosphorus, was reflected in a conformational transmission effect, which occurs when the probe is located in the axis of a Pv-TBP. This means that the six-membered 35 -dioxaphosphorinane ring predominantly remains in a diequatorial (e,e) orientation. In the absence of conformational transmission, as in compound 4, the 3, 5 -dioxaphosphorinane ring favors an equatorial-axial (e,a) orientation. From this we conclude that the occurrence of conformational transmission can stabilize the (e,e) orientation of the 3, 5 -ring. This can be of relevance to the activation of protein kinase by cAMP. In order to obtain more structural information from 3 and 4, we performed MNDO calculations on the models 8 - 10. These calculations revealed that the (e,e) orientation of the 3, 5 -ring is destabilized by 3 - 4 kcal/mol compared to the (e,a) orientation. For the (e,a) geometry, the 3, 5 -ring adopts a twist conformation, whereas the (e,e) orientated 3, 5 -ring shows a half-chair geometry...|$|R

Using a mouse model that produces a truncated form of CC 2 D 1 A that lacks the C 2 domain and three of the four DM 14 domains, we show that CC 2 D 1 A is important for neuronal differentiation and brain development. CC 2 D 1 A mutant neurons are hypersensitive to stress and have a reduced capacitytoformdendritesandsynapsesinculture. Atthebiochemical level,CC 2 D 1 Atransduces signals to the cyclic <b>adenosine</b> 3 ?, <b>5</b> ?<b>-monophosphate</b> (cAMP) -protein kinase A (PKA) pathway during neuronal cell differentiation. PKA activity is compromised, and the translocation of its catalytic subunit to the nucleus is also defective in CC 2 D 1 A mutant cells. Consistently, phosphorylation of the PKA target cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, at serine 133, is nearly abolished in CC 2 D 1 A mutant cells. The defects in cAMP/PKA signaling were observed in fibroblast, macrophage, and neuronal primary cells derived from the CC 2 D 1 A KO mice. CC 2 D 1 A associates with the cAMP-PKA complex following forskolin treatment and accumulates in vesicles or on the plasma membrane in wild-type cells, suggesting that CC 2 D 1 A may recruit the PKA complex to the membrane to facilitate signal transduction. Together, our data show that CC 2 D 1 A is an important regulator of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, which may be the underlying cause for impaired mental function in nonsyndromic mental retardation patients with CC 2 D 1 A mutation. 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Background: Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to pharmacologic stimuli and sputum eosinophils {{might be}} useful in the {{individual}} adjustment of long-term asthma management. However, {{it is not clear}} whether inhaled glucocorticosteroids (GCSs) provide greater protection against specific surrogate markers of airways inflammation than other means. In addition, detailed longitudinal assessment of changes in airway response with inhaled GCSs has never been carried out. Objectives: We compared changes in AHR to inhaled methacholine and <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ?<b>-monophosphate</b> (AMP) after budesonide treatment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of patients with mild-to-moderate asthma. Subsequently, we undertook a separate study to examine the time course of the changes in AHR in more detail and the changes in sputum cell counts in relation to budesonide treatment. Methods: In the phase 1 of the study, patients undertook bronchial provocation studies with increasing doubling concentrations of methacholine (0. 06 to 16 mg/mL) and AMP (3. 125 to 800 mg/mL) before and after budesonide 0. 8 mg/daily for 3 weeks. The bronchial responses to the inhaled agonists were expressed as the provocative concentration causing a 20 % decline in FEV 1 (PC 20). In phase 2 of the study, patients attended the laboratory on 12 separate occasions to investigate changes in PC 20 methacholine, PC 20 AMP, and sputum cell counts before, during, and after withdrawal of therapy with inhaled budesonide 0. 8 mg/daily for 6 weeks. Results: Budesonide treatment for 3 weeks significantly attenuated the constrictor response by 0. 8 ± 0. 3 doubling doses for methacholine and by 2. 6 ± 0. 5 doubling doses for AMP. These changes were significantly different from each other (P =. 003). Significant variation in PC 20 methacholine (P <. 05) value, PC 20 AMP (P <. 001) value, percentage of sputum eosinophils (P <. 001), and percentage of sputum epithelial cells (P <. 001) were observed throughout the longitudinal assessment of changes in airway response to budesonide. Compared with the other surrogate markers, PC 20 AMP appears to be useful in promptly detecting early inflammatory changes of the asthmatic airways; a significant change of 1. 6 ± 0. 3, 2. 2 ± 0. 3, and 2. 8 ± 0. 3 doubling doses of PC 20 AMP was observed at 1, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively, in the course of budesonide treatment.

40|$|Background: Cyclic <b>adenosine</b> 3 ? <b>5</b> ?<b>-monophosphate</b> (cAMP) {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of many cellular processes, {{including in}} the neuronal system, and its activity is tuned by Phosphodiesterase (PDE) activation. Further, the CC 2 D 1 A protein, consisting of N-Terminal containing four DM 14 domains and C-terminal containing C 2 domain, was shown to regulate the cAMP-PKA pathway. A human deletion mutation lacking the fourth DM 14 and the adjacent C 2 domain results in Non Syndromic Intellectual Disability (NSID) {{also referred to as}} Non Syndromic Mental Retardation (NSMR). Findings. Here we demonstrate that in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF) CC 2 D 1 A co-localizes with PDE 4 D in the cytosol before cAMP stimulation and on the periphery after stimulation, and that the movement to the periphery requires the full-length CC 2 D 1 A. In CC 2 D 1 A mouse mutant cells, the absence of three of the four DM 14 domains abolishes migration of the complex to the periphery and causes constitutive phosphorylation of PDE 4 D Serine 126 (Sssup 126 esup) via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) resulting in PDE 4 D hyperactivity. Suppressing PDE 4 D activity with Rolipram in turn restores the down-stream phosphorylation of the "cAMP response element-binding protein" (CREB) that is defective in mouse mutant cells. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CC 2 D 1 A is a novel regulator of PDE 4 D. CC 2 D 1 A interacts directly with PDE 4 D regulating its activity and thereby fine-tuning cAMP-dependent downstream signaling. Based on our in vitro evidence we propose a model which links CC 2 D 1 A structure and function to cAMP homeostasis thereby affecting CREB phosphorylation. We speculate that CC 2 D 1 A and/or PDE 4 D may be promising targets for therapeutic interventions in many disorders with impaired PDE 4 D function such as NSID. 2013 Al-Tawashi and Gehring; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Extracts of Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Euglena {{gracilis}} var. bacillaris, spinach, barley, Dictyostelium discoideum and Escherichia coli form {{an unknown}} compound enzymically from <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphosulphate {{in the presence}} of ammonia. This unknown compound shares the following properties with <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphoramidate: molar proportions of constituent parts (1 adenine: 1 ribose: 1 phosphate: 1 ammonia released at low pH), co-electrophoresis in all buffers tested including borate, formation of AMP at low pH through release of ammonia, mass and i. r. spectra and conversion into 5 ′-AMP by phosphodiesterase. This unknown compound therefore appears to be identical with <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphoramidate. The enzyme that catalyses the formation of <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphoramidate from ammonia and <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphosulphate was purified 1800 -fold (to homogeneity) from Chlorella by using (NH 4) 2 SO 4 precipitation and DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex and Reactive Blue 2 –agarose chromatography. The purified enzyme shows one band of protein, coincident with activity, at a position corresponding to 60000 – 65000 molecular weight, on polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and yields three subunits on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of 26000, 21000 and 17000 molecular weight, consistent with a molecular weight of 64000 for the native enzyme. Isoelectrofocusing yields one band of pI 4. 2. The pH optimum of the enzyme-catalysed reaction is 8. 8. ATP, ADP or <b>adenosine</b> 3 ′-phosphate <b>5</b> ′-phosphosulphate will not replace <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphosulphate, and the apparent Km for the last-mentioned compound is 0. 82 mm. The apparent Km for ammonia (assuming NH 3 to be the active species) is about 10 mm. A large variety of primary, secondary and tertiary amines or amides will not replace ammonia. One mol. prop. of <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphosulphate reacts with 1 mol. prop. of ammonia to yield 1 mol. prop. each of <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphoramidate and sulphate; no AMP is found. The highly purified enzyme does not catalyse any of the known reactions of <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphosulphate, including those catalysed by ATP sulphurylase, <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphosulphate kinase, <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphosulphate sulphotransferase or ADP sulphurylase. <b>Adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphoramidate is found in old samples of the ammonium salt of <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphosulphate and can be formed non-enzymically if <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphosulphate and ammonia are boiled. In the non-enzymic reaction both <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphoramidate and AMP are formed. Thus the enzyme forms <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphoramidate by selectively speeding up an already favoured reaction...|$|R
40|$|Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a {{cornerstone}} immunosuppressant therapy in solid organ transplantation. MPA is metabolized by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase to inactive 7 -O-MPA-glucuronide (MPAG). At least three minor metabolites are also formed, including a pharmacologically active acylglucuronide. MPA and MPAG {{are subject to}} enterohepatic recirculation. Biliary excretion of MPA/MPAG involves several transporters, including organic anion transporting polypeptides and multidrug resistant protein- 2 (MRP- 2). MPA metabolites are also excreted via the kidney, {{at least in part}} by MRP- 2. MPA exerts its immunosuppressive effect through the inhibition of inosine- <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> dehydrogenase. Several SNPs have been identified in the genes encoding for uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase, organic anion transporting polypeptides, MRP- 2 and inosine- <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> dehydrogenase.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of the hydroxyl radical, generated by a Fenton system, with pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides was investigated by using the e. s. r. technique of spin trapping. The spin trap t-nitrosobutane was employed to trap secondary radicals formed by the {{reaction of}} the hydroxyl radical with these nucleotides. The results presented here show that hydroxyl-radical attack on thymidine, 2 -deoxycytidine <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> and 2 -deoxyuridine <b>5</b> <b>-monophosphate</b> produced nucleotide-derived free radicals. The results indicate that. OH radical attack occurs predominantly at the carbon-carbon double bond of the pyrimidine base. The e. s. r. studies showed a good correlation with previous results obtained by authors who used x- or gamma-ray irradiation to generate the hydroxyl radical.

40|$|SUMMARY. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate developmental changes in contractile protein <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-tnphosphatase in the rabbit heart Myofibnls and myosin were isolated from ventricular muscles from the fetal, newborn, and adult rabbits. Actin and troponin-tropomyosin complex were isolated from the adult skeletal muscle. Myofibrillar (actomyosin) <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-tnphosphatase measured at low ionic strength increased with development. In contrast, myofi-brillar calcium <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-tnphosphatase at high ionic strength was the greatest in the newborn and the lowest in the adult Myosin calcium <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-triphosphatase and actin-activated myosin <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-triphosphatase were also the greatest in the newborn and the lowest in the adult The relative proportion of myosin isozyme Vi was the greatest in the newborn and the lowest in the adult. The addition of troponin-tropomyosin complex stimulated myosin <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-tnphosphatase in the presence of calcium in the adult, but not in the newborn and fetus. As a result, actin-activated myosin <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-triphosphatase in the presence of troponin-tropomy-osin complex was the greatest in the adult, followed by the newborn and fetus. These data suggest that the low myofibrillar <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-triphosphatase activity at low ionic strength in the premature heart {{may be due to the}} age-related difference in the interaction of myosin wit...|$|R

The <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-triphosphate {{levels of the}} fungus were high during {{exponential}} phase and low during stationary phase in zinc-replete cultures.

The <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-triphosphate levels during exponential phase may indicate higher primary metabolic activity of the fungus. On the other hand, high <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-monophosphate levels during stationary phase may inhibit lipid formation and may enhance aflatoxin levels. The inorganic phosphorus content was low in a zinc-replete medium throughout the growth period, thereby favoring aflatoxin biosynthesis.

40|$|AbstractWe {{show here}} that Fhit proteins, in {{addition}} to their function as dinucleoside triphosphate hydrolases, act similarly to adenylylsulfatases and nucleoside phosphoramidases, liberating nucleoside 5 ′-monophosphates from such natural metabolites as <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphosulfate and <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-phosphoramidate. Moreover, Fhits recognize synthetic nucleotides, such as <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-O-phosphorofluoridate and <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-O-(γ-fluorotriphosphate), and release AMP from them. With respect to the former, Fhits behave like a phosphodiesterase I concomitant with cleavage of the P–F bond.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective To {{determine}} <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> &# 8217;-triphosphate {{levels in}} the interstice of spinal cord L 6 -S 1 segment, under basal conditions or during mechanical and chemical activation of urinary bladder afferents. Methods A microdialysis probe was transversally implanted in the dorsal half of spinal cord L 6 -S 1 segment in female rats. Microdialysate was collected at 15 minutes intervals during 135 minutes, in anesthetized animals. <b>Adenosine</b> <b>5</b> &# 8217;-triphosphate concentrations were determined with a bioluminescent assay. In one group of animals (n= 7) microdialysate samples were obtained with an empty bladder during a 10 -minutes bladder distension to 20 or 40 cmH 2 O with either saline, saline with acetic acid or saline with capsaicin. In another group of animals (n= 6) bladder distention was performed and the microdialysis solution contained the ectonucleotidase inhibitor ARL 67156. Results Basal extracellular adenosine triphosphate levels were 110. 9 ± 35. 34 fmol/ 15 minutes, (mean±SEM, n= 13), and bladder distention {{was associated with a}} significant increase in <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> &# 8217;-triphosphate levels which was not observed after bladder distention with saline solution containing capsaicin (10 µM). Microdialysis with solution containing ARL 67156 (1 mM) was associated with significantly higher extracellular <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> &# 8217;-triphosphate levels and no further increase in <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> &# 8217;-triphosphate was observed during bladder distension. Conclusion <b>Adenosine</b> <b>5</b> &# 8217;-triphosphate was present in the interstice of L 6 -S 1 spinal cord segments, was degraded by ectonucleotidase, and its concentration increased following the activation of bladder mechanosensitive but not of the chemosensitive afferents fibers. <b>Adenosine</b> <b>5</b> &# 8217;-triphosphate may originate either from the central endings of bladder mechanosensitive primary afferent neurons, or most likely from intrinsic spinal neurons, or glial cells and its release appears to be modulated by capsaicin activated bladder primary afferent or by <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> &# 8217;-triphosphate itself...|$|R

40|$|Proton influx was {{measured}} after imposition of an electrochemical potential difference for protons (delta muH+) across the cell membrane of the anaerobe, Streptococcus lactis. As delta muH+ was increased, {{there was an}} approximately parallel increase in proton entry, until delta muH+ attained 175 to 200 mV. At this point, a new pathway became available for proton entry, allowing an abrupt increase in both the rate and extent of H+ influx. This gated response depended upon the value of delta muH+ itself, and not upon the value of either the membrane potential or the pH gradient. For delta muH+ above 175 to 200 mV, elevated proton entry occurred only in cells having a functional membrane-bound Ca 2 +-stimulated, Mg 2 +stimulated <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-triphosphatase (EC 3. 6. 1. 3). When present, elevated proton entry coincided {{with the appearance of}} net synthesis of <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-triphosphate catalyzed by this <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> '-triphosphatase.
