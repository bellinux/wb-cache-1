5|$|Coastal {{areas of}} Wales, and those near rivers, produce many {{different}} forms of fish and shellfish. Traditional fishing methods, such as wade netting for salmon, remained in place for 2,000 years. Welsh coracles, simple boats made of a willow frame and covered in animal hides, were noted by Romans and were still in use in the 20th century. Once landed, fish would generally be wind-dried <b>and</b> <b>smoked,</b> or cured with salt.|$|E
5|$|Israeli eating customs also {{conform to}} the wider Mediterranean region, with lunch, rather than dinner, being the focal meal of a regular workday. “Kibbutz foods” have been adopted by many Israelis for their light evening meals as well as breakfasts, and may consist of various types of cheeses, both soft and hard, yogurt, labne and sour cream, {{vegetables}} and salads, olives, hard-boiled eggs or omelets, pickled <b>and</b> <b>smoked</b> herring, a variety of breads, and fresh orange juice and coffee.|$|E
5|$|Perovskia atriplicifolia has a {{long history}} of use in {{traditional}} medicine, especially as an antipyretic. It has also been employed as an antiparasitic and analgesic in Tibet, <b>and</b> <b>smoked</b> elsewhere as a euphoriant. In Balochistan, Pakistan, a decoction of the plant's leaves and flowers has been considered an anti-diabetic medication and a treatment for dysentery.|$|E

40|$|Combustible materials, when burned, produce toxic gases <b>and</b> <b>smoke,</b> {{which may}} vary {{dramatically}} from one material to another, with resultant different total toxicity <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> obscuration levels. This U. S.

These correlations can be used to devise simple, standard tests for determining the toxic <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> obscuration hazards of mine materials during fire...|$|R

5|$|The cuisine of Slavonia {{reflects}} {{cultural influences}} on the region through the diversity of its culinary influences. The most significant among those were from Hungarian, Viennese, Central European, as well as Turkish and Arab cuisines brought by series of conquests and accompanying social influences. The ingredients of traditional dishes are pickled vegetables, dairy products <b>and</b> <b>smoked</b> meats. The most famous traditional preserved meat product is kulen, {{one of a handful}} Croatian products protected by the EU as indigenous products.|$|E
5|$|Another failed product, {{this time}} under Grand Metropolitan's {{successor}} Diageo, was the BK Back Porch Grillers line of burgers that featured a spiced and flavored patty {{served on a}} bakery-style roll. There were two varieties: The Regular served with mayonnaise, whole leaf iceberg lettuce, tomato and grilled onions, and the Bacon Cheddar, with bacon <b>and</b> <b>smoked</b> cheddar cheese. There was one LTO variety, the Black Stack Griller, made with Black Strap Barbecue sauce (a strong molasses-flavored sauce), Swiss cheese, bacon, and onions, to promote Men in Black II. The Griller patty was flavored so {{that it had a}} taste similar to a hamburger that had been grilled over a charcoal-fired grill.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The fire <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> {{monitoring}} systems {{are useful in}} different industry such as military, social security and economical. The recent methods for fire <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> detection are used only motion and color characteristics thus many wrong alarms are happening and this is decrease {{the performance of the}} systems. This research presents a new method for fire <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> detection through image processing. In this algorithm all objects in an image is considered and then check them to figure out which objects are <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> fire. The color, motion and disorder are useful characteristics in fire <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> detection algorithm. Smoke of fire will blur the whole or part of the images. Thus by processing of the video frames, different objects will detect. Due to evaluate the features of objects, the goal objects (fire <b>and</b> <b>smoke)</b> can be defined easily. Two-dimensional wavelet analysis is used in the presented method. The results of this research present the proposed features that can reduce the wrong alarms and increase the system performances...|$|R
5|$|In late December {{the last}} of the {{survivors}} that were able to be extricated were pulled from the fallen buildings, rescue operations ceased, and the cleanup began, beginning with the destruction of buildings that were too heavily damaged to be repaired. Six friends were {{in the basement of a}} nine-story building relocating barrels when it came down around them on December 7. Their injuries were minor, but one person did suffer a broken arm. They sustained themselves on the food supplies—fruit salad, pickles, <b>and</b> <b>smoked</b> ham—that were available in the basement for 35 days before their rescue in January.|$|E
5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight {{to make sure he}} did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily <b>and</b> <b>smoked</b> cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E
5|$|McKellar {{was also}} a keen fitness enthusiast and, despite his short stature, built up a great {{physical}} strength. Though he enjoyed wine <b>and</b> <b>smoked</b> the occasional pipe or cigar he kept in peak physical shape until his death. Even {{at the height of}} the Battle of Britain he was always clean shaven and immaculately dressed. McKellar's spare time was used reading about sport and First World War fighter pilots. His interest in the flying personalities of the past spurred him to take up flying. He joined at his own expense the Scottish Flying Club, which had been founded in 1927; it leased and managed Renfrew Airport from 1933 until it was requisitioned during the Second World War. McKellar quickly acquired a pilot's licence. By the time he began his military career, McKellar was a very experienced pilot, and he soon began earning relatively quick promotions.|$|E

Preliminary results are presented.

5|$|Abel Starkey was {{a native}} of Roxbury, Massachusetts. The story of Starkey's capture was {{published}} by George Hubbard in The New England Magazine. Starkey was part of a gang of counterfeiters, including Stephen Burroughs, Samuel Corson and James Smith. Pursued by the authorities, Abel Starkey disappeared in the vicinity of a lightning splitter home that was owned by the Shephardson family. A thorough search of the house was conducted and the authorities found nothing. According to Hubbard, the house was the refuge of the counterfeiters for a number of years. After a time the public and authorities continued to track members of the gang to the location and investigations were performed only to turn up empty. Sheriff Johnson of Worcester tracked the counterfeiters to the house one day and set up a team of men outside and inside the house to uncover and arrest the counterfeiters. A careful search turned up nothing, so measurements of the house were taken to make sure no secret rooms or areas existed. With the inaccessible third attic all but ruled out, the discovery of its access through the chimney was by chance when an officer emptied out his trash into the fireplace. Contained in the trash was some snuff and a sneeze came from above, alerting the officers of hidden occupants in the chimney. After the fire had been extinguished and raked out, Sheriff Johnson attempted to climb up into the chimney. A brick was dropped from above and wounded him. The authorities capped the chimney <b>and</b> <b>smoked</b> the counterfeiters until they fell unconscious. Starkey was amongst the three arrested counterfeiters.|$|E
