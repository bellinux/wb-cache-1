Now, if I can be of any help on that, I'm prepared to send my driver with an officer of mine to escort you to safety. And we can get you on my jet aircraft, and I'm sure I can deliver on that.

500|$|In 2004, King {{said that}} Flagg {{had been a}} {{presence}} in his writing {{since the beginning of}} his career, with the idea coming to him in college. He first wrote a poem, [...] "The Dark Man", about a man who rides the rails and confesses to murder and rape; written {{on the back of a}} placemat in a college restaurant, the one-page poem was published in 1969, but the character never left King's mind. To the author, what made Flagg interesting was [...] "the idea of the villain <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> was always on the outside looking in, and hated people who had good fellowship and good conversation and friends".|$|E

She presents herself in this way as this beautiful woman because she knows the effect that that can have on people. She knows the effect that that has on Stannis, and that can make men do unadvisable things. So the fact that she did that and she uses that power in that way to have this influence on people. That puts her into context <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> really does know what she's doing." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2010 when {{accompanying}} the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, he said [...] "We feel that Saudi Arabia {{has a long}} and close relationship with Pakistan, that makes Saudi Arabia even more a valuable interlocutor for us. When we tell them about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, will listen with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone you speak to. If I speak to you, you are my interlocutor. I mentioned the Saudis as our interlocutors, i.e. the people we are here to speak to".|$|E
500|$|The stage play Being Sellers premiered in Australia in 1998, {{three years}} after the release of the {{biography}} by Roger Lewis, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. [...] In 2004, the book was turned into an HBO film with the same title, starring Geoffrey Rush. The play later transferred to New York in December 2010. The Belfast Telegraph notes how the film captured Sellers's [...] "life of drugs, drink, fast cars and lots and lots of beautiful women". Although the film was widely praised by critics, both Lord Snowdon and Britt Ekland were highly critical of the film and the enactment of Sellers; Ekland believed that the film left the audiences with the wrong idea of her former husband, saying [...] "the film leaves you with the impression that Peter Sellers was essentially a likeable man when in reality he was a monster. He may have been a brilliant actor, but as a human being he had no saving graces at all". Snowdon disagreed with Ekland's verdict, and with the film, and stated that Sellers [...] "had a light touch, a sense of humour, I can't bear to see him portrayed <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> was apparently without either... The man on the screen is charmless, humourless and boring—the one thing you could never say about Peter." ...|$|E

50|$|The play {{revealed}} {{the dominance of}} male in the Filipino family. Though there were several female characters, the characters of Ramon and Carlos were imposing.

Of course, his brother-in-law, Joe Dawson, was the shakiest {{gun in the}} West. He seemed to {{not be able to}} hit the guy in any part of the body that would actually kill him. Horton kept surviving." [...] Kirsch believed that Hudson [...] "saw Horton <b>as</b> being <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> was very hostile {{to what was going on}} around them.

500|$|Wilson {{increasingly}} {{expanded his}} social circle {{to include a}} mix of worldly-minded friends, musicians, mystics, and business advisers. Smile was the album projected to follow Pet Sounds. This time, Wilson worked with Van Dyke Parks, whose surreal and oblique lyrics led Love to adopt the term [...] "acid alliteration" [...] when describing them. Love says that he [...] "wasn't resistant to ... I mean, crazy stupid sounds, like animals, farmyard sounds, did all that shit, laying {{in the bottom of}} an empty pool, singing up at the mic. I did all that stuff. ... I admit to wanting to make a commercially successful pop record, so I might have complained about some of the lyrics on Smile." [...] Capitol was not interested in Wilson's newest ideas for forthcoming projects, such as an album of found sounds, which led to the Beach Boys' desire to form their own label, Brother Records. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Love was [...] "the most receptive" [...] to the idea, wanting the Beach Boys to have more creative control over their work, and supported Wilson's decision to employ his newfound [...] "best friend" [...] David Anderle {{as the head of the}} label—despite the wishes of band manager Nick Grillo. By December 1966, Wilson [...] completed much of the album's backing tracks. When the Beach Boys returned from a month-long tour of Europe, they were confused by the new coterie of interlopers that surrounded him. As Gaines writes, Anderle now appeared as the leader of [...] "a whole group of strangers [...] had infiltrated and taken over the Beach Boys." [...] Anderle had been encouraging Wilson to leave the group, and he was [...] "sure they saw me <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> ... <b>who</b> was fueling Brian's weirdness. And I stand guilty on those counts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallenda {{says that}} the high-wire {{performance}} is not a daredevil act or a mere stunt, but rather an athletic feat requiring great physical training. [...] "I see a stunt <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> gets in a barrel and goes over the edge and hopes they don't hit a rock," [...] he said commenting on his walk across Niagara Falls. [...] "What I do is very calculated. I train {{a long time for}} it and I consider it more of an art. I guess I don't get offended by [...] calling it a stunt, but to me it's more of an art than anything." [...] He aims to be [...] "over-prepared" [...] for every event he does, training six hours a day, six days a week. He does ten hours of weight training and five hours of aerobic exercise each week. [...] Even so, he says wire walking is primarily a mental skill.|$|E
2500|$|Duckworth {{fell and}} broke her leg in August 2009 while at her Quebec cottage. She was treated in {{hospital}} in Magog, Quebec where her condition deteriorated. As she received palliative care, Duckworth reportedly told visitors, [...] "I'm {{going to leave}} you now. It's time for me to go. Everything is ready." [...] Then she added: [...] "Be happy with each other. You have each other. Goodbye, I'm going now." [...] Her imminent death drew this comment from her friend, the well-known scholar and peace activist Ursula Franklin: [...] "I would like her to be remembered <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> demonstrated that it's possible to change one's society, to be profoundly critical and still remain a respected member of that society." [...] Muriel Duckworth died on August 22, 2009 aged 100. Her biographer, Marion Douglas Kerans said, [...] "She showed women how to become true leaders in their community, and in the world, without losing any feminine grace." ...|$|E
40|$|The author, {{following}} Heidegger’s {{analysis of}} Dasein way, {{starts with a}} description of common understanding of a project of existence. Then he passes on to its ontological understanding. Both common and Heidegger’s way of understanding treat these issues in a different way. Despite significant differences, both ways of understanding the existence project – as a suggested answer to “how to live” question claiming to be the right ones – result from the same paradigm of viewing a human-being, mostly <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> apart, <b>who</b> is distinguishable by possessing a self-imposed task, which could be “discovered” and put into reality only by an entity alone – and be oneself. Such a human, as a unique in his existence, is his own biggest problem and a task (a project) for all life...|$|R

Lady Margolotta herself wears a pink jumper with embroidered bats, and carries a little ratlike dog (or possibly a doglike rat) with her.

2500|$|On February 11, 2010, Trudeau {{was arrested}} and {{appeared}} in U.S. District Court before Gettleman for criminal contempt of court after he [...] "asked his supporters to email the federal judge overseeing a pending civil case brought against him by the Federal Trade Commission." [...] He was forced to turn over his passport, pay a $50,000 bond and was warned he could face future prison time for interfering with the direct process of the court. On February 17, Gettleman sentenced Trudeau to 30 days in jail and forfeiture of the $50,000 bond. Well-known critic of Trudeau, Stephen Barrett, the creator of Quackwatch.org, [...] "has for years labeled Trudeau a fraud" [...] and was quoted: [...] "He struck me <b>as</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> (believes he) is omnipotent. That is, no one can touch him," [...] Barrett said. [...] "That’s almost been the case." [...] Trudeau appealed the ruling and on May 20 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted his motion, dismissing the contempt citation.|$|E
2500|$|Ferguson {{refused to}} give {{interviews}} to the BBC after a documentary called Fergie and Son was shown on BBC Three on 27 May 2004.

The same newspaper article {{made it clear that}} [...] "Ferguson Jnr" [...] was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, and it quoted Ferguson Senior as follows: [...] "They [...] did a story about my son that was whole lot of nonsense. It all [...] made-up stuff and 'brown paper bags' {{and all that kind of}} carry-on. It was a horrible attack on my son's honour and he should never have been accused of that."

60|$|His {{expenses}} were heavy, for it {{was important}} that he should pass for a sporting man of means, and he was a good shot and skilful with the salmon rod. As a rule, he had money enough for his needs, but his supplies had been irregular since the war began, and as he had luxurious tastes his debts had mounted up. Of late, his creditors had grown impatient, but it was curious they should all have asked the same lawyer to enforce their claims. This could not have happened by coincidence. It looked <b>as</b> if <b>somebody,</b> <b>who</b> must have taken a good deal of trouble to investigate his affairs, meant to put some pressure on him. This was alarming, for several reasons; and as he could not pay his debts in the time allowed, he determined to call upon the lawyer and see what he could find out.|$|R

He simultaneously served {{as the chairman of}} the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands from 1980 to 1982. Brady was also involved with the Fourth Constitutional Convention held in 1980. He heavily criticized a proposed provision in the U.S. Virgin Islands Constitution that would have required that all future Governors and Lt. Governors of the territory be born in the U.S. Virgin Islands or have at least one parent who was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands in order to hold office. As a guest speaker, Brady told the constitutional delegates, [...] "For you people who were elected by a microcosm of the entire Virgin Islands to decide that for all time we cannot have in these Virgin Islands <b>as</b> governor <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> was not born here, or whatever definition you use, is - to say the least - the height of arrogance." ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{then walked}} along {{back into the}} yard, and {{began to think of}} the subject of the sun's shining in at the south door. He looked up towards the sun, and began to {{consider}} what sort of a change in its place, at noon, on different days, would be necessary in order to account for its shining in more at south doors and windows, on some days, than on others. He reflected that if the sun were exactly overhead, at noon, it could not shine in at any doors at all; for the rays would then strike perpendicularly down the sides of the houses. While he was standing thus, lost in thought, looking up to the sun, with his arm across his forehead, to shelter his eyes a little from the dazzling rays, he suddenly felt the pressure of two soft hands upon his ears, <b>as</b> of <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> had come up behind him.

The reason of this is then people would trust him as a Jongler instead of a Ranger to get more information about the terrorist in Grimsdell wood. Then Will travels to Macindaw where their Baron lord Syron has been poisoned and is now in the hospital. His son Orman has taken over the castle while he is in the hospital, but Orman's cousin Keren has been trying to become Baron too.

[...] "Whatever happens, he's still ultimately not a good person and you've got to try and be sympathetic towards him just to see it from his point of view." [...] He did not research paedophilia per se, but tried to discover research on individuals with pre-paedophiliac tendences. He found there was little scientific research in the area. Gravelle was therefore forced to come up with his own rationales for Joe's crimes. [...] "The need to be loved was the root of it," [...] he said. [...] "Joe had love but he didn't have the attention in the way that he got it from Danny. It's probably an ego thing. ... He's not working. It's a self-worth issue." ...|$|R

At a large trading post owned by a man named Wellmore, Coleman sees Flack and suspects him right away as being one of the killers. Flack likewise suspects Coleman <b>as</b> being <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> knows too much about the killing. Coleman is asked by a large group of settlers to scout their caravan west, and declines, until he learns that Flack and Lopez were just hired by Wellmore to boss a bull train along the as-yet-unblazed Oregon Trail to a trading post north of Oregon, owned by another Missouri fur trader. Coleman agrees to scout for the train, so he can {{keep an eye on the}} villains and kill them as soon as they reach their destination. The caravan of settlers in their Prairie schooners would follow Wellmore's ox-drawn train of Conestoga Wagons, as the first major group of settlers to move west on the Oregon Trail. The film is set somewhere between 1837 and 1845. This is historically accurate, as the first major wave of settlers on the Oregon Trail was in 1843, although the details were completely different.|$|R
