In order to refine {{and reduce the}} number of acute inhalation tests performed, we propose a screening test that uses isolated lungs. The test consists of the exposure of isolated, ventilated and perfused rat lungs, to aerosolised formulations of waterproofing agents (mass median aerodynamic diameter = 1 mu m), and on-line monitoring of respiratory parameters and gross pathology analysis. A pilot evaluation of the isolated perfused rat lung model for use in a screening test was carried out by blind testing 12 surface-active substances. The results obtained compared well with data available from in vivo acute inhalation studies. Substances that triggered harmful effects, such as impaired lung compliance and atelectasis of the isolated perfused lung, were also found to cause changes in respiratory parameters, some of which would be severe enough to lead to death in in vivo tests with rats. The changes in respiratory parameters suggest that the mode-of-action is associated with impairment of the surfactant layer. Therefore, pre-testing in the isolated perfused rat lung allows the identification of surface-active substances with the potential for causing <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity...</b>|$|E

Statistical analysis demonstrates that, when females are more sensitive, the new procedure is likely to give the same classification as the original FCP, whereas, if males are more sensitive, the new procedure is much less likely to lead to incorrect classification into a less toxic category. If there is no difference in the LC 50 for females and males, the new procedure is slightly more likely to classify into a more stringent class than the original FCP.

40|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> of {{chemicals}} has conventionally been {{assessed by the}} median lethal concentration (LC 50) test (organisation for economic co-operation and development (OECD) TG 403). Two new methods, the recently adopted acute toxic class method (ATC; OECD TG 436) and a proposed fixed concentration procedure (FCP), have recently been considered, but statistical evaluations of these methods did not investigate the influence of differential sensitivity {{between male and female}} rats on the outcomes. This paper presents an analysis of data from the assessment of <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> for 56 substances. Statistically significant differences between the LC 50 for males and females were found for 16 substances, with greater than 10 -fold differences in the LC 50 for two substances.

With TG 403, a gender difference leads to a slightly greater chance of under-classification. This is also the case for the ATC method, but more pronounced than for TG 403, with misclassification of nearly all substances from Globally Harmonised System (GHS) class 3 into class 4.

A good predictability for acute toxicity testing could be demonstrated in a pre-validation study using relatively high toxic chemical gases such as nitrogen dioxide and ozone and inert gases. To extend this range of substances, a set of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was tested for applicability using this short-exposure in vitro test. Therefore, a test matrix of different VOCs was set up from the database of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), including VOCs differing in <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> and hydrophobicity. Cell-based in vitro testing was carried out using vaporized compounds, an improved air-liquid interface in vitro procedure (PRIT ExpoCube) using a human lung cell line (A 549 cells) and measurement of cytotoxicity (WST- 1).

The test comprises exposure of IPRLs to aerosolised formulations of the water proofing agents and on-line monitoring of respiratory parameters. Substances revealing harmful effects on the IPRL, such as impaired lung compliance and atelectasis formation, did also show changes in respiratory parameters up to mortality in in vivo tests with rats. Thus, pre-testing in the IPRL allows the identification of surface-active substances causing <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity.</b> To assess the potential lung toxicity of seven formulations, each tested in two male and two female IPRLs, we evaluated changes in the respiratory parameters tidal volume, compliance, and resistance, edema and atelectasis formation, taking into account the inhaled doses.

In conclusion, the use of the IPRL is well suited for screening substances showing acute "physical" inhalation toxicity. Therefore, for future assessment of surface active substances, it is suggested to use this test prior to in vivo inhalation tests. Formulations with no acute harmful effects on the IPRL need to be further investigated in vivo for complete risk assessment. However, substances showing strong reactions in the IPRL will most likely cause lung damage in vivo.

40|$|Data on acute lethal {{inhalation}} toxicity {{from animal}} studies are commonly required {{for assessing the}} hazards to human health of volatile, gaseous and dusty chemicals or their mixtures. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) made the provision of <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> data a mandatory requirement for the carriage of bulk liquid chemicals transported by sea in tank ships, thereby creating the need for inhalation data on many hundreds of chemicals in bulk maritime transport. Taking note of previously published proposals for estimating <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> hazards for chemicals, and the paucity of measured experimental data, an extrapolation method has been developed by the Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) to partly fulfil this need.

40|$|A {{new design}} for <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> testing was {{evaluated}} and compared with results obtained according to OECD guideline 403. The new design {{consists of a}} range-finding test, which is compatible with a conventional limit test, and can be followed by determination of a concentration-time-mortality relationship, enabling calculation of LC 50 (50 % mortality exposure concentration) values. By exposing pairs of rats for different periods of time to about four different test concentrations in a nose-only exposure unit, LT 50 (50 % mortality exposure time) values were obtained for five pairs of animals per concentration. The mortality data of the approximate 20 time-concentration combinations were {{used to calculate the}} probit relationship. Estimated mortality responses from these probit relations were compared with mortality figures obtained by exposing groups of five male rats and five female rats whole-body according to conventional toxicity testing. In general, there was good correspondence between the estimated and the observed mortality response. In our hands, the determination of the concentration-time-mortality relationship takes about the same number of animals (40 - 50) as the conventional LC 50 procedure according to the OECD guideline 403. However, the new method has several additional advantages such as: (A) LC 50 values are obtained over a 10 -fold range in time, with the potential of decreasing the number of animals used when regulations require acute toxicity data for different periods of exposure. (B) The obtained relationship contains considerably more valuable information for risk assessment than the LC 50 value. (C) The method is less sensitive to small fluctuations in test substance concentrations which is important especially for substances with steep concentration-response curves.

Results: Acutely-exposed rats became lethargic but recovered following discontinuation of inhalation. Other clinical symptoms such as change of body weight and autopsy finds were absent. The LC 50 for the <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> of n-octane was deter-mined to exceed 23. 36 mg/L and the GHS category was ‘not grouping’.

The German BfR provided consultancy in validation principles and independent support with biostatistics. In all laboratories, rat PCLS were prepared and exposed to 5 concentrations of 20 industrial chemicals under submerged culture conditions for 1 h. After 23 h post-incubation, toxicity was assessed by measurement of released lactate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial activity. In addition, protein content and pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 1 α were measured. For all endpoints IC 50 values were calculated if feasible. For each endpoint test acceptance criteria were established. This report provides the final results for all 20 chemicals. More than 900 concentration–response curves were analyzed. Log 10 [IC 50 (μM) ], obtained for all assay endpoints, showed best intra- and inter-laboratory consistency for the data obtained by WST- 1 and BCA assays. While WST- 1 and LDH indicated toxic effects for the majority of substances, only some of the substances induced an increase in extracellular IL- 1 α. Two prediction models (two-group classification model, prediction of LC 50 by IC 50) were developed and showed promising results...|$|E
40|$|Based on the expert-analytical {{study of}} {{literature}} and websites {{on the results of}} toxicological experiments of varying duration, a hygienic evaluation of the new class of insecticides – macrocyclic lactones: abamectin and emamectin was done. It was found that by the parameters of acute oral and inhalation toxicity abamectin isreferred to a highly dangerous pesticides (class 1), by acute percutaneous toxicity – to moderately dangerous (3), by irritating and allergenic action – to low dangerous (4). According to LD 50 emamectin in single administration into the stomach and on the skin belongs to class 3, by <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity</b> and irritation of the mucous membranes – to class 2 (dangerous), by skin irritation – to 3 - 4 class, having allergenic potential – 4 class of danger. CF- 1 mice are animals most sensitive to the effects of avermectins due to polymorphism of their mdr 1 a gene, coding P-glycoprotein. The main target organ to avermectin action was recognized to be the central nervous system. ADI of abamectin for humans was established at the level of 0, 0002 mg/kg (the lowest NOAEL by systemic toxicity for parent and offspring generation was set in the experiment studying reproductive toxicity on rats – 0, 12 mg/kg, a safety factor – 600) and emamectin – 0, 001 mg/kg (the lowest NOEL was established in 16 -day experiment on CF- 1 mice – 0, 1 mg/kg and a safety factor – 100) ...|$|E
5000|$|The EPA has {{established}} an equivalent toxicity level for human exposure at 6.1 x 10−2 mg/kg/day. This level {{placed it in}} Category I, II, and IV for oral, dermal, and <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicity.</b> [...] Category I is classified as highly irritating to the eyes, {{but not to the}} skin. As for oral toxicity, when the fungicide is transferred via food into the body, it must be metabolized before it can do any damage.|$|R
40|$|Simpson, Carroll, Zhou and Guth (1996) {{developed}} an ordinal response regression approach to meta-analysis {{of data from}} diverse toxicology studies, applying the methodology to a database of <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> studies of tetrachloroethylene. We present an alternative analysis of the same data, with two major differences: (1) interval censored scores are assigned worst case values, e. g., a score known {{to be in the}} interval [0; 1] is set equal to 1; and (2) the response is reduced to a binary response (adverse, nonadverse). We explore the stability of the analysis by varying a robustness parameter and graphing the curves traced out by the estimates and confidence intervals. 1. INTRODUCTION This paper is concerned with the analysis of data from published toxicology experiments on a particular chemical. We focus on <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> studies of tetrachloroethylene, but the techniques are general. The database contains a range of toxicological endpoints including central nervous system effects, [...] ...|$|R
