40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the agency model of the firm {{extensively}} recognize the managerial ownership and external debt as important tools in mitigating agency conflicts and enhancing firm value. They also find that increase in the external monitors, for example the institutional investors, can actually play a useful role in limiting agency problems in the firm. This paper, using 1351 companies from UK between 2004 and 2008 explores the impact of institutional holdings on managerial ownership and debt policy in an integrated framework by using a simultaneous equations estimation procedure (2 SLS). The findings {{show that there is}} a significant negative relationship between institutional ownership and corporate leverage. This escalates the agency costs of debt because debt holders increase the rate of borrowing when they realize that institutional ownership increases {{in such a way as}} to jeopardize their wealth because using the control power they accumulate from their ownership, institutional shareholders may engage in riskier projects. In addition, corporate leverage is also governed by managerial ownership and revealed a statistically significant negative relationship. At the same time, debt appears as a key governance variable as it moderates private benefits extraction from corporate <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> as reported in the results of this paper that companies with higher average debt ratios <b>accumulate</b> less <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> as opposed to companies with lower average debt ratios...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirically {{the effect}} of firm growth opportunities and earnings quality on the market valuation of <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> defined as the difference between operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and capital expenditures. Equity valuation theory prescribes that <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> should not be associated with stock returns {{because it does not}} add value. However, <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> could become a value-relevant construct in certain contexts. This study considers growth opportunities and transitory earnings as two such contexts and examines the valuation of <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow.</b> An accounting-based valuation framework is developed where stock returns are regressed on <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> interacted with growth and earnings quality proxies, after controlling for book values, dividends, and current earnings realisations. Findings reveal that firms with a positive <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and attractive growth opportunities command a valuation premium.

Unfortunately, the calculation of <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> has limitations, just like earnings. For example, as capital expenditures decrease, <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> increases by the same amount, and vice versa. Thus, a temporary reduction in capital expenditures could cause reported <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> to increase in an unsustainable way. This study examines growth in adjusted operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> (operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> adjusted for nonoperating and nonrecurring items), adjusted <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> (similarly adjusted), and capital expenditures for the non-financial firms of the S&P 100 for the years 2000 through 2003. The objective is to measure the extent to which growth observed in adjusted <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> is derived from operations or through reductions in capital expenditures.

Therefore, how corporate governance via board structure influences the use of <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and how this interaction affects dividend payment are crucial. This study examined the interaction effects of firm’s characteristics such as board structure and <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> on divided per share as a proxy of firm’s performance. The fixed effect regression with a sample of 361 non-financial Malaysian listed firms over the period of 2002 to 2007 were employed in the analysis.

For testing research hypotheses, the required data were collected from 63 companies listed in Tehran Securities Exchange. Data analysis was conducted using three methods of linear regression, Pearson analysis, and variance analysis and showed that there was a direct significant relationship between discretionary accruals and <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Also based on Jensen theory and other related research, there was also a direct relationship between discretionary accruals and <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> in Iranian firms with high <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and low growth...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliography. The use of <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> {{has been}} a source of {{conflict}} between shareholders and managers. This conflict derives from the agency relationship between shareholders and managers in that decisions taken by managers (as agents) affect the shareholders (as principals). The decisions of managers may not always be in the interest of shareholders. The interests of shareholders will be served if actions of managers lead to the maximisation of the total value of the company. The <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> theory suggests that managers have the tendency to misuse surplus cash resources. Any use of <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> that is not value maximising could result in losses to shareholders. These are termed the agency costs of <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow.</b> It is believed that managers will think and act as shareholders if they own significant proportions of the equity capital of companies. This dissertation examines the effects of the agency relationship on the utilisation of <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{from recent}} US and UK studies reveals {{a pattern of}} poor long run post {{acquisition}} performance by acquiring firms. One explanation, due to Jensen (1986) is that acquirers with an excess of <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> (FCF) will have a propensity to squander this on wasteful investments, including take-overs. In this paper, using a dataset of UK take-overs and proxies for <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> {{similar to those used}} by Lang, Stulz and Walking (1991), we find no support for the FCF hypothesis and show that this conclusion is robust to the model of long run returns employed. Contrary to the <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> hypothesis there is evidence that acquirers with high <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> perform better than acquirers with low <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow.</b> Although not consistent with the Jensen hypothesis, this evidence is compatible with the emerging UK evidence that shows cash flow-to-price measures are associated with market returns.

Strength level of accountancy profit relation in a few financial accounting literature measured by using Earnings Response Coefficients (ERC) as a reaction of by certain side of profit which have been company announced. The problems of the study {{about the influence of}} devidend payout ratio to Earnings Response Coefficients (ERC) with <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> moderating variable, influence of company which have not devidend payout ratio to Earnings Response Coefficients (ERC) with <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> moderating variable, influence of leverage to Earnings Response Coefficients (ERC) with <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> moderating variable. The goal of this study to know what is there are influence of devidend payout ratio to Earnings Response Coefficients (ERC) with <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> moderating variable, to know influence of company which have not devidend payout ratio there are Earnings Response Coefficients with <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> moderating variable, to know influence of leverage to Earnings Response Coefficients (ERC) with <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> moderating variable. The result of obtained analysis by t of tables of 1, 990 while t count 0, 331, meaning t count < t of tables of with level of signifikan equal to 0, 744 so Ho accepted and is Ha refused. So can be concluded that there no which positive influence between variable of DPR (X 1) with <b>free</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> moderating to earnings response coefficients.
