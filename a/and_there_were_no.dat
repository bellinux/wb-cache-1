5|$|Across {{the western}} Caribbean Sea, the {{developing}} storm produced heavy rainfall and increased winds. Strong winds in western Cuba caused severe damage, with two small towns nearly destroyed. About 90people {{were killed in}} the country, all in Pinar del Río Province. Later, the hurricane brought heavy rainfall to southern Florida, which caused flooding and crop damage. Damage was light in the state, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> casualties.|$|E

5|$|A Warrior Who Fought Custer was {{published}} in April 1931 to mostly good reviews. However, W. J. Ghent, writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather than face death {{at the hands of}} the Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a hindrance to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea more fully in a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself.|$|E
5|$|A new points {{system was}} {{implemented}} in the 2013 Continental Cup of Curling. The total of points available was 60 points, compared to the total of 400 points used in previous years. The mixed doubles, singles, and team games were worth one point each, and ties were worth one half point each to both teams. The skins games were worth {{a total of five}} points. All games were eight ends long, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> extra ends. Also, six mixed doubles games and six singles competition games were played, as before. However, there were eighteen team games instead of the previous twelve, and there were six skins games instead of the previous eight.|$|E
5|$|According to David A. Norris, {{a scholar}} specializing in Serbian {{cultural}} history, conditions in 19th-century Serbia were unsuitable {{for the development}} of visual art. Materials were difficult to come by, studio and exhibition spaces were virtually non-existent, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> art patrons willing to financially support painters and purchase their finished works. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, Serbian visual artists dedicated themselves almost exclusively to decorating the walls of churches and producing icons and other religious objects. There were some painters of Serb heritage living outside Serbia, such as Uroš Knežević and Jovan Popović, who resided in the Austrian Empire.|$|E

5|$|After Kiev, the Red Army {{no longer}} outnumbered the Germans <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> more trained {{reserves}} directly available. To defend Moscow, Stalin could field 800,000 men in 83 divisions, {{but no more}} than 25 divisions were fully effective. Operation Typhoon, the drive to Moscow, began on 30 September 1941. In front of Army Group Center was a series of elaborate defense lines, the first centered on Vyazma and the second on Mozhaysk. Russian peasants began fleeing ahead of the advancing German units, burning their harvested crops, driving their cattle away, and destroying buildings in their villages as part of a scorched-earth policy designed to deny the Nazi war machine of needed supplies and foodstuffs.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{the list of}} 21 tropical cyclone names {{for the first time}} ever, the NHC began naming storms with the Greek alphabet. Epsilon was the fifth name of the list, and ultimately there was one additional storm, making the 2005 season the most active on record with 27named storms. Since Epsilon stayed well out to sea and never approached land, no warnings or watches were issued. No ships reported tropical storm force winds from Epsilon <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> damages or fatalities.|$|E
5|$|At the Great Bitter Lake, the Egyptian 130th Amphibious Brigade {{performed}} its own crossing. Composed of the 602nd and 603rd Mechanized Infantry Battalions with 1,000 men, {{including a}} Sagger anti-tank battalion, an anti-air battalion, 20 PT-76 tanks and 100 amphibious armored personnel carriers, it was tasked with seeking and destroying enemy installations at the entrances of the Gedy and Mitla Passes. The sand rampart {{that lined the}} entire Suez Canal {{did not exist in}} the Bitter Lakes, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> Israeli defences or units to be encountered, and the brigade reached the opposite bank around 14:40 without any losses.

5|$|During the strike, despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the strike and the public was, by and large, opposed to the strike as well. Several of the strike leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC {{and the federal government}} to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the strike, and in maintaining the calm during the strike itself.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, several {{ships were}} {{caught off guard}} by the late arrival of Jeanne. The cyclone entered the Gulf of Mexico, and two barges broke loose from towing vessels via strong winds and high waves. One barge was an oil rig tender that {{contained}} 16people; it was carried several hundred miles across the central Gulf of Mexico. All crew members survived, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> maritime deaths related to the hurricane. Jeanne produced a prolonged period of rough surf and heavy swells along the Texas coast. Tides reached 2 to 4feet (1.20m) above normal. The hurricane caused coastal flooding; the worst flooding occurred near Galveston.|$|E
5|$|In {{incidents}} on 18 April, 21 May and 15 December, {{tear gas}} grenades were fired at Rajab's {{house in the}} village of Bani Jamra by unknown assailants. In the first incident, HRW identified the grenades thrown into the Rajab family's compound as US-manufactured munitions to which only Bahrain's security forces would have had access. Tear gas penetrated into the adjacent home of Rajab's 78-year-old mother who suffers from respiratory disease, causing her great distress. On 21 May, four gas grenades were fired at the house. This time, according to Rajab, the grenades were smaller than those used in the mid-April assault <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> marks identifying the manufacturer.|$|E

It was first held in 1963 at the Chelsea College of Physical Education at Eastbourne, England, with 11 nations competing. Since its inception the competition has been dominated primarily by the Australian and New Zealand teams, which hold ten and four titles, respectively. Trinidad and Tobago is the only other team {{to win a championship}} title. That title, won in 1979, was shared with New Zealand and Australia; all three teams finished with equal points {{at the end of the}} round robin, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> finals.|$|E
5|$|Ole Ewé, {{a former}} member of BOPA—another group in the Danish {{resistance}} movement—disagreed with the description of the attempt to kill the Gestapo leader Hoffman on the Roskildevej road. In the film, the car had Nazi flags, and a soldier and his son are killed by resistance gunfire. Ewé said that on that day he and other BOPA members were enlisted to kill Arno Oskar Hammeken, a Gestapo informer. Flammen, who also received tips about the informer's whereabouts, appeared there and shot up the car. Ewé said that the man in the car was in civilian clothes <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> Nazi flags on the car.|$|E
5|$|On 24 July 1930 Palmer's {{launched}} its thousandth ship, the tanker Peter Hurll, but {{by this time}} the brief shipbuilding boom had been ended by the Great Depression, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> new orders on the firm's books. Rumours of impending reorganisation and rationalisation in the industry gave the workforce cause for anxiety, which deepened with the formation in 1930 of National Shipbuilders Security Ltd (NSS). This was a company created by the government to assist shipbuilders by acquiring failing yards and dismantling them, so that production was concentrated within a smaller number of profitable yards. To ensure this rationalisation was sustained, the closed yards were banned from any shipbuilding activity for at least 40 years.|$|E

Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents.

No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free {{to go up to the}} border line, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E
5|$|Several Jews {{and other}} {{survivors}} of the Holocaust dedicated themselves to finding Eichmann and other Nazis. Among them was the Jewish Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. Wiesenthal learned from a letter shown to him in 1953 that Eichmann had been seen in Buenos Aires, and he passed along that information to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954. When Eichmann's father died in 1960, Wiesenthal made arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of the family, as Eichmann's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> current photos of the fugitive. He provided these photographs to Mossad agents on 18 February.|$|E
