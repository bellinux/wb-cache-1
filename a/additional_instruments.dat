5|$|Quadrophenia was {{released}} {{to a positive}} reception in both the UK and the US, but the resulting tour was marred with problems with backing tapes replacing the <b>additional</b> <b>instruments</b> on the album, and the stage piece was retired in early 1974. It was revived in 1996 with a larger ensemble, and a further tour occurred in 2012. The album made {{a positive impact on}} the mod revival movement of the late 1970s, and the resulting film adaptation, released in 1979, was successful. The album has been reissued on compact disc several times, and seen a number of remixes that corrected some perceived flaws in the original.|$|E
5|$|BeppoSAX functioned until 2002 and CGRO (with BATSE) was deorbited in 2000. However, the {{revolution}} {{in the study of}} gamma-ray bursts motivated the development of a number of <b>additional</b> <b>instruments</b> designed specifically to explore the nature of GRBs, especially in the earliest moments following the explosion. The first such mission, HETE-2, launched in 2000 and functioned until 2006, providing most of the major discoveries during this period. One of the most successful space missions to date, Swift, was launched in 2004 and as of 2016 is still operational. Swift is equipped with a very sensitive gamma ray detector as well as on-board X-ray and optical telescopes, which can be rapidly and automatically slewed to observe afterglow emission following a burst. More recently, the Fermi mission was launched carrying the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor, which detects bursts at a rate of several hundred per year, some of which are bright enough to be observed at extremely high energies with Fermi's Large Area Telescope. Meanwhile, on the ground, numerous optical telescopes have been built or modified to incorporate robotic control software that responds immediately to signals sent through the Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network. This allows the telescopes to rapidly repoint towards a GRB, often within seconds of receiving the signal and while the gamma-ray emission itself is still ongoing.|$|E

25|$|Hysterectomy can be {{performed}} in different ways. The oldest known technique is abdominal incision. Subsequently the vaginal (performing the hysterectomy through the vaginal canal) and later laparoscopic vaginal (with <b>additional</b> <b>instruments</b> inserted through a small hole, frequently close to the navel) techniques were developed.|$|E
25|$|They {{are dressed}} in {{colorful}} clothes, usually in an eccentric version of traditional Japanese clothes. Women may be dressed up like a Geisha, with heavy make up. Men usually have their hair in a top knot, although nowadays they are usually wigs, and some may wear fancy hats. They parade through the streets playing various instruments, including both traditional Japanese instruments and western instruments. Usually, one person carries a combined instrument consisting of a small gong (giving the chin sound in chindon'ya) and two small drums (giving the don sound in cindonya). <b>Additional</b> <b>instruments</b> by other performers may include a larger drum and a woodwind instrument, as for example a clarinet, a trumpet or a saxophone. They often play traditional Japanese tunes, military marches, or jazz.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} <b>additional</b> <b>instruments</b> {{are used for}} packing the weft. Some weaving areas in Iran known for {{producing}} very fine pieces use additional tools. In Kerman, a saber like instrument is used horizontally inside the shed. In Bijar, a nail-like tool is inserted between the warps, and beaten on in order to compact the fabric even more. Bijar is also famous for their wet loom technique, which consists of wetting the warp, weft, and yarn with water throughout the weaving process to compact the wool and allow for a particularly heavy compression of the pile, warps, and wefts. When the rug is complete and dried, the wool and cotton expand, which results in a very heavy and stiff texture. Bijar rugs are not easily pliable without damaging the fabric.|$|E
25|$|A live {{performance}} may feature various changes. The performances require {{a minimum of}} 230 players. However, most of the expanded orchestration (double brass, added flutes) {{and some of the}} unique instruments can be removed and replaced by more conventional counterparts (the panpipes can be replaced by a recorder), some roles like the wood flute can be doubled by the existing players. Also, the orchestra (particularly the string section) can be reduced to an overall size of under seventy players in order to accommodate for the <b>additional</b> <b>instruments</b> required while keeping within the limitations of the organiser or the stage. Alternatively, the orchestra can be expanded with a larger string section and added woodwind parts (so the cor anglais, piccolo and contrabassoon are played by separate players to those on the flutes, oboes and bassoons) and the SATBB and boy choirs (an additional, separate male choir is usually not used) are typically expanded, often to as many as 150 and 100 accordingly, or more. The solo roles are often reduced to one or two sopranos, a boy soprano, a girl and a baritone.|$|E
25|$|Rosetta was {{launched}} on 2 March 2004 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana on an Ariane 5 rocket and reached Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko on 7 May 2014. It performed {{a series of}} maneuvers to enter orbit between then and 6 August 2014, when it became the first spacecraft to orbit a comet. (Previous missions had conducted successful flybys of seven other comets.) It was one of ESA's Horizon 2000 cornerstone missions. The spacecraft consisted of the Rosetta orbiter, which featured 12 instruments, and the Philae lander, with nine <b>additional</b> <b>instruments.</b> The Rosetta mission orbited Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko for 17 months and was designed to complete the most detailed study of a comet ever attempted. The spacecraft was controlled from the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC), in Darmstadt, Germany. The planning for {{the operation of the}} scientific payload, together with the data retrieval, calibration, archiving and distribution, was performed from the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC), in Villanueva de la Cañada, near Madrid, Spain. It has been estimated that in the decade preceding 2014, some 2,000 people assisted in the mission in some capacity.|$|E

500|$|A choral {{movement}} confirms [...] "" [...] (The Lord {{has done}} {{good things for}} us). The movement is structured like a da capo aria, with a fugue in the opening and repeat, while the contrasting middle section is mostly homophonic. A a long ritornello theme features an [...] "imperious" [...] trumpet melody, which is played four times during the movement. The voices enter from the lowest to the highest, then <b>additional</b> <b>instruments</b> lead to a climax. In the middle section motifs from the ritornello are played [...] "above and between" [...] the voices. One fanfare motif appears also in Bach's first Brandenburg Concerto and would later {{be used in the}} bass aria [...] in the Christmas Oratorio. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann assumes, reflecting its secular character as a hunting signal and fanfare, that the movement is derived from an earlier homage cantata.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Bookends Theme" [...] {{that opens}} and closes side one is {{played on the}} {{acoustic}} guitar, with no <b>additional</b> <b>instruments.</b> An audio sample of the band's first hit, [...] "The Sound of Silence", softly plays during a cacophony of sounds {{near the end of}} the second track, [...] "Save the Life of My Child". John Simon, who was credited with production assistance on the song, created the bassline by playing a Moog synthesizer with help from Robert Moog himself. James Bennighof, author of The Words and Music of Paul Simon, finds that [...] "textural elements are variously supported by a churning groove, percussive, and distorted electronic sounds" [...] that complement the song's subject matter, suicide suburban youth. [...] "Overs" [...] explores a more jazz-oriented style, with a larger selection of chords and looser form than the group's previous styles.|$|E

This way, I can sing all of the hit songs, the songs that people want. But, it's a deeper meaning... these songs meant {{more than just the}} chorus that's catchy... it's my life." [...] Since the show was created last minute, there were many changes. Originally, the set list included, [...] "Ego", [...] "At Last", [...] "Listen", [...] "Ring the Alarm", and [...] "Upgrade U". These songs were later removed from the set list and a new one was added with <b>additional</b> <b>instruments.</b> The success of the show has led Wynn Resorts to ask Beyoncé to return as a residency act.|$|E
