50|$|A {{kerosene}} heater operates {{much like}} a large kerosene lamp. A circular wick made from fiberglass or cotton is integrated into a burner unit mounted above a font (tank) filled with 1-K kerosene. The wick draws kerosene from the tank via capillary action. Once lit, the wick heats the Kerosene until {{it turns into a}} gas (gasification) and this gas is then burnt which heats air via convection or nearby objects via radiation. The burner is designed to properly oxygenate and distribute the flames. The flame height is controlled by raising or lowering the exposed wick height inside the burner unit via an <b>adjusting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The kerosene heater is extinguished by fully retracting the wick into a cavity below the burner, which will snuff out the flame.|$|E

30|$|In fact, it is {{difficult}} for the PNPPSS to obtain desired dynamic and static performances because of the nonlinearity associated with air compressibility and the asymmetry of charging and discharging process. In addition, the parametric variation due to leakage, setting pressure and vacuum pumping speed will further complicate the problem. It is known that the distinct advantages of PID controllers are simple structure and robust performance [18]. However, it {{is difficult}} to achieve the ideal result for the conventional PID controllers due to the nonlinearities mentioned above. Fuzzy controller is a good candidate, since it is not based on the model of the process and the accurate model of the system is not required [19, 20]. Fuzzy rule based controllers are found to improve tracking performance over fixed gain PID by upwards of 70 % [21], and have been applied to pneumatic systems [22, 23]. However, regular fuzzy controller is not suitable to the system due to its lack of adaption to wider operational range and serious asymmetry. To improve robustness and achieve consistent control performance, some auto <b>adjusting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> need to be introduced. Recently, many auto <b>adjusting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for fuzzy controller have been presented [24 – 28], which offer better performance. In Refs. [24, 25], both the input and output scaling factors (SFs) were tuned with rule-base defined on the error and change in error of the controlled variable. Since the output SF has strong influence on the performance and stability of the system [26], some fuzzy logic controllers with auto-adjusting mechanism only tuned the output SF, which was regulated by a properly designed rule base [27, 28].|$|R
