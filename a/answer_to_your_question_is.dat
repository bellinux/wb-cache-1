5000|$|In December 2013, {{she moved}} to New York because Russian {{authorities}} had begun to talk about taking children away from gay parents. In March, [...] "the St Petersburg legislator Milonov who had become {{a spokesman for the}} law ‘homosexual propaganda' towards children started mentioning me and my ‘perverted family’ in his interviews," [...] and Gessen contacted an adoption lawyer asking [...] "whether I had reason to worry that social services would go after my family and attempt to remove my oldest son, whom I adopted in 2000." [...] The lawyer told Gessen [...] "to instruct my son to run if he is approached by strangers and concluding: ‘The <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> at the airport.’" [...] In June 2013, Gessen was beaten up outside of the Parliament [...] "and I realised that in all my interactions, including professional ones, I no longer felt I was perceived as a journalist first: I am now a person with a pink triangle." [...] She stated that [...] "a court would easily decide to annul Vova's adoption, and I wouldn't even know it." [...] Given this potential threat to her family, Gessen [...] "felt like no risk was small enough to be acceptable," [...] she later told the CBC. [...] "So we just had to get out." [...] In a January 2014 interview with ABC News, Gessen said that the Russian gay propaganda law had [...] "led to a huge increase in antigay violence, including murders. It's led to attacks on gay and lesbian clubs and film festivals...and because these laws are passed supposedly to protect children, the people who are most targeted or have the most to fear are LGBT parents." ...|$|E
40|$|In Douglas Adam’s "The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy", {{published}} in the 1970 s, a computer is confronted with the intriguing question: "What {{is the meaning of}} life?" After elaborate and tedious number crunching, the computer returns: "The <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> 42 ". It is obvious, that the monetary valuation of road safety is not an easy task either. In fact, it implies answering an equally difficult and intriguing question – What is the statistical value of a human life? Although various methods and approaches have been put forward to estimate the statistical cost of a road fatality, some scholars argue that valuing fatal injuries and hence human life is virtually impossible. They maintain that people do not nearly have sufficiently accurate preferences to make a sensible trade-off between road safety and money. The (perceptions of) changes in risk levels are so small that making the trade-off is very difficult, if not impossible (Hauer, 1994). However, other road safety costs can be statistically determined and initiatives developed to reduce the burden to both organisations and individuals. Therefore, the topic {{of this paper is to}} determine what factors contribute to work-related road incidents and how economic costs to industry organisations could be reduced...|$|E
