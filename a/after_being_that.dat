5000|$|The 2013-14 season started poorly for Berisha, despite scoring in {{the opening}} round win over Wellington Phoenix, he injured his {{hamstring}} in Round 2 which kept him on the sidelines for four weeks. Upon his return, he scored four goals in his next five appearances including a second half winner against Perth Glory and a brace in a 2-1 defeat of Adelaide United, however a hip injury then sidelined him for a further two weeks. Despite Berisha again scoring on his return from injury, on this occasion he could not prevent defeat to Adelaide at home. In the following match away to Perth Glory he received his first red card in the A-League. He was unfortunate to be booked in the first 30 seconds of the game whilst contesting a header with Michael Thwaite; he was then given his marching orders in the 32nd minute after receiving a second yellow card for a reckless tackle on the same player. Berisha scored on his return from suspension, netting a 90th-minute winner against Central Coast Mariners. On 27 April 2014, Berisha scored and gave his team the victory 1-0 against Melbourne Victory, valid for semi-finals of the A-League.
