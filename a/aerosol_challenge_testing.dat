40|$|OBJECTIVE: Airway {{microvascular}} leakage {{is considered}} to be an important component of airway inflammation in asthma. In the present study we examined the effect of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) on airway microvascular leakage in vivo. METHODOLOGY: Tracheal Evans blue extravasation was examined in an isolated tracheal segment, in anaesthetized mechanically ventilated guinea pigs. Baseline tracheal microvascular leakage was measured in five animals. As a control group for <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge,</b> the isolated tracheal segment (n = 5) underwent saline <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge.</b> To <b>test</b> whether a combination of IL- 1 beta (10 ng/mL) and TNFalpha (100 ng/mL) induced Evans blue extravasation, the trachea was exposed to an aerosol of these cytokines (n = 5). As a positive control the tracheal segment was <b>challenged</b> with histamine <b>aerosol</b> (5 x 10 (- 2) mol) (n = 3). All <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenges</b> were for 1 min. RESULTS: TNFalpha and IL- 1 beta <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> significantly increased Evans blue extravasation (28. 9 +/- 1. 6 microg/g wet tissue, mean +/- SE) compared to saline challenge (13. 8 +/- 3. 0 microg/g; P < 0. 05). Tracheal dye extravasation without <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge,</b> was not significantly different from saline-challenged animals (17. 5 +/- 2. 9 and 13. 8 +/- 3. 0 microg/g, respectively). Histamine significantly increased Evans blue extravasation (50. 1 +/- 4. 8 microg/g; P < 0. 05) compared to saline challenge. CONCLUSION: Pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNFalpha and IL- 1 beta are able to induce significant microvascular leakage in the guinea pig trachea...|$|R
40|$|A {{biological}} safety cabinet was tested {{to determine the}} effect of crossdrafts (such as those created by normal laboratory activity or ventilation) upon the ability of the cabinet to protect both experiments and investigators. A simple crossdraft, controllable from 50 to 200 feet per min (fpm; 15. 24 to 60. 96 m/min), was created across the face of the unit. Modifications of standardized procedures involving controlled bacterial <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenges</b> provided stringent <b>test</b> conditions. Results indicated that, as the crossflow velocities exceeded 100 fpm, the ability of the cabinet to protect either experiments or investigators decreased logarithmically with increasing crossdraft speed. Because 100 fpm is an airspeed easily achieved by some air conditioning and heating vents (open windows and doorways may create velocities far in excess of 200 fpm), the proper placement of a {{biological safety}} cabinet within the laboratory [...] away from such disruptive air currents [...] is essential to satisfactory cabinet performance...|$|R
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} bioaerosol environments {{may present}} {{a challenge to}} biological detection-identification-monitoring (BIODIM) systems aiming at rapid and reliable warning of bioterrorism incidents. One way to improve the operational performance of BIODIM systems is to increase our understanding of relevant bioaerosol backgrounds. Subway stations are enclosed public environments which may be regarded as potential bioterrorism targets. This study provides novel information concerning the temporal variability of the concentration level, size distribution, and diversity of airborne bacteria in a Norwegian subway station. Three different air samplers were used during a 72 -h sampling campaign in February 2011. The results suggested that the airborne bacterial environment was stable between days and seasons, while the intraday variability {{was found to be}} substantial, although often following a consistent diurnal pattern. The bacterial levels ranged from not detected to 103 CFU m 3 and generally showed increased levels during the daytime compared to the nighttime levels, as well as during rush hours compared to non-rush hours. The airborne bacterial levels showed rapid temporal variation (up to 270 -fold) on some occasions, both consistent and inconsistent with the diurnal profile. Airborne bacterium-containing particles were distributed between different sizes for particles of > 1. 1 m, although 50 % were between 1. 1 and 3. 3 m. Anthropogenic activities (mainly passengers) were demonstrated as major sources of airborne bacteria and predominantly contributed 1. 1 - to 3. 3 -m bacterium-containing particles. Our findings {{contribute to the development of}} realistic testing and evaluation schemes for BIODIM equipment by providing information that may be used to simulate operational bioaerosol backgrounds during controlled <b>aerosol</b> chamber-based <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> with biological threat agents...|$|R
40|$|Anaphylactic bronchoconstriction {{provoked}} by <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge,</b> and its pharmacological modulation, {{has been investigated}} in anaesthetized pump-ventilated guinea-pigs actively sensitized to ovalbumin (OA). <b>Aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> (OA 0. 03 - 10 mg ml- 1) provoked immediate bronchoconstriction, the degree of which, and its rate of development, was directly related to antigen concentration. Concomitant changes in heart rate and systemic arterial blood pressure following <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> were reduced compared with systemic (OA, 1 mg kg- 1 i. v.) challenge. Unlike systemic <b>challenge,</b> <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> did not cause a concomitant fall in either circulating leukocyte or platelet count. When a submaximal (microshock) <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> stimulus (OA, 0. 3 mg ml- 1, 5 s) was employed, bronchoconstriction was markedly reduced by mepyramine (2 mg kg- 1 i. v.). The residual component of bronchoconstriction was enhanced by indomethacin (10 mg kg- 1 i. v.), an effect which was reversed by either BW 755 C (30 mg kg- 1 i. v.) or FPL 55712 (10 mg kg- 1 i. v.). When a supramaximal (macroshock) <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> stimulus (OA, 10 mg ml- 1, 5 s) was employed, bronchoconstriction was also markedly reduced by mepyramine. Residual bronchoconstriction was not altered by indomethacin, slowed but not reduced by indomethacin plus BW 755 C, and substantially reduced by indomethacin plus FPL 55712. The successive incremental antagonism of anaphylactic bronchoconstriction by mepyramine and mepyramine plus indomethacin and FPL 55712 indicates that the predominant mediators involved are histamine and leukotrienes, respectively. The failure of indomethacin plus BW 755 C to inhibit the mepyramine-resistant bronchoconstriction {{provoked by}} OA macroshock may reflect the increased generation of leukotrienes via a 5 -lipoxygenase isoenzyme resistant to inhibition by BW 755 C.

Current animal models such as the intracerebral challenge model have significant limitations in correlating protection to a specific level of anti-PT antibody. This study examines the protective effects of priming with tetranitromethane-inactivated pertussis toxoid (PTx) vaccine in the <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> model and whether a measurable response to a priming dose of PTx is enough to initiate a protective secondary response when challenged with infection. The correlation of priming with markers of illness such as leukocytosis, weight loss, bacterial proliferation, and mortality after established infection with Bordetella pertussis was explored. BALB/c mice were immunized with PTx vaccine on day 6 of life and then challenged with B. pertussis using the <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> model. Data were analyzed according to the primary immunologic response, differentiating responders (anti-PT immunoglobulin G [IgG] ≥ 1 μg/ml) from nonresponders (anti-PT IgG < 1 μg/ml). Mice that showed evidence of priming on the day of <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> were able to mount a secondary response to the challenge with a ≥ 2 -fold rise in anti-PT IgG antibody by day 7 and a ≥ 10 -fold rise by day 14 post-aerosol challenge. These primed mice were significantly better protected against leukocytosis, weight loss, and proliferation of B. pertussis in the lungs following <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> than the nonprimed group.

40|$|To {{establish}} whether allergic asthma {{could be}} induced experimentally in a nonhuman primate using a common human allergen, three female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were sensitized with house dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae) allergen (HDMA) by subcutaneous injection, followed by four intranasal sensitizations, {{and exposure to}} allergen aerosol 3 hours per day, 3 days per week for up to 13 weeks. Before <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge,</b> all three monkeys skin-tested positive for HDMA. During <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> with HDMA, sensitized monkeys exhibited cough and rapid shallow breathing and increased airway resistance, which was reversed by albuterol aerosol treatment. Compared to nonsensitized monkeys, there was a fourfold reduction in the dose of histamine aerosol necessary to produce a 150 % increase in airway resistance in sensitized monkeys. After <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge,</b> serum levels of histamine were elevated in sensitized monkeys. Sensitized monkeys exhibited increased levels of HDMA-specific IgE in serum, numbers of eosinophils and exfoliated cells within lavage, and elevated CD 25 expression on circulating CD 4 + lymphocytes. Intrapulmonary bronchi of sensitized monkeys had focal mucus cell hyperplasia, interstitial infiltrates of eosinophils, and thickening of the basement membrane zone.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the fundamental nature of protective immunity to Bordetella pertussis, we studied intranasal immunization of adult mice with formalin-fixed B. pertussis (FFBP), followed by <b>aerosol</b> B. pertussis <b>challenge.</b> Mice given two doses of FFBP intranasally completely cleared a subsequent pertussis <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> from tracheae and lungs (defined as protection), {{but there was}} no correlation between levels of specific antibody and clearance of bacteria. Further, transfer of immune serum before <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> had minimal effects on bacterial burdens. However, pertussis-specific T cells producing interferon � but not interleukin 4 or interleukin 10 were detected in draining lymph nodes of FFBP-immunized mice. Significantly, repeated immunization of B cell knockout (BKO) mice resulted in partial protection, and complete protection was reconstituted by transfer of pertussis-immune B cells; reconstituted BKO mice had little if any detectable antipertussis antibodies. Immunization of mice lacking all T cells or lacking CD 4 � T cells did not lead to protection; in contrast, CD 8 � mice were protected. Mice depleted of CD 4 � T cells after immunization but before <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge,</b> which thus had normal amounts of specific antibodies, were not optimally protected.

Titer of the antibodies was calculated from the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) unit given arbitrarily to reference antibodies. PT antibody titer which protected 50 % of mice was indistinguishable in both active immunization followed by intracerebral challenge and passive immunization followed by <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge.</b> The 50 % effective dose was 23 ELISA U/ml in the former mice and 24 ELISA U/mouse in the latter. In the intracerebral challenge system, FHA did not elicit a protective response but was very helpful for PT as an immunizing antigen. When anti-FHA immunoglobulin G coexisted with anti-PT immunoglobulin G in mice, the 50 % effective dose of PT antibody was 4. 4 or 10 ELISA U/mouse in intracerebral or <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> systems, respectively.

The infection of rabbits and non-human primates with fully virulent Bacillus anthracis spores provides two excellent models of anthrax disease. However, the high cost of procuring and housing these animals and the specialized facilities required to deliver fully virulent spores limit their practical use in early stages of product development. Conversely, the small size and low cost associated with using mice makes this animal model more practical for conducting experiments in which large numbers of animals are required.

However, the contribution of anthrax toxin proteins to dissemination, disease progression, and subsequent immunity after aerosol infection with spores has not been clearly elucidated. To better understand the role of anthrax toxins in pathogenesis in vivo and to investigate the contribution of antibody to toxin proteins in protection, we completed a series of in vivo experiments using a murine <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> model {{and a collection of}} in-frame deletion mutants lacking toxin components. Our data show that after aerosol exposure to Bacillus anthracis spores, anthrax lethal toxin was required for outgrowth of bacilli in the draining lymph nodes and subsequent progression of infection beyond the lymph nodes to establish disseminated disease. After pulmonary exposure to anthrax spores, toxin expression was required for the development of protective immunity to a subsequent lethal challenge. However, immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin G) titers to toxin proteins, prior to secondary challenge, did not correlate with the protection observed upon secondary challenge with wild-type spores. A correlation was observed between survival after secondary challenge and rapid anamnestic responses directed against toxin proteins. Taken together, these studies indicate that anthrax toxins are required for dissemination of bacteria beyond the draining lymphoid tissue, leading to full virulence in the mouse <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> model, and that primary and anamnestic immune responses to toxin proteins provide protection against subsequent lethal challenge.

Substantial {{progress has been made}} during the past 10 years toward the development of improved vaccines for brucellosis. In part, this has been achieved by the identification and characterization of live attenuated mutants that are safer in the host but still can stimulate an adequate immune response. In the present study, the identification and characterization of the mucR mutant (BMEI 1364) as a vaccine candidate for brucellosis was conducted. BALB/c mice were vaccinated intraperitoneally at a dose of 105 CFU with the mutant to evaluate safety and protective efficacy against intraperitoneal and <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge.</b> All animals vaccinated with the vaccine candidate demonstrated a statistically significant degree of protection against both intraperitoneal and <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge.</b> Safety was revealed by the absence of Brucella associated pathological changes, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or granulomatous disease. These results suggest that the 16 MΔmucR vaccine is safe, elicits a strong protective immunity, and should be considered as a promising vaccine candidate for human use...|$|R
40|$|Burkholderia mallei is {{the cause}} of {{glanders}} and a proven biological weapon. We identified and purified the type IV pilin protein of this organism to study its potential as a subunit vaccine. We found that purified pilin was highly immunogenic. Furthermore, mice infected via sublethal <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> developed significant increases in titers of antibody against the pilin, suggesting that it is expressed in vivo. Nevertheless, we found no evidence that high-titer antipilin antisera provided passive protection against a sublethal or lethal <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> and no evidence of protection afforded by active immunization with purified pilin. These results contrast with the utility of type IV pilin subunit vaccines against other infectious diseases and highlight the need for further efforts to identify protective responses against this pathogen. Glanders, a contagious and fatal disease of odd-toed ungu-lates that has zoonotic potential, has been known since anti-quity. It is caused by infection with the bacterium Burkholderia mallei. In solipeds (horses, mules, and donkeys), B. mallei can cause disease in two forms, respiratory (glanders) and subcu-taneous (farcy) (26). Glanders remains a problem in parts of Asia, South America, and Africa (2). Humans may becom...|$|R
40|$|T {{lymphocytes}} have {{a central}} regulatory {{role in the}} pathogenesis of asthma. We delineated the participation of lymphocytes in the acute allergic and chronic tolerant stages of a murine model of asthma by characterizing the various subsets of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue associated with these responses. Acute (10 -day) <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> of immunized C 57 BL/ 6 J mice with ovalbumin resulted in airway eosinophilia, histological evidence of peribronchial and perivascular airway inflammation, clusters of B cells and TCRγδ cells in lung tissue, increased serum IgE levels, and airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. In mice subjected to chronic (6 -week) <b>aerosol</b> <b>challenge</b> with ovalbumin, airway inflammation and serum IgE levels were significantly attenuated and airway hyperresponsiveness was absent. The marked increases in lung B and T cell populations seen in the acute stage were also significantly reduced in the chronic stage of this model. Thus, acute ovalbumin challenge resulted in airway sensitization characteristic of asthma, whereas chronic ovalbumin challenge elicited a suppressed or tolerant state. The transition from antigenic sensitization to tolerance was accompanied by shifts in lymphocyte profiles in the lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid...|$|R
40|$|<b>Challenge</b> <b>tests</b> {{are used}} to reveal the {{adaptability}} and resilience of humans to get insight in their health. When contrasting <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> are used, various forms of adaptability can be tested and this gives a multidimensional view {{on the health of}} these individuals. Here we introduce a methodology to describe the similarities and differences on how individuals are positioned in the health space based on the responses to different <b>challenge</b> <b>tests.</b> Results show that anabolic and catabolic challenges differentiate healthy subjects in rather different ways. Considering these results we hypothesize that combining <b>challenge</b> <b>tests</b> can improve the understanding of the underlying multidimensional phenotype...|$|R
