40|$|A {{critical}} review of systems of scoring multiple choice tests is presented and {{the superiority of}} a system based upon elimination method over one based upon the best <b>answer</b> <b>mode</b> is hypothesized. This is {{discussed in terms of}} the capacity of the mode to reveal the relationships among decoy options and the effects of partial information, misinformation and guessing. Tests were administered to two groups of subjects and scored according to each of the three treatment modes, classical, weighted choice, and elimination. In addition, subjects were asked to indicate their confidence in the correctness of each answer. Thus, treatment, confidence, and knowledge scores were computed for each subject and a Gulliksen-Wilks regression test was performed on the data to compare the validity and reliability of the three scoring modes. The results generally support the hypothesized superiority of the elimination scores. Elimination produced higher validities and reliabilities and less guessing than either of the other two treatments, Although the design did not permit a definitive comparison of elimination and confidence scores, there was some evidence that elimination scores were at least as valid as confidence scores.

This research set out to monitor the information activities of selected public and special libraries in the UK. An independent researcher collected enquiry data at seven different information services (two public reference libraries, two public lending libraries, a tourist information centre and two special libraries). This data was then categorised according to length of <b>answer,</b> <b>mode</b> of enquiring, type of enquiry and subject of enquiry.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to use DTMF decoders, sensors and micro-controllers to control {{autonomous}} navigation of a robot between a start and end point along a fixed path. This has very practical applications, eg. a mobile phone {{can be used to}} start the car and allow it to autonomously drive itself to a pick up point and vehicles in warehouses to carry goods from point A to point B, etc. A DTMF decoder is interfaced with the microcontroller, and a phone on auto <b>answer</b> <b>mode</b> is connected to the decoder. When the robot is called and a number on the user’s phone is pressed, the tone is sent to the decoder, which decodes and sends a signal to the microcontroller, and the robot is started. To avoid obstacles the robot has inbuilt Infrared sensors which detect obstacles and inform the microcontroller, which accordingly guides the robot. In this setup only three sensors were used given the limitation in terms of input ports. However, a greater number of sensors would allow for the robot to be aware of more specific situations. Therefore, it can be made more adaptable in varying situations. The test robot was programmed using Embedded C with AVR Studios. This approach uses existing technologies and is very inexpensive...|$|E

40|$|Background: Cheap and {{effective}} tools for measuring patients’ physical activity (PA) level are needed. The first aim {{in this thesis}} was therefore to assess the validity of two PA -questions, and their three associated answer modes, that are used within the Swedish health care system. Sitting, light intensity PA (LIPA), and moderate and vigorous intensity PA (MVPA), are associated with health and longevity, but detailed population data assessed with objective methods is needed. The second aim was thus to assess the above with motion sensor technology, in a middle-aged Swedish sample. Low self-perceived health is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality, but this association may vary over time with changes in the society and our lifestyle. The third aim was to assess secular trends in the interrelations between self-perceived health, physical fitness, and selected covariates. The effects of PA on prescription (PAP) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in overweight adults are unclear, thus the fourth aim was to explore this. Methods: All data was collected in the Swedish population. Data from the PA -questions and accelerometers, aerobic fitness, counter movement jump, and balance tests, blood samples, and self-rated general health were collected in 365 participants, 21 – 66 yrs. The PA pattern was assessed in 948 individuals, 50 ‒ 64 yrs, from the SCAPIS pilot study. Self-perceived physical health, and measured aerobic fitness, counter movement jump height, and balance, and demographic and lifestyle data, was assessed in three independent samples from 1990, 2000 and 2013, including 3564 adults, 20 ‒ 65 yrs. The effects of Swedish PAP on HRQoL was assessed in a randomized controlled trial including 101 men and women, 67 ‒ 68 yrs, that were inactive, overweight (BMI> 25 kg/m 2), and had a waist circumference ≥ 102 cm (men) or ≥ 88 cm (women), who were randomized to an intervention group or a control group. The 36 -item Short Form Health Survey (SF- 36) {{was used to assess}} HRQoL. Results: The multiple choice <b>answer</b> <b>mode</b> of the two PA -questions was found to have the strongest validity, compared with the two other (an open mode, and one where PA minutes is specified per weekday). The validity is in line with many other established PA-questionnaires, but the open mode has limitations. The assessment of PA pattern showed that 61 % of motion sensor wear time represented sitting, 35 % LIPA, and 4 % MVPA. Only 7 % of the sample met the PA recommendations. The odds for describing perceived health as good was found to increase by 5 % per each increment of 1 ml/kg/min in VO 2 max. This was stable across genders and all three LIV-samples (i. e. over time). Waist circumference, chronic disease, sleep problems, and level of satisfaction with one’s life, were also important correlates. The Swedish PAP group improved significantly more, and more participants displayed clinically relevant improvements (OR 2. 43), in mental aspects of HRQoL, compared to the controls. Physical aspects of HRQoL improved in the PAP group, but not in the control group. Conclusions: The multiple choice <b>answer</b> <b>mode</b> has the strongest validity and Open mode the weakest. The PA -questions may be used in populations, or in individuals to determine appropriateness for treatment. The questions’ advantages and limitations must be considered and further reliability and validity studies are needed. The results regarding sitting, LIPA, MVPA and fulfillment of PA recommendations, are of high clinical relevance. A great challenge remains to further implement methods to increase the level of PA in the Swedish population. Physical fitness is related to self-perceived health independently of changes in society and lifestyle over time, and simple questions may be useful for the clinical assessment of physical fitness. Swedish PAP has a positive effect on mental aspects of HRQoL, measured by the SF- 36. This finding supports the clinical use of the Swedish PAP model. LIV 201...|$|E

The user {{in order to control}} the vehicle should make a video call to the 4 G enabled phone attached in the Vehicle, from any another 4 G enabled phone, which can send DTMF tones by pressing the numeric buttons and can view the video output. The cell phone in the vehicle is kept in auto <b>answer</b> <b>mode.</b> So, after a ring the cell phone accepts the call and starts video transmission.

Second generation (2 G) wireless supported more users within a cell by using digital technology, which allowed many callers to use the same multiplexed channel. But 2 G was still primarily meant for voice communications, not data, except some very low data-rate features, like short messaging service (SMS). So-called 2. 5 G allowed carriers to increase data rates with a software upgrade at the base transceivers stations (BTS), as long as consumers purchased new phones too.

The questionnaire born to cover an Italian lack concerned the psychological tools for people aged within 14 and 25 years old (Sanavio, et al., 1992; Michelin & Sica, 1996). The aim of CBA young form is evaluating the typical trouble of adolescence in Italy. The main goal of the questionnaire is the evaluation of three things: psychological wellness, the probability whom the subject could have some kinds of dangerous behaviors and the subject's skills against negative events in life. The diagnosis {{of the state of}} well-being and psychological adjustment of the subject is a priority goal for any instrument of medical, also referring to an age evolving as that of adolescence or youth, it becomes essential to collect elements that can help the specialist to provide for "risky behavior" {{on the part of the}} subject. Alcohol, drugs, AIDS, car accidents, vandalism, etc [...] seriously put at risk the lives of many young people and invariably mark the future adulthood. Finally, it is necessary to be able to estimate the presence of so-called "coping strategies" coping strategies can be conceptualized as psychological resources that help the person to develop and address the mutavoli situations she encounters in the course of their lives (Goldfried and Davison, 1976; Petter, 1999). In fact, insufficient acquisition of these strategies results in difficulties and problems in interpersonal behavior and social life of the individual. On the other hand, realistic expectations of self-efficacy, the ability to restructure erroneous beliefs, a sense of self-confidence, problem solving skills, etc [...] , Can be considered as real factors "protective" of the psychological health of the person and more generally an indicator of well-being and psychosocial adjustment. Description of the CBA-Y The CBA-Y in its final form consists of 500 items by filling in the form checklist. Who fills in the questionnaire flows individual item and mark in the box corresponding to those judges can adapt to your situation. This mode of response is generally considered to be less invasive because it allows the omission of the item rather than forcing the individual to give an answer. Compilation time is around 30 minutes. Protocol CBA-Y are obtained across a range of information about individual items marked dall'esaminato. In addition there is the structuring of responses within two control scales (Autoapertura, Emotional State), two scales of well-being (well-being, psychosocial adjustment) and 7 scales of discomfort (Use of Drugs and Unusual Experiences, psychopathological risk, Love the risk and search of excitement, anxiety and emotional instability, Characteristics and antisocial behavior, irritability, aggressiveness and hostility Events psychophysiological). It also calculates the number of items that were used to describe as additional information for the psychologist. At the same time it was realized the short form of the same questionnaire, the Youth Welfare CBA (CBA-BG). The short form differs from the baseline questionnaire for the reduction in the number of items that have been brought to 200. The stairs that are calculated has been eliminated on the emotional state portandone the total number to 10. Objectives The overall objective of the research is to validate the CBA Young form. The validation process is divided into different times with different priorities. 1. Investigate the main psychometric characteristics of the questionnaire. We intend to evaluate the factor structure of the questionnaire, the distribution of scores in the scales and their reliability, possible gender differences in the responses and any differences related to age groups. 2. Convergent and discriminant validity: comparison of the instrument with other psychological screening questionnaires in charge of the youth population. 3. Criterion validity: to observe the pattern of response to the questionnaire populations characterized by the presence of specific symptoms in the field of psychology. 4. Measure the predictive power of the questionnaire to the onset of psychopathological symptoms in young people. Participants A large representative sample of the normal population (about 2000 participants). Subsamples pathological to test the response of the questionnaire when administered to individuals critical. A sample external to that used for the collection of normative data to test the external validity of the questionnaire. Materials and methods - Informed Consent Form - Folder registry (socio demographic information, medical history and related to pharmacological treatment in progress) - Medical Record (information on the diagnosis and course of the disease) - Young form CBA (CBA-Y) - CBA youth welfare (CBA-BG) - Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory version adolescents (Butcher & Williams, 1996). The number of participants will take part in the compilation of one or more questionnaires. Partecipanti Un vasto campione rappresentativo della popolazione normale (circa 2000 partecipanti).

Goal. The objectives of this work are twofold: to assess whether the checklist mode with respect to the true / false influence scores and highlight any differences between paper and electronic administration. Method. 100 people completed the questionnaire in response mode checklist and true / false in order counterbalanced. 50 people have made the two compilations in the electronic version and 50 in the paper version. To evaluate the differences between the two modes of response was used the McNemar test on the 16 sections of the questionnaire and the analysis of variance on the scores obtained in 15 steps. To evaluate the differences between paper and electronic administration has been used analysis of variance on the scores obtained in 15 steps. Results. The McNemar test showed that the number of items marked "true" is greater than the number of items selected in the checklist in all sections of the questionnaire included the "status anxiety.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} psychometric {{properties}} of the Italian version of the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) and to study the relationship between anhedonia, depression and cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: The SHAPS (14 items) was translated into Italian and pre-tested in a pilot study. Two items evaluating physical anhedonia related to sexual issues were added. The Italian version of SHAPS was validated in 274 consecutive PD patients, divided into patients with major depression according to DSM-IV criteria (dPD) and patients without depression (nPD), and in healthy subjects. To test the feasibility of the instrument and to determine whether clinical data affect anhedonia, we also administered SHAPS to 1307 patients with different types of parkinsonism. RESULTS: The Italian SHAPS proved to be easy to understand as regards the question and <b>answer</b> <b>modes.</b> Intraclass coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0. 65 for the total score. KR index was 0. 61. ANOVA of the SHAPS total score revealed that scores were higher in dPD patients than in healthy controls and nPD (p< 0. 05). In the 1307 patients with various types of parkinsonism, the SHAPS data showed that anhedonia was related to age, type of parkinsonism, apathy, depression and cognitive impairment. Anhedonia was correlated with frontal dysfunctions in supranuclear palsy and PD patients (r=- 0. 682 and - 0. 264 respectively, p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The Italian version of the SHAPS is a reliable tool with which to assess anhedonia in patients with PD and other forms of parkinsonism...|$|R

We present an O(n 2 − 2) -space static data structure that supports range mode queries in O(n) time in the worst case, for any fixed ∈ [0, 1 / 2]. When = 1 / 2, this corresponds to the first linear-space data structure to guarantee O(√n) query time. We then describe three additional linear-space data structures that provide O(k), O(m), and O(|j − i|) query time, respectively, where k denotes the number of distinct elements in A and m denotes {{the frequency of the}} mode of A. Finally, we examine generalizing our data structures to higher dimensions. ...|$|R

Psychological measures, developed for paper-and-pencil (paper) administration require measurement equivalence testing when administered in an alternative mode. Here, Icelandic translations of the NEO-FFI personality measure and Adult Reading History Questionnaire (ARHQ) were tested for equivalence of measurement and data quality between paper and web mode. Perceived sensitivity of data and preference for survey mode were also assessed. One hundred adults were recruited to <b>answer</b> both <b>modes</b> in a randomized, crossover design. Eighty-eight participants completed both administrations with an average of 63. 8 days (SD = 2. 2) between them. Within-subjects comparisons of means between modes demonstrated measurement equivalence for both measures. However, differing invalidity coefficients by mode observed by multi-trait multi method (MTMM) analysis suggested systematic effects not captured by traditional psychometric evaluation. Of note was a greater tendency for acquiescence responding to the NEO-FFI observed in web mode. Neither personality traits nor ARHQ reading difficulty scores were associated with preference for survey mode. However, 36...|$|R

Another question to be <b>answered</b> is why <b>Mode</b> 1 has arisen after Mode 2: the original organizational and institutional basis of science, consisting of networks and invisible colleges. Where have these ideas, of the scientist as the isolated individual and of science separated from the interests of society, come from? Mode 2 represents the material base of science, how it actually operates. Mode 1 is a construct, built upon that base {{in order to justify}} autonomy for science, especially in an earlier era when it was still a fragile institution and needed all the help it could get (references omitted)." ...|$|R

The best previous data structure with linear space, by Krizanc, Morin, and Smid (ISAAC 2003), requires O (√ n log log n) query time. We improve their result and present an O(n) -space data structure that supports range mode queries in O (√ n / log n) worst-case time. Furthermore, we present strong evidence that a query time significantly below √ n cannot be achieved by purely combinatorial techniques; we show that boolean matrix multiplication of two √ n × √ n matrices reduces to n range mode queries {{in an array of}} size O(n). Additionally, we give linear-space data structures for orthogonal range mode in higher dimensions (queries in near O(n 1 − 1 / 2 d) time) and for halfspace range mode in higher dimensions (queries in O(n 1 − 1 /d 2) time) ...|$|R
