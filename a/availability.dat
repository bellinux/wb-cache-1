5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal <b>availability</b> of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This <b>availability</b> {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat <b>availability</b> for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food <b>availability</b> and {{temperature}} affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food <b>availability</b> provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pessimistic quorum-based data {{replication}} strategies gener-ally strive for maximizing operation <b>availabilities</b> while adhering to a strict consistency notion. Unfortunately, their operation <b>availabilities</b> are strictly upper-bounded. Probabilistically relaxing the consistency notion permits {{to overcome this}} bound, introducing probabilistic data replica-tion strategies that allow for a data consistency vs. operation availabili-ties trade-off. We present two construction algorithms transforming strict quorum systems into probabilistic ones and compare {{them in terms of}} operation <b>availabilities</b> and degree of data consistency. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of forest structure (food and cover <b>availabilities)</b> on habitat use by roe deer Capreolus capreolus (Linnaeus, 1758) was studied comparing home ranges in a shrubowood (much food, low visibility bet-ween deer) and a coppice (low food, good visibility). There was {{no change in}} home range location during the year. Home ranges were greater in the shrubwood than in coppice and showed greater seasonal variations. Population density was higher in shrubwood. Roe deer showed a different strategy in an area with good trophic <b>availabilities</b> but crowded and in an area with poor trophic <b>availabilities</b> but less crowded...|$|R
5|$|All studies {{revealed}} minor {{improvements in}} household nutrient <b>availability,</b> with the 1985 study revealing an improvement of vitamin and mineral consumption over non-participating {{families and the}} 1993 study partially confirming these results. The most extensive study on nutrient <b>availability</b> was published in 1996, which concluded that nutrition did not change significantly after {{the implementation of the}} NAP program for all beneficiaries, however most improvements were noted for very low-income beneficiaries versus their non-participating equivalents.|$|E

5|$|Different {{estimates}} exist of {{the amounts}} of indium contained within the ores of other metals. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see Production and <b>availability).</b> Thus, the <b>availability</b> of indium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} these ores are extracted, and not their absolute amount. This is an aspect that is often forgotten in the current debate, e.g. by the Graedel group at Yale in their criticality assessments, explaining the paradoxically low depletion times some studies cite.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Congress passed must-carry regulations, which {{required}} cable carriers to allocate spectrum to local broadcasters. This affected the <b>availability</b> of C-SPAN in some areas, in particular C-SPAN2, as some providers chose to discontinue carriage {{of the channel}} altogether. Between 1993 and 1994, cable systems in 95 U.S. cities dropped or reduced broadcasts of C-SPAN and C-SPAN2, following {{the implementation of the}} must-carry regulations. Viewers protested these decisions, especially when the changes coincided with matters of local interest occurring in the House or Senate. Some communities, such as Eugene, Oregon and Alexandria, Virginia, were successful in restoring C-SPAN <b>availability.</b> C-SPAN <b>availability</b> was later restored as technological developments that resulted in the expansion of channel capacity on cable providers allowed for mandatory stations and the C-SPAN networks both to be broadcast.|$|E

5|$|Limiting the <b>availability</b> of {{paracetamol}} tablets {{has been}} attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol {{are restricted to}} packs of 32 x 500mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 x 500mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion. In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively. Subsequent study suggests that the reduced <b>availability</b> in large numbers {{had a significant effect}} in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we {{consider}} a multistate monotone system of multistate components. Following a Bayesian approach, the ambition is {{to arrive at the}} posterior distributions of the system <b>availabilities</b> and unavailabilities to the various levels in a fixed time interval based on both prior information and data on both the components and the system. We argue that a realistic approach is to start out by describing our uncertainty on the component <b>availabilities</b> and unavailabilities to the various levels in a fixed time interval, based on both prior information and data on the components, by the moments up till order m of their marginal distributions. From these moments analytic bounds on the corresponding moments of the system <b>availabilities</b> and unavailabilities to the various levels in a fixed time interval are arrived at. Applying these bounds and prior system information we may then fit prior distributions of the system <b>availabilities</b> and unavailabilities to the various levels in a fixed time interval. These can in turn be updated by relevant data on the system. This generalizes results given in (Natvig and Eide 1987) considering a binary monotone system of binary components at a fixed point of time. Furthermore, considering a simple network system, we show that the analytic bounds can be slightly improved by straightforward simulation techniques...|$|R
