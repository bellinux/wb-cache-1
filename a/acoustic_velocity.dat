40|$|Graduation date: 2011 To {{compete with}} other {{building}} materials, the wood products industry {{must find a way}} to increase value and lower costs. Wood stiffness is important for most wood uses. Value can be increased and costs can be lowered by sorting logs for stiffness in the woods using acoustic devices mounted on harvesters and processors in order to properly allocate logs to their processing destination. This decreases shipping costs because logs do not have to be reshipped if they are delivered directly to their final processing location and increases value recovery because only logs that are fit for the end use are processed. The goal of this study was to determine if four increasingly more difficult-to measure variables - length from the butt, <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity,</b> bark percentage, and wood density - can be used to predict the <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> variation along the length of a tree in Douglas-fir and thus improve the utility of acoustic devices as tools for the optimal bucking of trees into logs which have been sorted according to stiffness. Research was undertaken in five stands. Six trees were selected from each stand. Time of flight (TOF) <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> measured across the bole of the tree had little value in predicting the longitudinal resonance <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> of a section of the tree. Although TOF across the bole was statistically significant it had a very low correlation coefficient and lacked the ability to accurately and precisely predict resonance <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity.</b> Wood density, moisture content, and bark percentage were not significant predictors of resonance <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> of a section of a tree. The use of tree length resonance acoustic velocities was found to be a statistically significant and strongly correlated predictor of <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> of tree section. Distance of a log section from the butt of the tree and distance of a section from the butt squared were statistically significant and strongly correlated predictors of <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> of tree sections. Final models including resonance <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> measurements, distance from the butt, and distance from the butt squared were developed with high coefficients of determination (R² 0. 849 using all tree length acoustic velocities (velocities taken every 3 meters up the tree that measured <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> of the entire tree after the previous 3 meter section), R² 0. 827 using initial tree length <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> of the entire tree), and R² 0. 678 using initial 3 meter log <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity).</b> The models developed were found to be stand dependent, indicating a possible need for model calibration for each stand to be harvested. Lower <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> in the butt of a tree due to high microfibril angle inhibits the predictive capability of models based on <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> measurements taken from the butt of the tree to predict <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> of 3 meter sections after the first 6 meters of the tree. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> models based on a 3 meter log <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> or tree length acoustic measured after the first 6 meters of the tree have been removed are the best predictors of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> of 3 meter sections after the first 6 meters of the tree. Final models based on measurements taken after the first 6 meters of the tree included resonance <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> measurements and distance from the butt had high coefficients of determination (R² 0. 860 using third tree length <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> and R² 0. 887 using third 3 meter section acoustic velocities). These models were also found to be stand dependent. The use of either a single tree length <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> measurement or a single log <b>acoustic</b> <b>velocity</b> measurement with distance from the butt and/or distance from the butt squared has the potential to increase value recovery from a log by predicting the stiffness in that log and effectively matching it to its end use...|$|E

40|$|For many aero-acoustic {{research}} applications {{the direct}} {{measurement of the}} <b>acoustic</b> particle <b>velocity</b> is of high relevance. Often times these applications exhibit a mean flow field superimposed by the acoustics wave propagation. This work demonstrates {{the application of the}} non-intrusive, laser-based Acoustic Particle Image Velocimetry (A-PIV) in duct flows with Mach numbers up to 0. 2. In a first step the particular features of an acoustic field with non-uniform mean flow are discussed briefly. The experiments were conducted in the acoustic grazing flow facility DUCT-R at DLR Berlin. When mean flow is present, the A-PIV results show a strongly profiled distribution of the <b>acoustic</b> particle <b>velocity</b> in duct-height direction (y). Hence, a difficulty occurs in determining a representative value of the <b>acoustic</b> particle <b>velocity</b> for comparison with microphone measurements, since the applied microphone pressure analysis neglects the y-dependency (plug flow assumption). However, averaging of the <b>acoustic</b> particle <b>velocities</b> along the half duct height reveals a very close agreement with the microphone data.

In results, the ability of A-PIV to determine the <b>acoustic</b> particle <b>velocity</b> under mean flow conditions could be proven.
