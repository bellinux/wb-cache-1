5|$|The {{gray wolf}} {{is one of}} the world's best-known and most-researched animals, with {{probably}} more books written about it than any other wildlife species. It {{has a long history of}} association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few, live <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>people,</b> and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds.|$|E

25|$|During The Porfiriato, Diaz modernized {{different}} aspects of Mexico's infrastructure, such as a tenfold in railways, steam-powered locomotives, increase in telegraph lines across the country. These improvements were mainly backed by foreign capital and were done to benefit his close supporters and foreign investors. In the other hand, he showed less concern for the common Mexican people. During 1883-1894, laws were passed to give fewer and fewer people large amounts of land. Land was taken <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>people</b> by bribing local judges to declare them vacant. Díaz's friend obtained 12 million acres of land in Baja California by bribing local judges. Those who opposed were killed or captured and sold as slaves to plantations.|$|E

The young boy was paid by the Tanzim militia to detonate himself at the checkpoint.

500|$|Mosquito nets {{help keep}} {{mosquitoes}} <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>people</b> and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria. Nets {{are not a}} perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time {{to find a way}} past the net. Insecticide-treated nets are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net. Between 2000 and 2008, the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250,000 infants in Sub-Saharan Africa. About 13% of households in Sub-Saharan countries owned ITNs in 2007 and 31% of African households were estimated to own at least one ITN in 2008. In 2000, 1.7 million (1.8%) African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN. That number increased to 20.3 million (18.5%) African children using ITNs in 2007, leaving 89.6 million children unprotected and to 68% African children using mosquito nets in 2015. [...] Most nets are impregnated with pyrethroids, a class of insecticides with low toxicity. They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn. It is recommended to hang a large [...] "bed net" [...] above the center of a bed and either tuck the edges under the mattress or make sure it is large enough such that it touches the ground.|$|E

2500|$|This is well {{demonstrated}} {{in the writings of}} Edward Abbey with particular regard to Desert Solitaire where solitude focused only on isolation from other people allows for a more complete connection to the external world, as in the absence of human interaction the natural world itself takes {{on the role of the}} companion. [...] In this context, the individual seeking solitude does so not strictly for personal gain or introspection, though this is often an unavoidable outcome, but instead in an attempt to gain an understanding of the natural world as entirely removed from the human perspective as possible, a state of mind much more readily attained in the complete absence of outside human presence. In psychology, introverted individuals may require spending time <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>people</b> to recharge. Those who are simply socially apathetic might find it a pleasurable environment in which to occupy oneself with solitary tasks.|$|E

[...] In a November 2008 interview he said that, unless the Church formally excommunicated them, he would not deny Communion to Catholic politicians in his diocese who support legal abortion. Despite criticism from conservative Catholics, including Raymond Arroyo of Eternal Word Television Network, of his participation in the funeral service for Senator Ted Kennedy, a long-standing supporter of legal abortion, O'Malley assisted at the funeral Mass and led a prayer. He called for less contentious political dialog: [...] "We will not change hearts by turning <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>people</b> in their time of need {{and when they are}} experiencing grief and loss." [...] He said he appreciated the Senator's work for social justice, but that [...] "there is a tragic sense of lost opportunity in his lack of support for the unborn".|$|E

It would have been nice, indeed, to be that water, never staying, passing, passing; or wind, touching everything, never caught. To be able to do nothing without hurting someone--that was what was so ghastly. If only one were like a flower, that just sprang up and lived its life all to itself, and died.

6000|$|He {{uttered a}} little sound which had pain in it, {{and she felt}} a real pang of compunction. He had gripped {{the back of a}} chair; his face had lost its heaviness. A dull flush {{coloured}} his cheeks. Noel had a feeling, {{as if she had been}} convicted of treachery. It was his silence, the curious look of an impersonal pain beyond power of words; she felt in him something much deeper than mere disapproval--something which echoed within herself. She walked quickly past him and escaped. She ran upstairs and threw herself on her bed. He was nothing: it was not that! It was in herself, the awful feeling, for the first time developed and poignant, that she had betrayed her caste, forfeited the right to be thought a lady, betrayed her secret reserve and refinement, repaid with black ingratitude the love lavished on her up bringing, by behaving like any uncared-for common girl. She had never felt this before--not even when Gratian first heard of it, and they had stood one at each end of the hearth, unable to speak. Then she still had her passion, and her grief for the dead. That was gone now as if it had never been; and she had no defence, nothing between her and this crushing humiliation and chagrin. She had been mad! She must have been mad! The Belgian Barra was right: [...] "All a little mad" [...] in this [...] "forcing-house" [...] of a war! She buried her face deep in the pillow, till it almost stopped her power of breathing; her head and cheeks and ears seemed to be on fire. If only he had shown disgust, done something which roused her temper, her sense of justice, her feeling that Fate had been too cruel to her; but he had just stood there, bewilderment incarnate, like a creature with some very deep illusion shattered. It was horrible! Then, feeling that she could not stay still, must walk, run, get away somehow from this feeling of treachery and betrayal, she sprang up. All was quiet below, and she slipped downstairs and out, speeding along with no knowledge of direction, taking the way she had taken day after day to her hospital. It was the last of April, trees and shrubs were luscious with blossom and leaf; the dogs ran gaily; people had almost happy faces in the sunshine. 'If I could get away from myself, I wouldn't care,' she thought. Easy to get <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>people,</b> from London, even from England perhaps; but from oneself--impossible! She passed her hospital; and looked at it dully, at the Red Cross flag against its stucco wall, and a soldier in his blue slops and red tie, coming out. She had spent many miserable hours there, but none quite so miserable as this. She passed the church opposite to the flats where Leila lived, and running suddenly into a tall man coming round the corner, saw Fort. She bent her head, and tried to hurry past. But his hand was held out, she could not help putting hers into it; and looking up hardily, she said: ...|$|E
