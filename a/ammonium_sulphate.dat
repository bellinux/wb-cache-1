25|$|During C. P.'s {{tenure as}} Diwan, Travancore made rapid strides in {{industrial}} development. The Indian Aluminium Company {{was invited to}} set up a factory in the town of Aluva. The first fertiliser plant in India, the Fertilizers and Chemicals of Travancore Ltd. (FACT) was established by C. P. to manufacture <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate.</b> This was established with American collaboration in open defiance to the hostility of the Viceroy of India. C.P. also established a plant to manufacture cement and another to manufacture titanium dioxide.The Travancore plywood factory at Punalur The Travancore Rayons Limited was established in 1946 with a plant at Perumbavoor. The first plant to manufacture aluminium cables was opened at Kundara. By the time, C.

2500|$|Following the {{invention}} of coal gas early in the 19th century, {{it was discovered that}} numerous organic and inorganic chemicals could be obtained when purifying the gas. Processes began to be developed to recover these, and a major branch of the British chemical industry – the coal tar and ammonia by-products industry – came into existence. By 1876 a nearby company, Burt, Boulton and Haywood of Silvertown, was distilling each year [...] of coal tar to manufacture ingredients for disinfectants, insecticides and dyes. Sulphur from the gas works was the raw material for local manufacturers of sulphuric acid needed by other nearby companies producing products such as fertilizers. Subsequently the GLCC decided that it would carry out the processing of by-products itself, rather than sell them to independent chemical companies. A purpose-built chemical works, Beckton Products Works, was constructed in 1879. It was the largest tar and ammonia by-products works in the UK, possibly in the world. Besides millions of gallons of road tar, products included phenol, the cresols and xylenols, naphthalene, pyridine bases, creosote, benzene, toluene, xylene, solvent naphtha, <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and ammonia solution, sulphuric acid, picolines, quinoline, quinaldine, acenaphthene, anthracene and dicyclopentadiene. Since the Products works was dependent on by-products of gas manufacture it could not long survive the introduction of natural gas. The last train carrying chemical products, a load of pitch, left the works on 1 June 1970.|$|E

40|$|The {{charge and}} {{chemical}} composition of ambient particles {{in an urban}} environment were determined using a Neutral Particle and Air Ion Spectrometer and an Aerodyne compact Time-Of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer. Particle formation and growth events were observed on 20 of the 36 days of sampling, with eight of these events classified as strong. During these events, peaks in the concentration of intermediate and large ions were followed by peaks in the concentration of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>sulphate,</b> which were not observed in the organic fraction. Comparison of days with and without particle formation events revealed that <b>ammonium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> were the dominant species on particle formation days while high concentrations of biomass burning OA inhibited particle growth. Analyses {{of the degree of}} particle neutralisation lead us to conclude that an excess of ammonium enabled particle formation and growth. In addition, the large ion concentration increased sharply during particle growth, suggesting that during nucleation the neutral gaseous species ammonia and sulphuric acid react to form <b>ammonium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> ions.

40|$|A {{high-volume}} cascade {{impact collector}} (1100 l/min air flow) {{was used to}} collect air samples in an industrial (Port Talbot) and an urban (Cardiff) site {{with the purpose of}} characterising both coarse (PM 10 – 2. 5) and fine (PM 2. 5) fractions comprising the total sample. PM 10 – 2. 5 and PM 2. 5 samples were collected by cascading air through two polyurethane foams on which particles impact and become deposited. Air sample collection rates are to some extent dependent on weather conditions, notably rainfall, humidity, and especially, wind direction, but samples show a very different and distinctive air particle composition between the two collection sites. Thus, although both Cardiff and Port Talbot are coastal sites and therefore have high contents in chlorides, Port Talbot is extremely rich in tiny Fe spherules (> 30 %, in both coarse and fine fractions) from a nearby steel plant. Mineralogical characterisation using SEM-EDX shows a clear fractionation between the particle composition in the PM fractions, with the coarse fraction being dominated by chlorides, sulphates (gypsum), and silicates, and the fine fraction having high proportions of <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphates</b> and elemental and organic carbon compounds, most of the latter being linked to traffic pollution...|$|R
