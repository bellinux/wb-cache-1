25|$|But {{the other}} day I was kind of tired, and my dad {{suddenly}} sprung on me {{the fact that my}} submarine had been causing a tremendous amount of difficulty in the mouth of the Columbia River. Hadn't thought <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> for years. Of course, it's all shot to ribbons, this thing. It's got jagged steel sticking out at all ends and angles, and it's a big submarine! It's a— I don't know, {{about the size of the}} first Narwhal that we built. And the fishermen coming in there and fishing are dragging their nets around in that area, and it's just tearing their nets to ribbons— they've even hired a civilian contractor to try to blow the thing up and get it the devil out of there— and has evidently been raising bob with postwar fishing here for more years than I'd care to count.|$|E
500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel J. Goor and {{directed}} by Dean Holland. The episode marked {{the culmination of a}} seven-episode story arc that began with the third season premiere, [...] "Go Big or Go Home", in which Leslie and the parks department prepare to relaunch the harvest festival, which had previously been a Pawnee tradition before it ended. The storyline stemmed from serious budget problems facing Pawnee which forced a government shutdown and threatened major cuts to the parks department, prompting Leslie to bring the harvest festival back and stake the future of the entire department on its success or failure. Amy Poehler said she believed the storyline was appropriate for a series about small government and was well handled by the writers: [...] "What I like about the show is it doesn't spend 25 episodes talking <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> it talks about it in the right amount of time. It happens and then there's consequences of it. The show keeps moving forward, which is always really fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest, {{the leak}} that Tony Harnischfeger had spotted was cited as {{evidence}} that the dam was leaking {{on the day of the}} break, and that both the Bureau of Water Works and Supply and Mulholland were aware of it. Mulholland told the jury he had been at the dam the day of the break, due to the dam keeper's call, but neither he nor Van Norman had observed anything of concern, nor found any dangerous conditions. Mulholland further testified that leaks in dams, especially of the type and size of the St. Francis, were common. During the Inquest Mulholland said, [...] "This inquest is a very painful thing for me to have to attend but it is the occasion of it that is painful. The only ones I envy <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> are the ones who are dead." [...] In subsequent testimony, after answering a question he added, [...] "Whether it is good or bad, don't blame anyone else, you just fasten it on me. If there was an error in human judgment, I was the human, I won't try to fasten it on anyone else." ...|$|E
