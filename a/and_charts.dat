5|$|After a final {{check of}} the weather reports for Germany and the North Sea, Hess took off at 17:45 on 10 May 1941 from the {{airfield}} at Augsburg-Haunstetten in his specially prepared aircraft. It was the last of several attempts to depart on his mission; previous efforts had to be called off due to mechanical problems or poor weather. Wearing a leather flying suit bearing the rank of captain, he brought along a supply of money and toiletries, a torch, a camera, maps <b>and</b> <b>charts,</b> and a collection of 28 different medicines, as well as dextrose tablets to help ward off fatigue and an assortment of homeopathic remedies.|$|E
5|$|To handle {{other forms}} of intelligence, Blamey and MacArthur created the Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB). This {{included}} the Services Reconnaissance Department with its Z Special Unit that carried out special operations like Operation Jaywick; Secret Intelligence Australia; the Coastwatchers, who watched for Japanese aircraft and ships from observation posts behind Japanese lines; and the propaganda specialists of the Far Eastern Liaison Office (FELO). Two other important combined organisations, not part of AIB, were the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section (ATIS), which translated Japanese documents, and the Allied Geographical Section, which prepared maps <b>and</b> <b>charts,</b> and drafted appreciations of the terrain.|$|E

25|$|Most {{autoclaves}} have meters <b>and</b> <b>charts</b> {{that record}} or display information, particularly temperature and pressure {{as a function}} of time. The information is checked to ensure that the conditions required for sterilization have been met. Indicator tape is often placed on packages of products prior to autoclaving, and some packaging incorporates indicators. The indicator changes color when exposed to steam, providing a visual confirmation.|$|E
25|$|The US counter-strategy was {{ineffective}} {{in a number}} of ways against Communist forces. This ineffectiveness was predicted by Hanoi's analyses of weaknesses and contradictions in their enemy's camp (Vo Nguyen Giap, Big Victory, Great Task) An initial policy of gradualism against North Vietnam for example, saw the American President and his Secretary of Defence huddled over maps <b>and</b> <b>charts,</b> planning piecemeal airstrikes on limited targets. These inflicted some localized damage, but had little significant effect on the overall VC/NVA buildup in the south.|$|E
40|$|Control charts are {{effective}} tools for signal detection in both manufacturing processes and service processes. Much {{of the data}} in service industries comes from processes having nonnormal or unknown distributions. The commonly used Shewhart variable control charts, which depend heavily on the normality assumption, are not appropriately used here. In this paper, we propose a new asymmetric EWMA variance <b>chart</b> (EWMA-AV <b>chart)</b> <b>and</b> an asymmetric EWMA mean chart (EWMA-AM chart) based on two simple statistics to monitor process variance and mean shifts simultaneously. Further, we explore the sampling properties of the new monitoring statistics and calculate the average run lengths when using both the EWMA-AV <b>chart</b> <b>and</b> the EWMA-AM <b>chart.</b> The performance of the EWMA-AV <b>and</b> EWMA-AM <b>charts</b> <b>and</b> that of some existing variance <b>and</b> mean <b>charts</b> are compared. A numerical example involving nonnormal service times from the service system of a bank branch in Taiwan is used to illustrate the applications of the EWMA-AV <b>and</b> EWMA-AM <b>charts</b> <b>and</b> to compare them with the existing variance (or standard deviation) <b>and</b> mean <b>charts.</b> The proposed EWMA-AV <b>chart</b> <b>and</b> EWMA-AM <b>charts</b> show superior detection performance compared to the existing variance <b>and</b> mean <b>charts.</b> The EWMA-AV <b>chart</b> <b>and</b> EWMA-AM <b>chart</b> are thus recommended...|$|R

25|$|In 1611–12, the Admiralty of Amsterdam {{sent two}} covert expeditions {{to find a}} passage to China with the yachts Craen and Vos, captained by Jan Cornelisz Mey and Symon Willemsz Cat, respectively. In four voyages made between 1611 and 1614, the area between present-day Maryland and Massachusetts was explored, surveyed, and charted by Adriaen Block, Hendrick Christiaensen, and Cornelius Jacobsen Mey. The results of these explorations, surveys, <b>and</b> <b>charts</b> made from 1609 through 1614 were {{consolidated}} in Block's map, which used the name New Netherland for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Rep. Paul Ryan (R) has {{proposed}} the Roadmap for America's Future, {{which is a}} series of budgetary reforms. His January 2010 version of the plan includes the transition of Medicare to a voucher system, meaning individuals would receive a voucher which could be used to purchase health insurance in the private market. This would not affect those near retirement or currently enrolled. A series of graphs <b>and</b> <b>charts</b> summarizing the impact of the plan are included. Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan. The CBO also partially scored the bill.|$|E
25|$|Vancouver's {{expedition}} {{occurred within}} a year of Eliza's, and Vancouver encountered other Spanish ships and traded information. Thus Vancouver knew of the names given by Eliza's expedition and tended to keep them, although he renamed some features, like the Strait of Georgia. Wilkes, sailing in 1841, had some British charts, but may not have been aware of the Spanish names <b>and</b> <b>charts.</b> He liberally gave new names to nearly every coastal feature not already named on the charts he had. The names that Wilkes gave tended to be patriotically American (heroes of the War of 1812 for example), or to honor members of his crew.|$|E
