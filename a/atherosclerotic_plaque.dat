25|$|<b>Atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaque</b> {{contains}} vascular {{smooth muscle}} cells, macrophages and endothelial cells and {{these have been}} found to accumulate 8-oxoG, a common type of oxidative DNA damage. DNA strand breaks also increased in atherosclerotic plaques, thus linking DNA damage to plaque formation.|$|E
25|$|By radiographic, i.e. X-Ray, methods, after arteries have {{developed}} advanced calcified <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaque,</b> IMT {{can also be}} semi-estimated by {{the distance between the}} outer edges of calcification (actually this leaves out most of the media) and the outer edges of an angiographic dye column within the artery lumen. This is a far more complex technique; it is invasive to the body due to the use of X-Ray radiation, catheters and angiographic contrast agents.|$|E
30|$|Macrophages, {{which are}} the main {{component}} of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques,</b> are the first inflammatory cells to enter atherosclerotic lesions [2]. Studies of atherosclerosis reported that macrophages are involved at multiple stages of plaque formation [3]. Both classically (known as M 1) and alternatively (M 2) differentiated macrophages have been identified in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques.</b> The phenotypic spectrum of macrophages in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> is, however, complex [3]. The in vivo detection of macrophage polarization in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> with imaging may pave the way for better understanding of the exact roles of M 1 and M 2 macrophages in different stages of the disease which is critical for the prognosis, diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis.|$|R
40|$|The {{major cause}} for <b>plaque</b> {{instability}} in <b>atherosclerotic</b> disease is neoangiogenic revascularization, but the factors controlling this process remain only partly understood. Hedgehog (HH) is a morphogen with important functions in revascularization, but its function in human healthy vessel biology {{as well as}} in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> has not been well investigated. Hence, we determined the status of HH pathway activity both in healthy vessels and <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques.</b> A series of 10 healthy organ donor-derived human vessels, 17 coronary <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> and 24 <b>atherosclerotic</b> carotid <b>plaques</b> were investigated for HH pathway activity. We show that a healthy vessel is characterized by a high level of HH pathway activity but that <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> are devoid of HH signaling despite the presence of HH ligand in these pathological structures. Thus, a dichotomy between healthy vessels and <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> with respect to the activation status of the HH pathway exists, and it is tempting to suggest that downregulation of HH signaling contributes to long-term plaque stability.

30|$|In this study, we {{demonstrated}} that the expression of MR in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> can be detected in vivo with SPECT imaging after i.v. injection of 111 In-tilmanocept. Despite the small dimension of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques,</b> lesions in the low abdominal aorta were successfully visualized with a dedicated animal SPECT/CT, 90 Â min p.i. The high and specific uptake of the tracer in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> was also confirmed ex vivo by autoradiography and associated {{with the presence of}} high number of MR+ macrophages in the lesions.|$|R
25|$|Arterial ultrasound, {{especially}} of the carotid arteries, with measurement of {{the thickness of the}} artery wall, offers a way to partially track the disease progression. As of 2006, the thickness, commonly referred to as IMT for intimal-medial thickness, is not measured clinically though it has been used by some researchers since the mid-1990s to track changes in arterial walls. Traditionally, clinical carotid ultrasounds have only estimated the degree of blood lumen restriction, stenosis, a result of very advanced disease. The National Institute of Health did a five-year $5 million study, headed by medical researcher Kenneth Ouriel, to study intravascular ultrasound techniques regarding <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaque.</b> More progressive clinicians have begun using IMT measurement as a way to quantify and track disease progression or stability within individual patients.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol {{embolism}} (often cholesterol crystal embolism or atheroembolism, sometimes blue toe or purple toe syndrome or trash foot or warfarin blue toe syndrome) {{occurs when}} cholesterol is released, usually from an <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaque,</b> and travels as an embolus {{in the bloodstream}} to lodge (as an embolism) causing an obstruction in blood vessels further away. Most commonly this causes skin symptoms (usually livedo reticularis), gangrene of the extremities and sometimes renal failure; problems with other organs may arise, depending on the site at which the cholesterol crystals enter the bloodstream. When the kidneys are involved, the disease {{is referred to as}} atheroembolic renal disease (AERD). The diagnosis usually involves biopsy (removing a tissue sample) from an affected organ. Cholesterol embolism is treated by removing the cause and giving supportive therapy; statin drugs have been found to improve the prognosis.|$|E
500|$|Most MIs occur due to {{coronary}} artery disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake, among others. [...] The complete blockage of a {{coronary artery}} {{caused by a}} rupture of an <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaque</b> is usually the underlying mechanism of an MI. MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms, which {{may be due to}} cocaine, significant emotional stress, and extreme cold, among others. [...] A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood tests, and coronary angiography. An ECG, which is a recording of the heart's electrical activity, may confirm an ST elevation MI (STEMI) if ST elevation is present. Commonly used blood tests include troponin and less often creatine kinase MB.|$|E
30|$|After i.v. injection, 111 In-tilmanocept {{accumulated}} in MR-expressing organs and {{was associated with}} only low residual blood signal. In addition, 111 In-tilmanocept uptake was detected in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> of mice containing MR-expressing macrophages suggesting that tilmanocept represents a promising tracer for the non-invasive detection of macrophages in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques.</b>|$|R
30|$|Macrophages play {{a crucial}} role in the {{progression}} and development of atherosclerosis from early fatty-streak lesions to advanced <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> [11]. Ruptured plaques, in particular, commonly contain high quantities of macrophages [3]. Therefore, the contents of macrophages may be an excellent imaging biomarker for the vulnerability of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques.</b> The present results revealed that the 68 Ga-radioactivity uptake in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques,</b> especially in their macrophage-rich areas, was higher when compared to healthy vessel wall. This observation strengthens our conception that 68 Ga-radioactivity accumulates at the site of inflammation.|$|R
3000|$|ApoB 100 / 100 mice had {{developed}} areas covered with <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> in aortic arch, aortic arteries, {{and also in}} the distal part of aorta. Histologically, the plaques were of fibroatheroma type and some of them contained calcifications. In the aortas of the control mice, no <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> were detected.|$|R
2500|$|Werner {{syndrome}} (WS), {{a premature}} aging condition in humans, {{is caused by}} a genetic defect in a RecQ helicase that is employed in several DNA repair processes. [...] WS patients develop a substantial burden of atherosclerotic plaques in their coronary arteries and aorta. [...] These findings link excessive unrepaired DNA damage to premature aging and early <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaque</b> development.|$|E
2500|$|When {{this process}} becomes unregulated, LDL {{molecules}} without receptors begin {{to appear in}} the blood. These LDL molecules are oxidized and taken up by macrophages, which become engorged and form foam cells. These foam cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaque</b> formation. Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness). These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems, leading to the association of so-called LDL cholesterol (actually a lipoprotein) with [...] "bad" [...] cholesterol.|$|E
2500|$|... 8-oxoG, {{a common}} type of {{oxidative}} damage in DNA, is found to accumulate in plaque vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages and endothelial cells, thus linking DNA damage to plaque formation. DNA strand breaks also increased in atherosclerotic plaques. [...] Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging condition in humans. [...] WS {{is caused by a}} genetic defect in a RecQ helicase that is employed in several repair processes that remove damages from DNA. [...] WS patients develop a considerable burden of atherosclerotic plaques in their coronary arteries and aorta: calcification of the aortic valve is also frequently observed.

30|$|To some extent, gallium {{may also}} be taken up by <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> due to its binding to the {{circulating}} transferrin and avidly to the transferrin receptors {{at the site of}} atherosclerotic arteries. Transferrin receptor expression has been shown to correlate positively with macrophage infiltration in human carotid atherosclerotic lesions [20]. Moreover, symptomatic patients with carotid atherosclerosis have significantly higher expression of transferrin receptors than asymptomatic patients [21]. However, although the uptake of 68 Ga in inflamed <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> was promising as measured by autoradiography, the slow blood clearance limits the use of ionic 68 Ga for in vivo imaging of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> can be {{classified}} into two types: stable and unstable <b>plaques.</b> Stable <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> are characterized by a thicker layer of fibrous cap, which protects the plaque from rupture. Unstable <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> are characterized by a lipid core covered by a relatively thin fibrous cap containing less extracellular matrix and vascular smooth muscle cells, often with inflammatory cells and secretion of proteinases. This may lead to rupture or fissure of {{the surface of the}} plaque, thus exposing the lipid core to the bloodstream causing thrombosis (local clotting of the blood) and many cardiovascular diseases [7].|$|R
40|$|Aims Rupture-prone <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> show an {{elevated}} temperature, but a molecular {{explanation for this}} phenomenon is unknown. Here,we investigatedwhethermitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP 2) could be involved because this protein is a macrophage homologue of thermogenin in brown fat tissue. Methods and results Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactionwere used to detect UCP 2 expression in human and rabbit <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques.</b> Tempera-ture was measured in plaques with thermography catheters and in cultured cells with precision ther-mometers. UCP 2 was abundantly expressed in subendothelial macrophages of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> but not in deeper layers of the plaque. Ex vivo temperature measurements in atherosclerotic rabbit thor-acic aorta demonstrated a correlation between local plaque temperature, total macrophage mass, and UCP 2 expression. In vitro, chemical uncoupling of macrophages with sodium cyanide resulted in heat pro-duction (DT 0. 13 + 0. 048 C vs. controls). Also, overexpression of UCP 2 in cultured cells led to a similar increase in temperature. Conclusion Our findings provide evidence that temperature heterogeneity in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> is {{at least in part}} attributed to UCP 2 expression in macrophages. The heat generated might be used to detect unstable, macrophage-rich, <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> via thermography...|$|R
2500|$|Veins do {{not develop}} atheromata, {{because they are}} not {{subjected}} to the same hemodynamic pressure that arteries are, unless surgically moved to function as an artery, as in bypass surgery. The accumulation (swelling) is always in the tunica intima, between the endothelium lining and the smooth muscle middle layer of the artery wall. While the early stages, based on gross appearance, have traditionally been termed fatty streaks by pathologists, they are not composed of fat cells but of accumulations of white blood cells, especially macrophages, that have taken up oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL). [...] After they accumulate large amounts of cytoplasmic membranes (with associated high cholesterol content) they are called foam cells. [...] When foam cells die, their contents are released, which attracts more macrophages and creates an extracellular lipid core near the center to inner surface of each <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaque.</b> Conversely, the outer, older portions of the plaque become more calcified, less metabolically active and more physically stiff over time.|$|E

40|$|Detection of {{vulnerable}} plaques as {{the underlying}} cause of myocardial infarction {{is at the center}} of attention in cardiology. We have previously shown that infiltration of inflammatory cells in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> renders these plaques relatively hot and acidic, with substantial plaque temperature and pH variation. The objective of this investigation was to determine whether near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) could be used to non-destructively measure the tissue pH in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques.</b> NIRS and tissue pH electrode measurements were taken on freshly excised carotid plaques maintained under physiological conditions. The coefficient of determination between NIRS and the pH microelectrode measurement was 0. 75 using 17 different areas. The estimated accuracy of the NIRS measurement was 0. 09 pH units. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using NIRS tissue pH in freshly excised <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> in light of marked pH heterogeneity and warrants future in-vivo investigations on pH measurement of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{levels of}} the active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, are {{inversely}} correlated with coronary calcification. Moreover, the active vitamin D analog, alfacalcidol, seems to protect patients from developing vascular calcification. Serum vitamin D {{has been found to}} correlate with calcified <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaque</b> in African Americans as they have higher active serum vitamin D levels compared to Euro-Americans. Higher levels of calcidiol positively correlate with aorta and carotid calcified <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaque</b> in African Americans but not with coronary plaque, whereas individuals of European descent have an opposite, negative association. There are racial differences in the association of coronary calcified plaque in that there is less calcified <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaque</b> in the coronary arteries of African-Americans than in whites.|$|E
40|$|The rupture of {{vulnerable}} <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> {{that lead}} to stroke and myocardial infarction may be induced by macrophage infiltration and augmented by the expression of integrin Î±vÎ² 3.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundOral {{bacteria}} {{have been}} detected in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> at a variable frequency; however, the connection between oral health and vascular and oral bacterial profiles of patients with vascular disease is not clearly established. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the presence of oral bacterial DNA in the mouth and <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques,</b> in addition to assessing the patientsâ caries and periodontal disease history. MethodsThirty samples of supragingival and subgingival <b>plaque,</b> saliva and <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> of 13 patients with carotid stenosis or aortic aneurysm were evaluated, through real-time polymerase chain reaction, for the presence of Streptococcus mutans (SM), Prevotella intermedia (PI), Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG) and Treponema denticola (TD). All patients were submitted to oral examination using the DMFT (decayed, missing and filled teeth) and PSR (Periodontal Screening and Recording) indexes. Histopathological analysis of the <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> was performed. ResultsMost of the patients were edentulous (76. 9 %). SM, PI, PG and TD were detected in 100. 0 %, 92. 0 %, 15. 3 % and 30. 7 % of the oral samples, respectively. SM was the most prevalent targeted bacteria in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques,</b> detected in 100 % of the samples, followed by PI (7. 1 %). The vascular samples were negative for PG and TD. There was a statistically significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the presence of PG and TD in the oral cavity and vascular samples. ConclusionSM was found at a high frequency in oral and vascular samples, even in edentulous patients, and its presence in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> suggests the possible involvement of this bacterium in the disease progression...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which hydroxymethylglutaryl CoenzymeA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain poorly understood. Statins {{have been shown to}} modulate the levels of different inflammatory proteins both in carotid <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> and in the blood of patients with atherosclerosis. In this work, we hypothesize that statins could also modulate the levels of the proteins secreted by cultured <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques.</b> Thus, the secretomes obtained from complicated <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> incubated in the presence/absence of atorvastatin (10 micromol/l, 24 h) were analysed and compared by two-dimensional electrophoresis, considering the fibrous adjacent areas as controls. In total, 54 proteins (83 protein isoforms) were identified by Mass Spectrometry (MS) : 24 proteins were increased and 20 proteins decreased in atheroma plaque supernatants compared to controls. Some of these proteins, like Cathepsin D, could {{play a significant role in}} plaque instability, becoming a potential target for therapeutical treatment. Interestingly, 66 % of the proteins differentially released by <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques</b> reverted to control values after administration of atorvastatin, among them, Cathepsin D. Moreover, plaques obtained from patients who received atorvastatin treatment prior to carotid endarterectomy showed decreased Cathepsin D expression relative to plaques from non-treated patients. In conclusion, this proteomic approach has shown that statins are able to modulate the secretome of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>plaques,</b> and new therapeutical targets for statins have been characterised...|$|R
