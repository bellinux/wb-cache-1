An alloying atom is by nature a point defect, thus it must create a stress field when placed into a foreign crystallographic position, which could block {{the passage of}} a dislocation.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, nanocrystalline metals have been of {{increasing}} interest. Their ability to show increased yield strength and uniform structure show them to be potentially useful in many applications. Additionally, nanocrystalline metals have become more easily manufactured in recent years, allowing for more testing and more use within industrial settings. However, nanocrystalline metals are still highly unstable, mainly due to temperature related growth. Grain boundary segregation is {{one way in which}} materials can keep nano length-scale grains. This process involves metal alloys that preferentially segregate the <b>alloying</b> <b>material</b> to the grain boundaries, potentially leading to Grain Boundary Embrittlement (GBE). Using an ideal work of fracture equation, [gamma] = 2 [sigma]s - [sigma]g, the energy required to fracture nanocrystalline metal alloys was obtained, and predicted grain stability. Fracture toughness data is also calculated and compared. A contrast between bulk and nanocrystalline alloys is then made, showing benefits to the use of either set of materials for specific alloy functions. by Oscar Figueroa, III. Thesis (S. B.)

Design/methodology/approach: The effect was determined of the main alloying parameters on hardness, abrasive wear resistance and roughness. The hot work tool steels conventionally heat treated were used as reference material and the tantalum carbide {{was used as an}} <b>alloying</b> <b>material.</b> The remelted layers which were formed in the surface of investigated hot work tool steels were metallographically examined and analyzed using a hardness testing machine. Findings: It was found out in examinations of the surface layer that it can be possible to obtain high quality top layer with higher hardness and abrasive wear resistance compared to material after conventional heat treatment. Research limitations/implications: The surface layer and its properties are elements which are critical for lifetime of tools and parts of machines and also for lifetime of whole technical equipment. If the working surface of a tool or its part is exposed to rough friction, an intensive mass and volume loss occurs. In this case it is reasonable to produce a surface layer which is extremely wear resistant to avoid the mass and volume loss.

40|$|Forging dies {{are exposed}} to thermal, mechanical, {{tribological}} and chemical stress during use. This results in high abrasive and adhesive die wear which limits the die lifetime. The lifetime can be prolonged by means of appropriate surface treatments. Laser beam surface treatment techniques offer several advantages compared to conventional procedures: they allow an efficient, local modification of the surface layer which can be adjusted to the actual wear types. Within the research activities selected forging dies were laser alloyed/dispersed {{in order to reduce}} the abrasive wear. The dies were subsequently plasma nitrided to decrease the adhesive wear. The optimal combination of such surface treatments was determined via an iterative evaluation of <b>alloying</b> <b>material,</b> process development and die application under industrial conditions in forging companies. The findings up to now show that the die lifetime can be increased from 50 % to 300 %. Some areas of improvement still remain before this technique can be used at industrial level: the process know-how is insufficient as regards laser alloying/dispersing of specific die areas such as radii and edges; difference of results between nitriding processes (plasma, salt bath and gas nitriding) are not well-known in combination with laser pre-treated die surfaces at the moment; a classification of forging dies is required depending on die geometry, strain, material flow path, formed material, etc. The technology of laser alloying/dispersing needs to be made reliable, reproducible and accessible to the forging industry at reasonable costs.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} of the present work was to study the modification of the microstructure of hot-work tool steel X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 during the surface modifying by means of laser technology. Design/methodology/approach: The initial experiments consisting in alloying the {{hot work tool steel}} indicate to the clear influence of the laser power on the run face shape and its depth. Findings: The structure of material solidifying after laser remelting is characteristic of the diversified morphology connected with the repeated changes of the crystals’ growth direction, from the small dendrites, whose principal axes are oriented in accordance with the heat removal directions at the boundary between the solid and liquid phases, clusters of carbides arranged in accordance with the swirls caused by the metallic liquid convection motion, and partially non-remelted WC conglomerates as the <b>alloying</b> <b>material</b> in the central area of the remelted zone, to the fine equiaxial grains in the subsurface zone. Research limitations/implications: Laser remelting and alloying with the tungsten carbide results in refinement of the structure in the entire laser power range and in diversification of the grain size in the particular surface layer zones. Practical implications: Laser alloying has the important cognitive significance and gives grounds to the practical employment of these technologies for forming the surfaces of new tools and regeneration of the used ones. Originality/value: The fine grained, dendritic structure occurs in the remelted and alloyed zone with the crystallization direction connected with the dynamical heat abstraction from the laser beam influence zone.

The surface was then consolidated by scanning with a 2 -kW CW Nd:YAG laser beam. The micro structures of the alloyed layers were studied by scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy and X-ray diffractometry. The corrosion and cavitation-erosion characteristics in 3. 5 % NaCl solution at 23 °C were studied by potentiodynamic polarization technique and by means of a 20 kHz ultrasonic vibratory facility. The laser-alloyed specimens were found to be composed of ferrite and the intermetallic phases Fe 3 Al, FeAl and Fe 2 Al 5. The maximum hardness was significantly increased to 595 Hv. The corrosion behaviour was influenced by the degree of dilution of the alloying element. Although aluminizing led to an active shift in the corrosion potential from - 510 mV to - 890 mV, the specimens showed passivity with pitting and protection potentials of - 550 mV and - 710 mV respectively while the substrate did not. The corrosion resistance of the laser-alloyed specimens was significantly improved as evidenced by a much lower corrosion current density. In addition, the cavitation-erosion resistance of the laser-alloyed specimens was also significantly improved by 17. 7 times that of the substrate due to the increase in both hardness and corrosion resistance of the laser-alloyed layer.

40|$|Of the {{terrestrial}} planets, Earth and probably Mercury possess substantial intrinsic magnetic fields generated by core dynamos, while Venus and Mars apparently lack such fields. Thermal histories are calculated for these planets and {{are found to}} admit several possible present states, including those which suggest simple explanations for the observations; while the cores of Earth and Mercury are continuing to freeze, the cores of Venus and Mars may still be completely liquid. The models assume whole mantle convection, which is parameterized by a simple Nusselt-Rayleigh number relation and dictates {{the rate at which}} heat escapes from the core. It is found that completely fluid cores, devoid of intrinsic heat sources, are not likely to sustain thermal convection for the age of the solar system but cool to a subadiabatic, conductive state that can not maintain a dynamo. Planets which nucleate an inner core continue to sustain a dynamo because of the gravitational energy release and chemically driven convection that accompany inner core growth. The absence of a significant inner core can arise in Venus because of its slightly higher temperature and lower central pressure relative to Earth, while a Martian core avoids the onset of freezing if the abundance of sulfur in the core is ⪆ 15 % by mass. All of the models presented assume that (I) core dynamos are driven by thermal and/or chemical convection; (ii) radiogenic heat production is confined to the mantle; (iii) mantle and core cool from initially hot states which are at the solidus and superliquidus, respectively; and (iv) any inner core excludes the light <b>alloying</b> <b>material</b> (sulfur or oxygen) which then mixes uniformly upward through the outer core. The models include realistic pressure and composition-dependent freezing curves for the core, and material parameters are chosen so that the correct present-day values of heat outflow, upper mantle temperature and viscosity, and inner core radius are obtained for the earth. It is found that Venus and Mars may have once had dynamos maintained by thermal convection alone. Earth may have had a completely fluid core and a dynamo maintained by thermal convection for the first 2 to 3 by, but an inner core nucleates and the dynamo energetics are subsequently dominated by gravitational energy release. Complete freezing of the Mercurian core is prohibited if it contains even a small amount of sulfur, and a dynamo can be maintained by chemical convection in a thin, fluid shell...|$|E
