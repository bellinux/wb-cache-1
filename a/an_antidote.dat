5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its use as <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> is not routinely recommended {{because of the}} high risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E

5|$|Seymour {{maintained}} {{a reputation as}} a courageous and innovative officer: he was awarded a commemorative medal for his actions at the battle of the Glorious First of June and is credited with introducing epaulettes to Royal Navy uniforms as a method of indicating rank to non-English speaking allies. In his youth he formed close personal friendships with fellow officer John Willett Payne and George, Prince of Wales, through association with whom he gained {{a reputation as a}} rake. His marriage in 1785, made at the insistence of his family as <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> to his dissolution, was brought about through royal connections and proved very successful. During his lifetime he also held several seats as a member of parliament in the Parliament of Great Britain, although he did not pursue an active political career.|$|E

5|$|They reunite {{with the}} other {{characters}} and exit the school along {{with the other}} students and faculty brought there by Mister One; however Ryouta, now thoroughly infected by the Charon virus, elects to stay behind in cryonic storage until a cure is found. The scenario ends with Sakuya vowing to come back for Ryouta, and Ryouta offering to recap the day's events to the protagonist's spirit as the door to the storage facility closes. If the extended epilogue is unlocked, it is revealed that Yuuya survived being poisoned long enough to receive <b>an</b> <b>antidote,</b> and the game's closing lines imply that with Shuu's cooperation, a cure for the Charon virus has been developed.|$|E
5|$|With General Beckman's (Bonita Friedericy) aid, Chuck {{intercepts}} {{the transport}} carrying Alexei, {{only to find}} that Decker has deprogrammed Alexei and restored his previous identity and memories of Hartley Winterbottom. Hartley administers <b>an</b> <b>antidote,</b> but it fails to cure Sarah. Mary then remembers that Alexei had developed a stronger antidote, but it is stored at the Volkoff Industries Headquarters in Moscow, Russia. As they leave the hospital, Chuck, Casey, Mary, and Hartley are captured by Decker and taken to Castle, a government base under the big-box store Buy More, where Decker suppresses the Intersect in Chuck's mind. Casey helps Chuck and Hartley escape, giving Chuck discs containing clean fabricated identities for him and Sarah.|$|E
5|$|At the Penitentiary, Quinn {{releases}} Poison Ivy {{from her}} cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production {{facility in the}} Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> and learns that {{it can only be}} made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.|$|E

After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent after finding the clue {{revealing}} Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box housing <b>an</b> <b>antidote,</b> but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he can't read his own number, and he cuts the skin from his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a hacksaw, killing him.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable, cabbage has been used historically as a medicinal herb {{for a variety of}} purported health benefits. For example, the Ancient Greeks recommended consuming the vegetable as a laxative, and used cabbage juice as <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> for mushroom poisoning, for eye salves, and for liniments used to help bruises heal. In De Agri Cultura (On Agriculture), Cato the Elder suggested that women could prevent diseases by bathing in urine obtained from those who had frequently eaten cabbage. The ancient Roman nobleman Pliny the Elder described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable, recommending it for drunkenness—both preventatively to counter the effects of alcohol and to cure hangovers. Similarly, the Ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning of meals to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine. This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{resolves}} {{to enter}} the Rip. After Enterprise enters the Gorn's galaxy, Kirk and Spock take a shuttle with Sulu (voiced by John Cho) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) to a nearby planet. When their shuttle is shot down, Kirk and Spock use wingsuits to glide to a Gorn outpost and blow it up before infiltrating a base to rescue T'Mar. They find Daniels, who is killed in an ensuing firefight. The Gorn bring Kirk and Spock to the Commander, who has them taken to an arena to fight his soldiers to the death. Angered by their besting of his champion, the Commander has Spock infected with the virus and pits him against Kirk. Sulu's shuttle arrives and McCoy shoots Spock with <b>an</b> <b>antidote,</b> while the Commander flees to his ship with T'Mar and the device.|$|E

30|$|<b>As</b> <b>antidotes</b> {{to these}} challenges, some labs used {{incremental}} projects to develop technological platforms for future projects; {{such an approach}} is effective where there is the prospect of many projects using shared technology; less so where applications are more idiosyncratic, such as service innovation. Others formed alliances with like-minded, non-competing organizations in a collaborative innovation community. Two such communities were encountered in this study. These {{had the advantage of}} shared knowledge and technology, and the serendipity that arises from comparing common problems across different contexts.|$|R
5|$|Peter {{suspects}} Connors is the Lizard and unsuccessfully {{confronts the}} creature in the sewers. The Lizard learns Spider-Man's real identity via {{the name on}} an abandoned camera and follows Peter to school, where they fight. Police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and the Lizard. The Police corner Spider-Man by taking off his mask and Captain Stacy discovers that Spider-Man is really Peter. The Lizard plans to make all humans lizard-like by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity. Spider-Man eventually disperses <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> cloud instead, restoring Connors and earlier victims to normal, but not before the Lizard mortally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy requests Peter avoid Gwen, {{in order to keep}} her safe. Peter initially does so, but later at school, suggests to Gwen he may see her after all.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
5|$|While on Müller's trail, {{he happens}} to meet his old friend, the Portuguese {{merchant}} Oliveira da Figueira. With Figueira's help, Tintin enters Müller's house and knocks the criminal unconscious. He finds the prince, who is imprisoned in a dungeon, and rescues him as Haddock arrives with the authorities. Müller is revealed to be the agent of a foreign power responsible for the tampering of the fuel supplies, having invented a type of chemical in tablet form, which {{goes by the name}} Formula 14, that increases the explosive power of oil by a significant amount. Thomson and Thompson find the tablets and swallow them, thinking them to be aspirin, causing them to grow long hair and beards that change colour. After analysing the tablets, Professor Calculus develops <b>an</b> <b>antidote</b> for Thomson and Thompson and a means of countering the affected oil supplies.|$|E
