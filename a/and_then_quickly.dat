5|$|Angel {{gives up}} {{his share of}} the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and {{ammunition}} to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Deke's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> take off again after the Bunch.|$|E
5|$|Males {{that have}} been unable to court a female {{successfully}} may try to achieve reproductive success in other ways. In sunfish species, like the bluegill, larger, older males known as parental males, which have successfully courted a female, construct nests for the eggs they fertilise. Smaller satellite males mimic female behaviour and coloration to access a nest and fertilise the eggs. Other males, known as sneaker males, lurk nearby <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> dash to the nest, fertilising on the run. These males are smaller than satellite males. Sneaker males also exist in Oncorhynchus salmon, where small males that were unable to establish a position near a female dash in while the large dominant male is spawning with the female.|$|E
5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} theatrically in the United States and Canada in September 1982 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> withdrawn {{because of its}} poor performance at the box office. It has never been released on home video, although it has sometimes been broadcast on television. It was the largest financial loss in film of 1982, earning less than $2 million. Reviewers at the time gave it consistently bad reviews and later commentators including Newsweek, TV Guide and Canadian Press have classed Inchon among the worst films of all time.|$|E
5|$|With Germany {{suffering}} major defeat on all fronts, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and {{his ring}} of conspirators decided to eliminate Hitler and the Nazi leadership, {{establish a new}} government and save the country from total destruction. On 20 July 1944, during a military conference at the Wolf's Lair, Stauffenberg planted a briefcase bomb underneath Hitler's conference table <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> left, claiming {{he had to make}} an important telephone call. Shortly after, the bomb exploded, fatally wounding three officers and the stenographer, who died shorty thereafter. Hitler survived with only minor injuries, as did everyone else who was shielded from the blast by the conference table leg.|$|E
5|$|After the two rivers merge, the Avon {{then turns}} south east {{away from the}} Cotswolds <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> south into the clay Dauntsey Vale, where it is joined by the River Marden, until it reaches the biggest town so far, Chippenham. The wide vale {{is now known as}} the Avon Vale, and the river flows on via Lacock to Melksham, then turns north-west through Bradford on Avon, where the centre of the town grew up around the ford across the river Avon, hence the origin of the town's name ("Broad-Ford"). This was {{supplemented}} in Norman times by the stone bridge that still stands today. The Norman side is upstream, and has pointed arches; the newer side has curved arches. The Town Bridge and Chapel is a grade I listed building. It was originally a Packhorse bridge, but widened in the 17th century by rebuilding the western side. On the bridge stands a small building which was originally a chapel but later used as a town lock-up.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the screen is a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.|$|E
5|$|In Season 4, Kurt joins Rachel in New York {{after she}} reveals {{that she is}} unhappy with her roommate and life at that point. After the {{encouragement}} of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds a loft in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and his editor, Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, she leans on his support, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June, Ilić went to Tuzla {{to bring}} the weapons to Sarajevo. Miško Jovanović hid the weapons in a large box of sugar. On 15 June, the two went {{separately}} by train to Doboj where Jovanović handed off the box to Ilić. Later that day, Ilić returned to Sarajevo by train, being careful to transfer to a local train outside Sarajevo <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> transfer to a tram to avoid police detection. Once at his mother's house, Ilić hid the weapons in a suitcase under a sofa. Then, on approximately 17 June, Ilić traveled to Brod (Dedijer puts it on 16 June, but trial records put it on 18 June). Questioned at trial, Ilić gave a confused explanation {{of the reason for}} his trip, first saying he had gone to Brod to prevent the assassination and then saying he had returned to Sarajevo from Brod to prevent the assassination. Dedijer puts forward the thesis (citing Bogijević) that Ilić went to Brod to meet an emissary of Apis, Djuro Ŝarac, who had instructions to cancel the assassination and then later Rade Malobabić was dispatched from Serbia to Sarajevo to reauthorize the assassination.|$|E

25|$|The Bay of Fundy Campaign {{occurred}} during the French and Indian War (the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War) when the British ordered the Expulsion of the Acadians from Acadia after the Battle of Fort Beauséjour (1755). The Campaign started at Chignecto <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> moved to Grand Pré, Rivière-aux-Canards, Pisiguit, Cobequid, and finally Annapolis Royal. Approximately 7,000 Acadians were deported to the New England colonies.|$|E

25|$|In Guatemala, Matías de Gálvez led Spanish {{troops in}} an effort to {{dislocate}} British settlements along the Gulf of Honduras. Gálvez captured Roatán on 16 March 1782, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> took Black River. Following the decisive naval victory at the Saintes, Archibald Campbell, the Royal governor of Jamaica, authorized Edward Despard to re-take Black River, which he did on 22 August. However, with peace talks opening, and Franco-Spanish resources committed to the siege of Gibraltar, no further offensive operations took place.|$|E
25|$|Phidippus clarus {{is found}} in old fields {{throughout}} eastern North America. It lives among flowers, often sharing habitats with the small to medium-sized crab spider Misumena vatia, which waits for prey. P. clarus often waits upside down {{near the top of}} a plant, a position which may be useful for detecting prey <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> jumping down before the prey can escape. In a 2002 survey of jumping spiders in Minnesota, P. clarus accounted for 52% of the total found.|$|E
25|$|CCF re-emerged as Can-Car Rail in 1983 as a joint {{division}} between Hawker Siddeley Canada and UTDC. The Can-Car Rail operations were based in Thunder Bay.
