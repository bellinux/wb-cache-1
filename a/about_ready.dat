5|$|During {{a costume}} party, Lois {{suggests}} Brian {{to find a}} girlfriend. After going to the bookstore to buy The God Delusion, Brian meets an atheist named Carolyn, {{who happens to be}} looking for the same book. Brian becomes interested in Carolyn, and the two begin to date. When she invites him to her house, Stewie apprehends Brian and tells him that his relationships fail because he has sex with his girlfriends immediately when they meet. Brian realizes that Stewie is right and decides to listen to his advice. However, he finds out that Carolyn has begun to date Cleveland, since Brian did not want to have sex for the three weeks they have dated, and assumed he just wanted to be friends. A heartbroken Brian tries to deal with his loss, but keeps running into Cleveland and Carolyn having sex in various locations. Blaming Stewie for his advice that cost him a relationship with Carolyn, Brian is <b>about</b> <b>ready</b> to give up on love. Apologizing for his botched attempt to help him out, Stewie suggests that he can convince Cleveland's ex-wife, Loretta, to reconcile with him.|$|E
5|$|When the Sasanians reached Chalcedon in 615, {{it was at}} this point, {{according}} to Sebeos, that Heraclius had agreed to stand down and was <b>about</b> <b>ready</b> to become a client of the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II, allowing the Roman Empire to become a Persian client state, as well as even allow Khosrow II to choose the emperor. Things began to look even more grim for the Byzantines when Chalcedon fell in 617 to Shahin, making the Persians visible from Constantinople. Shahin courteously received a peace delegation but claimed {{that he did not have}} the authority to engage in peace talks, directing Heraclius to Khosrow, who rejected the peace offer. Still, the Persian forces soon withdrew, probably to focus on their invasion of Egypt. Yet the Persians retained their advantage, capturing Ancyra, an important military base in central Anatolia, in 620 or 622. Rhodes and several other islands in the eastern Aegean fell in 622/3, threatening a naval assault on Constantinople. Such was the despair in Constantinople that Heraclius considered moving the government to Carthage in Africa.|$|E
500|$|Another {{orthopteran}} {{is found}} in Rachel Ruysch's still life Flowers in a Vase, c. 1685. The seemingly static scene is animated by a [...] "grasshopper on the table that looks <b>about</b> <b>ready</b> to spring", according to the gallery curator Betsy Wieseman, with other invertebrates including a spider, an ant, and two caterpillars.|$|E

5|$|His {{expertise}} in airbase construction led to Johns {{being sent to}} the South West Pacific as Chief Engineer, American Forces in Java. Departing Washington, D.C. by air on 14 January 1942, Johns arrived in Surabaya nine days later. His first mission was to provide airfield facilities on Java for 2,000 aircraft. Tapping into the vast resources of labour available in one of the world's most densely populated regions, Johns set <b>about</b> <b>readying</b> the required airfields. However, Java was captured by the Japanese before the aircraft arrived.|$|R

500|$|In 2013, Architects {{expanded}} their promotional reach to the United States, a country {{they were not}} confident in. They were [...] "tired of losing money" [...] with their tours in the US and [...] " [...] were <b>about</b> <b>ready</b> {{to give up on}} America". Starting in March, with opening act Crossfaith they supported Enter Shikari and then joined the American Warped Tour 2013 in June. The band also made single appearances in Europe at several summer festivals, including Download Festival 2013 in the UK. The band announced they would tour the US {{for the third time in}} 2013 in November and December with co-headliners Protest The Hero and support from The Kindred and Affiance. They also announced plans to tour Australia before the end of 2013. Architects' final performance in support of Daybreaker and their first in India occurred at the Saarang culture festival on 11 January 2014.|$|E
500|$|O'Hara began 1941 by {{appearing}} in They Met in Argentina, RKO's answer to Down Argentine Way (1940). O'Hara later declared that she [...] "knew {{it was going}} to be a stinker; terrible script, bad director, preposterous plot, forgettable music". She grew increasingly frustrated with the direction of her career at this time. Ida Zeitlin wrote that O'Hara had [...] "reached a pitch of despair where she was <b>about</b> <b>ready</b> to throw in the towel, to break her contract, to collapse against the stone wall of indifference and howl like a baby wolf". She pleaded with her agent for a role, however small, in John Ford's upcoming film How Green Was My Valley (1941), at 20th Century Fox, a film about a close, hard-working Welsh mining family living in the heart of the South Wales Valleys in the 19th century. The film, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, began an artistic collaboration with Ford that would span 20 years and five feature films.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, {{the band}} {{promoted}} Daybreaker further, {{primarily in the}} United States, first supporting Enter Shikari in the US in March with Crossfaith and then {{as part of the}} American Warped Tour 2013 in June. They also played the main stage at Download Festival 2013 at Donington Park, Leicestershire, United Kingdom. Before their large touring schedule in the United States the band wasn't confident in performing as they were [...] "tired of losing money" [...] with their tours in the country and that [...] " [...] were <b>about</b> <b>ready</b> to give up on America". Architects announced that they were recording their sixth full-length album in September. The band announced they were doing a third tour of the United States in 2013 in November and December with co-headliners Protest The Hero and support from The Kindred and Affiance, as well as plans to go to Australia before 2013 had finished. Architects final performance in support of Daybreaker is their first performance in India at the Saarang culture festival on 11 January 2014 with Romanian rock band Grimus.|$|E
60|$|It {{can well}} be fancied that, after this {{reminder}} that I {{was not to}} be trusted in time of danger, my lips remained closed, and in silence I set <b>about</b> making <b>ready</b> for the journey.|$|R

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of April 12, an armed crowd rallied under a banner that read [...] "Liberty Freedom For God We Stand". [...] Most had signs, many of which chided [...] "government thugs". Addressing the protesters, Bundy said, [...] "We {{definitely}} don't recognize [...] jurisdiction or authority, his arresting power or policing power in any way" [...] and [...] "We're <b>about</b> <b>ready</b> to take the country over with force!" [...] After the BLM announced a suspension of the roundup, Bundy suggested blocking a highway. Armed protesters blocked a portion of Interstate 15 {{for more than two}} hours, causing traffic backups for three miles in both directions. Protesters also converged at the mouth of Gold Butte, the preserve where the cattle were corralled, and a tense, hour-long standoff ensued. BLM rangers warned over loudspeakers that they were prepared to use tear gas. Former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, who was with the protesters, said that they were [...] "strategizing to put all the women up at the front. If they are going to start shooting, it's going to be women {{that are going to be}} televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers". Protestors with rifles took positions on a highway overpass, seemingly offering cover as horse-mounted wranglers led protesters to face off against heavily equipped BLM rangers and snipers. Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, who officially traveled to the Bundy standoff to convey that Utah did not want the cattle, put the number of federal agents present at over 200. According to Las Vegas assistant sheriff Joe Lombardo, there were 24 BLM rangers and Las Vegas deputy sheriffs present at the standoff. Las Vegas police were not allowed to wear protective gear because of fear that it would be seen as a provocation. Clark County Sheriff Gillespie blames the escalation of the situation on the BLM, stating to the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the BLM has lied to him about having a place to take the cattle and the BLM did not attend town-hall meetings and disregarded his advice as County Sheriff.|$|E

60|$|After {{this the}} {{situation}} was discussed for some time--in fact, until well after the noon hour.

60|$|Six {{men were}} sent {{down the river}} in canoes, to watch and report the {{movements}} of the enemy, that we might have timely warning of their near approach, and the remainder of the party which had been left behind were set <b>about</b> getting <b>ready</b> for the destruction of the fleet, if that should become necessary.|$|R
