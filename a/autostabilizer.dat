5000|$|Aerodynamic {{surfaces}} and air-jet nozzles controlled electrically via three independent servo-motors (with [...] "three-way parallel" [...] or [...] "triplex" [...] fail-safe operation) {{in conjunction with}} three <b>autostabilizer</b> control systems ("full fly-by-wire") ...|$|E
5000|$|Modes 1 and 2 were {{selected}} on the ground; whenever the <b>autostabilizer</b> was in use, the pilot had an emergency override lever available {{with which to}} revert to direct control mode in flight. The outputs from the three control systems were compared and a [...] "majority rule" [...] enforced, ensuring that a failure in a single system was overridden by the other two (presumably correct) systems. Any failure in a [...] "fly-by-wire" [...] pathway was indicated to the pilot as a warning, which he could either choose to ignore or respond to by switching to direct (manual) control.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{procedure}} for the optimization of aircraft <b>autostabilizer</b> systems is presented. The procedure is straightforward, and its application does {{not result in}} demands for <b>autostabilizer</b> systems of prohibitive complexity. Many important non-linear effects may be included v/ith only slight extra complication in the required calculations. The procedure is applicable, in the first place, to piloted aircraft,- {{the essence of the}} procedure being the assumption {{that the purpose of the}} <b>autostabilizer</b> is to reduce the effort demanded of the pilot in executing a given manoeuvre or attaining a given response. Although the presence of the pilot is explicitly taken into account in the calculations no form of pilot's transfer function need be specified. It is shovm how the procedure may be modified to form an approximate procedvire for the optimization of auto stabilizers for pilotless aircraft having linear <b>autostabilizer</b> character...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{simulation of}} a slender-wing {{supersonic transport aircraft}} during approach and landing has been flown {{by a number of}} pilots from airlines and test establishments. The aim of the simulation was to obtain pilots ' comments on the handling qualities of the simulated aircraft, to discover problem areas, and to study especially touchdown, and the effect of <b>autostabilizer</b> failures. The touchdown phase was of particular interest as, at the time, it had not been studied in detail. Although useful results were obtained, they are qualified by the inability of the simulation to provide all the cues, particularly visual ones, necegsary for a successful lfinding. Cockpit motion in pitch and roll was used. Principal results were that the handling qualities of the simulated aircraft in its fully autostabilized state were good: loss of the pitch damper provoked the strongest criticisms; loss of autothrottle did not pose any great difficulty. Retaining the autothrottle in operation throughout the landing flare was desirable. Sidestep manoeuvres were performed easily and good landings could be made in calm and turbulent conditions, in cross-wind...|$|E
