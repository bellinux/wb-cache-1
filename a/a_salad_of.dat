5|$|The current menu {{still has}} {{elements}} {{from the earlier}} days of the restaurant, such as lobster thermidor and grouse. Chef Gueller produces modern French cuisine, with classical elements. Dishes on the restaurant's menu include a terrine of foie gras served with <b>a</b> <b>salad</b> <b>of</b> smoked eel, alongside apple served both as a jelly and as a purée. Foie gras was temporarily taken off the menu in 2008 following threats of protests from animal rights activists. The dish was later restored to the menu, and foie gras has also since been served with a duck terrine and pistachios.|$|E

25|$|Garlic, onions, ginger, tomatoes, mild curry, {{and salt}} {{are the most}} common {{ingredients}} used to flavor dishes, and in coastal areas other ingredients such as coconut milk, vanilla, cloves or turmeric may also be used. A variety of condiments are served on the side and mixed into the rice or laoka according to each individual's taste rather than mixing them in as the food is being cooked. The most common and basic condiment, sakay, is a spicy condiment made from red or green chili pepper. Indian-style condiments made of pickled mango, lemon, and other fruits (known as achards or lasary), are a coastal specialty; in the highlands, lasary often refers to <b>a</b> <b>salad</b> <b>of</b> green beans, cabbage, carrots and onion in a vinaigrette sauce, popular as a side dish or as the filling of a baguette sandwich.|$|E

6000|$|Such is {{the present}} {{condition}} of the once famous emporium Leukè Kóme. We returned along the shore to embark; and, shortly after noon, the old corvette of Crimean date again swung round on her heel, and resumed her wanderings, this time northwards. The run of eighteen hours and fifteen minutes was semicircular, but the sea had subsided to a dead calm. The return to El-Wijh felt like being restored to civilization; we actually had <b>a</b> <b>salad</b> <b>of</b> radish leaves--delicious! ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Korner sat up {{suddenly}} and looked about him. This was not bed. The fragments of a jug and glass lay scattered round his feet. To the tablecloth an overturned cruet-stand mingled with egg gave colour. A tingling sensation about his head called for investigation.

A sound directed Mr. Korner's attention to the door.|$|E

60|$|Neither Twinkle nor Chubbins {{was very}} hungry, {{but they were}} curious to {{know what kind of}} food the prairie-dogs ate, so they watched {{carefully}} when the different dishes were passed around. Only grains and vegetables were used, for prairie-dogs do not eat meat. There was a milk-weed soup at first; and then yellow corn, boiled and sliced thin. Afterward they had <b>a</b> <b>salad</b> <b>of</b> thistle leaves, and some bread made of barley. The dessert was a dish of the sweet, dark honey made by prairie-bees, and some cakes flavored with sweet and spicy roots that only prairie-dogs know how to find.|$|E
60|$|And {{for once}} I {{accepted}} that belief, since {{but for the}} shedding of that wine and its sudden effect upon him, it is likely we had witnessed a shedding of blood. Thus, was the ill-timed pleasantry of my feather-brained La Fosse tided over in comparative safety. But the topic being raised was not so easily abandoned. Mademoiselle de Lavedan grew to be openly discussed, and even the Count's courtship of her came to be hinted at, at first vaguely, then pointedly, {{with a lack of}} delicacy for which I can but blame the wine with which these gentlemen had made <b>a</b> <b>salad</b> <b>of</b> their senses. In growing alarm I watched the Count. But he showed no further sign of irritation. He sat and listened as though no jot concerned. There were moments when he even smiled at some lively sally, and at last he {{went so far as to}} join in that merry combat of wits, and defend himself from their attacks, which were made with a good-humour that but thinly veiled the dislike he was held in and the satisfaction that was culled from his late discomfiture.|$|E
