40|$|We {{present a}} nonparametric 'revealed preference' {{methodology}} for empirically analyzing <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> behavior. First, we introduce an integer programming (IP) methodology for testing data consistency with alternative <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> models: the 'general' {{case in which}} any good can be publicly consumed as well as privately consumed, possibly with externalities; and 'special' cases that impose specific prior structure (e. g. the case with all goods publicly consumed, and the case with all goods privately consumed without externalities). In addition, we show that this IP methodology can include information on 'assignable quantities' for particular goods. Next, we demonstrate that the IP methodology allows for recovering the structural collective decision model (including the sharing rule) from the observed <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> behavior. In turn, this {{makes it possible to}} address welfare-related questions that are specific to the <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> model. <b>collective</b> model; revealed preferences; consumption; testing; recovery; welfare analysis; integer programming...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines collective consumption: repetitive, intensive {{social relations}} {{focused on the}} consumption of {{a particular set of}} products. A theoretical orientation is established based on the cultural approach developed by anthropologists, a framework which has not yet been utilized to analyze <b>collective</b> <b>consumption,</b> but which can more easily acknowledge its complexity than can prominent models like subculture and fandom. This approach is applied to an ethnographic exploration of two cases of collective consumption: (1) the Anglo-American consumption of folk music, in which participants often combat the commodity status of their favored musical texts; and (2) the American musical activity known as wizard rock, which is predicated on the <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> of the Harry Potter series, one of history 2 ̆ 7 s most profitable sets of consumer forms. Using data gathered from these two similar-yet-different cases, the dissertation addresses three aspects of consumption-based social relations which {{have been the subject of}} prolonged debate amongst scholars and journalists. Firstly, it takes on the issue of whether <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> is characterized mainly by communality or hierarchy, demonstrating that a focus on the cultural norms which motivate a particular case of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> can not only show where it lands on this behavioral spectrum, but precisely why it does so. Secondly, the dissertation examines the impact of commerce on <b>collective</b> <b>consumption.</b> Findings from the two case studies show that <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> 2 ̆ 7 s strong ties to the commodity nexus have no inherent effect on the nature of its interactions, despite the fears of consumption critics. On the other hand, the emphasis of many scholars on consumers 2 ̆ 7 tendency to resist the commercial marketplace is also deemed unrealistic. Thirdly, the political potential of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> is assessed. While consumption does not oppose political involvement, as many authors have recently argued—in fact, both of these cases show sustained political activity—the ability of consumption-based interactions to be rallied into politics is found to be fundamentally limited. In conclusion, this work 2 ̆ 7 s cultural approach exposes the significant variability of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption,</b> and it thus encourages more empirical research to balance the prevalent academic and journalistic theorizing on the topic. ...|$|R

40|$|In La Question Urbaine Manuel Castells {{defined the}} urban {{question}} {{in terms of}} the alignment of the city as the spatial unit of organization and the establishment of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> (housing, public transport, water and energy provision, leisure, …). As a historical thesis and framework of analysis Castells’ definition is more dubious than ever as the process of urbanization is subject to fundamental logics of rescaling and has definitively left the contours of the city as a clearly defined territorial unit. Meanwhile, the context of ‘planetary urbanization’ has led to new situations in which questions of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption,</b> previously associated with the city, give rise to new urban questions within new territorial geometries, calling for new ‘urbanisms’ and new forms of governance. This paper studies three provincial projects of electrification within the context of extended urbanization in Belgium in order to problematize the territorial basis of the question of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption.</b> Urbanization in Belgium has historically been marked by what Neil Brenner described as ‘Spatial Keynesianism’: Distributive urban policies led to development models in which a precarious balance was struck between avoiding the problem of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> and the development of alternative modes of providing collective services. Since electricity networks were historically one of the first instances of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> to permeate into the countryside, analyzing them might clarify the logic behind extended forms of urbanization. Moreover, studying ‘urban questions’ beyond the city might provide methodological clues on ways in which to move beyond methodological cityism in the study of urbanization and its politico-ecological implications...|$|R
40|$|We provide a. first nonparametric (revealed preference) {{test of the}} <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> {{model on}} the basis of {{experimental}} data. By using nonparametric testing tools and experimental data, we avoid the usual problems associated with parametric tests (e. g. non-verifiable parametric structure) and the use of ‘real life’ data sets (e. g. preference heterogeneity). In addition, our collective rationality test complements the existing nonparametric-experimental evidence on individual rationality. Focusing on dyads, we find that all observed consumption choices are consistent with the nonparametric collective rationality conditions. In fact, the consistency results for the parsimonious ‘egoistic’ <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> model (as a tool for describing dyads’ choice behavior) are closely similar to those for the individual rationality model (as a tool for describing individuals’. choice behavior). This suggest that for simple consumption decision settings, such as that considered in our experiment, the egoistic model may be useful for practical analysis. Still, our results also suggest that the more general <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> model, which accounts for consumption externalities and public consumption, can be useful even for modeling such simple decision settings. In fact, we can interpret that the appropriate model specification also depends on the specific dyad type (e. g. friends or partners; gender composition) and choice setting (e. g. public consumption or not) at hand. <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> decisions, Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference, nonparametric analysis, experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Manuel Castells {{spoke of}} the urban as a unit of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption,</b> yet much of the {{politics}} of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> he documented was evident in the suburbs. The tendency for suburbs of most complexions to lack services and amenities has been and continues to be a focus of politics in Europe. In Spain, as elsewhere in Europe, a grassroots politics surrounding the making good of these deficits in basic services and amenities has broadened and formalised somewhat to become part of a competitive local representative politics concerned with shaping a sense of place. Here we consider this legacy of grassroots politics as it has played out more recently in a politics of place making in Getafe and Badalona in metropolitan Madrid and Barcelona, respectively. In conclusion, we suggest that this enduring suburban question—of making the suburban urban—places them at the centre of contemporary metropolitan governance and politics. However, it also raises further issues for study—notably, the scalar politics in which suburban place making is empowered or constrained, the role of political parties and individual politicians on the place-making process, and the point at which grassroots politics of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> becomes urban entrepreneurialism...|$|R

40|$|Kulutusyhteisöt ovat markkinoinnin kannalta merkittäviä kumppaneita ja sidosryhmiä, sillä ne osallistavat ja aktivoivat kuluttajia. Tunnettujen brändien, kuten Harley Davidsonin, Niken ja Applen fanit ovat paitsi uskollisia asiakkaita, myös toimivat tuotteiden puolestapuhujina. Väitöskirjassa tutkitaan sitä, miten myös arkisten ja tavanomaisten tuotteiden ympärille voi syntyä vahvaa yhteisöllistä toimintaa. Kulutusyhteisöt voivat määrittää brändin kokonaan uudelleen ja herättää sen henkiin ilman suurta markkinointibudjettia. Tutkimuksessa analysoidaan kotimaisen Reino & Aino -brändin kulttuurista elpymistä markkinoilla lähes täydellisestä unohduksesta merkittävään myynnin kasvuun ja uuteen suosioon kuluttajien keskuudessa. Laajan haastatteluista, havainnoinneista, valokuvista ja kirjallisesta materiaalista koostuvan aineiston avulla tutkitaan brändin roolia monimuotoisessa yhteisöjen verkostossa, jossa toiminta on suurelta osin kuluttajien itsensä organisoimaa. Erilaiset kulutusyhteisöt muodostavat dynaamisen verkoston, jossa yhteisöjen piirteet ja brändin rooli vaihtelevat. Yhteisöt ovat tutkimustulosten perusteella keskeisessä roolissa brändin elpymisen kannalta. Yhteisölliseen toimintaan kuuluvat kuluttajien järjestämät tapahtumat, kuten juoksukilpailut, jalkapalloturnaus ja rock-festivaali, joissa brändi yhdistyy mm. maaseudun nostalgiaan, humoristiseen kisailuun ja suomalaisen kulttuurin keskeisiin arvoihin. Reino & Aino on omaksuttu yhteenkuuluvuuden symboliksi myös artistien, kuten Jonne Aaronin ja Katri-Helenan faniyhteisöissä. Perheet, työyhteisöt ja harrastusryhmät, kuten esimerkiksi jääkiekon pelaajat ovat ottaneet brändin omakseen ja luoneet sille uusia merkityksiä ja käyttötapoja. Vanhusten kotitohvelista on tullut koko kansan jalkine, joka taipuu mitä moninaisimpiin käyttötarkoituksiin. Itse organisoituvien yhteisöjen huomioiminen edellyttää yritykseltä perinteisen roolin uudelleen määrittelyä. Tutkimuksen perusteella hallinnan ja kontrollin sijaan yritysten tulisi tukea ja mahdollistaa yhteisöllistä toimintaa esimerkiksi antamalla yhteisöjen käyttöön resursseja, osallistumalla niiden toimintaan ja osoittamalla niitä kohtaan arvostusta. Näin brändiä voidaan kehittää vuorovaikutuksessa yhteisöjen kanssa. Consumption {{and social}} life are intertwined. People join <b>consumption</b> <b>collectives</b> in order to feel {{connected}} and to share consumption practices and objects with others. Several concepts have been developed in consumer research to characterize <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> phenomena, such as subcultures of consumption, brand communities, and consumption tribes. However, differences between the concepts are often unclear, and each concept highlights some features while obscuring others. Regarding the <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> of brands, the literature has emphasized the commercial nature and hierarchical structure of brand communities, simultaneously overlooking other kinds of collectives. More research is thus needed to integrate the literature and to extend it. Specifically the heterogeneity and complexity of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> needs to be recognized. The purpose {{of this research is}} to extend the view of the <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> of brands. The purpose is divided into three interconnected research objectives that focus on building a categorization scheme for heterogeneous <b>consumption</b> <b>collectives</b> around one brand, analyzing their characteristics in detail as well as understanding their role in cultural brand revitalization. In particular, the findings yield insights on the interaction between <b>consumption</b> <b>collectives</b> and the revitalization of a brand that was disappearing from the market. Qualitative case study research was conducted on the Finnish footwear brand Reino & Aino. Research data was generated through multiple methods including interviews, observations, and gathering cultural data. The research process was iterative and based on abductive logic incorporating both inductive and deductive phases. The conceptual framework for the study is built from the stream of literature on marketplace cultures and communities. This literature is integrated and critically evaluated in order to build a categorization scheme of heterogeneous <b>consumption</b> <b>collectives</b> around one brand with which to initially analyze the empirical data. Five different kinds of <b>consumption</b> <b>collectives</b> are identified: place-focused, brand-focused, activity-focused, idea-focused and social relations-focused collectives. They are also characterized as more or less integrated versus dispersed {{and the role of the}} brand is either more central or more peripheral in the <b>consumption</b> <b>collective.</b> A practice theoretical interpretive framework is used to further analyze the elements of practices within the <b>consumption</b> <b>collectives.</b> Practice theory focuses on the performative aspects of everyday social life. The analysis identifies elements of practice including materials, meanings, and competences that intersect and form socially shared practices in <b>consumption</b> <b>collectives.</b> Finally, the research provides an interpretation of cultural brand revitalization where the heterogeneous <b>consumption</b> <b>collectives</b> are seen as important social sites that facilitate it. The research contributes to consumer research first by integrating the literature on <b>collective</b> <b>consumption,</b> second by offering a new way of categorizing consumption collectives; and third, by yielding insights into the role of <b>consumption</b> <b>collectives</b> in cultural brand revitalization. The complexity and heterogeneity of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> phenomena in the market are recognized. The research also has implications for marketing practitioners who wish to build and maintain the viability of their brands in the market. These implications help them to adopt a new supportive and encouraging role in relation to different <b>consumption</b> <b>collectives...</b>|$|R

The model focuses on individual preferences, a consumption technology that captures {{the economies of}} scale {{of living in a}} couple, and a sharing rule that governs the intra-household allocation of resources. The model is applied to a time series of Dutch consumption expenditure surveys. Our empirical results indicate substantial economies of scale and a wife's share that is increasing in total expenditures. We further calculated two sets of poverty rates: one based on the <b>collective</b> <b>consumption</b> model and one based on the traditional approach with a standard equivalence scale. Poverty among widowers is underestimated by the traditional approach. The same is true for women (men) in elderly couples for the first (later) time periods in our analysis. Finally, we analysed the impact of becoming a widow(er). Based on cross-sectional evidence, we find that the drop in material well-being following the husband's death is rather substantial for women.

Adopting the social cleavage approach, the present thesis argues that two electoral cleavages, centre-periphery and <b>collective</b> <b>consumption,</b> were important by 1991. It, therefore, explores the international, social and political contexts within which the 1991 LegCo direct elections took place in order to explain the political alignments and electoral cleavages during the period 1982 - 1991. First, the study examines the Sino-British attitudes towards political reforms in Hong Kong and the development of the centre-periphery cleavage in the 1980 s as the two countries negotiated the transfer of sovereignty. Second, the expansion of the Hong Kong Government 2 ̆ 7 s activities and its privatisation programmes are analyzed in order to describe the increasingly intimate relations between government and society and to show that, as a result, conflicts evolved over issues of <b>collective</b> <b>consumption.</b> Third, the emerging competition {{at the time of the}} 1991 elections is discussed with reference to political mobilisation and alignments during the previous decade.
