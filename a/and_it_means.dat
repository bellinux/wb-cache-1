The buttonhole on the lapel is called “occhiello” in Italian, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> “little eye” for its elongated almond shape. There isn’t really a tradition for a specific type of buttonhole in Naples, but there is a tendency of Neapolitan tailors to prefer slightly shorter and thicker buttonholes that resemble those of a shirt, while “regular” buttonholes of English tradition are more elongated and slender. Some tailors add a little teardrop shape {{at the end of the}} buttonhole, but that’s an aesthetic choice that does not refer to a particular tradition. For what concerns the buttons on the sleeves, they are always working buttons, and they are always overlapping, as if they were kissing each other.|$|E

500|$|With {{an eye to}} {{a presidential}} bid in 1860, Seward tried to appear a statesman who could be trusted by both North and South. Seward {{did not believe the}} federal {{government}} could mandate emancipation but that it would develop by action of the slave states as the nation urbanized and slavery became uneconomical, as it had in New York. Southerners still believed that he was threatening the forced end of slavery. While campaigning for Republicans in the 1858 midterm elections, Seward gave a speech at Rochester that proved divisive and quotable, alleging that the U.S. had two [...] "antagonistic system [...] are continually coming into closer contact, and collision results.… It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> that the United States must and will, sooner or later, become entirely either a slave-holding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation." [...] White southerners saw the [...] "irrepressible conflict" [...] speech as a declaration of war, and Seward's vehemence ultimately damaged his chances of gaining the presidential nomination.|$|E

According to Summer Hayes, author of six books about My Little Pony toy collections and organizer of the annual My Little Pony collectors' fair, some of these collectors appreciated the attention of the brony community. Hayes said that the brony community has participated in the toy fair, and that other collectors resent the sudden popularity of Friendship Is Magic. She said that that these earlier fans and collectors had thought; [...] "...what about us? We've been here forever, and nobody seemed to care.

Swastika is a derived word and connotes a form of welcome or a sign of something [...] "associated with well-being". According to Monier-Williams, a majority of scholars consider it a solar symbol, and in the ancient Indian texts the base swasti is equivalent to [...] "may it be well with thee! hail! health! adieu! so be it!". The sign implies something fortunate, lucky or auspicious, and when applied to entrances, doors, mandalas or object it denotes or reminds of auspiciousness or well-being.|$|E
2500|$|In ancient {{texts of}} Jainism, {{such as the}} Kalpa Sūtra the term Sati is found, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> [...] "virtuous woman". Many texts include a list of sixteen Satis, ancient women that {{represent}} auspiciousness and virtue, names revered in the mythology of Hinduism as well. The connotation of the term Sati, states M Whitney Kelting, means the same [...] "virtuousness, chaste, dedication to her family" [...] as in Hinduism, and in both cases, it {{is different from the}} associated practice called suttee during colonial British India. Evidence suggests that there were instances of Sati practice (self immolation) by Jain women, including some in the 19th century. In the Epigraphia Carnatica, two of the 41 cases of sati in the time period 1400 to 1600 CE are those of Jain women. The low numbers of Jains known to have committed sati suggests that the practice was uncommon within this community. In Jainism, the alternate competing phenomenon of widows becoming nuns, after a husband's death, has been recorded.|$|E
