It is also known as <b>ADAM</b> <b>complex</b> (amniotic deformities, adhesion, mutilation), amniotic band sequence, amniotic disruption complex, annular grooves, congenital amputation, congenital constricting bands, Streeter bands, Streeter anomaly, transverse terminal defects of limb, aberrant tissue bands, amniochorionic mesoblastic fibrous strings, and amniotic bands. The severity of amniotic band syndrome can range from a single, isolated finding to multiple, disfiguring complications. The arms and legs are most often affected.

40|$|The {{members of}} the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family are membrane-anchored {{multi-domain}} proteins that play prominent roles in male reproduction. ADAM 2, {{which was one of}} the first identified ADAMs, is the best studied ADAM in reproduction. In the male germ cells of mice, ADAM 2 and other <b>ADAMs</b> form <b>complexes</b> that contribute to sperm-sperm adhesion, sperm-egg interactions, and the migration of sperm in the female reproductive tract. Here, we generated specific antibodies against mouse and human ADAM 2, and investigated various features of ADAM 2 in mice, monkeys and humans. We found that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM 2 might enable the differential association of this protein with other ADAMs in mice. Western blot analysis with the anti-human ADAM 2 antibodies showed that ADAM 2 is present in the testis and sperm of monkeys. Monkey ADAM 2 was found to associate with chaperone proteins in testis. In humans, we identified ADAM 2 as a 100 -kDa protein in the testis, but failed to detect it in sperm. This is surprising given the results in mice and monkeys, but it is consistent with the failure of ADAM 2 identification in the previous proteomic analyses of human sperm. These findings suggest that the reproductive functions of ADAM 2 differ between humans and mice. Our protein analysis showed the presence of potential <b>ADAM</b> 2 <b>complexes</b> involving yet-unknown proteins in human testis. Taken together, our results provide new information regarding the characteristics of ADAM 2 in mammalian species, including humans...|$|R

5000|$|Reformers {{sought to}} change their role from civilizers to assimilators when {{reservation}} conditions crumbled. This plan for assimilation included provision of dedicated lands, and new legal and educational systems, including common schools, day schools on reservation, and boarding schools {{both on and off}} reservation. Adams describes boarding schools that [...] "alienated those it claimed to serve" [...] as its [...] "total institution" [...] nature provided acculturation outside standard curriculum. While students received instruction in the three Rs and in farming and domestic areas, Adams shows practices that targeted the students cultures including haircuts, restriction of native language and names, and school uniforms. With regard to reformer intent, he summarizes that the [...] "only way to save Indians was to destroy them (culturally)". <b>Adams</b> details the <b>complex</b> reaction to the schools, from hiding children to arguing over certain rules, and the overall acquiescence to the federal role.

Adams finds more criticism from lack of [...] "adequate and responsive instruction" [...] than he does towards the schools as a system.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} ways that group actions enter into {{algebraic}} K-theory and there are various theories that fit {{under the rubric of}} our title. To anyone familiar with both equivariant topological K-theory and Quillen's original definition and calculations of algebraic K-theory, there is a perfectly obvious program for the definition of the equivariant algebraic K-theory of rings and its calculation for finite fields. While this program surely must have occurred to others, there are no pub-lished accounts and the technical details have not been worked out before.

Negatively indexed equivariant K-groups were introduced by Loday [19]. From a topological point of view, one way of thinking about Quillen's original definition runs as follows. Let ~ be a topological group, perhaps discrete. One has a notion of a principal K-bundle and a classifying space B ~ for such bundles. When H is discrete, a principal ~-bundle is just a covering (possibly with dis-connected total space) with fibre and group ~. Given any increasing sequence of groups N with union H, we obtain an increasing sequence of classifying spaces n BH with union B~. We then think of B ~ as a classifying space for stabl...|$|R
40|$|The ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) {{family of}} {{proteins}} {{is involved in}} a variety of cellular interactions, including cell adhesion and ecto- domain shedding. Here we show that ADAM 12 binds to cell surface syndecans. Three forms of recombinant ADAM 12 were used in these experiments: the cys-teine-rich domain made in Escherichia coli (rADAM 12 -cys), the disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domain made in insect cells (rADAM 12 -DC), and full-length human ADAM 12 -S tagged with green fluorescent protein made in mammalian cells (rADAM 12 -GFP). Mesenchymal cells specifically and in a dose-dependent manner attach to ADAM 12 via members of the syndecan family. After binding to syndecans, mesenchymal cells spread and form focal adhesions and actin stress fibers. Integrin β 1 was responsible for cell spreading because function-blocking monoclonal antibodies completely inhibited cell spreading, and chondroblasts lacking β 1 integrin attached but did not spread. These data suggest that mesenchymal cells use syndecans as the initial receptor for the ADAM 12 cysteine-rich domain–mediated cell adhesion, and then the β 1 integrin to induce cell spreading. Interestingly, carcinoma cells attached but did not spread on ADAM 12. However, spreading could be efficiently induced by the addition of either 1 mM Mn 2 + or the β 1 integrin–activating monoclonal antibody 12 G 10, suggesting that in these carcinoma cells, the <b>ADAM</b> 12 –syndecan <b>complex</b> fails to modulate the function of β 1 integrin...|$|R
40|$|ADAM 15 is a transmembrane {{metalloproteinase}} {{involved in}} disease progression and aggressiveness in prostate cancer (PCa). ADAM 15 {{is composed of}} an extracellular domain, a transmembrane region and an intracellular domain, the latter being subject to splicing due to alternative use of exons 19 to 21. The splice variants that will be subject {{in this study are}} ADAM 15 -A, ADAM 15 -B, ADAM 15 -C, ADAM 15 -D and ADAM 15 -E. Previously, ADAM 15 splice variant A and B were reported to associate with the PCa promotor PTK 6 and the cMET adaptor protein Grb 2. In order to understand the underlying mechanisms for the contribution of ADAM 15 to disease progression in PCa, ADAM 15 A-E splice variants, overexpressed in LNCaP and PC 3 PCa cells, were biochemically and functionally characterized. Overexpression of ADAM 15 -A in PC 3 led to enhanced invasion upon HGF treatment, which could be reverted by cMET inhibitor treatment. In addition, ADAM 15 -induced invasion was dependent on its proteolytic activity. Moreover, PC 3 cells expressing proteolytically active ADAM 15 showed more MMP 2 activity compared to cells with the proteolytically inactive ADAM 15 mutant in cell supernatants. In contrast to the aggressive, androgen independent PC 3, androgen dependent LNCaP cells did not show any response to HGF treatment upon ADAM 15 A-E overexpression. All ADAM 15 splice variants were found in a complex with PTK 6, which could be disrupted upon cMET inhibition in PC 3. Strikingly, ADAM 15 was found in a complex with cMET/Gab 1 /Grb 2 /PTK 6. cMET inhibition led to complex loss of cMET/Gab 1 /PTK 6, however, Grb 2 remained in <b>complex</b> with <b>ADAM</b> 15 regardless of treatment. Unlike cMET, PTK 6 activity was not needed for formation of the <b>ADAM</b> 15 <b>complex.</b> Analysis of the ADAM 15 splice profile in prostate cancer patients and comparison with healthy prostate tissue revealed a significant overexpression of all ADAM 15 splice variants. In summary, we show {{for the first time that}} ADAM 15 is found in a complex with cMET/Gab 1 /Grb 2 /PTK 6, and importantly, that, this complex formation is dependent on the cMET/HGF axis in PC 3 PCa cells. Moreover, we found that proteolytically active ADAM 15 resulted in enhanced invasion upon HGF treatment in PC 3 s. Our data suggest an important role for ADAM 15 in prostate cancer disease progression...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe disintegrin and {{metalloprotease}} ADAM 12 {{has important}} functions in normal physiology {{as well as}} in diseases, such as cancer. Little is known about how ADAM 12 confers its protumorigenic effect; however, its proteolytic capacity is likely a key component. Thus, selective inhibition of ADAM 12 activity may be of great value therapeutically and as an investigative tool to elucidate its mechanisms of actions. We have previously reported the inhibitory profile of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) against ADAM 12, demonstrating in addition to TIMP- 3, a unique ADAM inhibitory activity of TIMP- 2. These findings strongly suggest that it is feasible to design a TIMP mutant selectively inhibiting ADAM 12. With this purpose, we characterized the molecular determinants of the <b>ADAM</b> 12 –TIMP <b>complex</b> formation as compared with known molecular requirements for TIMP-mediated inhibition of ADAM 17 /TACE.

40|$|The insulin {{receptor}} (IR) {{lacking the}} alternatively spliced exon 11 (IR-A) is preferentially expressed in fetal and cancer cells. The IR-A {{has been identified}} as a high-affinity receptor for insulin and IGF-II but not IGF-I, which it binds with substantially lower affinity. Several cancer cell types that express the IR-A also overexpress IGF-II, suggesting a possible autocrine proliferative loop. To determine the regions of IGF-I and IGF-II responsible for this differential affinity, chimeras were made where the C and D domains were exchanged between IGF-I and IGF-II either singly or together. The abilities of these chimeras to bind to, and activate, the IR-A were investigated. We also investigated the ability of these chimeras to bind and activate the IR exon 11 + isoform (IR-B) and as a positive control, the IGF-I receptor (IGF- 1 R). We show that the C domain and, to a lesser extent, the D domains represent the principal determinants of the binding differences between IGF-I and IGF-II to IR-A. The C and D domains of IGF-II promote higher affinity binding to the IR-A than the equivalent domains of IGF-I, resulting in an affinity close to that of insulin for the IR-A. The C and D domains also regulate the IR-B binding specificity of the IGFs in a similar manner, although the level of binding for all IGF ligands to IR-B is lower than to IR-A. In contrast, the C and D domains of IGF-I allow higher affinity binding to the IGF- 1 R than the analogous domains of IGF-II. Activation of IGF- 1 R by the chimeras reflected their binding affinities whereas the phosphorylation of the two IR isoforms was more <b>complex.</b> <b>Adam</b> Denley, Eric R. Bonython, Grant W.
