40|$|Background: Numerous {{individual}} characteristics {{have been found}} to be associated with rates of ob-taining flu shots. This study creates a predictive model that assesses the relative impact of each of these factors on increasing rates of flu <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> population. Methods: The Medicare beneficiary survey from 1998 and 1999 was used. Sixteen factors present in 1998 were compared between subjects who did and who did not receive flu shots. Significant factors were then used in a logistic regression to predict the probability of receiving <b>a</b> flu <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> 1998 and 1999. Results: Seven demographic and 7 health status measures were significantly different between sub-jects who did and who did not receive flu <b>shots</b> <b>in</b> 1998. Logistic regression showed that twelve of these variables were associated with a subject receiving <b>a</b> flu <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> 1998 and explained 11. 4 % of the vari-ability in who did and who did not receive <b>a</b> flu <b>shot.</b> For the following year, 1999, 7 measures were significantly associated with receiving <b>a</b> flu <b>shot</b> and explained 64 % of the variability in who did and who did not receive <b>a</b> flu <b>shot.</b> One variable, if the subject had received <b>a</b> flu <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> 1998, was highly predic-tive of a subject receiving <b>a</b> flu <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> 1999, explaining 63 % of the observed variability in who did and who did not receive <b>a</b> flu <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> 1999...|$|R

5|$|Children of Men used several lengthy single-shot {{sequences}} {{in which}} extremely complex actions take place. The longest {{of these are}} <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> which Kee gives birth (199 seconds; 3:19); an ambush on a country road (247 seconds; 4:07); and {{a scene in which}} Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and runs down a street and through a building {{in the middle of a}} raging battle (378 seconds; 6:18). These sequences were extremely difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by CGI effects.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{began when}} the large and {{unwieldy}} CSS Virginia steamed into Hampton Roads {{on the morning of}} March 8, 1862. Captain Buchanan intended to attack as soon as possible. Virginia was accompanied from her moorings on the Elizabeth River by Raleigh and Beaufort, and was joined at Hampton Roads by the James River Squadron, Patrick Henry, Jamestown, and Teaser. When they were passing the Union batteries at Newport News, Patrick Henry was temporarily disabled by <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> her boiler that killed four of her crew.

5|$|A month {{following}} his trade, Jovanovski suffered a broken foot while blocking <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> {{a game against}} the New Jersey Devils on February 9, 1999. Later in the season, he was involved in an altercation with Montreal Canadiens forward Shayne Corson. After being high-sticked in the face by Corson, the two players were sent off the ice, at which point Corson entered the Canucks' dressing room to verbally confront Jovanovski. According to Corson, the feud stemmed from comments Jovanovski had said about his family. As a result of entering the Canucks' dressing room, the Canadiens forward was later suspended five games by the NHL, in addition to one game for the high-sticking infraction. In 31 games with the Canucks that season, Jovanovski recorded two goals and 11 points. Combined with his games played with the Panthers, he totalled 27 points in 72 games.|$|E

5|$|After playing 48 {{games in}} the 2006–07 NHL season, Kesler {{suffered}} a torn acetabular labrum and missed {{the remainder of the}} regular season, finishing the season with sixteen points. Kesler returned to the Canucks lineup for the first game of their quarterfinal playoff series versus the Dallas Stars. While blocking <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> the fourth overtime of the game, Kesler was re-injured, suffering a displaced index finger. Despite finishing the game, Kesler was forced to undergo surgery to repair the damage and missed the remainder of the playoffs. In the off-season, the Canucks re-signed Kesler to a three-year, $5.25-million contract extension on May 24, 2007. In comparison to his previous contract, facilitated by the Flyers' offer sheet, the deal represented a $150,000 paycut in terms of average annual salary.|$|E
5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> the head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames {{leading up to the}} frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.|$|E
5|$|Renown {{was laid}} down by Fairfield at Govan, Glasgow, Scotland on 25 January 1915. The ship was {{launched}} on 4 March 1916 and completed on 20 September 1916, after the Battle of Jutland {{at the cost of}} £3,117,204. She served with the Grand Fleet in the North Sea during the remaining two years of the First World War. Renown was assigned to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron {{for the duration of the}} war, but never fired <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> anger during the war. On 12 December 1917 Renown put to sea with other elements of the fleet in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept the German 3rd Half-Flotilla of destroyers that had destroyed a Scandinavian convoy and most of its escorts off the coast of Norway. For the rest of the war the ships patrolled the North Sea uneventfully. Both Renown and Repulse were present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918.|$|E

5|$|Barrett {{signed for}} Ebbsfleet's Conference Premier rivals York City on a free {{transfer}} on 29 June 2009. He made his debut in a 2–1 defeat to Oxford on 8 August 2009, before scoring his first {{goal for the}} club with the opener in a 1–1 draw with Luton Town on 20 October with <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> the bottom corner. He scored the opening goal in a 3–1 defeat to Premier League team Stoke City in the FA Cup third round on 2 January 2010, with a header from an Alex Lawless free kick. He picked up a hamstring injury during March 2010, missing one match before making his return in a 1–0 victory over Mansfield Town later that month. He played in both legs of York's play-off semi-final victory over Luton, which finished 2–0 on aggregate. He signed a new one-year contract with York on 13 May 2010. He started in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 16 May, being substituted on 81 minutes, with York losing 3–1 to Oxford. He finished 2009–10 with 51 appearances and five goals for York.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{went into}} the first leg in Glasgow as massive underdogs, and the match {{seemed to be going}} as {{expected}} when 17 year old Michael Owen put the English side ahead on 6 minutes. Celtic continued to struggle during the opening 20 minutes, but began to find form as the first half progressed. The start of the second half saw Celtic pushing forward more and they equalised on 53 minutes. Jackie McNamara raced down the right wing, played a one-two with Craig Burley, then volleyed a powerful shot past David James. Simon Donnelly hit the post on 62 minutes, then a minute later the referee ignored {{what appeared to be a}} blatant foul on him in the penalty box. Celtic continued to press forward, and on 73 minutes were awarded a penalty when Larsson fell on being challenged by David James in the penalty box. Donnelly converted the resultant spot kick to put Celtic ahead. With full-time approaching, Steve McManaman picked the ball from inside his own half, dribbled 70 yards to the edge of the Celtic penalty box and curled <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> to level the match at 22. The return match at Anfield produced fewer chances and no goals, seeing Liverpool knock out Celtic on away goals.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, the United States went to {{war against}} Mexico and sent a naval and land {{expedition}} to conquer Alta California. At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles, the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For {{the next several months}} the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner's Ranch. Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico. In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual, fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} staircase set in Washington, D.C. {{was filmed}} in San Francisco's City Hall. The University of the Pacific's campus in Stockton, California, stood {{in for the}} exterior of the college where Jones works, while his classroom and the hall where he meets the American intelligence agents was filmed at the Royal Masonic School for Girls in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, England, which was again used in The Last Crusade. His home exteriors were filmed in San Rafael, California. Opening sequence exteriors were filmed in Kauai, Hawaii, with Spielberg wrapping in September in 73days, finishing under schedule in contrast to his previous film, 1941. The Washington, D.C. coda, although it appeared in the script's early drafts, was not included in early edits but was added later when it was realized that there was no resolution to Jones' relationship with Marion. Shots of the Douglas DC-3 Jones flies on to Nepal were taken from Lost Horizon, and a street scene was from <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> The Hindenburg. Filming of Jones boarding a Boeing Clipper flying-boat was complicated by the lack of a surviving aircraft. Eventually, a post-war British Short Solent flying-boat formerly owned by Howard Hughes was located in California and substituted.|$|E
5|$|When {{still in}} operation, the power {{stations}} appeared in films and television programs {{shot in the}} Newcastle area. They appeared in Payroll, a movie made in 1961, starring Michael Craig. One of two security van operators lives in Stella park, a housing estate above the power station. It is prominently in the background whenever the van operator's home is shown. In 1985, the Stella power stations are seen briefly in <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> Seacoal, a movie made by Amber Films. They appear during a scene where the two protagonists, Ray and Betty, are travelling from Sunderland to Newcastle. (Lynemouth power station, a North East power station still in operation, is more prominent in the film.) In Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?, a British sitcom broadcast between 1973 and 1974, the stations themselves did {{not appear in the}} series, but in the end credits their ash boat, Bessie Surtees, could be seen passing Spiller's Wharf near Byker. In 1981, it was featured in Swing Bridge Videos' Check it Out, a short film about youth unemployment in the west end of Newcastle. In the mid-1990s, the decommissioned stations were photographed by north eastern artist John Kippin as part of his work The Secret Intelligence of the Silent. This piece was exhibited at the Laing Art Gallery in 2012 as part of the exhibition Futureland Now.|$|E
