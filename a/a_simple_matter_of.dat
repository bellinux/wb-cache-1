25|$|At {{least one}} {{contributing}} mechanism for reduced spermatogenesis in cryptorchid testes is temperature. The temperature of testes in the scrotum {{is at least}} a couple of degrees cooler than in the abdomen. Animal experiments in the middle of the 20th century suggested that raising the temperature could damage fertility. Some circumstantial evidence suggests tight underwear and other practices that raise the testicular temperature for prolonged periods can be associated with lower sperm counts. Nevertheless, research in recent decades suggests that the issue of fertility is more complex than <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> temperature. It seems likely that subtle or transient hormone deficiencies or other factors that lead to a lack of descent also impair the development of spermatogenic tissue.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{advance in}} analog computing was {{the development of}} the first fire-control systems for long range ship gunlaying. When gunnery ranges increased dramatically in the late 19th century it was no longer <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> calculating the proper aim point, given the flight times of the shells. Various spotters on board the ship would relay distance measures and observations to a central plotting station. There the fire direction teams fed in the location, speed and direction of the ship and its target, as well as various adjustments for Coriolis effect, weather effects on the air, and other adjustments; the computer would then output a firing solution, which would be fed to the turrets for laying. In 1912, British engineer Arthur Pollen developed the first electrically powered mechanical analogue computer (called at the time the Argo Clock). It was used by the Imperial Russian Navy in World War I. The alternative Dreyer Table fire control system was fitted to British capital ships by mid-1916.|$|E

The review deals with how Signal Detection Theory, also called Thurstonian modeling, led to the adoption of a more sophisticated way of analyzing the data from sensory difference tests, by introducing the signal-to-noise ratio, d′, as a fundamental measure of perceived small sensory differences. Generally, the method of computation <b>of</b> d′ is <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>matter</b> for some <b>of</b> the better known difference tests like the triangle, duo–trio and 2 -AFC.
