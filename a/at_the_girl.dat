5|$|It {{begins with}} a young girl playing in the {{backyard}} as snow falls on the ground. The scene shifts {{to that of a}} bedside, where a young woman who has died, lies. Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl,</b> tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach the knob of a door, and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face.|$|E

2500|$|By early 1975 Genie showed {{comprehension}} of simple and complex sentences where {{the object was}} the relative clause, such as [...] "The boy is looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> who is frowning", or sentences where the subject was the relative clause and did not end in a noun phrase, such as [...] "The boy who is frowning {{is looking at the}} girl". However, when interpreting a complex sentence in which a relative clause ending in a noun phrase came before the main verb, such as [...] "The boy who is looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> is frowning", she interpreted the noun closest to the verb as the subject. The scientists wrote that this meant that she was using a word order strategy, which they considered progress because her earlier responses to them were clearly guesses. By this time Genie could only consistently count as high as 7 in sequential order, which came at the expense of her ability to do so via gestalt perception.|$|E

2500|$|Seems Zoya Vinogradova was {{an actress}} only and before {{performance}} of Mister X {{her name and}} family name could be jargoned due to Mister X Intelligence services program. It can be confirmed by jargon [...] "a poisonous snake" [...] with has commencement from 1970-x. One school-girl Zoya and her parents were sent to Odessa in 1974 or 1975 from the Volga region about. She became a school-girl of one school in Odessa. It was needed, that one school-boy Yuriy had to feel the love to this girl Zoya, and it succeeded. Next step was to let know for this boy that Zoya means dangerous. When the boy was looking for this girl she became smile and said roughly: [...] "What are you looking?" [...] Other boys and girl pay attention and it is shamefully for the boy. The poet and writer Alexander Pushkin verse [...] "Oleg Prophetic" [...] {{was included in the}} program of this class during that period. Personage Oleg Prophetic died due to snake bite, the snake was described by the poet as [...] "the snake under a boot tree". The word snake on Russian is [...] "змея" [...] (zmeya), pronunciation is close to Zoya. The boy Yuriy (short name Yura) was looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> Zoya and he thought: [...] "A Snake under a boot tree". In 1977, and of eight class education, girls of this class gave one to another and to some school-boys own special note-books where had to be mentioned any wishes or remarks as last two classes could be completed by girls and boys, who wished to continue education in any institute, high school or academy. It was possible after completion of 10 classes education. Everybody could check what was written by others and the boy Yura sow that Zoy wrote in one note-book: [...] "The love does not exist." [...] Zoya and her parent back from Odessa to Volga region in 1977. The boy Yuriy remembered that it was just switching from the previous love to Zhoya and his love to Zoya was switched off after Zoya departure. Later he understood that behind him was family with equipment and their boy Oleg received nickname [...] "Oleg Prophetic". Seems Zoya arrived in Odessa for short time to mentioned who will stay with equipment behind Yura. Jargon [...] "Zoya" [...] is [...] "a dangerous snake" [...] was promulgated, seems to avoid anybody understand really situation. The boy Yuriy does not call any Zoya as a snake. Really the boy Oleg became a [...] "snake" [...] for Yuriy later. It is example, how new meanings of words could enter the Russian language. It is means that some jargon could enter during the Mister X filming or later. Seems all jargon of the word [...] "виноград" [...] (...) entered during the Mister X filming or later. And really, the festival's bride was a problem for KGB due to plenty questions and misunderstandings.|$|E
