5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a red dress. In his life with Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical message of the film that <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way we can see that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E

25|$|I {{have learned}} {{that many of the}} Greeks believe Pythagoras said <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> {{generated}} from number. The very assertion poses a difficulty: How can things which do not exist even be conceived to generate? But he did not say that all things come to be from number; rather, in accordance with number – on the grounds that order in the primary sense is in number and it is by participation in order that a first and a second and the rest sequentially are assigned to things which are counted.|$|E

500|$|The various scandals {{involving}} Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion {{have left}} distinct marks on Romania's cultural life. Boia writes: [...] "Caion [...] secured himself an unwanted fame {{in the history}} of Romanian literature". In early 20th-century Transylvania, [...] "Caion" [...] was adapted into a common noun and a term of contempt. Listing its [...] "Transylvanophobe" [...] enemies, Luceafărul noted the existence of [...] "all sorts of Caions, those little puppies raised by the obscure magazines." [...] Also in Luceafărul, priest-publicist Alexandru Ciura stated: [...] "We live in the epoch of the Caions, for whom <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> permitted". Caion's poor reputation also rubbed off on Macedonski: Caragiale's disciple Alexandru Cazaban coined the word Macaionski, as a hybrid of both writers.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there is}} a strong {{suggestion}} in his letters that in his early years he had a sexual encounter with one of his models and possibly also a sexual encounter of some kind while in Venice in 1823–24, Etty was devoutly Christian and famously abstemious. Alison Smith considers the composition of Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret a conscious effort on his part to praise the virtue of chastity by creating a [...] "challenge for the presumably male viewer... to vanquish lust and cast a pure gaze on vulnerable womanhood". Throughout his career Etty had championed the use of female models in life classes, creating some controversy, and this painting may have been intended to emphasise his belief that [...] "To the pure in heart <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> pure".|$|E

Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records." ...|$|E

[...] Robert Christgau, writing for The Village Voice, gave the album an A and commented, [...] "these songs are among Fagen's finest [...] his acutely shaded lyrics puts the jazziest music he's ever committed to vinyl into a context that like everything here is loving but very clear-eyed." [...] Robert Palmer of The New York Times called The Nightfly a [...] "vivid and frequently ingenious look back at a world that is gone forever.
