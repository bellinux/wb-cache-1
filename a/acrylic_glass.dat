5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took {{matters into their own hands}} by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In part because of the defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with <b>acrylic</b> <b>glass,</b> and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E
25|$|Diasec is {{a process}} which uses <b>acrylic</b> <b>glass</b> as a {{substitute}} for normal glass in picture frames. This is done for its relatively low cost, light weight, shatter-resistance, aesthetics and because it can be ordered in larger sizes than standard picture framing glass.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{furniture}} makers, {{especially in}} the 1960s and 1970s, seeking to give their products a space age aesthetic, incorporated Lucite and other PMMA products into their designs, especially office chairs. Many other products (for example, guitars) are sometimes made with <b>acrylic</b> <b>glass</b> to make the commonly opaque objects translucent.|$|E

40|$|Samples of <b>acrylic</b> and <b>glass</b> were {{implanted}} with tungsten (W) and lead (Pb) to investigate their X-ray attenuation characteristics. The near-surface composition depth profiles of ion-implanted <b>acrylic</b> and <b>glass</b> samples were studied using ion-beam analysis (Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy—RBS). The effect of implanted ions on the X-ray attenuation ability was studied using a conventional laboratory X-ray machine with X-ray tube voltages ranging from 40 to 100 kV at constant exposure 10 mAs. The results {{were compared with}} previous work on ion-implanted epoxy. As predicted, the RBS results and X-ray attenuation for both ion-implanted <b>acrylic</b> and <b>glass</b> increase {{with the type of}} implanted ions when compared to the controls. However, since the glass is denser than epoxy or acrylic, it has provided the higher X-ray attenuation property and higher RBS ion concentration implanted with a shorter range of the ion depth profile when compared to epoxy and acrylic. A prolonged time is necessary for implanting acrylic with a very high nominal dose to minimize a high possibility of acrylic to melt during the process...|$|R
25|$|On December 17, 1967, another LM {{under test}} {{failed in the}} Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation ascent stage {{manufacturing}} plant. A window in LM-5 (Apollo 11's LM Eagle) shattered during its initial cabin pressurization test, designed to pressurize the cabin to 39 kilopascals (5.7pounds per square inch) above the external pressure. Both inner and outer windows and the <b>acrylic</b> <b>glass</b> cover of the right-hand window shattered when the pressure reached 35 kPa (5.1pounds per square inch).|$|E
25|$|Although not {{a type of}} {{familiar}} silica-based glass, the substance, like many thermoplastics, is often technically classified {{as a type of}} glass (in that it is a non-crystalline vitreous substance) hence its occasional historic designation as <b>acrylic</b> <b>glass.</b> Chemically, it is the synthetic polymer of methyl methacrylate. The material was developed in 1928 in several different laboratories by many chemists, such as William Chalmers, Otto Röhm and Walter Bauer, and was first brought to market in 1933 by the Rohm and Haas Company under the trademark Plexiglas.|$|E
25|$|The {{passenger}} {{doors are}} higher than on normal buses so that passengers can only board from designated shelters. The doors employ automated swing and slide mechanisms which is manually controlled by the driver. Currently, the slide mechanism is being phased out, with all new buses being equipped with swing doors. Protective full-height <b>acrylic</b> <b>glass</b> barriers are installed behind passenger seats close to the sliding door mechanism. Although, feeder routes uses low street-level doors. This is achieved with the driver's door {{at the front of}} the bus on big buses and a pair of designated hydaulic folding door on medium buses.|$|E
50|$|Simple paper, {{uncorrected}} gel glasses, cannot {{compensate for}} the 250 nanometer difference in the wavelengths of the red-cyan filters. With simple glasses, the red filtered image is somewhat blurry, when viewing a close computer screen or printed image. The (RED) retinal focus differs from the image through the (CYAN) filter, which dominates the eyes' focusing. Better quality, molded <b>acrylic</b> <b>glasses</b> frequently employ a compensating differential diopter power (a spherical correction) to balance the red filter focus shift relative to the cyan, which reduces the innate softness, and diffraction of red filtered light. Low power reading glasses worn along with the paper glasses also sharpen the image noticeably.|$|R

25|$|Almost all stations, except {{most of the}} {{elevated}} sections and sections of Line 2 from Songhong Road to Longyang Road, have platform screen doors with sliding <b>acrylic</b> <b>glass</b> at the platform edge. The train stops with its doors lined-up with the sliding doors on the platform edge and open when the train doors open, and are closed at other times. These screens are also being retrofitted on existing lines, starting with Line 1 whose core stations had doors {{by the end of}} 2006. On part of Line 2 and most of {{the elevated}} sections, the platform has sliding safety doors that reach only halfway up from the ground called Automatic platform gates.|$|E
25|$|A {{high-speed}} door is a {{very fast}} door some with opening speeds of up to 4m/s, mainly used in the industrial sector where {{the speed of a}} door has an effect on production logistics, temperature and pressure control. high-speed clean room doors are used in pharmaceutical industries for the special curtain and stainless steel frames. They guarantee the tightness of all accesses. The powerful high-speed doors have a smooth surface structure and no protruding edges. Therefore, they can be easily cleaned and depositing of particles is largely excluded. High-speed doors are made to handle a high number of openings, generally more than 200000 a year. They need to be built with heavy duty parts and counterbalance systems for speed enhancement and emergency opening function. The door curtain was originally made of PVC, but was later also developed in aluminium and <b>acrylic</b> <b>glass</b> sections. High Speed refrigeration and cold room doors with excellent insulation values was also introduced with the Green and Energy saving requirements.|$|E
500|$|Banksy {{unveiled}} one of {{his most}} controversial pieces of the series on 15 October, with a depiction of the Lower Manhattan skyline featuring the former Twin Towers, with a burnt-orange chrysanthemum in place where one of the hijacked airplanes struck the North Tower. The silhouette appeared {{on the side of a}} building in TriBeCa, with an identical depiction along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, facing the downtown skyline. The Brooklyn Heights piece was eventually buffed out by the city, requiring chemicals and a high-powered pressure washer. The removal followed a taunt Banksy had directed toward the city on his website. Meanwhile, the sister piece in TriBeCa served as a shrine, people placing flowers next to it and as well as a letter asking no one to touch the painting. [...] <b>Acrylic</b> <b>glass</b> was eventually installed to protect the piece, before someone painted over it.|$|E
25|$|Acetylene can be semihydrogenated to ethylene, {{providing}} a feedstock {{for a variety}} of polyethylene plastics.

500|$|Tharani {{described}} the set designing {{for the song}} [...] "Sahana", which was also shot at Ramoji Film City, as [...] "extremely challenging". After listening to the lyrics of the song which speaks of the four traditional calendar seasons, Tharani thought of using a concept titled Living in Seasons, which he used at a symposium held in Japan. For the set's design which depicted the four seasons, Tharani proposed three concepts– a traditional Japanese house, a contemporary house and a futuristic house. Shankar chose the futuristic house concept, which consisted of three domes in the shapes of a square, a circle and a pyramid adjacent to one another. The circular dome had a pathway around it and water falling from a 50 feet high rock, which would seep under the set. Tharani made use of <b>acrylic</b> <b>glass</b> and normal glass with the former being implemented {{on the floor to}} make the dance movements more easier to perform. Construction of the set for the number was completed in 30days.|$|E
