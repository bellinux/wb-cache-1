5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Lepiota babruzalka grow singly or {{scattered}} on the ground among decaying leaf litter <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of bamboo stands. The species has been documented only from Chelavur and Nilambur in the Kozhikode and Malappuram Districts of Kerala State. As of 2009, there are 22 Lepiota taxa (21 species and 1 variety) known from Kerala, which is recognized as a biodiversity hotspot.|$|E

5|$|Prior to opening, {{the flower}} buds are enveloped and {{protected}} {{in a thin}} dry papery or membranous (scarious) spathe. The spathe consists of a singular bract that is ribbed, and which remains wrapped <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the open flower. As the bud grows, the spathe splits longitudinally. Bracteoles are small or absent.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the pyramid-like {{mountain}} of Rtanj, in the Serbian Carpathians, attracted much apocalyptic attention, as many believed an artificial pyramid structure buried within it would emit {{a powerful force}} shield on the day, protecting those within it. Hotels <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> received up to 500 bookings a piece for rooms.|$|E
5|$|In 1330 Sir John de Mohun {{inherited}} the castle; John, although a notable knight, was childless {{and fell into}} considerable debt. His wife Joan took over the running of their estates, and when John died in 1376 she agreed to sell the castle to Lady Elizabeth Luttrell, the leading member of another major Norman family, for 5,000 marks, with the castle to transfer to Elizabeth on Joan's death. At some point during this period additional stone buildings were constructed along the Lower Ward, {{on the side of}} the current mansion, and records suggest that a ditch, or moat, may have existed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the Tor in the 14th century.|$|E

5000|$|Outfields were {{assumed to}} be boundless, in general. The only [...] "home run" [...] was a literal dash <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases,</b> on a ball hit between outfielders.|$|R
50|$|Azotobacter chroococcum, a nitrogen-fixing bacteria, is {{probably}} concentrated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of <b>the</b> petioles. But the bacteria do not fix nitrogen unless {{the plant is}} suffering extreme nitrogen-deficiency.|$|R
5|$|In 1988, the Air Force {{decided to}} close {{three of its}} nuclear weapons {{stations}} at its SAC bases. In addition to Loring, other bases around the world were scaled back. As the B-1B Lancer was now predicted to become the mainstay of nuclear defense for the country, Loring was deemed unnecessary for nuclear weapons stationing. That same year, fears began to surface that Loring would be an {{on the list of}} the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. As a result, the community began to rally <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> which at the time included 3,800 military personnel, 1,000 civilian employees, generated an $80 million payroll the previous year, and was the subject of $34 million in construction services.|$|E
5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread out <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> {{of the plant}} for varying distances, close to the surface. Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots, produced along the stems where these {{come into contact with}} a rooting medium.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. But, {{at the time}} Hanoi {{made the decision to}} move in <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. It is debatable whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops—nearly fifty maneuver battalions—to I Corps.|$|E
50|$|Spathularia is a genus of {{fungi in}} the family Cudoniaceae. Species in the genus are found in {{coniferous}} forests <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of conifers or near rotting logs.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, Wildcat {{softball}} players Mallory Holtman and Liz Wallace helped carry injured opponent Sara Tucholsky of Western Oregon University <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> {{after she}} hit her first-ever career home run and injured herself running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases.</b> CWU lost <b>the</b> game, ending the Wildcats' season. The story received national attention and the trio appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, CBS, CNN and ESPN. They also won an ESPY award for Best Moment in Sports in 2008, were featured in Sports Illustrated, and {{are part of}} a national billboard campaign promoting sportsmanship by the Foundation for A Better Life.|$|R
5|$|The guns on {{the forward}} turret roof were removed in 1911–1912 and the upper forward pair of guns in the {{superstructure}} were removed in 1913–1914. In addition, gun shields were fitted to all guns in the superstructure and the bridge structure was enlarged <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the forward tripod mast. During {{the first year of}} the war, a fire-control director was installed high on the forward tripod mast. Around the same time, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house 4 four-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns. In addition a pair of three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added.|$|E
5|$|The hairpin banksia's {{infructescence}} is {{a typical}} Banksia cone-like structure, with up to 100 crowded embedded follicles which are 1–2.4centimetres (⅓–1in) in diameter; these generally remain closed until burnt by bushfire. The nonlignotuberous subspecies cunninghamii is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, while the others regenerate from buds <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the lignotuber. Old flower spikes fade to brown, then grey with age. Old flower parts usually persist for a long time, giving the infructescence a hairy appearance. In Central and North Queensland, old cones of both var.spinulosa and var.collina are generally bare.|$|E
5|$|The last of {{the bronze}} reliefs on the column's {{pedestals}} was not completed until May 1854, and the four lions, although {{part of the original}} design, were only added in 1867. Each lion weighs seven tons. A hoarding remained <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of Nelson's Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place. Landseer, the sculptor, had asked for a lion that had died at the London Zoo to be brought to his studio. He took so long to complete sketches that its corpse began to decompose and some parts had to be improvised. The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{perennial}} bunchgrass forming clumps of stems up to 40 centimeters in maximum height with narrow, almost hairlike leaves located <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases.</b> <b>The</b> inflorescence is a spreading array {{of a few}} branches containing rough-haired spikelets.|$|R
50|$|Swinging {{almost entirely}} with his upper body, Gibson then hit the pitch over the right-field fence. He limped <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> and pumped his fist as his {{teammates}} stormed the field. The Dodgers won the game, 5 - 4.|$|R

5|$|The road intersects with Island Pond Road, a dirt path in Harriman, as it heads {{along the}} border. Arden Valley Road intersects with Crooked Road thereafter. Harris Mine is {{visible to the}} left as the road {{proceeds}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of Echo Mountain. To the southeast of Lindley Mountain, Arden Valley Road turns east and into the park. Arden Valley Road passes Lake Cohasset and Upper Lake Cohasset as it heads eastward. The road intersects with the Long Path and RamapoDunderbergAppalachian Trails soon afterward. Bradley Mine is visible to the left, and Arden Valley Road {{comes to an end}} at Tiorati Circle., where the road continues eastward as Tiorati Brook Road.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{is formed}} by {{andesite}} and dacite rocks, with fragmentary rocks prevailing over lava flows. The rocks have typical arc-volcano chemistry and composition, with a progression from andesite to dacite in the eruption products with younger age. Potassium-argon dating has indicated an age range from 5,900,000 to 90,000 years. Subsequent erosion has generated a large debris apron <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> {{of the volcano}} and carved rock formations which impressed early explorers; one well-known rock formation is Neza e Sultan.|$|E
5|$|To evade enemy {{detection}} and interception efforts, the Victor was outfitted with an extensive electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite which were {{operated by the}} air electronics officer (AEO), who had primary responsibility for the aircraft's electronics and communication systems. The ECM equipment could be employed to disrupt effective use of both active and passive radar {{in the vicinity of}} the aircraft, and to provide situational awareness for the crew. Enemy communications could also be jammed, and radar guided missiles of the era were also reportedly rendered ineffective. The Victor B.2 featured an extended area located <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the tail fin which contained cooling systems and some of the ECM equipment.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1936 World Series {{cover story}} about Lou Gehrig and Carl Hubbell, Time proclaimed Gehrig [...] "the game's No. 1 batsman", who [...] "takes boyish pride in banging a {{baseball}} as far, and running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> as quickly, as possible".|$|R
50|$|Erigeron disparipilus is a {{perennial}} herb up to 12 cm (4.8 inches) tall. Most {{of the leaves}} are generally clustered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of <b>the</b> stems. Each stem generally has only one flower head, with 30-60 white ray florets surrounding numerous yellow disc florets.|$|R
50|$|This dendronotid nudibranch is {{translucent}} {{white with}} large red spots entirely covering the ceratal tubercles. The back and sides {{are covered with}} an irregular, patchy, brown-red pigment, and there are bare areas <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of <b>the</b> cerata and {{along the sides of}} the foot.|$|R
5|$|When {{it came to}} leisure, {{the area}} {{surrounding}} Loring offered many options. Many recreation areas and campgrounds were located in and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> region, with some being as far as two hundred miles away. The Morale Welfare and Recreation center offered equipment for these outings, including fishbait and tackle, as well as boat rentals. Loring's bowling center was twenty-two lanes, {{and one of the}} most modern in the area. Finally, the base library loaned books to both residents and students alike.|$|E
5|$|While {{the slaves}} lacked {{military}} training, Spartacus' forces displayed ingenuity {{in their use}} of available local materials, and {{in their use of}} clever, unorthodox tactics when facing the disciplined Roman armies. In response to Glaber's siege, Spartacus' men made ropes and ladders from vines and trees growing on the slopes of Vesuvius and used them to rappel down the cliffs {{on the side of the}} mountain opposite Glaber's forces. They moved <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of Vesuvius, outflanked the army, and annihilated Glaber's men.|$|E
5|$|In March 1966, the Australian {{government}} further {{increased its}} commitment to the Vietnam War, announcing the deployment of a two-battalion brigade with armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support, designated the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF). Jackson was subsequently appointed as its first commander. Based in Phuoc Tuy Province, South Vietnam, 1 ATF was involved in counter-insurgency operations against the Viet Cong. During his period in command the task force was successfully established at Nui Dat, clearing a security zone <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> and conducting offensive operations {{to the edge of}} the Tactical Area of Responsibility, while a number of significant actions were fought, including the Battle of Long Tan, which established 1 ATF's dominance over the province. Jackson was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his command of 1 ATF during this period.|$|E
50|$|This {{species of}} Doto has a cream {{coloured}} body with grey mottled markings {{on the back}} and sides. This pigment can vary from pale grey-brown to almost black in some individuals. The dark pigment forms rings <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of <b>the</b> cerata in well-marked specimens.|$|R
50|$|Stationed in Hawaii in , Patkin was {{pitching}} for {{a service}} team, and Joe DiMaggio homered off the lanky right-hander. In mock anger, Patkin threw his glove down then followed DiMaggio <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases,</b> much to <b>the</b> delight of the fans—and a career was born.|$|R
5000|$|Wrightstown and {{neighboring}} Cookstown {{were put in}} the national spotlight when six Islamic militants, dubbed [...] "The Fort Dix Six", were arrested while trying to carry out an attack against Fort Dix on May 7, 2007.
