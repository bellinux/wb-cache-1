This is mainly {{in the form of}} McDonald's top three stories of the week, which are discussed with the panel. Therefore, it is more akin to a traditional news broadcast rather than a talk show, but with a comic agenda.|$|E

Melua said in a statement: [...] "This album {{was going to be}} my 'singer's album'. I had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this one day; singing other people's songs brings something out of you and your voice that isn't perhaps where you would have gone vocally with your own material." ...|$|E

While working for The Walt Disney Company, Katzenberg suggested this idea to Michael Eisner, but he refused. The {{idea for the}} film was brought back at the formation of DreamWorks SKG in 1994, when Katzenberg's partners, Amblin Entertainment founder Steven Spielberg, and music producer David Geffen, were meeting in Spielberg's living room.

Christophe Beck, a regular {{composer}} for the series, filled in the overture and coda and composed [...] "Dawn's Ballet". Whedon {{is a fan of}} Stephen Sondheim, and used him as the inspiration for much of the music, particularly with the episode's ambiguous ending. Cast member James Marsters (Spike) said, [...] "Some of Joss' music is surprisingly complicated. Maybe it's a Beatles thing. He doesn't know enough to know what he can't do and he's smashing rules." ...|$|E

I first read about the Earth's Crust Displacement Theory in Graham Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods." [...] He and composer-producer Harald Kloser worked closely together, co-writing a spec script (also {{entitled}} 2012) which was marketed to studios in February2008.

500|$|The {{character}} of Phoebe Green was {{considered as a}} recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance.

I've <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a Scotland Yard detective who was a woman. I also thought it was an interesting chance to use Amanda Pays and make a villainess of her". Executive producer Robert Goodwin felt that the episode [...] "was a hard one. Any kind of a fire stunt is a major undertaking, because it involves so many overlapping things. It was a major feat, a real logical and creative feat, because you wanted it to look good".|$|E

Groundbreaking for the school occurred in 1959 on the medical center’s campus, and the first class of nurses was accepted in 1961. “We may sometimes wonder why the sisters embark on such great projects,” Camden Bishop Justin J. McCarthy said during the school’s groundbreaking ceremony. “They <b>always</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> great work for God.

500|$|The {{directors}} cast Nielsen for {{his ability}} to play like [...] "a fish in water", saying [...] "You could have cast funny people and done it with everybody winking, goofing off, and silly... we wanted people to be oblivious to the comedy." [...] For Nielsen, Airplane! marked a shift from dramatic roles to deadpan comedy. When it was suggested his role in Airplane! was against type, Nielsen protested that he had [...] "always been cast against type before", and that comedy was what he <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The same directors cast Nielsen in a similar style, in their TV series Police Squad!. The series introduced Nielsen as Frank Drebin, the stereotypical police officer modelled after serious characters in earlier police series.|$|E

500|$|The song is {{constructed}} in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a bridge before {{the third and}} fourth chorus, and uses a simple chord progression of Fm–C7. It opens with an introduction, which consists of the repeated use of the word la. The first verse follows, the lyrics are an international rally cry, targeted to a global market, as Melanie Chisholm described it: [...] "We <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a carnival tune and write a song for the world." [...] After the first verse, the group sings the pre-chorus and the chorus. The same pattern occurs, leading to the second chorus. A spoken bridge, in which the girls mention different dance styles,—flamenco, lambada, hip-hop, moonwalk, foxtrot, polka, salsa and haka—precedes the third chorus. The group closes the song repeating the chorus for a fourth time.|$|E

Allen described her as [...] "a naturally funny person. When {{she does a}} scene, you listen to her and look at her, and the prism through which it's all filtered is funny."

Clive Smith said of Nicholls: [...] "He is trying emotional blackmail, saying that Kauto Star would be better off staying at Ditcheat to be Clifford Baker's hack.

Reiner remembers, [...] "I {{was in the middle of}} my single life. I'd been divorced for a while. I'd been out a number of times, all these disastrous, confusing relationships one after another". The next time they all met, Reiner said that he had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a film about two people who become friends and do not have sex because they know it will ruin their relationship but have sex anyway. Ephron liked the idea, and Reiner acquired a deal at a studio.|$|E
500|$|American singer-songwriter Johnny Nash {{created a}} cover of [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] for his {{eleventh}} studio album, I Can See Clearly Now (1972). It was first used as the B-side to his previous single, [...] "There Are More Questions Than Answers", which was also released in 1972, and was produced by Nash. Rita Marley, Bob's wife, was upset that JAD Records lent the track for Nash to cover, as the label [...] "wanted to make a star out of Johnny Nash, not of Bob Marley". Additionally, Steve Sullivan (author of Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings, Volume 1) incorrectly claimed that Marley was commissioned to write [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] solely for Nash. However, Sullivan also writes {{that the success of}} Nash's version allotted Marley enough money to start his own record label, which he had <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The label was eventually created and became known as Tuff Gong.|$|E
500|$|Extraterrestrials {{make their}} first {{appearance}} in this episode, as Carter {{thought it would be}} a good moment to reveal them. The image of the alien was stretched in post-production to make it look taller and skinnier. The writers for the episode researched various abductee reports and conspiracy theories in order to get the right feel for the episode and make the aliens appear realistic and not [...] "fanciful". The episode makes several mentions to the Voyager program and the Voyager Golden Record; Mulder and Senator Matheson listen to Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F. First Movement while in the latter's office. The concerto's first movement is the first piece of music on the Voyager record. In addition, the episode relies heavily on mentions of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program, the collective name for a number of activities people undertake to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life. Morgan later explained, “I <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something with the SETI background. Hope that kids at school check out SETI, because it was factual as to what exists.” ...|$|E
