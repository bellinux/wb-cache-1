5|$|In August 1968, in an {{interview}} to Rolling Stone, Townsend talked about a new rock opera, which had the working title of Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy, and described the entire plot in great detail, which ran to 11 pages. Who biographer Dave Marsh subsequently said the interview described the narrative better than the finished album. Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as he felt it forced him to write the album according to that blueprint. The rest of the Who, however, were enthusiastic about the idea, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> have artistic control over the project.|$|E

5|$|In 1150, {{it looked}} like Caithness and the whole earldom of Orkney {{were going to come}} under {{permanent}} Scottish control. However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put a spanner in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unaware in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay fealty as a condition of his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the Orkney earldom of Harald's rival Erlend Haraldsson, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David's grant. David's weakness in Orkney was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared to stand back <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> reduce their power.|$|E

25|$|The {{trouble with}} our genial humorist {{is that he}} is beyond his depth. He would not make a success if he turned statesman.
