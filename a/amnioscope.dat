40|$|Polyhydramnios is {{associated}} with many serious maternal complications such as placental abruption or cord prolapse at rupture of membranes, uterine dysfunction at delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage. When considering uterine dysfunction caused by overstretched uterine muscles, active artificial amniotomy for more efficient labor {{seems to be a}} preferred obstetric management, but the potential adverse complications make obstetricians hesitate to perform this procedure. In such a challenging situation, a new strategy is required. We recently performed pinhole artificial amniotomy using an <b>amnioscope</b> in four women with polyhydramnios, not only to accelerate of labor but also to more slowly and safely reduce amniotic fluid volume. We had no complications using this procedure, and all women were able to have a vaginal delivery without postpartum hemorrhage and neonatal asphyxia. Pinhole artificial amniotomy using an <b>amnioscope</b> may be more convenient and safer than conventional artificial amniotomy. The significance of the <b>amnioscope</b> has been practically nil in modern obstetric management. In this pilot clinical study, we identified a new value for the <b>amnioscope</b> as a promising device for safer amniotomy in women with polyhydramnios...|$|E
40|$|Velamentous {{insertion}} of {{the umbilical cord}} is a high-risk obstetrical condition that is rarely diagnosed before delivery of the placenta. The fetal mortality rate from this condition has been estimated to {{be as high as}} 70 percent. Criteria used to aid in the diagnosis of this condition include (1) vaginal bleeding accompanied by fetal heart irregularities, (2) vaginal blood determined to be of fetal origin, (3) palpation of vasoprevia through a dilated cervix, (4) visualization of vasoprevia through the <b>amnioscope,</b> and (5) marked fetal bradycardia when the membranes are unruptured and {{there is no evidence of}} vaginal bleeding...|$|E
40|$|Background: This {{study was}} carried out to explore whether {{amnioscopy}} could help us to management of the uncertain date fetus to differ the prematurity from growth-restriction and assessment of post-term pregnancies as well. Notify the meconium staining of amniotic fluid is another aspect of amnioscopy, too. Study design: This was a descriptive study of 80 pregnant women from 2007 to 2008 at a university hospital, Tehran, Iran. The characteristics of amniotic fluid were documented on admission by inspection with transcervical amnioscopy, in all singleton pregnancies. Data were analyzed statistically. Results: Eighty women were admitted in labor {{during the study period}} and fulfilled the study inclusion criteria and had amniotic fluid evaluation available. Three pregnancies were uncertain date that managed according to <b>amnioscope</b> findings. Amniotic fluid were meconium stain in 22. 5 % (n = 18) and were clear 58. 7 % (n = 47) at amnioscopy and it was confirmed after delivery. Conclusion: This study suggests that amnioscopy is an easy and safe procedure for assessment of amniotic fluid characteristics. It could help us to differ prematurity (with vernix) from growth restriction(with yellowish or meconium staining). Further analysis will determine its role in the perinatal outcome...|$|E
