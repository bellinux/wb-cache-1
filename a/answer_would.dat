5|$|In an {{interview}} by Scholastic with Rick Riordan for The Lost Hero, Riordan was questioned about {{the whereabouts of}} Percy Jackson. The author hinted that the <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> be revealed as Jason's quest progressed. By {{the end of the}} book, he said that readers would have a good idea where the second book is going. On May 26, 2011, Riordan released both the cover art and the first chapter for The Son of Neptune confirming that Percy would {{play a role in the}} book.|$|E
5|$|An inflationary phase, an {{additional}} phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10−33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 {{to account for}} several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation {{have resulted in the}} first evidence for this scenario. However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations. An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An authoritative <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).|$|E

25|$|In Parliament, Prior-Palmer {{began his}} career by voting (along with many backbench Conservative MPs) against the large loan from the United States which the Labour {{government}} had negotiated {{after the end of}} Lend-Lease. However, these were the only dissenting votes he ever cast against the Conservative whip. In 1946 he argued for retaining conventional defence in addition to nuclear arms, because an <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> be found to the atomic bomb.|$|E
25|$|The {{presidency}} of Laurel understandably {{remains one of}} the most controversial in Philippine history. After the war, he would be denounced by the pro American sectors as a war collaborator or even a traitor, although his indictment for treason was superseded by President Roxas' Amnesty Proclamation. However, despite being one of the most infamous figures in Philippine history, he is also regarded as a Pan-Asianist who supported independence. When asked if he was pro American or pro Japanese, his <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> be pro Filipino.|$|E

25|$|The other janitor, Shawna Ornt, who {{witnessed}} the two men fleeing the parking lot eventually testified under oath that she had told the prosecutor that the man she saw {{the night of the}} murder was not Ferguson. She claims Crane repeatedly tried to get her to implicate him and that he became threatening during his last conversation with her. Despite being the sole witness who reported that she could identify the men at the scene, Shawna Ornt was never asked in court if she could identify Ferguson. Zellner alleged that the prosecution did not ask her to identify Ferguson because they knew her <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> hurt their case.|$|E
25|$|The {{school with}} the most {{aggregate}} points {{at the end of}} the week is the winner, progressing to the semi-finals and then the Grand Final. The winning school on any one day does not compete for more points or prizes, and should there be a tie it need not be broken. However, should there be a tie after the week, a tie breaker would be given out for the Friday's teams. The team that gives the correct answer gets 10 points for their team and go through to the next round. An incorrect <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> lose them 10 points and the opposing team go through instead.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether Kiya ever used the rich funerary equipment that was prepared against her death. If her disappearance resulted from disgrace or exile, the <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> be no. On the other hand, if {{she died in}} good standing with Akhenaten, she probably would have received a lavish burial appropriate to her station. In the latter case, a likely site for her interment would be the Amarna Royal Tomb, which includes a suite of three chambers evidently used to house female members of Akhenaten's family. At least two and possibly {{as many as three}} different individuals were interred in this suite, including Akhenaten's daughter Meketaten, the only one whose name survives. Two of the chambers originally included painted plaster reliefs depicting Akhenaten, Nefertiti, certain of their daughters, and other mourners lamenting the deceased. Some Egyptologists have suggested that one of these scenes of mourning refers to Kiya, although no specific evidence supports this claim.|$|E

5000|$|Garagiola read a {{statement}} (e.g., [...] "How he shows affection"), and each contestant {{would have to}} raise his hand. The first three to raise their hands would say a one- or two-word <b>answer,</b> which Garagiola <b>would</b> ask them to explain. The <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> then be read {{one at a time}} over the phone, and the off-stage partner would have to ring in if she thought her partner had said it. If the first person to ring in was correct, the couple won 25 points. If she was wrong, the couple lost 10 points, as did the team which originally gave the answer. Each of the three <b>answers</b> <b>would</b> be read in random order. During the all-celebrity format, the off-stage partner would have to not only ring in for the correct answer, but also relate the same explanation or story about the answer as the on-stage partner to get the points; otherwise they lost 10 points.|$|R
500|$|A popular Greek legend turned Alexander the Great's sister, Thessalonike, into a mermaid {{after her}} death, {{living in the}} Aegean. She would ask the sailors on any ship she would {{encounter}} only one question: [...] "Is King Alexander alive?" [...] ( [...] ;"), to which the correct answer was: [...] "He lives and reigns and conquers the world" [...] (Greek: [...] "Ζει και βασιλεύει και τον κόσμον κυριεύει"). [...] This <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> please her, and she would accordingly calm the waters and bid the ship farewell.

500|$|Alexander {{features}} {{prominently in}} modern Greek folklore, {{more so than}} any other ancient figure. The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek ("O Megalexandros") is a household name, {{and he is the}} only ancient hero to appear in the Karagiozis shadow play. One well-known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ship's prow during a storm and ask the captain [...] "Is King Alexander alive?" [...] The correct answer is [...] "He is alive and well and rules the world!" [...] causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm. Any other <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> cause the mermaid to turn into a raging Gorgon who would drag the ship {{to the bottom of the}} sea, all hands aboard.|$|E

[...] A null value indicates a lack of a value - a lack of a value is not the same thing as a value of zero in the same way that a lack of an answer is not the same thing as an answer of [...] "no". [...] For example, consider the question [...] "How many books does Adam own?" [...] The answer may be [...] "zero" [...] (we know that he owns none) or [...] "null" [...] (we do not know how many he owns).

500|$|According to Ocias, {{the main}} themes of Loved were of {{dominance}} and power, but {{to provide a}} fuller <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> [...] "defy {{the point of the}} game". His intentions in making the game were to get people to think about the games they were playing—a direction he found much of the video game industry shying away from. The confrontational aspect of the game was motivated by two aspects: primarily to use [...] "the resource of emotions" [...] invoked by its risk and reward mechanic; and secondly to absorb the awareness of people online. Expanding upon his inspirations, Ocias cited individual games such as The Last Guardian and , along with companies such as Thatgamecompany and Eidos Montréal, as showing [...] "greater depth" [...] to video games as well as experimentation and research. Ocias ultimately stated that while he dislikes [...] "force-feeding" [...] players, he would try to take a different approach both mechanically and thematically for his next game.|$|E
500|$|While {{acknowledging}} the privileged position whites had under Smith, several commentators have latterly agreed with his claims that many black Zimbabweans preferred him to Mugabe with hindsight. [...] "Smith's image improved inversely as Mugabe's plummeted," [...] Johnson wrote. [...] "When {{he walked the}} streets of Harare, Africans would almost queue up to grasp his hand and wish him well." [...] "If you were to go to Harare today [...] and ask ordinary black Zimbabweans who they would rather have as their leader—Smith or Mugabe—the <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> be almost unanimous," [...] Boynton asserted; [...] "And {{it would not be}} Mugabe." [...] Smith's death prompted strongly condemnatory reports in Zimbabwe's state media. The Deputy Minister of Information Bright Matonga accused Smith of being a racist, blamed him for the deaths of thousands and asserted that he would [...] "not be mourned or missed here by any decent person". Reactions from Zimbabweans on the street were mixed, however; according to Western journalists, many expressed sadness.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team depicted {{reality in}} the world of Never 7 as subjective and relative rather than absolute. As such, for each route, that route's history is the only one Makoto knows and the only one that is real to him; the Curé syndrome only exists to him in the routes where it is mentioned. The bells were used as symbols for reality being relative, and were described by the development team as [...] "vague existences", saying that one cannot know if they exist or not. In the bad ending to Izumi's route, the bells, which [...] "should be fictional" [...] remain while something that should exist disappears; this was a metaphor for the idea that delusions become reality while reality becomes a delusion. The game's title comes from how Makoto is unable to escape the infinite loop and reach April 7, and how most of the seven characters die {{at some point during the}} game. It is also based on the belief that 7 is a lucky number. The game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations, a design philosophy that was carried over to later entries in the series and was part of what led to Infinity being chosen as the series title. One example of the openness to interpretation was that development team did not want to confirm or deny whether the game's world was connected to that of the Memories Off series, saying that while characters with similar names may appear, they wanted to leave the player to decide for themselves what the <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> be.|$|E
