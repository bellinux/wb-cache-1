The theoretical section contains a theoretical estimation of spectral density and its theoretical substantiation. Further, {{we assume that the}} spectrum is constant. We have also made an intermediate conclusion that the estimation of spectral density will be ergodic if the two conditions are simultaneously satisfied.

40|$|Biomass {{energy is}} {{increasingly}} {{used to reduce}} the dependence on fossil fuels and reduce the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming. Fluidized bed gasification converts solid biomass into gaseous fuels {{that can be used}} for combustion or liquid fuels synthesis. The efficiency of biomass gasification is directly affected by the fluidized bed hydrodynamics. For example, the solids recirculation rate through the system is an important parameter that affects the heat and mass transfer rates. In this study, a cold model of a dual fluidized bed (DFB) biomass gasification plant was designed using scaling laws, and was constructed to investigate the hydrodynamics of industrial DFBs. A DFB consists of a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB), where biomass is gasified to produce syngas, and a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) where the residues of gasification are combusted. The investigation was divided into Phase I and II. In Phase I, an operational map was developed for the CFB to define operational boundaries for steady state operation of the plant. An empirical model was developed to predict the solids mass flow rate out of the CFB riser, which is an empirical function of the exit opening width, the CFB diameter, and a newly introduced <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>factor.</b> The correlation coefficient, R 2 for the empirical function was 0. 8327. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>factor</b> accounts for the particle inertia and clustering effects at the exit of the CFB riser. Results from Phase I also showed that increasing the fluidizing velocities increased the solids circulation rate and affected the pressure drop over various points in the CFB plant due to redistribution of solids with the system. A critical assessment was performed on published correlations found in the literature to determine how accurately they predicted the hydrodynamics in the CFB riser. By comparing predicted and experimental results, the correlations were found to be inaccurate for the conditions and configuration of the CFB tested in this study. For example, the solids velocity was not accurately predicted by published correlations due to unaccounted particle clustering effects. The main issue with the published correlations was a lack of generality, so that the correlations only applied for predicting fluidizing behaviour in the equipment they were developed in. In Phase II, an operational map was developed for the DFB, which incorporated both the CFB and the BFB. Experiments with a binary mixture representing sand and char in an industrial gasifier showed a blocking effect in the connecting chute between the CFB and BFB by the material representing char, which was larger and less dense than the material representing sand. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based design tool for modelling the cold model CFB cyclone was developed and validated by comparing the predicted and experimental cyclone pressure drop. The correlation coefficient for the CFD pressure drop prediction was 0. 7755. The design tool contained information about the grid resolution and the time step required for modelling the cyclone accurately...|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} view of {{aeolian sand}} transport generally estimates flux {{from the perspective}} of aerodynamic forces creating the airborne grain population, although it has been recognized that "reptation" causes {{a significant part of the}} total airborne flux; reptation involves both ballistic injection of grains into the air stream by the impact of saltating grains as well as the "nudging" of surface grains into a creeping motion. Whilst aerodynamic forces may initiate sand motion, it is proposed here that within a fully-matured grain cloud, flux is actually governed by two thresholds: an aerodynamic threshold, and a bed-dilatancy threshold. It is the latter which controls the reptation population, and its significance increases proportionally with transport energy. Because we only have experience with terrestrial sand transport, extrapolations of aeolian theory to Mars and Venus have adjusted only the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>factor,</b> taking gravitational forces and atmospheric density as the prime variables in the aerodynamic equations, but neglecting reptation. The basis for our perspective on the importance of reptation and bed dilatancy is a set of experiments that were designed to simulate sand transport across the surface of a martian dune. Using a modified sporting crossbow in which a sand-impelling sabot replaced the bolt-firing mechanism, individual grains of sand were fired at loose sand targets with glancing angles typical of saltation impact; grains were projected at about 80 m/s to simulate velocities commensurate with those predicted for extreme martian aeolian conditions. The sabot impelling method permitted study of individual impacts without the masking effect of bed mobilization encountered in wind-tunnel studies. At these martian impact velocities, grains produced small craters formed by the ejection of several hundred grains from the bed. Unexpectedly, the craters were not elongated, despite glancing impact; the craters were very close to circular in planform. High-speed photography showed them to grow in both diameter and depth after the impactor had ricochetted from the crater site. The delayed response of the bed was "explosive" in nature, and created a miniature ejecta curtain spreading upward and outward for many centimeters for impact of 100 - 300 micron-diameter grains into similar material. Elastic energy deposited in the bed by the impacting grain creates a subsurface stress regime or "quasi-Boussinesq" compression field. Elastic recovery of the bed occurs by dilatancy; shear stresses suddenly convert the grains from closed to open packing, and grains are consequently able to eject themselves forcefully from the impact site. Random jostling of the grains causes radial homogenization of stress vectors and a resulting circular crater. There is a great temptation to draw parallels with cratering produced by meteorite impacts, but a rigorous search for common modelling ground between the two phenomena has not been conducted at this time. For every impact of an aerodynamically energized grain, there are several hundred grains ejected into the wind for the high-energy transport that might occur on Mars. Many of these grains will themselves become subject to the boundary layer's aerodynamic lift forces (their motion will not immediately die and add to the creep population), and these grains will become indistinguishable from those lifted entirely by aerodynamic forces. As each grain impacts the bed, it will eject even more grains into the flow. A cascading effect will take place, but because it must be finite in its growth, damping will occur as the number of grains set in motion causes mid-air collisions that prevent much of the impact energy from reaching the surface of the bed -thus creating a dynamic equilibrium in a high-density saltation cloud. It is apparent that for a given impact energy, the stress field permits a smaller volume of grains to convert to open packing as the size of the bed grains increases, or as the energy of the "percussive" grain decreases (by decrease in velocity or mass). Thus, the mass of the "repercussive" grain population that is ejected from the impact site becomes a function of the scale of the stress field in relation to the scale of the bed material (self-similarity being applicable if both bed size and energy are simultaneously adjusted). In other words, in a very high energy aeolian system where an aerodynamically raised grain can ballistically raise many more grains, the amount of material lifted into the wind becomes largely a function of a dilatancy threshold. If this threshold is exceeded, grains are repercussively injected into the saltation cloud. The "dilatancy threshold" may be defined in terms of the saltation percussive force required to convert the bed, through elastic response, from a closed to an open packing system. If open packing cannot be created, the grains cannot escape from the impact site, even though the elastic deformation and percussive force may be able to reorganize the grains with respect to one another. As the crossbow experiments showed, for an ever-increasing bed grain size, a point is reached when no material can be moved because the energy of the percussive grain is insufficient to dilate the relatively coarse bed. Although this seems to be stating the obvious [...] that too little energy will not cause the bed to splash [...] the consequences of exceeding the "splash threshold" by dilatancy are not so obvious for high-energy aeolian transport. It is noted that the force required to elastically dilate the bed has to overcome Coulombic grain attractions such as dipole-dipole coupling, dielectric, monopole, contact-induced dipole attractions, van der Waals forces, molecular monolayer capillary forces, as well as the mechanical interlocking frictional resistance of the grains. On Mars, it is predicted that the dilatancy threshold may be the prime control of grain flux. Additional information is contained in the original...|$|E

40|$|Aerodynamic {{roughness}} length (z(0)) {{is one of}} the main parameters for describing aerodynamic characteristics and turbulence exchange of underlying surfaces. It also plays a very important role in land surface fluxes simulation and atmospheric boundary layer studies. In fluxes and atmospheric numerical simulation models, z(0) is usually considered as a simple parameter related to rough elements, while actually z(0) is the result of <b>aerodynamic</b> and thermal <b>factors</b> and rough elements. Some researchers on z(0) established a model to calculate effective roughness at TM pixel scale. But in the model, the length of the fetch is simply considered as 100 times of the highest measuring height, which results in much uncertainty of the model. With the development of eddy covariance observations and the footprint theory, fetch could be determined with more accurate footprint model. This paper aims to make an improvement for the model basing on footprint model, and clarify the relationship between z(0) and air temperature, wind speed and geometric roughness. Firstly meteorological data in two different levels was obtained to calculate z(0) and the calculated z(0) was considered as the real value, and then the fetch length was calculated by FSAM footprint model. Secondly LAI was retrieved from TM image to calculate geometric roughness. Thirdly drag coefficient was taken into the roughness calculation model, and then a roughness calculation model was established with footprint model and LAI, vegetation height, atmospheric stratifications and drag coefficient. The result indicated that z(0) is the function of thermal and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>factors,</b> and the reason for roughness dynamic was interpreted thoroughly. The quantitative relationship between rough elements and <b>aerodynamic</b> and thermal <b>factors</b> is clarified, and a more accurate model for retrieving z(0) at TM pixel scale could be established with the fetch determined by footprint...|$|R

Improvements in lift/drag ratio, specific fuel consumption, structural weight <b>factor,</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> improvements (laminar flow control, increased wing aspect ratio, drag reduction for specified lift, propulsion efficiency, higher bypass ratios, composite structures) are discussed along with V/STOL, controllable twist rotors, circulation control rotors, variable-cycle engines, and higher structural efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|The <b>aerodynamic</b> {{and mass}} <b>factors</b> {{governing}} lateral stability are discussed and formulas are given for their estimation. Relatively simple {{relationships between the}} governing factors and the resulting stability characteristics are presented. A series of charts is included with which approximate stability characteristics may be rapidly estimated. The effects of the various governing factors upon the stability characteristics are discussed in detail. It is pointed out that much additional research is necessary both to correlate stability characteristics with riding, flying, and handling qualities and to provide suitable data for accurate estimates of those characteristics of an airplane while {{it is in the}} design stage...|$|R
40|$|Some {{widely held}} beliefs {{concerning}} the practicability of rigid airships in air carrier operations are discussed. It {{is shown by}} a review of past operational experience, and some basic aerostatic theory, their actual record {{and the reasons for}} their demise. Problems of atmospheric density and temperature variations, meteorological <b>factors,</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> stability and control, and mooring difficulties are discussed and related to actual case histories. Structural and flight efficiencies are compared to airplane efficiencies for airplanes contemporary with the zeppelin as well as modern designs. The difficulty of supporting new, commercial airship developments on an economic basis is made clear...|$|R
