40|$|International audienceAmong Aspergillus species, Aspergillus fumigatus is {{responsible}} for various pulmonary diseases ranging from chronic and/or immuno-allergic forms in immunocompetent host, to severe invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patient. Triazole antifungals are the mainstay of therapy for aspergillosis, as first-line treatment for IA (voriconazole), or for prophylaxis. Over the past decade, the emergence of clinical and environmental azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates {{has been reported in}} Europe, threatening the <b>azole</b> effectiveness for treatment of aspergillosis. The main mechanism of resistance is the occurrence of mutations in cyp 51 A gene, encoding the <b>azole</b> target enzyme (14 α-demethylase). Two hypothesis for <b>azole</b> resistance emergence are debated: <b>azole</b> resistance following long periods of <b>azole</b> treatment in the clinical setting, and an environmental origin related to the extended use of <b>azole</b> fungicides in agriculture. Thus, a reliable screening of resistant isolates is required in laboratories to improve the clinical management of IA patients with resistant strain, at high risk of treatment failure. Here, we successively review the current epidemiology, molecular mechanisms and clinical implication of Aspergillus <b>azole</b> resistance. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SA...|$|R
40|$|Infections {{caused by}} the {{filamentous}} fungus Aspergillus fumigatus are a significant clinical issue and represent the second most-common form of fungal infection. <b>Azole</b> drugs are effective against this pathogen but resistant isolates are being found more frequently. Infections associated with <b>azole</b> resistant A. fumigatus have a significantly increased mortality making understanding drug resistance in this organism a priority. The target of <b>azole</b> drugs is the lanosterol α- 14 demethylase enzyme encoded by the cyp 51 A gene in A. fumigatus.

25|$|The {{virulence}} factors {{implicated in}} E. rostratum pathogenicity {{are not well}} established. E. rostratum is a melanized fungus capable of thriving at mammalian temperatures. In other pathogenic fungi, melanin is a well established virulence factor thought to contribute to virulence by protecting the organism against the immune system of the host. Melanin production has also been associated with drug resistance to polyenes and echinocandins but not to <b>azoles,</b> which is why voriconanole is effective at treating fungal infections.|$|E
25|$|For comparison, {{another group}} of <b>azoles</b> is the triazoles, which {{includes}} fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. The difference between the imidazoles and the triazoles involves the mechanism of inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme. The N3 of the imidazole compound binds to the heme iron atom of ferric cytochrome P450, whereas the N4 of the triazoles bind to the heme group. The triazoles {{have been shown to}} have a higher specificity for the cytochrome P450 than imidazoles, thereby making them more potent than the imidazoles.|$|E
2500|$|Effective {{clinical}} {{treatments of}} infections caused by Exserohilum {{are still very}} scarce. Recent cases of sinusitis and cutaneous infections report successful results when treated with amphotericin B, itraconazole and/or voriconazole. Although E. rostratum is sensitive to amphotericin B, a common antifungal agent, the severe and potentially lethal side-effects of this drug have limited its use in certain patients, particularly those of older age. A recent drug repurposing screening of antifungal agents suggests the triazoles posaconazole and lanoconazole as useful alternative agents for treating E. rostratum infection. Posaconazole is highly potent and can be taken orally for the prolonged treatment of non-CNS infections like septic joints. It {{has also been shown}} to cross the blood-brain barrier and thus has potential as a treatment for CNS infections as well, though not reaching levels as high as the <b>azoles.</b>|$|E
40|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Aspergillus fumigatus causes {{serious illness}} and often death when it invades tissues, especially in immuno-compromised individuals. The <b>azole</b> class of drugs {{is the most}} commonly prescribed treatment for many fungal infections and acts on the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. One commonmechanism of acquired <b>azole</b> drug resistance in fungi is the preven-tion of drug accumulation to toxic levels in the cell. While drug efflux is a well-known resistance strategy, reduced <b>azole</b> import would be another strategy to maintain low intracellular <b>azole</b> levels. Recently, <b>azole</b> uptake in Candida albicans and other yeasts was analyzed using [3 H]fluconazole. Defective drug import was suggested to be a potential mechanism of drug resistance in sev-eral pathogenic fungi, including Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida krusei, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have adapted and developed an assay to measure <b>azole</b> accumulation in A. fumigatus using radioactively labeled <b>azole</b> drugs, based on previous work done with C. albicans. We used this assay to study the differences in <b>azole</b> uptake in A. fumigatus isolates {{under a variety of}} drug treatment conditions, with different morphologies and with a select mutant strain with deficiencies in the sterol uptake and biosynthesis pathway. We conclude that <b>azole</b> drugs are specifically selected and imported into the fungal cell by a pH- and ATP-independent facilitated diffusionmechanism, not by passive diffusion. This method of drug transport is likely to be conserved across most fungal species. The fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the mostcommon andubiquitous environmentalmolds.

50|$|<b>Azoles</b> are a {{class of}} five-membered heterocyclic {{compounds}} containing a nitrogen atom {{and at least one}} other non-carbon atom (i.e. nitrogen, sulfur, or oxygen) as part of the ring. Their names originate from the Hantzsch-Widman nomenclature. The parent compounds are aromatic and have two double bonds; there are successively reduced analogs (azolines and azolidines) with fewer. One, and only one, lone pair of electrons from each heteroatom in the ring is part of the aromatic bonding in an azole. Names of <b>azoles</b> maintain the prefix upon reduction (e.g., pyrazoline, pyrazolidine). The numbering of ring atoms in <b>azoles</b> starts with the heteroatom that is not part of a double bond, and then proceeds towards the other heteroatom.|$|E

40|$|Antifungal {{susceptibility}} {{testing of}} molds has been standardized in Europe {{and in the}} United States. Aspergillus fumigatus strains with resistance to <b>azole</b> drugs have recently been detected and the underlying molecular mechanisms of resistance characterized. Three hundred and ninety-three isolates, including 32 itraconazole-resistant strains, were used to define wild-type populations, epidemiological cutoffs, and cross-resistance between <b>azole</b> drugs. The epidemiological cutoff for itraconazole, voriconazole, and ravuconazole for the wild-type populations of A. fumigatus was ≤ 1 mg/liter. For posaconazole, the epidemiological cutoff was ≤ 0. 25 mg/liter. Up till now, isolates susceptible to itraconazole have not yet displayed resistance to other <b>azole</b> drugs. Cross-resistance between <b>azole</b> drugs depends on specific mutations in cyp 51 A. Thus, a substitution of glycine in position 54 of Cyp 51 A confers cross-resistance between itraconazole and posaconazole.

40|$|Background. <b>Azole</b> {{resistance}} is an emerging problem in Aspergillus fumigatus and complicates the manage-ment {{of patients with}} Aspergillus-related diseases. Selection of <b>azole</b> resistance may occur through exposure to <b>azole</b> fungicides in the environment. In the Netherlands a surveillance network was used to investigate the epidemiology of resistance selection in A. fumigatus. Methods. Clinical A. fumigatus isolates were screened for <b>azole</b> resistance in 8 university hospitals using <b>azole</b> agar dilution plates. Patient information was collected using an online questionnaire and azole-resistant A. fumiga-tus isolates were analyzed using gene sequencing, susceptibility testing, and genotyping. Air sampling was per-formed to investigate the presence of resistant isolates in hospitals and domiciles. Results. Between December 2009 and January 2011, 1315 A. fumigatus isolates from 921 patients were screened. A new cyp 51 A-mediated resistance mechanism (TR 46 /Y 121 F/T 289 A) was observed in 21 azole-resistant isolates from 15 patients in 6 hospitals.

40|$|Invasive {{fungal infections}} are {{associated}} with significant morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients. Not only are transplant recipients more susceptible to these infections due to their immunocompromised state, but treatment itself can pose its own challenges. <b>Azole</b> antifungals are frequently chosen to prevent or treat these infections. Concomitant use of <b>azole</b> antifungals and immunosuppressants such as calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors can result in clinically significant drug interactions since <b>azole</b> antifungals inhibit cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450) enzymes that metabolize these immunosuppressants. Anticipation of these interactions enables clinicians to use these agents together and minimize toxicities and/ or supratherapeutic immunosuppressant concentrations when initiating <b>azole</b> antifungal therapy. When the <b>azole</b> antifungal is discontinued, awareness of the drug-drug interactions can prevent sub-therapeutic immunosuppressant concentrations. 1 In this article, we offer strategies for managing these clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions.
