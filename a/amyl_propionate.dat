5000|$|Pentyl {{propanoate}} (also {{known as}} <b>amyl</b> <b>propionate)</b> is an organic ester {{formed by the}} condensation of pentan-1-ol and propanoic acid. [...] It is a colorless liquid with an apple-like odor, that floats on water.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of 51 volatile compounds, among alcohols and esters in Brazilian sugar-cane spirit (cachaça), were investigated by high-resolution gas chromatography (HRGC). The following alcohols and esters {{were identified and}} quantified: methanol, 1, 4 -butanodiol, 2 -phenylethyl alcohol, amyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, cynamic alcohol, n-decanol, geraniol, isoamyl alcohol, isobutanol, menthol, n-butanol, n-dodecanol, n-propanol, n-tetradecanol, <b>amyl</b> <b>propionate,</b> ethyl acetate, ethyl benzoate, ethyl heptanoate, isoamyl valerate, methyl propionate, propyl butyrate. The average higher alcohols content (262 mg/ 100 mL in anhydrous alcohol a. a.) and total esters content (24 mg/ 100 mL a. a.) in cachaças, are smaller than in other spirits. The average methanol content in cachaças (6 mg/ 100 mL a. a.) {{is the same as}} in rum, but smaller than in wine spirit. No qualitative differences of chemical profile among cachaças have been observed...|$|E
