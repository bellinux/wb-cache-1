We want to explore what the consequences of having specific goals for social life in a city are, and what this means for its citizens, and for a city. To procure an understanding of these goals, we have examined Jan Gehl and his ideas of the human city. Furthermore we have included philosopher and sociologist Henri Lefebvre, and his visualization of the city and how urban life is procreated. And lastly to acquire an understanding of life on the street, we have examined Michel De Certeau and his theories of walking in the city. To provide an understanding of the city and the project revolving Vester Voldgade, we have performed a mapping method, handed out surveys at Vester Voldgade, and interviewed experts in various fields relating to urban planning, and the city in general. We have done so, in pursuit of a versatile foundation for our further research. The three theories and our empirical data have been put to use in an analysis of Vester Voldgade and a discussion of the good city and its physical space. We have done so to find out, if providing the physical framework for urban life is enough, or if there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things,</b> <b>you</b> cannot plan...|$|E
