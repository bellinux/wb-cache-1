5|$|In 1828, Ernest {{was staying}} with the King at Windsor Castle when severe {{disturbances}} broke out in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland, and returned to Berlin in August, believing that the Government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly with the Irish. In January 1829, the Wellington Government {{announced that it would}} introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned to London, {{and was one of the}} leaders against the Catholic Relief Act 1829, influencing King George <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> Within days of his arrival, the King instructed the officers of his Household to vote <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill.</b> Hearing of this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted Wellington's resignation, and Ernest attempted to put together a government united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a government would have considerable support in the House of Lords, it would have little support in the Commons, and Ernest abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The bill passed the Lords and became law.|$|E
5|$|Key has a mixed {{voting record}} on social issues: for example, in 2004 he voted <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> {{creating}} civil unions, stating that, while he personally supports such unions, he acted {{in accordance with}} his electorate's views. However, in 2005, Key {{was part of a}} large bloc of MPs voting to defeat a bill that defined marriage as being {{between a man and a}} woman. Key stated in 2008 that he did not oppose gay adoption. In 2013 he expressed support for same-sex marriage and voted for the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Bill {{was then}} sent {{up to the}} House of Lords, a {{majority}} in which {{was known to be}} hostile to it. After the Whigs' decisive victory in the 1831 election, some speculated that opponents would abstain, rather than openly defy the public will. Indeed, when the Lords voted on the second reading of the bill after a memorable series of debates, many Tory peers did refrain from voting. However, the Lords Spiritual mustered in unusually large numbers, and of 22 present, 21 voted <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill.</b> It failed by 41 votes.|$|E

He returned the interception 26 {{yards for a}} touchdown, his first career score for the Jaguars. His performance <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> earned him AFC Defensive Player of the Week honors. Smith would finish the season with 128 tackles and 2.5 sacks in addition to <b>the</b> interception <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bills.</b> He was ranked 83rd on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.|$|R

5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{had wanted}} to {{organize}} the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this. Pierce was skeptical of the bill, knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North. Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless. It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator Salmon P. Chase and Massachusetts' Charles Sumner, who rallied public sentiment in the North <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase, moves towards Cuba annexation, {{and the influence of}} slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression. The result was a political firestorm that did great damage to Pierce's presidency.|$|E
5|$|A plan {{to fill in}} {{a section}} of the canal in Nottingham {{resulted}} in a number of letters appearing in the local press in 1963, and a student at Kesteven College produced a report {{on the state of the}} canal, which was presented to the Grantham Civic Society. In 1970, the British Waterways Board attempted to obtain an act of parliament which would have allowed them to cease maintaining the water levels of the canal. The Inland Waterways Association campaigned <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> and the clause was amended. The Grantham Canal Society was formed soon afterwards, to promote restoration of the waterway. In 1974, a National Boat Rally was held at Nottingham, to gain support for the restoration scheme, and to promote the idea of a new link to the Trent, which would pass through old gravel workings.|$|E

5|$|On 22 July 1847 {{the company}} {{acquired}} {{control of the}} Paisley and Renfrew Railway under the Paisley & Renfrew Railway Sale and Improvement Act. ,. The purchase had earlier been agreed by the proposed Paisley, Barrhead and Hurlet Railway, supported by the GPK, for £34,000. It was horse-operated and had a track gauge of 4ft4in (1,321mm). The line was loss-making and had no practical value other than the tactical one of securing territory against competing companies. The Paisley Barrhead and Hurlet Bill failed in the 1847 session of Parliament and was re-presented in 1848; the share capital proposed had risen to £230,000; during the Lords' hearings it became plain that running powers {{were likely to be}} granted to the Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, an offshoot of the Caledonian Railway. The GPK had subscribed to £150,000 in face value of the shares of this proposed line, with the sole intention of excluding the Caledonian Railway from the area. The GPK now petitioned <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill,</b> but this was unsuccessful, and it received the Royal Assent, with the running powers clause, on 31 August 1848.|$|E
5|$|The brutal {{repression}} backfired to some extent. The Fasci leaders {{used the}} military tribunals to make impassioned and well-reported speeches in their defence. The tribunals were too repressive and revolted the Liberal consciences of many Northern Italians. In {{an attempt to}} regain his former 'left wing', Crispi introduced a bill in July 1894 to take over large estates and uncultivated land. The idea was to rent out the land on long leases in medium-sized holdings and leaseholders would be given reduced credit and tax concessions. While the bill failed to convince the Radicals and democrats of Crispi's good intentions, it angered the Sicilian landowners. After {{the suppression of the}} Fasci those were now unwilling to make any concessions. Under the leadership of Di Rudiní, they battled <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> When Crispi fell from power after Adwa in March 1896, their proponent Di Rudiní became Prime Minister and the Sicilian landowners were safe.|$|E
5|$|This season focuses {{primarily}} on the show's main protagonist, Senior Sergeant Tom Croydon, his failing health and his personal troubles. John Wood, who portrays Croydon, is the only actor to appear in every episode of Blue Heelers and is, indisputably, the pillar of the show. The final episode of the thirteenth season aired as a 2-hour, movie-length tribute starting with an introduction from John Wood, and concluding with a compilation of Blue Heelers moments from over its 13-season run. For this thirteenth season, Blue Heelers was moved from its primetime Wednesday-night timeslot to the lower rating Saturday-night timeslot, which saw it come up <b>against</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bill,</b> a British police drama which has become quite popular in Australia. Ratings for this season, partially due to the series' move to its lower-rating timeslot, were relatively low; ratings were around the 1.2 million viewer mark, increasing to 1.5 million for the finale. Blue Heelers failed to even {{make it into the}} top 20 programmes at any time during its thirteenth season.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} week, Henry {{was passed}} on the depth chart by Sammy Morris and Brock Forsey.

He was activated in Week 13 <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bills,</b> carrying <b>the</b> ball two times for five yards and losing the only fumble of his career.|$|R

50|$|Coming {{off their}} win in Buffalo <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bills,</b> <b>the</b> Patriots {{returned}} to Foxborough {{to host the}} Denver Broncos. This was the 13th Brady-Manning meeting between quarterbacks since 2001, and the 17th overall meeting between Manning and the Patriots.|$|R
5|$|Fillmore sent {{a special}} message to Congress on August 6, 1850, {{disclosing}} {{the letter from}} Governor Bell and his reply, warning that armed Texans would be viewed as intruders, and urging Congress to defuse sectional tensions by passing the Compromise. Without the Great Triumvirate of John C. Calhoun, Webster and Clay who had long dominated the Senate, Douglas and others led that body towards the administration-backed package of bills. Each bill passed the Senate {{with the support of}} the section that wanted it, plus a few members who were determined to see all the bills passed. The battle then moved to the House, which had a Northern majority because of population. Most contentious was the Fugitive Slave Bill, whose provisions were anathema to abolitionists. Fillmore applied pressure to get Northern Whigs to abstain rather than oppose, including New Yorkers—threatening to kill the renomination of Congressman Abraham Schermerhorn of Rochester, whose constituents included Frederick Douglass, if he voted <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> Through the legislative process, various changes were made, including the setting of a boundary between New Mexico Territory and Texas—the state would be given a payment to settle any claims. California was admitted as a free state, the District slave trade was ended, and the final status of slavery in New Mexico and Utah would be settled later. Fillmore signed the bills as they reached his desk, holding the Fugitive Slave Bill for two days until he received a favorable opinion as to its constitutionality from the new Attorney General, John J. Crittenden. Although some Northerners were unhappy at the Fugitive Slave Act, relief was widespread, as was the hope this would settle the slavery question.|$|E
5|$|The new senator {{took his}} seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, James C. Jones, had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without {{his wife and}} family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson {{immediately}} set about introducing the Homestead Bill in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded Republican Party), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who {{took advantage of the}} provisions of the Homestead Bill {{were more likely to be}} Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30–22. In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners. Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it.|$|E
