25|$|The {{mechanical}} {{advantage of the}} brake lever must be matched to the brake it is connected to {{in order for the}} rider to have sufficient leverage and travel to <b>actuate</b> the brake. Using mismatched brakes and levers could result in too much {{mechanical advantage}} and hence not enough travel to properly <b>actuate</b> the brake (v-brakes with conventional levers) or too little mechanical advantage, requiring a very strong pull to apply the brakes hard (v-brake levers with other types of brake).|$|E

40|$|A non-collinear valve {{actuator}} includes a primary <b>actuating</b> {{system and a}} return spring system with each applying forces to a linkage system in order to regulate the flow of a quarter-turn valve. The primary <b>actuating</b> system and return spring system are positioned non-collinearly, which simply means the primary <b>actuating</b> system and return spring system are not in line with each other. By positioning the primary <b>actuating</b> system and return spring system in this manner, the primary <b>actuating</b> system can undergo a larger stroke while the return spring system experiences significantly less displacement. This allows {{the length of the}} return spring to be reduced due to the minimization of displacement thereby reducing the weight of the return spring system. By allowing the primary <b>actuating</b> system to undergo longer strokes, the weight of the primary <b>actuating</b> system may also be reduced. Accordingly, the weight of the non-collinear {{valve actuator}} is reduced...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modelling and design pro-cess of a two link passively <b>actuated</b> robot manipula-tor with a blockable {{degree of freedom}} and describes the experimental setup of the overall mechanical sys-tem. The mathematical description uses the Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) formulation in order to handle the equations of motion with inequality con-straints. The different components of the robot, espe-cially the exchangeable <b>actuated</b> and passively <b>actuated</b> joint-modules, are addressed in detail. The robot ma-nipulator serves as an experimental platform for the verification of control strategies of passively <b>actuated</b> systems performing tracking operations and the explo-ration of passively <b>actuated</b> walking patterns as well as fail safe robot manipulators in industrial fabrication processes.

25|$|Two {{different}} systems were employed. The earlier, fitted to the 1965 through 1968 Ford-built {{cars and the}} 1971â€“1972 Nissan Cedric, employed an electric motor driving, through reduction gearing, a set of three slow-turning cams. These cams would <b>actuate</b> switches {{to turn on the}} lights in sequence. Later Ford cars and the 1969 Imperial used a transistorised control module with no moving parts to wear, break, or go out of adjustment.|$|E
25|$|There are an {{increasing}} number of ideas coming into the market place to extend the options for openhole completions; for example, electronics can be used to <b>actuate</b> a self-opening or self-closing liner valve. This might be used in an openhole completion to improve clean-up, by bringing the well onto production from the toe-end for 100 days, then self-opening the heel-end. Inflow control devices and intelligent completions are also installed as openhole completions.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} caliper design uses a single {{hydraulically}} actuated piston within a cylinder, although high performance brakes use {{as many as}} twelve. Modern cars use different hydraulic circuits to <b>actuate</b> the brakes on each set of wheels as a safety measure. The hydraulic design also helps multiply braking force. The number of pistons in a caliper {{is often referred to}} as the number of 'pots', so if a vehicle has 'six pot' calipers it means that each caliper houses six pistons.|$|E
40|$|An <b>actuating</b> device {{can change}} a {{position}} of an active member that remains in substantially the same position {{in the absence of}} a force of a predetermined magnitude on the active member.

25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the Princess was {{designed}} to be operated by a pair of pilots, two flight engineers, a navigator, and a radio operator. Early on, it had been intended for the aircraft to be outfitted with some form of powered flight controls, including an early fly-by-wire implementation, in order that pilots would be able to effectively <b>actuate</b> its large control surfaces, which would have to overcome equally larger forces. However, it was decided to opt for a traditional mechanical linkage approach that was augmented by a series of electrically-driven power assist units to effectively support actuation instead.|$|E
25|$|Dump valves {{are used}} to release air from the bag when in the water. They can be {{operated}} manually at the valve by a diver or may be remotely operated by a pull-cord, which may be operated by a diver or attached to a weight which will automatically open the valve if the weight is lifted off the bottom. Some dump valves can be operated in both these ways. One system operates by pressing on the top or pulling a line attached to the bottom to <b>actuate</b> the spring-loaded valve. The dump valve may be a screw-in quick change system, and the spring tension may be adjustable.|$|E
25|$|Water {{and steam}} based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} had overall control by wall-mounted bi-metallic strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to <b>actuate</b> an on/off switch. Typically the central {{system would be}} switched on when the temperature drops below the set point on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the set point desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith the {{improving}} {{skills of}} oil exploration and exploitation, {{the proportion of}} the production of ultra-low permeable reservoirs is increasing. But the developing process has encountered many problems, such as poor reservoir properties, high injection <b>actuating</b> pressure, etc. Aimed at lowering the injection <b>actuating</b> pressure of ultra-low permeable oilfield, author has finished the indoor gradient test of <b>actuating</b> pressure, selected and evaluated a system of surface acting agent which later applied in the X oilfield as well. The results show that the gradient <b>actuating</b> pressure of Z reservoir in X oilfield ranges between 0. 0308 MPa/cm to 0. 2215 MPa/cm. And because the SAA system could largely reduce the surface tension between fluid and rock, the injection <b>actuating</b> pressure then can be reduced by 40 %- 50 %. And its application efficiency was 75 %. As a result, it is feasible to use SAA to lower the injection <b>actuating</b> pressure of ultra-low permeable reservoirs...|$|R
25|$|The chief {{designer}} of most Ducati motorcycles in the 1950s was Fabio Taglioni (1920â€“2001). His designs {{ranged from the}} small single-cylinder machines that were successful in the Italian 'street races' to the large-capacity twins of the 1980s. Ducati introduced the Pantah in 1979; its engine was updated in the 1990s in the Ducati SuperSport (SS) series. All modern Ducati engines are derivatives of the Pantah, which uses a toothed belt to <b>actuate</b> the engine's valves. Taglioni used the Cavallino Rampante (identified with the Ferrari brand) on his Ducati motorbikes, Taglioni chose this emblem of courage and daring {{as a sign of}} respect and admiration for Francesco Baracca, a heroic World War I fighter pilot who died during an air raid in 1918.|$|E
25|$|The wing is of single-spar {{construction}} that {{passes through the}} aircraft's fuselage. The wingspan and total length of the Canberra are almost identical at just under 20 metres. Outboard of the engine nacelles, the wing has a leading edge sweep of 4Â° and trailing edge sweep of âˆ’14Â°. All flight controls are manual, using push-rods rather than cables, but are otherwise conventional. These <b>actuate</b> the aircraft's flight control surfaces, including shrouded-nosed ailerons, four-section conventional split-type flaps, and atypical airbrakes which comprise 40 hydraulically-raised fingers located {{on the top and}} bottom surfaces of the wings. Swept-wings were considered, but not adopted, since the expected operational speeds did not warrant them and because they could have introduced new aerodynamic problems into what was otherwise anticipated to be a straightforward replacement for RAF Hawker Typhoon and Westland Whirlwind fighter-bombers.|$|E
25|$|The SA.4 was {{designed}} for a crew of five: pilot, copilot, bombardier ("air bomber"), navigator and radio operator. The prone bombardier's position was a tube extending forward of the cockpit above the radome; the crew compartment being pressurized. These positions were fitted with opaque nosecones, as the Sperrins were never used for live bombing. The pilot was {{the only member of}} the crew to have a Martin-Baker-produced ejector seat underneath a jettisonable roof panel; other crew members were intended to bail out via a door located under the navigator's console. The other three crew positions were located behind the pilots, facing rearwards. Unusually, the pilot's flying controls lacked any direct connection to the aircraft's flight control surfaces, control input was instead directed into a gearbox to <b>actuate</b> rotatable ball-screw jacks to move each flight surface via aerodynamic load instead; a corresponding artificial feel system was also installed. Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist describe the control system as having been simple, light, reliable, and low-friction and contrast it positively against powered systems of the era.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”In this work, {{the concept}} of a {{convolution}} product of real-valued functions on the Special Euclidean group, SE(D) (which describes all rigid body motions in D-dimensional Euclidean space), is applied to the determination of workspaces of discretely <b>actuated</b> manipulators. These manipulators have a finite number of joint states. If a discretely <b>actuated</b> manipulator consists of P <b>actuated</b> modules, each with K states, then it can reach K P frames in space. Given this exponential {{growth in the number of}} reachable frames, brute force representation of discretely <b>actuated</b> manipulator workspaces is not feasible in the highly <b>actuated</b> case. However, by partitioning a discretely <b>actuated</b> manipulator into P modules, and approximating the workspace of each module as a density function on a compact subset of the Special Euclidean group, the whole workspace can be approximated as an P-fold convolution of these densities. A numerical approximation of this convolution is presented in this paper which is O(P) for fixed taskspace dimension. In the special case when the manipulator is composed of P identical <b>actuated</b> modules, the workspace density for the whole manipulator can be calculated in O(log P) computation time. In either case, the O(K P) computations required by brute force workspace generation are avoided.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{contrasts}} current {{views about}} the effectiveness of <b>actuated</b> signal control in urban traffic, based on a field study carried-out in Brazil, and evaluates the viability of analysis methods based on HCM performance models in predicting signal times and vehicle delays for deciding about its implementation. We argue that there is an old view about the use of <b>actuated</b> control on practical warrants (as cure for light-volume traffic signals only) in contrast to a theoretical belief on the performance superiority of <b>actuated</b> control (stated generically). The field study investigates the comparative performance of pre-timed and <b>actuated</b> control in a heavy traffic urban intersection and evaluates field measures of delay against HCM-based model estimates (a basic tool for establishing a clear criteria grounded on cost-benefit analysis). Our field study shows that potential gains from <b>actuated</b> control are not easy to realize, depends on good parameter setting for micro-regulation efficiency and, most of all, on the importance of incidents and trends that ask for an automatic macro-regulation capability. Even for evaluating micro-regulation gains, HCM-based performance models give biased results about traffic <b>actuated</b> operation, commanding care on their use for assessing the real (relative) effectiveness of traffic <b>actuated</b> control on the field, not to say about paramete...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{solution}} for steering microrobotic swarm by dynamic <b>actuating</b> fields. In our approach, {{the motion of}} micro-robots is controlled by changing the <b>actuating</b> direction of a field applied to them. The time-series sequence of <b>actuating</b> fieldâ€™s directions can be computed automatically. Given a target position {{in the domain of}} swarm, a governing field is first constructed to provide optimal moving directions at every points. Following these directions, a robot can be driven to the target efficiently. However, when working with a crowd of micro-robots, the optimal moving directions on different agents can contradict with each other. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a novel steering algorithm to compute a statistically optimal <b>actuating</b> direction at each time frame. Following a sequence of these <b>actuating</b> directions, a crowd of micro-robots can be transported to the target region effectively. Our steering strategy of swarm has been verified on a platform that generates magnetic fields with unique <b>actuating</b> directions.
