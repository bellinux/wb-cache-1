A new phosphorescent zinc sensor (ZIrF) was constructed based on an Ir(III) complex bearing two 2 -(2, 4 -difluorophenyl) pyridine (dfppy) cyclometalating ligands and a neutral 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen) ligand. A zinc-specific di(2 -picolyl) amino (DPA) receptor was introduced at the 4 -position of the phen ligand via a methylene linker.

Zinc coordination selectively enhanced the latter, affording a phosphorescence ratiometric response.

By 1600, the serum LH concentration was greater in intact hamsters than in ovx animals (2800 vs 400 ng/ml), and in both groups LH release was blocked by Phen. Sham-ovariectomy {{had no effect on}} 1600 serum LH levels. In intact females, P prolonged LH release but did not affect LH concentration at 1600 (3000 ng/ml) whereas in ovx animals P more than doubled the LH concentration at 1600 (1000 ng/ml). Phen plus P delayed and depressed the LH surge in intact animals but did not affect the LH pattern achieved by P alone in ovx animals. Therefore, the ability of P to overcome the Phen block of LH release was inhibited by the ovary. Additional groups of ovx animals were given EB in combination with P <b>and</b> <b>Phen</b> to determine whether estrogen was the substance which interfered with this action of P. Ovx hamsters given ER had twice the amount of serum LH at 1600 as those given P alone (1900 vs 1000 nglml).

All animals were maintained in a controlled environment and provided food and water ad libitum. This dosage of BB resulted in hepatotoxicity as measured by an increase in serum alanine transferase (ALT). BB treatment resulted in a 5 -fold increase in ALT. Moderate hepatotoxicity was detected with this treatment regime. Subsequently, another group of mice were treated with three treatments of nicotinamide at 0. 5, 1 and 2 hours following BB treatment. Serum ALT elevations were reduced by 90 % at 24 hours following BB and nicotinamide treatments. BB-induced liver pathology was also blocked by nicotinamide. Mortality among BB treated animals was also significantly reduced by nicotinamide treatment. Mortality among mice treated with BB and nicotinamide was near control. The model was verified with a more potent and specific inhibitor, Phen. BB treatment was keep at the same level as in the previous study, <b>and</b> <b>Phen</b> was administered concomitantly. Serum ALT elevations were reduced by 75 %. Phen also blocked BB-induced liver pathology. Mortality among mice treated with BB <b>and</b> <b>Phen</b> was reduced 75 %. PARP- 1 inhibitors appear to alter chemical-induced hepatotoxicity that has either a glutathione dependent or independent mechanism...|$|E

The Eu atom is in a pseudo-bicapped square-antiprismatic geometry, formed by four N atoms from two chelating 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen) ligands and by six O atoms, four from two 2, 6 -dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) ligands and the other two from a nitrate anion. &# 960;&# 8211;&# 960; stacking interactions between phen and DHB ligands [centroid&# 8211;centroid distances = 3. 5312 &# 8197;(19) and 3. 8347 &# 8197;(16) &# 8197;&# 197;], and between phen <b>and</b> <b>phen</b> ligands [face-to-face separation = 3. 433 &# 8197;(4) &# 8197;&# 197;] of adjacent complexes stabilize the crystal structure.

The structures of 1 and 2 were solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The cationic moieties of [Ni(bpy) 3] 2 + in 1 and [Ni(phen) 3] 2 + in 2 show octahedral environments around Ni(II), whereas the anionic groups of [Mn(NCO) 4] 2 - in 1 and [Zn(NCO) 4] 2 - in 2 exhibit tetrahedral geometry around the Mn(II) and Zn(II), respectively.

40|$|Platinum {{compounds}} containing an aromatic diimine (1, 10 -phenanthroline or 2, 9 -dimethyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline; <b>phen</b> <b>and</b> Me(2) <b>phen,</b> respectively) <b>and</b> antiviral guanosine-type ligands (acyclovir or penciclovir; acy and pen, respectively) {{have been}} synthesised. These compounds maintain the antiviral activity against Herpes Symplex Virus (HSV) and have greater efficacy than free acyclovir or penciclovir against Cytomegalovirus (CMV); {{in both cases}} the species with Me(2) phen are more active. The same complexes are effective against tumor cell proliferation which also results to be dependent upon the nature of the diimine ligand: all compounds containing Me(2) phen being more active than those containing phen. Although in vivo some complexes significantly reduce tumor cell proliferation, nevertheless, they do not appear to significantly affect the life time expectancy of the treated mice. The greater cytotoxicity of compounds with Me(2) phen may result from a higher reactivity towards cellular components, such as glutathione, which could cause release of the diimine, known to be highly cytotoxic. status: publishe...|$|R

No further solid-solid phase transition occurs in the temperature range examined. In addition, the average melting temperature, molar enthalpy and molar entropy of fusion for <b>phen</b> <b>and</b> dmphen were also determined to be (391. 1 +/- 0. 1 K, 11. 8 +/- 0. 1 kJ mol(- 1), and 30. 0 +/- 0. 3 JK(- 1) mol(- 1)) and (435. 9 +/- 0. 3 K, 17. 6 +/- 0. 3 kJ mol(- 1), and 40. 3 +/- 0. 6 JK(- 1) mol(- 1)), respectively. The experimental heat capacity data were obtained and the respective second-order polynomial fitting equations were derived: C-p,C-m(phen, cr) /(JK(- 1) mol(- 1)) = (- 3905 +/- 16) + (22. 0 +/- 1. 0) (T/K) - (0. 0289 +/- 0. 00 15) (T/K) (2) from 298. 2 to 360. 2 K, R- 2 = 0. 9935; C-p,C-m(dmphen, cr) /(JK(- 1) mol(- 1)) = (- 2808 +/- 14) + (17. 1 +/- 1. 0) (T/K) - (0. 0229 +/- 0. 0014) (T/K) (2) from 298. 2 to 393. 2 K, R- 2 = 0. 9953. In particular the C-p,C-m values at T= 298. 15 K for <b>phen</b> <b>and</b> dmphen {{were found to be}} (115 +/- 18 and 253 +/- 30) JK(- 1) mol(- 1), respectively, where the associated uncertainties are twice the standard deviations of the mean.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been demonstrated that phenanthroline-based ligands used to make gold metallotherapuetics {{have the ability to}} exhibit cytotoxicity when not coordinated to the metal center. In an effort to help assess the mechanism by which these ligands may cause tumor cell death, iron binding and re moval experiments have been considered. The close linkage between cell proliferation and intracellular iron concentrations suggest that iron deprivation strategies may be a mechanism involved in inhibiting tumor cell growth. With the creation of iron (III) phen complexes, the iron binding abilities of three polypyridal ligands [1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen), 2, 9 -dimethyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (methyl <b>phen),</b> <b>and</b> 2, 9 -di- sec- butyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (sec- butyl phen) ] can be tested via a competition reaction with a known iron chelator. Therefore, iron (III) complexes possessing all three ligands were synthesized. Initial mass spectrometric and infrared absorption data indicate that iron (III) tetrachloride complex ions with protonated phen ligands (R phenH +) were formed: [phenH][FeCl 4], [methyl phenH][FeCl 4], [sec- butyl phenH][FeCl 4]. UV-vis spectroscopy was used to monitor the stability of the complex ions, and {{it was found that the}} sec- butyl pheniron complex was more stable than the <b>phen</b> <b>and</b> methyl <b>phen</b> analogues. This was based on the observation that free ligand was observed immediately upon the addition of EDTA to the [phenH][FeCl 4] and [methyl phenH] [FeCl 4] complex ions.   </b...|$|R
