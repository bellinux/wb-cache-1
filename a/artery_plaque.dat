The study group consisted of patients admitted to the cardiology outpatient clinic with symptoms of stable angina pectoris. The study showed CIMT was higher in patients with significant CAD than in patients with non-critical coronary lesions. Regression analysis revealed that thickening of the mean intima-media complex more than 1.0 was predictive of significant CAD our patients. There was incremental significant increase in CIMT with the number coronary vessel involved. In accordance with the literature, it was found that CIMT was significantly higher in the presence of CAD. Furthermore, CIMT was increased as the number of involved vessels increased and the highest CIMT values were noted in patients with left main coronary involvement.

We characterized a human hsp distinct from those previously characterized in atherosclerotic lesions, termed HDJ- 2. Methods: To determine the role of HDJ- 2 in atherosclerosis, we compared the level of HDJ- 2 mRNA expression {{with the level of}} hsp 60 and hsp 70 mRNA expression in 26 carotid endarterectomy specimens and 17 normal arteries. The level of expression of HDJ- 2 mRNA was also correlated to the presence of plaque ulceration and the degree of luminal stenosis associated with the lesion. Results: The expression of HDJ- 2 and hsp 70 was significantly higher in carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> as compared with normal arteries: HDJ- 2, 6. 7 ± 1. 6 vs 0. 1 ± 0. 04, (P =. 001); hsp 70, 9. 5 ± 0. 9 vs 3. 7 ± 0. 8, (P =. 002). There {{was no significant difference in}} hsp 60 expression between carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> and normal <b>arteries</b> (21. 0 ± 0. 9 vs 20. 6 ± 0. 8, P =. 65). Increased HDJ- 2 expression in carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> was independent of hsp 70 (Pearson correlation, r = 0. 11; Bartlett χ 2 analysis, P =. 71). Within the ulcerated plaque group, there was a correlation between degree of stenosis and high HDJ- 2 mRNA expression (r = 0. 896, P =. 016).

On the other hand, positron emission tomography (PET) of plaques with the use of [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) identifies highly inflamed plaques, and the combination of molecular imaging and morphology could improve identification of vulnerable plaques. MethodsA total of 33 patients with cerebrovascular symptoms and carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> were included prospectively for ultrasound and PET imaging. Plaque standardized gray scale medians (GSM) were measured in longitudinal ultrasound images to quantitate echolucency, and GSM values were compared with FDG PET uptake quantified by maximum standardized uptake values (SUV). Symptomatic plaques were compared with contralateral carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> considered asymptomatic, and in 17 symptomatic patients, endarterectomized plaque specimens were analyzed for CD 68 expression. ResultsThere was a negative correlation between GSM and FDG SUV (r = − 0. 56, p < 0. 01). Whereas echo-rich plaques tended to show low FDG uptake, echolucent plaques ranged from high to low inflammatory activity, as depicted with PET. Quantitative FDG SUV differentiated asymptomatic from symptomatic plaques, whereas GSM values did not. There was a positive correlation between CD 68 expression and FDG uptake (r = 0. 50, p = 0. 04).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Thrombus is a {{main cause}} of cardiac death. Therefore {{identifying}} which coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaque</b> is vulnerable to rupture is a critical step for cardiac intervention to prevent future cardiac events. Systemic biochemical markers are used for predicting rupture of coronary plaque or identifying stenotic coronary artery plaque(s) vulnerable to rupture. METHODS: Blood samples of 2 x 24 locations (2 x 10 controls, 2 x 12 stable plaques and 2 x 2 unstable plaques) of 13 patients to undergo stent placement were taken from an artery which showed no stenosis (control), 70 % or more stenosis of stable plaques and unstable plaques, respectively. The blood samples were taken by using microcatheter distally and proximally. Concentrations of MPO, MMP- 9, SPLA 2 and CD 40 L of each sample were assayed. RESULTS: Concentration of MMP- 9 in unstable coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaque</b> (94. 7 + 14. 4 ng/ml) significantly increased {{compared with that of}} stable coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaque</b> (71. 0 + 67. 8 ng/ml, p= 0. 024). SPLA 2 concentration significantly decreased in unstable coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaque</b> (45. 9 + 14. 0 pg/ml) compared with that of stable coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaque</b> (80. 9 + 39. 3 pg/ml, p= 0. 015). Nine of ten studied subjects showed an average of 14. 5 % (range: 0. 0 - 28. 8 %) decrease of the SPLA 2 concentration in stable plaques compared with that of the non-stenotic coronary artery. CONCLUSION: MMP- 9 increased in unstable coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaque</b> compared with that of stable coronary plaque. Unstable coronary artery plaques absorbed SPLA 2 from the vasculars more than the stable plaques and control plaques.

Methods: Coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaque</b> area was determined by quantitative angiography in 108 patients (32 % women) with NSTEMI. Myocardial perfusion was assessed by contrast echocardiography in the 17 individual left ventricular segments. Artery tortuosity was defined as ‡ 3 curves > 45 in a main coronary artery. Results: Age, prevalence of hypertension, and diabetes did not differ between sexes (all nonsignificant). Women had lower prevalence of ‡ 50 % coronary artery stenosis (74 % vs. 91 %, p 0. 07).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{studies have}} found that the {{ultrasound}} greyscale median (GSM) of carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> may be useful for predicting the risk of cerebrovascular events. However, measurements of GSM are typically performed on still ultrasound images ignoring any variations that may be observed on a frame-by-frame basis. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the existence and investigate the nature and extent of these variations. METHODS: Employing a novel method that enabled plaque boundaries to be tracked semi-automatically, variations in the plaque GSM and observed cross-sectional area were measured for 27 carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> (19 consecutive patients, stenosis range 10 %- 80 %) over image sequences of up to 10  seconds in length acquired with a mean frame rate of 32 frames per second. RESULTS: Our results showed a mean inter-frame coefficient of variation (CV) of 5. 2 % (s. d. 2. 5 %) for GSM and 4. 2 % (s. d. 2. 9 %) for the plaque area. Thirteen of the 27 plaques (48 %) exhibited CV in GSM greater than 5 % whereas only six plaques (22 %) had CV in plaque area of greater than 5 %. There was no significant correlation between the CV of GSM and plaque area.

We tested whether macrophages in carotid <b>artery</b> atherosclerotic <b>plaques</b> are associated with echolucency on B-mode ultrasound imaging, lipid levels, inflammatory markers, and aspirin use. Methods: We studied 106 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy having ≥ 50 % carotid artery stenosis and previous ipsilateral hemispheric neurologic symptoms. Results: Macrophages were particularly common in plaques with a high content of lipid and hemorrhage and, conversely, rare in plaques dominated by calcification and fibrous tissue. Macrophage density in carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> classified by B-mode ultrasound imaging as echolucent (n = 56), intermediate (n = 25), or echorich (n = 25) was 1. 8 % ± 0. 2 %, 1. 5 % ± 0. 4 %, and 1. 0 % ± 0. 2 % (±SE), respectively (analysis of variance, P =. 02). A computer-generated measure of plaque echolucency, gray-scale median, was associated with increased macrophage density (r = – 0. 31; P =. 002). Furthermore, plasma and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were associated with carotid artery macrophage density (r = 0. 26, P =. 008 and r = 0. 23, P =. 02); this was most pronounced in patients with lipid-rich plaques.

However, plaques, with or without significant stenosis, have been reported in patients without coronary artery calcium. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and risk factors of the development of coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> in individuals with a zero calcium score. MethodsAnalysis of coronary artery calcium levels and coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) were performed using 64 -slice computed tomography (CT). The demographic data, clinical risk factors, and imaging features of 519 consecutive patients (54  ±  10 years, male:female ratio of 56 : 44) were retrospectively analyzed.

Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analyses were carried out to identify the frequency and risk factors associated with the presence of coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaques.</b> ResultsAmong 66 patients, 82 coronary arteries were found to have plaques, and six coronary arteries showed significant stenosis. Univariate analysis showed that an age greater than 55 years, male gender, a body mass index (BMI) of more than 27, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are significant factors associated with the development of coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaques.</b> Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that an age over 55 years (p =  0. 012, OR =  2. 13, 95 % C.

40|$|Background/Aims: The {{relationship}} between carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaque</b> burden, phenotype and serum cystatin C at normal and impaired renal function is still unclear. Methods: Demographic characteristics, carotid ultrasonography and {{other relevant information}} of 1, 477 patients were collected. The association of carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaque</b> burden, plaque phenotype with serum cystatin C was evaluated by strategy analysis based on renal function. Results: Serum cystatin C (OR= 2. 05, 95 % CI: 1. 83 - 2. 29, POR= 1. 60, 95 %CI: 1. 43 - 1. 78, POR= 1. 21, 95 %CI: 1. 10 - 1. 32, P Conclusion: In normal renal function, serum cystatin C may confer stability of plaques. In mildly impaired renal function, serum cystatin C is a risk predictor of plaques. In normal renal function circumstances, serum cystatin C may benefit to the stability of plaques. In mild impaired renal function circumstances, serum cystatin C are a risk predictors of plaques...|$|E
40|$|Background: Analysis of the {{coronary}} artery calcium levels usually provides important {{information that can}} be used in patient prognosis and stratification of treatment when {{coronary artery}} disease is suspected. However, plaques, with or without significant stenosis, have been reported in patients without coronary artery calcium. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and risk factors of the development of coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> in individuals with a zero calcium score. Methods: Analysis of coronary artery calcium levels and coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) were performed using 64 -slice computed tomography (CT). The demographic data, clinical risk factors, and imaging features of 519 consecutive patients (54  ±  10 years, male:female ratio of 56 : 44) were retrospectively analyzed. The presence of plaques and the degree of the resulting stenosis were recorded. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analyses were carried out to identify the frequency and risk factors associated with the presence of coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaques.</b> Results: Among 66 patients, 82 coronary arteries were found to have plaques, and six coronary arteries showed significant stenosis. Univariate analysis showed that an age greater than 55 years, male gender, a body mass index (BMI) of more than 27, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are significant factors associated with the development of coronary <b>artery</b> <b>plaques.</b> Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that an age over 55 years (p =  0. 012, OR =  2. 13, 95 % C. I.  =  1. 18 – 3. 84) and BMI greater than 27 (p =  0. 026, OR =  2. 01, 95 % C. I.  =  1. 09 – 3. 72) are independent factors associated with the presence of plaques in patients with a zero calcium score. Conclusion: The results of this study show that plaques are present in a significant proportion of individuals with a zero coronary artery calcium score. In addition, advanced age and obesity are risk factors associated with the development of plaques...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} whether increased serum Lp(a) level is a risk factor which significantly contributes to an increase in intima-media thickness (IMT) and the number of carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaques,</b> and the related increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study included 146 type 2 diabetic patients without signs of cerebrovascular and ischaemic heart disease. The levels of Lp(a) and IMT, as well as the number of carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> were determined at the beginning of the study. IMT and the number of carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> were again determined after four years of follow-up. Subjects were divided into two groups according to their serum Lp(a) levels: patients with Lp(a) level of ≤ 30 mg/dL and those with Lp level > 30 mg/dL. IMT was assessed by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound. Serum Lp(a) level was determined using immunoturbidimetric method. The studied groups of patients with high and low serum Lp(a) levels did not reveal significant differences in baseline IMT (p= 0. 112). After a 4 -yr follow-up IMT was significantly greater in patients with Lp(a) level > 30 mg/dL as compared to those with Lp(a) level of ≤ 30 mg/dL (1. 24 + 0. 22 mm vs. 1. 15 + 0. 17 mm, respectively; p= 0. 05). Mean increase in IMT over four years in the group with low Lp(a) level was 0. 12 mm (0. 030 mm/yr.), whereas in the group with high Lp(a) level it was 0. 17 mm (0. 043 mm/yr.). Multivariate analysis indicated that IMT value depended on Lp(a), and not on triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels. The studied patients from both groups did not show significant difference in baseline number of plaques (p= 0. 276). A significant increase in the number of plaques (p 0. 05). These results point to Lp(a) as an independent, genetically determined risk factor associated with IMT progression in type 2 diabetes mellitus...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE The aim of {{this study}} was to {{elucidate}} the relationship between the echogenicity of carotid <b>artery</b> <b>plaques</b> and the following risk factors: circulating oxLDL, hsCRP, the metabolic syndrome (MetS), and several of the traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional population-based study of 513 sixty-one-year-old men. The levels of circulating oxLDL were determined in plasma samples by sandwich ELISA utilizing a specific murine monoclonal antibody (mAb- 4 E 6). High-sensitivity CRP was measured in plasma by ELISA. Plaque occurrence, size and echogenicity were evaluated from B-mode ultrasound registrations in the carotid <b>arteries.</b> <b>Plaque</b> echogenicity was assessed based on a four-graded classification scale. RESULTS A higher frequency of echolucent carotid plaques was observed with increasing levels of oxLDL and systolic blood pressure (p = 0. 008 and p = 0. 041, respectively). Subjects with the MetS had a significantly higher frequency of echogenic plaques than subjects without the MetS (p = 0. 009). In a multiple logistic regression analysis, oxLDL turned out to be independently associated with echolucent carotid plaques. CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of echolucent carotid plaques was associated with oxLDL and systolic blood pressure, and oxLDL was associated with echolucent carotid plaques independently of systolic blood pressure...|$|R
