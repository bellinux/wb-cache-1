5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass, by doing this {{they will need to}} cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes <b>and</b> <b>checking.</b>|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} and investigation on {{a large number of}} striped <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> patterns in silk fabric of the Republic of China (1912 - 1949) and some relevant historical records, this paper mainly reviews the types of striped <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> patterns in silk fabric of the Republic of China. It also discusses the use of weave design in striped <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> patterns, <b>and</b> points out that striped <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> patterns turned {{to be one of the}} most popular patterns in silk fabric during this period, only ranking second to floral pattern. The influence of western design, changes in fashion and technological innovations are main reasons for this transition...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the current}} owner Charles Spencer professes to have never {{witnessed}} a ghost at Althorp or anywhere else, {{over the years}} numerous ghostly sightings {{have been reported in}} the mansion. In the mid 19th century the Dean of Lincoln was invited to stay at the property by Fredrick, 4th Earl Spencer. He complained the following morning that during the night a figure dressed as a groom (believed to be the ghost of the deceased servant of the 3rd Earl) had entered his room holding candles <b>and</b> <b>checking</b> that they were snuffed out around the bed. Margaret Douglas-Home professed to being aware of a ghost of a girl with grey slippers in the gallery.|$|E
5|$|Following the crew's post-sleep activities, {{they went}} to work {{performing}} the rendezvous operations that included burning the orbiter's engines to refine the approach to the Hubble telescope. Following some delays due to communications issues, Altman and Johnson ("Ray-J") guided the orbiter within fifty feet of the telescope. McArthur successfully grappled Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope was safely berthed in the payload bay of Atlantis. Later in the day, Grunsfeld and Feustel (Drew), along with Good ("Bueno") and Massimino ("Mass") worked on preparing for the next day's spacewalk, gathering tools <b>and</b> <b>checking</b> out the suits and equipment {{that would be used}} during the EVA.|$|E
5|$|To {{give the}} paratroops some {{artillery}} support, Lieutenant Colonel Alan Blyth of the 2/4th Field Regiment proposed dropping {{some of its}} eight short 25-pounders by parachute. A call went out for volunteers and four officers and 30 other ranks were selected. On 30 August, Vasey watched them carry out a practice jump at Rogers Airfield. This {{turned out to be}} the easy part. Brand new guns were received from the 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot at Port Moresby on 23 August. Two were handed over for training while, as a precaution, the remaining six were sent the 2/117th Field Workshops for inspection <b>and</b> <b>checking.</b> All six were condemned, owing to a number of serious defects in assembly and manufacture. On 30 August, the gunners received orders to move out the next day, so the 2/51st Light Aid Detachment cannibalised six guns to produce two working guns, which were proofed by firing 20 rounds per gun. Only one was ready in time to leave with the gunners so the other followed on a special flight. Eight of the 2/4th Field Regiment’s Mark II 25-pounders were also condemned owing to the presence of filings in the buffer system. Vasey was less than impressed.|$|E
