25|$|Historian Martin H. Folly {{argues that}} Bevin was not {{automatically}} pro-American. Instead {{he pushed his}} embassy in Washington to project a view of Britain that neutralized American criticisms. He felt Britain's problems were in part caused by American irresponsibility. He was frustrated with American attitudes. His strategy was to bring Washington around to support Britain's policies, arguing Britain had earned American support <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> compensate it for its sacrifices against the Nazis. Bevin was not coldly pragmatic, says Folly, nor was he uncritically pro-American; nor was he a puppet manipulated by the British Foreign Office.|$|E

In Volume 1 of Excursions, Adventures, and Field-sports in Ceylon Campbell notes that, {{from the start of}} his service in the army, he was in the habit of keeping a journal. However the night before the Battle of Talavera, thinking that he would be likely to die the next day and not wanting his journal to fall into enemy hands, he burnt it, and thus destroyed the record of events from the previous eight years.|$|E

25|$|Leicestershire Foxes {{took the}} win at Trent Bridge in a low-scoring match. Nottinghamshire Outlaws {{had won the}} toss and bowled first, <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have been pretty pleased with restricting the Foxes to 150 for 4, even though they conceded 15 extras. The opening {{partnership}} of HD Ackerman and Darren Maddy for 67 runs had promised more for Leicestershire. However, West Indian Ottis Gibson dug out two early wickets in Graeme Swann and Stephen Fleming - Darren Maddy and David Masters then took wickets at leisure, and Nottinghamshire were 96 for 7. Despite a rescue mission from Gareth Clough who hit 30 off 16 balls, there was no hitting power from the other players, and Nottinghamshire finished on 129 for 8.|$|E
25|$|The reports {{created a}} sensation. Oliver was not slow to try adrenal {{extracts}} in patients, orally again and rather indiscriminately, from Addison's disease, hypotension (″loss of vasomotor tone″), Diabetes mellitus and Diabetes insipidus to Graves' disease (″exophthalmic goitre″). It seems he adhered to contemporary ideas of organotherapy, believing that powerful substances existed in tissues <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be discovered for medicinal use. In fact he immediately {{went on to}} extract the pituitary gland and, again with Schäfer, discovered vasopressin. In 1903 adrenaline, meanwhile purified, was first used in asthma. The use was based, not on the bronchodilator effect, which was discovered later, but on the vasoconstrictor effect, which was hoped to alleviate the “turgidity of the bronchial mucosa” – presumably vascular congestion and edema. Also as of 1903, adrenaline was added to local anesthetic solutions. The surgeon Heinrich Braun in Leipzig showed that it prolonged the anesthesia at the injection site and simultaneously reduced ″systemic″ effects elsewhere in the body.|$|E
25|$|Kritiks: The {{negative}} {{can claim}} that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue {{that it would be}} good to reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that {{it would be good to}} reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.|$|E

25|$|Henry was in France {{with the}} Emperor Maximilian at {{the siege of}} Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV's letter of 26 July to him. James asked him to desist from attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry's {{exchange}} with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, Henry said that James {{had no right to}} summon him, <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be England's ally, as James was married to his (Henry's) sister, Margaret. He declared:And now, for a conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And one thing I ensure him by the faith that I have to the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace with me that ever his part shall be in it. Moreover, fellow, I care for nothing but for misentreating of my sister, that would God she were in England on a condition she cost the Schottes King not a penny.|$|E
25|$|Unexpectedly {{confronted by}} a large Austro-Russian army, MacDonald was in a dilemma. He {{believed}} that his 22,000 available soldiers were outnumbered <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> retreat, but he anticipated that Moreau might soon arrive to pitch into the Allied rear. So he hoped to hold out until his last divisions could arrive on the field. MacDonald was also aware {{of the presence of}} a force under Jean François Cornu de La Poype that was in position to threaten the Allied south flank. On the 18th, Veletsky's detached force surprised La Poype's 1,500 French and 2,000 Genoese at Bobbio, sending them fleeing back to Genoa. On morning of 18 June the injured MacDonald inspected his army. He found his men ready to fight and the enemy inactive. Meanwhile, Suvorov and Chasteler planned to throw three columns at the French, with the main strength on the right to break down MacDonald's flank by advancing from the Tidone to the Trebbia and finally {{all the way to the}} Nure, the next river to the east. With luck, the French would be driven back against the Po. The First Column on the right was headed by Bagration's Advance Guard followed by Schveikovsky's division. The Second Column in the center was made up of Förster's division. The Third Column included the divisions of Ott and Fröhlich. Ott was ordered to drive straight ahead to the Trebbia supported by his colleague. At some point Fröhlich's grenadiers were supposed to reinforce the right flank in order to give more weight to its attack.|$|E

500|$|The minority—in a dissent {{written by}} Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II and joined by Associate Justices Tom C.

500|$|William Elliott, Hart's former Princeton classmate who {{had become}} a Captain in the British Army, promised the wounded man safe passage to Fort Malden, but did not carry out his pledge. Elliot {{borrowed}} a horse, bridle and saddle from Major Benjamin Franklin Graves, an American officer, promising to send help to the American wounded, but none arrived. [...] Acting American captain William Caldwell wrote the next month that he heard Elliott tell General Winchester and Major Madison that [...] "the Indians were very excellent surgeons (<b>and</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> kill all the officers and men)." [...] In one official letter, the eye-witness says that Elliott's broken promise included an offer to take Hart in Elliott's [...] "own sleigh to Malden that evening" [...] and that Hart could stay at Elliott's home for his recovery.|$|E

500|$|Tech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 {{that using}} Twitter for [...] "literate communication" [...] is [...] "about {{as likely as}} firing up a CB radio and hearing some guy recite the Iliad". In September 2008, the {{journalist}} Clive Thompson mused in a New York Times Magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into [...] "a new, supermetabolic extreme—the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity-addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be shared with the world". One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity-related Twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980, when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round-the-clock press releases {{about his relationship with}} comedian Phyllis Diller, even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis. Conversely, Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints, and Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that [...] "the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|Early Christian theologian Origen also {{presented}} suffering as {{necessary for the}} development of human beings. Theologian Mark Scott has argued that John Hick's theodicy is more closely aligned with Origen's beliefs than Irenaeus' <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be called an [...] "Origenian theodicy". Origen used two metaphors for the world: it is a school and a hospital for souls, with God as Teacher and Physician, in which suffering plays both an educative and healing role. Through an allegorical reading of Exodus and the books of Solomon, Origen casts human development as a progression though a series of stages which take place in this life and after death. Origen believed that all humans will eventually reach heaven as the logical conclusion of God being 'all in all'. Hell is a metaphor for the purification of our souls: our sinful nature goes to 'Hell' and our original nature, created by God, goes to heaven. Scott argues that significant aspects of Origen's theology mean that there is a stronger continuation between it and Hick's theodicy. These aspects are Origen's allegorical treatment of Adam and Eve, the presentation of the world as a hospital or schoolroom, the progression he advocates of the human soul, and his universalism.|$|E
500|$|The {{convention}} concerned {{itself with}} federal-state relations, with the convention's Committee on the Preamble and Bill of Rights initially stating that, [...] ""the General Government of the United States is paramount {{to that of}} an individual state, except as to rights guaranteed to each State by the Constitution of the United States." [...] But Jacob N. Liggett of Rockingham County voiced the ex-Confederate doctrine that [...] "the Federal Government is the creature of the acts of the States." [...] Christopher Y. Thomas of Henry County proposed a compromise, to simply assert Article VI of the U.S. Constitution for Virginia's Bill of Rights, Section 2, that [...] "the Constitution of the United States, {{and the laws of}} Congress passed in pursuance thereof, constitute the supreme law of the land, to which paramount allegiance and obedience are due from every citizen..." [...] That was not enough for the Radical majority. Linus M. Nickerson of Fairfax County who had served in a New York infantry regiment successfully added [...] "this State shall ever remain a member of the United States of America... and that all attempts from whatever source, or upon whatever pretext, to dissolve said Union... are unauthorized, <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be resisted with the whole power of the State." ...|$|E
