50|$|The {{other major}} clade within Haplorhini, the simians (or anthropoids), {{is divided into}} two parvorders: Platyrrhini (the New World monkeys) and Catarrhini (the Old World monkeys and apes). The New World monkeys split from catarrhines about 40 mya, while the <b>apes</b> (<b>Hominoidea)</b> diverged from Old World monkeys (Cercopithecoidea) about 25 mya. The {{available}} fossil evidence indicates that both the hominoid and cercopithecoid clades originated in Africa.|$|E
50|$|<b>Apes</b> (<b>Hominoidea)</b> are {{a branch}} of Old World {{tailless}} anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of the Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{biologists}} and primatologists use monophyletic groups for taxonomic classification; that is, they use only those groups that include all descendants {{of a common}} ancestor. The superfamily Hominoidea is such a groupâ€”also known as a clade. Some scientists now use the term [...] "ape" [...] to mean {{all members of the}} superfamily Hominoidea, including humans. For example, in his 2005 book, Benton wrote [...] "The <b>apes,</b> <b>Hominoidea,</b> today include the gibbons and orang-utan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans". Modern {{biologists and}} primatologists refer to apes that are not human as [...] "non-human" [...] apes. Scientists broadly, other than paleoanthropologists, may use the term [...] "hominin" [...] to identify the human clade, replacing the term [...] "hominid". See terminology of primate names.|$|E

5|$|Within <b>apes</b> (superfamily <b>Hominoidea),</b> the gibbons diverged {{during the}} early Miocene (between 19.7 and 24.1mya, {{according}} to molecular evidence) and the orangutans split from the African great ape lineage between 15.7 and 19.3mya.|$|R

5000|$|Thus, {{the members}} of the two sets of groups, and hence names, do not match, which causes {{problems}} in relating scientific names to common (usually traditional) names. Consider the superfamily Hominoidea: In terms of the common names on the right, this group consists of apes and humans and there is no single common name for all {{the members of}} the group. One remedy is to create a new common name, in this case [...] "hominoids". Another possibility is to expand the use of one of the traditional names. For example, in his 2005 book, the vertebrate palaeontologist Benton wrote, [...] "The <b>apes,</b> <b>Hominoidea,</b> today include the gibbons and orang-utan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans"; thereby Benton was using [...] "apes" [...] to mean [...] "hominoids".

5000|$|Within the <b>Hominoidea</b> (<b>apes)</b> superfamily, the Hominidae family diverged {{from the}} Hylobatidae (gibbon) family some 15-20 million years ago; African great apes (subfamily Homininae) diverged from orangutans (Ponginae) about the Hominini tribe (humans, Australopithecines and other extinct biped genera, and chimpanzee) parted from the Gorillini tribe (gorillas) between [...] and and, in turn, the subtribes Hominina (humans and biped ancestors) and Panina (chimps) {{separated}} about [...] to [...]|$|R

40|$|Extant <b>apes</b> (Primates: <b>Hominoidea)</b> are the {{relics of}} a group that was much more diverse in the past. They {{originated}} in Africa around the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, but {{by the beginning of the}} Middle Miocene they expanded their range into Eurasia, where they experienced a far-reaching evolutionary radiation. A Eurasian origin of the great ape and human clade (Hominidae) has been favored by several authors, but the assessment of this hypothesis has been hampered by the lack of accurate datings for many Western Eurasian hominoids. Here we provide an updated chronology that incorporates recently discovered Iberian taxa and further reevaluates the age of many previously known sites on the basis of local biostratigraphic scales and magnetostratigraphic data. Our results show that identifiable Eurasian kenyapithecins (Griphopithecus and Kenyapithecus) are much younger than previously thought (ca. 14 Ma instead of 16 Ma), which casts serious doubts on the attribution of the hominoid tooth from Engelswies (16. 3 â€“ 16. 5 Ma) to cf. Griphopithecus. This evidence is further consistent with an alternative scenario, according to which the Eurasian pongines and African hominines might have independently evolved in their respective continents from similar kenyapithecin ancestors, resulting from an early Middle Miocene intercontinental range extension followed by vicariance. This hypothesis, which would imply an independent origin of orthogrady in pongines and hominines, deserves further testing by accurately inferring the phylogenetic position of European dryopithecins, which might be stem pongines rather than stem hominines...|$|R
40|$|The {{suborder}} Anthropoidea of the primates {{has traditionally}} been divided in three superfamilies: the <b>Hominoidea</b> (<b>apes</b> and humans) and the Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys), together comprising the infraorder Catarrhini, and the Ceboidea (New World monkeys) belonging to the infraorder Platyrrhini. We have sequenced an approximately 390 -base-pair part of the mitochondrial 12 S rRNA gene for 26 species of the major groups of African monkeys and apes and constructed an extensive phylogeny based upon DNA evidence. Not only is this phylogeny of great importance in classification of African guenons, but it also suggests rearrangements in traditional monkey taxonomy and evolution. Baboons and mandrills {{were found to be}} not directly related, while we could confirm that the known four superspecies of mangabeys do not form a monophyletic group, but should be separated into two genera, one clustering with baboons and the other with mandrills. Patas monkeys are clearly related to members of the genus Cercopithecus despite their divergence in build and habitat, while the talapoin falls outside the Cercopithecus clade (including the patas monkey...|$|R
40|$|Apes and Old World monkeys are {{prominent}} components of modern African and Asian ecosystems, yet the earliest phases of their evolutionary history have remained largely undocumented 1. The absence of crown catarrhine fossils older than ~ 20 [*]million years (Myr) has stood {{in stark contrast}} to molecular divergence estimates of ~ 25 â€“ 30 [*]Myr for the split between Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys) and <b>Hominoidea</b> (<b>apes),</b> implying long ghost lineages for both clades 2, 3, 4. Here we describe the oldest known fossil â€˜apeâ€™, represented by a partial mandible preserving dental features that place it with â€˜nyanzapithecineâ€™ stem hominoids. Additionally, we report the oldest stem member of the Old World monkey clade, represented by a lower third molar. Both specimens were recovered from a precisely dated 25. 2 -Myr-old stratum in the Rukwa Rift, a segment of the western branch of the East African Rift in Tanzania. These finds extend the fossil record of apes and Old World monkeys well into the Oligocene epoch of Africa, suggesting a possible link between diversification of crown catarrhines and changes in the African landscape brought about by previously unrecognized tectonic activity 5 in the East African rift system...|$|R
40|$|In {{the order}} Primates the {{responses}} to sucrose, alitame and aspartame were ascertained. All primates tested to date like sucrose and prefer this sweet substance to tap water. The artificial dipeptide aspartame {{was found to be}} not sweet in Prosimii and Platyrrhini (New World monkeys). Only the Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys) and <b>Hominoidea</b> (<b>apes</b> and humans) show the same response to aspartame and to sucrose. In contrast, all primates tested so far prefer alitame, another artificial dipeptide sweetener, which is structurally closely related to aspartame. This phylogenetic difference is consistent with the existence in catarrhine primates of a sweetness receptor containing two differently located hydrophobic recognition sites, one for the hydrophobic binding site of alitame, the other for the hydrophobic binding site of aspartame. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that the alitame-related hydrophobic recognition site, which is found in the sweetness receptor of all primates, could be a requisite for the interaction of the receptor with sucrose, while the aspartame-related hydrophobic recognition site, which is found exclusively in the sweetness receptor of Old World simians, could have been a crucial factor in the improvement in detection or selection of sucrose in foods, so favouring the mental development of these simians and maybe the emergence of humans.

40|$|The initial cladogenic event between <b>Hominoidea</b> (<b>apes,</b> {{including}} humans) and Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys) consisted {{primarily of}} changes in the craniofacial region. These changes, seen in taxa commonly known as victoriapithecids and proconsulids, arose in a mosaic fashion. The divergence in the postcranium was more subtle; there are strong suggestions that apes initially adopted a tail-less pronograde arboreal quadrupedalism, while cercopithecoids became better adapted to a more terrestrial lifestyle. Recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that gibbons (Hylobates) have reversed derived craniofacial characters autapomorphically, contradicting the interpretation that the origin of apes sensu stricto coincides with the emergence of suspensory adaptations. The suspensory postcranium evolved later and appeared first in Eurasia; recent palaeobiogeographic reconstructions suggest that suspensory apes subsequently re-colonized Africa, as suggested nearly thirty years ago on neontological grounds. To test whether these two models of hominoid evolution are compatible, catarrhine craniofacial and postcranial traits, including those from Eurasian fossils, were subjected to parsimony analysis. The results demonstrate a mosaic pattern of derived characters, with gibbons reversing some traits of the face, which suggests their derivation from a â€˜great apeâ€™ face. Combined with the palaeobiogeography, a much longer, step-wise transition from primitive catarrhines to extant great apes than previously envisioned is supported. The pattern of craniofacial change is difficult to interpret in functional/adaptational terms, but the origin of brachiation may have arisen through character displacement due to competition with the emerging modern Old World monkey radiation in Eurasia...|$|R
40|$|The {{divergence}} {{of the two}} superfamilies {{belonging to}} the Infraorder Catarrhini â€“ Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys) and <b>Hominoidea</b> (<b>apes,</b> including humans) â€“ is generally assumed to have occurred during the Oligocene, between 38 and 20 million years ago. Genetic studies indicate that this time period was one of active genetic evolution under strong purifying selection for catarrhine primates. This includes selective pressures on the glycoprotein galactosyltransferase 1 (GGTA 1) gene and subsequent inactivation 2 Ì† 2 clocked 2 Ì† 2 at approximately 28 ma, possibly prior to the Cercopithecoidea/Hominoidea split. The GGTA 1 gene codes for an Î± 1, 3 galactosyltransferase (GT) enzyme that synthesizes a terminal disaccharide, Î±galactosyl (Î±Gal), found on glycoproteins and glycolipids {{on the surface of}} cells in the tissues of most mammals. Currently, catarrhines are the only mammals studied for the terminal Î±Gal residue that do not express this sugar on their cell surfaces. The proposed selective advantage of this mutation for catarrhines is the ability to produce anti-Gal antibodies, which may be an effective immune component in neutralizing Î±Gal-expressing pathogens, as certain helminthes, many bacteria, including those found in primate guts, and some viruses derived from GGTA 1 positive species express Î±Gal on their surfaces. However, many viruses are known to utilize host cell carbohydrates in various ways such as binding receptors or attachment proteins, making these moieties 2 Ì† 2 hot spots 2 Ì† 2 for selective evolution. Cell surface Î±Gal may have predisposed ancestral catarrhines to pathogens and toxins that could utilize the terminal sugar moieties on host cells as binding sites or in other capacities during infection. I found that, in fact, {{the presence or absence of}} cell surface Î±Gal affects the course of certain viral infections. Infections of paired cell lines with differential expression of GT showed that Sindbis viruses (SINV) preferentially replicate in Î±Gal-positive cells, whereas herpes simplex viruses type 1 and type 2 (HSV- 1 and HSV- 2) preferentially grow in cells lacking Î±Gal. In both cases, differences in infection levels resulted from the ability of the virus to successfully initiate infection. This points to a role for Î±Gal in the early stages of viral infections. I also showed that GT knockout mice infected with HSV- 2 had higher viral load and greater pathology compared to WT B 6 mice that naturally express Î±Gal. The increased susceptibility of KO mice to HSV- 2 was not due to an immune component as differences in viral load and pathology were even more evident in immunocompromised mice. This clearly indicates that Î±Gal expression in cells or animal hosts can affect the course of viral infections. I was not able to further confirm differences in susceptibility to HSV 1 and 2 using mouse backcrosses (KO x WT). Unknown genetic factors, that are independent of Î±Gal expression, may be introduced during the crosses that need to be further investigated. Infections of KO and WT mice with other herpes viruses did not yield definitive data and require further studies with suitable reagents. The mechanism by which GT-dependent differential susceptibility to viruses operates still remains to be deciphered. However, it is clear that susceptibility to certain viral infections is tied to the presence or absence of Î±Gal on the surface of host cells. Overall, these results have implications for the evolution of resistance to viral infections in catarrhines. Pathogens exert great selective pressure on their hosts, and it is possible that a pathogen, able to exploit Î±Gal, could have helped shape primate lineage evolution during the Oligocene. ...|$|R
