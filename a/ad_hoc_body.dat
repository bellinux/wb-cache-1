40|$|Abstract: This {{article focuses}} on an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>body,</b> the UK Local Government Pay Commission, {{as a means of}} {{developing}} a broader argument on the relationship between collective dispute resolution and the nature of public service reform. It suggests that the character of disputes in this sector and the ‘fitness for purpose ’ of those institutions designed to resolve them are critically related to an industrial relations agenda, which is in turn shaped by changing forms of public service provision. An extended period of public service ‘modernization ’ in local government led to a restructuring of collective bargaining with substantive and procedural consequences: new issues emerged and related tensions arose that could not be managed by the traditional bargaining machinery or by the use of existing third-party conciliation or arbitration mechanisms. It required relatively novel arrangements {{in the form of the}} LGPC whose nature and operation and lessons are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) {{programme}} {{seeks to}} reshape the way we value, govern and interact with forests. Rather than managing forests according to interests in timber, conservation, land or livelihoods, REDD+ encourages forms of forest management that prioritise carbon. While international negotiations are shaping {{the rules of the}} programme, how it takes place on the ground will depend on its interpretation and implementation in different places. In this paper, we are interested in how the REDD+ Task Force (Satgas REDD+), an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>body</b> formed by presidential decree to design and implement REDD+ readiness activities in Indonesia, has attempted to mainstream the programme from 2010 to 2013. We develop a governmentality approach to focus on how the Task Force sought to introduce REDD+ carbon rationalities to forest politics. Based on extended ethnographic research, we identify three strategies: adopting and promoting the carbon discourses circulating among global REDD+ communities; making carbon visible and governable through mapping technologies; and implementing participatory technologies to encourage pro-REDD+ subjectivities. In some ways, the Task Force has been successful in building awareness about forest carbon among forest stakeholders in Indonesia. National civil society organisations, in particular, appear to be supportive of REDD+; however, they emphasise 'co-benefits' framed as 'Beyond Carbon', informed by social and environmental justice. For others, however, forests remain sources of timber and land, and new strategies are required if REDD+ is to have substantial impacts on forest governance in Indonesia. The Task Force's efforts reveal the difficult and contested processes through which global climate change programmes come to be embedded in national arenas. 16 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an original {{implementation of a}} two-parameters crack growth model for 2 D crack propagation simulations under general load spectrum. In such model, in order to unify the damage process, the following basic parameters are introduced for describing the overall fatigue process: K, Kmax and the internal stress contribution to Kmax. The coupled usage of Finite Element Method (FEM) and Dual Boundary Element Method (DBEM) is proposed {{in order to take}} advantage of the main capabilities of the two methods. The procedure is validated by comparison with in house obtained experimental results and its capability to predict the retardation phenomena following an overload is assessed. The numerical procedure is tested with reference to an MT aluminium specimen (2024 HP-T 3), whose fatigue calibration parameters had been previously determined using a CT specimen undergoing a constant amplitude load. As a matter of fact the main advantage of the aforementioned procedure is based on the simplicity of the crack growth law calibration, in fact, there is no need to calibrate on various overload levels but few constant amplitude test are sufficient. One of the main capabilities of the implemented procedure is the possibility to simulate load spectrum effects under linear elastic fracture mechanics, being the plastic effects simulated by <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>body</b> loads, imposed in the BEM analysis (by means of “load lines”), without the need for any non physical calibration parameters, as in many phenomenological models aimed at load spectra allowance (Willenborg model, Wheeler model, etc.).

40|$|The {{opportunities}} {{and limitations of}} Barnsley's educational provision for working-class children during the nineteenth century, were necessarily determined by the economic, social and religious changes which took place {{as a result of}} industrialisation. Prior to 1870, education for the masses was largely a matter for local charity, supplemented after 1833, by government grants. Children, if they went to school at all, attended Sunday schools and denominational day and evening schools where the concern was less with learning than with social and religious objectives. Destitute children could attend Ragged schools or the Workhouse school. For the exceptionally clever working-class child there was, in theory, the endowed grammar school. Private schools of various types were available for those who could pay. In 1870, Forster's Act extended the education of working-class children by putting it under the jurisdiction of the. Barnsley School Board, a locally elected, <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>body,</b> with powers to build and maintain schools out of the rates and to enforce compulsion on all {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 13. Despite numerous difficulties, this Board effected sweeping changes in the borough's educational outlook and administration. By the end of the century, new schools had been built, old ones extended, attendance increased and the scope of education considerably widened. When, in 1903, the Barnsley School Board was superseded by the Education Committee of the Town Council, a link with the past was retained when Board members were co-opted on to the new authority. These men, experienced in educational administration and alive to the needs of the working-class, were vital to the work of shaping the future educational policy of the borough...|$|E

40|$|The general {{theme is}} the {{experience}} of the Curriculum Development Unit as a case study in innovation in modern Irish education. The main time span is 1972 - 1987. The approach is broadly historical. The story of the Curriculum Development Unit is told in the context of {{what was happening in the}} Irish educational system during the period in question and, more broadly, in the context of the political and social development of contemporary Ireland. Against this background the Unit's experience is assessed - as an illustration of the influence of certain national events and also for the light that the development of the Unit itself can throw on these events. Two main research questions are addressed in the dissertation: What is the story underlying the Unit's efforts to institutionalise itself? How may this story be told by one of the principal actors involved? The focus of the research is on the efforts to institutionalise the innovative activities of the Unit. The main thesis is that this effort has largely failed mainly because of the strong centralising tendencies in the Irish system and the improbable nature of the Unit's sponsorship - a partnership between the local education authority, a university and a Government ministry. This is not to belittle the Unit's achievements; these perhaps have been all the more significant given the failure to institutionalise the Unit. The Unit may yet prove to be an interesting example of a phenomenon that is in keeping with the late twentieth century - an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>body</b> with no guarantee of survival, which manages to exist and even prosper in situations where more stable organisations are falling by the wayside...|$|E

40|$|Prior to 1871 public {{elementary}} {{education in the}} borough of South Shields was carried on by various bodies. These included the National Society, the British and Foreign Society, the Roman Catholic and the Presbyterian Church authorities and local industrial companies. There were eleven voluntary schools providing 5, 092 places for about 8, 000 children of school age. The curriculum in these schools was almost exclusively confined to the three R's as laid down by the Revised Code of 1862. II. The School Board was an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>body</b> set up under the Elementary Education Act, 1870,to provide the elementary school places which were urgently needed in the borough. Eleven school boards functioned successively between 1871 and 1903 providing the necessary school places. The Board built fifteen schools and took over the management of six voluntary schools providing accommodation for 14, 865 children. Nine voluntary schools also functioned in 1903 with 4, 918 places. Attendance was made compulsory from {{the inception of the}} Board and the school fees were high compared with other school boards. The Board's administration under the Elementary Education Acts and the regulations of the central authority was typical of the kind to be found in 'a poor and populous' district. It met the challenge of providing sufficient elementary school places when the population of the borough was rising rapidly and in spite of the opposition from the rate-payers. The struggle to gain control of the Board continued throughout its existence between the two opposing factions, the Sectarians and the Unsectarians. The Sectarians promoted the interests of the voluntary schools whilst the Unsectarians, who controlled nine of the eleven Boards, endeavoured to gain exclusive control of {{public elementary}} education in the borough. Despite this struggle the 'dual' system was firmly established when the new local authority took over the responsibility for public education under the Education Act o f 1902. III. By a generous interpretation of the Elementary Education Acts, together with the acquiescence of the Education Department, the Board provided higher elementary and technical education in its day and evening schools. Beginning with the Science and Art classes a t the Ocean Road Board School in 1887,the Board next built a higher grade department as part of the Westoe Road Board School in 1890; it was re-organised in 1895 as a higher grade and organised science school.
