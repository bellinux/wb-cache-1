Free to download, but structured around micro-payments, these games raise the complex relationship between game design and commercial strategies. Although offering a free gameplay experience in line with open <b>access</b> <b>philosophies,</b> these games also create systems that offer control over the temporal dynamics of that experience to monetise player attention and inattention.

In order to use BFlavor with state-of-the-art media formats, we have added support for transparent retrieval of context information and support for emulation prevention bytes. These extensions are validated by building a BFlavor code for bitstreams compliant with the scalable extension of the H. 264 /AVC specification. Performance measurements show that such a bitstream (containing a bitrate of 17 MBit/s) can be adapted in real-time by a BFlavor-based adaptation framework (with a speed of 27 MBit/s) ...|$|R

40|$|The Jewish {{communities}} of Occitania, known by medieval Jews as “Provence,” were unusually {{involved in the}} repeated outbreaks of public controversy over the integration of Greco-Islamic philosophy into Jewish intellectual culture. By {{the time of the}} early fourteenth-century controversy, Maimonideanism was a dominant cultural movement in the Mediterranean communities and Occitania in particular. Its critics, led by Abba-Mari b. Moses ha-Yarḥi (fl. c. 1300) in Montpellier and Solomon b. Abraham Ibn Adret (Rashba, c. 1235 -c. 1310) in Barcelona, were concerned with the potential for what I term ideational transgression. In contradistinction to the theological term heresy, ideational transgression denotes halakhic transgression deriving from a matter of conscience or ideology. This dissertation explores the motivations of proponents of a ban against the underage study of philosophy, and their approach to curtailing the activities they viewed as harmful. Ban proponents worried that rationalism would lead young people to reject the theoretical framework of Jewish law and thus, fail to observe it. Rather than developing ideational transgression as a halakhic category, however, an approach similar to that undertaken by Maimonides, ban proponents chose to regulate <b>access</b> to <b>philosophy</b> by means of excommunication. Levi b. Abraham b. Ḥayyim of Perpignan (c. 1245 -c. 1315), who popularized philosophy in encyclopedic compendia and in public teaching, serves as a test case for this approach. Moreover, I argue that the moderate center of the aristocracy was artificially polarized by the proposed legislation, despite their genuine concern about the radical implications of rationalism. My examination is undertaken through a careful study of the letter collection Minḥat Qenaʾot, which permits an unusually clear window into an understudied community just as it reached a critical turning point which reverberated throughout the Jewish world...|$|R

Yet, each system’s response {{to the problem of}} family violence is frequently different. Agency mission and <b>philosophy,</b> <b>access</b> to resources, political pressures and historical patterns of in-tervention all affect how each system responds. Child welfare workers remove children from their home when they believe the mother cannot protect the children despite safety planning. Domestic abuse ad-vocates see removal of the children as punishment of the mother and ask why the abuser is not held accountable for making the children unsafe. Increasingly, professionals from both systems identify reducing family violence and promoting positive, safe, and peaceful relationships among family members as their ultimate goal. Both child welfare workers and domestic abuse advocates must acknowledge and respect the complex and significant relationships that exist for the individuals they serve.

40|$|Open <b>Access</b> articleIn the <b>philosophy</b> of {{technology}} after the empirical turn, {{little attention has}} been paid to language and its relation to technology. In this programmatic and explorative paper, it is proposed to use the later Wittgenstein, not only to pay more attention to language use in philosophy {{of technology}}, but also to rethink technology itself—at least technology in its aspect of tool, technology-in-use. This is done by outlining a working account of Wittgenstein’s view of language (as articulated mainly in the Investigations) and by then applying that account to technology—turning around Wittgenstein’s metaphor of the toolbox. Using Wittgenstein’s concepts of language games and form of life and coining the term ‘technology games’, the paper proposes and argues for a use-oriented, holistic, transcendental, social, and historical approach to technology which is empirically but also normatively sensitive, and which takes into account implicit knowledge and know-how. It gives examples of interaction with social robots to support the relevance of this project for understanding and evaluating today’s technologies, makes comparisons with authors in philosophy of technology such as Winner and Ihde, and sketches the contours of a phenomenology and hermeneutics of technology use that may help us to understand but also to gain a more critical relation to specific uses of concrete technologies in everyday contexts. Ultimately, given the holism argued for, it also promises a more critical relation to the games and forms of life technologies are embedded in—to the ways we do things...|$|R
