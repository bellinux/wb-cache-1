40|$|Abstract. A {{cylindrical}} roller planetary traction drive was developed. It comprises a sun roller, three planetary rollers, an outer ring, a stationary carrier and <b>an</b> <b>input</b> <b>shaft.</b> The sun roller is hollow, and is connected through three logarithmic spiral profiles to the input shaft. As the input shaft rotates {{relative to the}} sun roller, a wedging action takes place between the input shaft and the sun roller; this makes the sun roller generate {{a certain amount of}} elastic deformation, so an appreciable amount of contact load is generated between the sun roller and the planetary roller. The greater the input torque is, the stronger the strength of the wedging action and the greater the contact load, and vice versa; so this configuration is self-actuating. Here, as {{cylindrical roller}}s are used in the planetary traction-drive configuration, the spin motion as would present in the case that the tapered rollers were used will not occur. Meanwhile, as a logarithmic spiral is used in the profile connection, the distribution of contact stress between the two connected surfaces will be uniform. This reduces the concentration of contact stress of the connected surfaces, and prolongs the life of the contact fatigue of the contacting surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Split-path {{transmissions}} are promising, attractive {{alternatives to}} the common planetary transmissions for helicopters. The split-path design offers two parallel paths for transmitting torque from the engine to the rotor. Ideally, the transmitted torque is shared equally between the two load paths; however, because of manufacturing tolerances, the design must be sized to allow for other than equal load sharing. To study the effect of tolerances, experiments were conducted using the NASA split-path test gearbox. Two gearboxes, nominally identical except for manufacturing tolerances, were tested. The clocking angle {{was considered to be}} a design parameter and used to adjust the load sharing of an otherwise fixed design. The torque carried in each path was measured for a matrix of input torques and clocking angles. The data were used to determine the optimal value and a tolerance for the clocking angles such that the most heavily loaded split path carried no greater than 53 percent of <b>an</b> <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> torque of 367 N-m. The range of clocking angles satisfying this condition was - 0. 0012 +/- 0. 0007 rad for box 1 and - 0. 0023 +/- 0. 0009 rad for box 2. This study indicates that split-path gearboxes can be used successfully in rotorcraft and can be manufactured with existing technology...|$|E

40|$|Wet {{friction}} clutches are machine elements enabling the power transmission from <b>an</b> <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> to an output shaft during the operation, {{based on the}} friction occurring in lubricated contacting surfaces. These components {{play a critical role}} in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions, power shift transmissions and limited slip differentials. An unexpected failure occurring in clutches can lead to an unexpected total breakdown of the vehicle. This undesirable situation can put human safety at risk, possibly cause long-term vehicle down times, and eventually result in high maintenance costs. In order to minimize the negative impacts, an optimal maintenance strategy, i. e. a condition based maintenance (CBM), driven by an accurate condition monitoring and prognostics therefore needs to be developed and implemented for wet {{friction clutches}}. A literature study has been carried out during this work in order to establish the state-of-the-art development of clutch monitoring and prognostics systems. Despite the fact that the performance demands for clutches increase, research in this direction is apparently very limited. Several methods related to this aspect have been reported in literature, but, they are not sufficiently pragmatic and flexible to implement for real-life applications. To fill this substantial gap, development of a clutch monitoring and prognostics method that can be easily implemented on real-life applications is the main objective of this thesis. There are two main failure modes that can interrupt the functionality of wet friction clutches as reported in the literature, namely (i) lubricant and (ii) friction material degradations. This thesis mainly focuses on the failure of wet friction clutches caused by the friction material degradation, which is a valid assumption for heavy-duty applications. In this scope, a better understanding of how friction material degradation affects the clutch dynamic behavior during its operation is of paramount importance for developing an effective clutch monitoring and prognostics system. In the first place, this thesis contributes to the contact modeling of nominally flat rough surfaces with asymmetric asperity heights distribution, which is relevant for clutch contact problems. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art of the clutch friction characteristics is established that leads to the derivation of a friction model appropriate for clutches, wherein some considerably important friction phenomena are taken into account. Subsequently, the effects of two major friction material degradation mechanisms, namely (i) adhesive wear and (ii) thermal degradation, on the clutch contact and friction characteristics are theoretically and experimentally investigated, which is the second contribution of this thesis. A novel experimental procedure, which is the third contribution, is proposed in order to systematically evaluate how the sliding friction characteristics of a clutch evolve during the lifetime. This way, the evolution of the frictionmodel parameters can be observed and quantified. A knowledge gained from the aforementioned evolution motivates to model and simulate the dynamic responses of a degrading clutch system. Based on the simulation results, some measurable ``features'' representing the progression of the clutch friction material degradation are derived, which is the fourth contribution. A feasibility study on the derived features recommends to develop two clutch monitoring methods: i. e. (a) post-lockup-features-based method and (b) pre-lockup-features-based method. In the first monitoring method, which is the fifth contribution, the torsional natural frequency and the corresponding damping extracted from the post-lockup torsional vibration signals are proposed as relevant features. The second monitoring method, which is the sixth contribution, utilizes the relative velocity signals of interest for extracting the relevant features, i. e. (i) the normalized engagement duration, (ii) normalized Euclidean distance and (iii) Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) distance. In order to evaluate and verify the developed monitoring methods, accelerated life tests (ALTs) were carried out on some commercial wet clutches using a fully instrumented SAE # 2 test setup which is designed by an industrial partner, Dana-Spicer Off Highway Belgium. The experimental results confirm that the developed monitoring methods are feasible to be used for practical applications. As the last contribution, a data-driven health assessment and prognostics method which can be used to assess the condition and to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of wet friction clutches is developed. This strategy has been successfully evaluated and verified on some commercially available wet clutches. The evaluation and verification show that the developed strategy is prospective for aiding a condition based maintenance for wet friction clutches. nrpages: 284 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} and development of SMA based actuator mechanisms are being pursued at many places. In this paper the on going {{research and}} development efforts at ACD, NAL to realize a SMA based actuator mechanism for deployment of a control surface model is discussed. The mechanism can be modified to either give a rotary or a linear output. The deployment of this control surface model was successfully demonstrated using the SMA based rotary actuator mechanism along with computerised powering devices and controls. This control surface model is deployed only during landing in order to improve the landing characteristics of the aircraft and remains retracted at all other times. The real challenge is the design and development of the SMA based mechanism, which will satisfy the weight and volume budget and more importantly consume minimum power. An innovative 3 -gear relay arrangement was chosen primarily to save the power. In this type of arrangement 3 different input gears mounted on 3 independent <b>input</b> <b>shafts</b> are used to drive the same output shaft on which the control surface model is mounted. Independent banks of SMA wires drive each of the 3 <b>input</b> <b>shafts.</b> The actuation of the <b>input</b> <b>shafts</b> is done in a sequential manner and each them rotates the control surface model by different angles. At any given time only one bank of SMA is energized and therefore the power consumption reduces significantly in contrast to a case where the complete rotation of the control surface model has to be effected by <b>a</b> single <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> power by <b>a</b> single bank of SMA. The state of art electronics and controls in order to achieve the above sequential actuation include miniaturized power devices, data acquisition, and controller of SMA actuation and health monitoring of SMA.

SMAs can be actuated by heating using external heaters or by resistive heating. For better control, high efficiency, compactness and silent operation, resistive heating is preferred.
