5|$|To Sukarno, {{this sort}} of {{operation}} {{had a number of}} merits.

Indonesia had also pulled off a successful operation using similar techniques in the West Irian campaign against the Dutch a decade previous, a raiding campaign into Western New Guinea had ended with the Dutch ceding that territory to prevent Indonesia from 'falling' to Communism.|$|E

Albanian migration to Italy reached its peak {{in the latter half of}} March, bringing great pressure to Italian accommodation centers and provoking a strong reaction in Italian public opinion. Italy had been operating under a bilateral agreement with Albania to board Albanian vessels whenever encountered starting on 3 April 1997 and Albanian would-be migrants going to Italy would be sent back to Albania, in exchange for Italian financial, police, and humanitarian assistance to the country. <b>A</b> <b>military</b> <b>Operation</b> White Flags was established in the international waters of the Strait and implemented a de facto naval blockade.|$|E

On February 16, 1898, Barbosa rushed to Muñoz Rivera's home. He had just learned that the American vessel USS Maine had sunk {{off the coast of}} Cuba, which would most likely spark a war between Spain and the United States. Barbosa {{expected}} the American government to grant Puerto Rico autonomy if they gained control. However, Muñoz Rivera was saddened by the news, knowing that the United States was planning to build a canal in Panama, and that Puerto Rico would be a strategic location to protect the structure.

The MPLA government tried unsuccessfully to take UNITA's supply depot in Mavinga from Menongue. While the attack failed, very different interpretations of the attack emerged. UNITA claimed Portuguese-speaking Soviet officers led FAPLA troops while the government said UNITA relied on South African paratroopers to defeat the MPLA attack. The South African government admitted to fighting in the area, but said its troops fought SWAPO militants.|$|E

Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>operation.</b> He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued. The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major, who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador's armored car. Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the Major from reneging on the deal.
