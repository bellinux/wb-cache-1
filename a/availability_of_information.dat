25|$|Consciousness in mammals (this {{includes}} humans) is {{an aspect}} of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as subjectivity, sentience, and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one's environment. It is a subject of much research in philosophy of mind, psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science. Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to processing systems in the brain. Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as qualia. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness of something or about something, a property known as intentionality in philosophy of mind.|$|E
25|$|Its {{policy of}} not {{revealing}} its name, finances, doctrine or history, and avoidance of publicity. largely kept the church from public notice. A few authors of popular literature {{have noted the}} church, even using it as background for various works. Notes regarding the Two by Twos appeared even more infrequently in religious journals and sociological works, with some writers assuming that the church had greatly declined, with nothing published regarding it. The publication of The Secret Sect in the early 1980s, followed by press reports and public statements by former members, however, increased {{public awareness of the}} church. <b>Availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on the Internet since the 1990s has also resulted in a loosening of the strict standards demanded of members.|$|E

The general principles of openness and transparency are reaffirmed in the articles 8 A, point 3 and 10.3 of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Maastricht Treaty respectively, stating that [...] "every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union. Decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen".

500|$|Imagery {{found on}} prehistoric murals and rock {{paintings}} of modern-day Spain and Algeria suggests that human usage of psilocybin mushrooms predates recorded history. In Mesoamerica, the mushrooms {{had long been}} consumed in spiritual and divinatory ceremonies before Spanish chroniclers first documented their use in the 16th century. In a 1957 Life magazine article, American banker and ethnomycologist [...] described his experiences ingesting psilocybin-containing mushrooms during a traditional ceremony in Mexico, introducing the substance to popular culture. In 1959, the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann isolated the active principle psilocybin from the mushroom Psilocybe mexicana. Hofmann's employer Sandoz marketed and sold pure psilocybin to physicians and clinicians worldwide for use in psychedelic psychotherapy. Although the increasingly restrictive drug laws of the late 1960s curbed scientific research into the effects of psilocybin and other hallucinogens, its popularity as an entheogen (spirituality-enhancing agent) grew in the next decade, owing largely to the increased <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on how to cultivate psilocybin mushrooms.|$|E
