40|$|The growing {{popularity}} of the electrical <b>arc</b> <b>furnace</b> in metallurgical industries causes significant impact on power grids, transient stability and quality of power supply. Being non-linear in nature, <b>arc</b> <b>furnaces</b> produce harmonics and inter-harmonics of arc voltage and current in electrical networks. Moreover, due to random load variation, the phenomenon of voltage fluctuation is found during <b>arc</b> <b>furnace</b> operation. Therefore, {{it is important to}} model the random behaviour of the <b>arc</b> <b>furnace.</b> The aims of this thesis are to investigate the applicability of the conventional and "black box" modelling techniques in modelling the response of an <b>arc</b> <b>furnace.</b> Conventional modelling approaches are used to obtain the instantaneous voltage and current wave forms of the <b>arc</b> <b>furnace,</b> while black box modelling approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS), are used to capture the random and time varying pattern of <b>arc</b> <b>furnace</b> power consumption which is due to random changes of the bus voltage.

40|$|Corresponding author) Electric <b>Arc</b> <b>Furnaces</b> (EAFs) are unbalanced, {{nonlinear}} {{and time}} varying loads, {{which can cause}} many problems in the power system quality. As the use of <b>arc</b> <b>furnace</b> loads increases in industry, {{the importance of the}} power quality problems also increase. So in order to optimize the usages of electric power in EAFs, it is necessary to minimize the effects of <b>arc</b> <b>furnace</b> loads on power quality in power systems as much as possible. Therefore, in this paper, design and simulation of an electric plant supplying an <b>arc</b> <b>furnace</b> is considered. For this purpose, a three phase <b>arc</b> <b>furnace</b> model, which can simulate all the mentioned power quality indices, is developed based on Hyperbolic-Exponential model (V-I model). Then by considering the high changes of reactive power and voltage flicker of nonlinear furnace load, a thyristor controlled reactor compensation with fixed capacitor (TCR/FC) are designed and simulated. In this procedure, the reactive power is measured so that maximum speed and accuracy are achieved. Finally, simulation results verify the accuracy of the load modelling and show the effectiveness of the proposed TCR/FC model for reactive compensating of the EAF...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of feedforward semi-empirical control models for furnaces and {{the evaluation of}} mass balances are based on plant data. The models can only {{be as good as}} the data and it is therefore required to know the inherent uncertainty associated with the plant data. This uncertainty stems mainly {{from the fact that the}} slag, alloy or dust, have a distributed nature that depends on the degree of mixedness. It is commonly accepted that melts from open bath furnaces are well-mixed, and submerged <b>arc</b> <b>furnaces</b> less so. The impact of this assumption is significant, as a reasonably homogeneous melt could be represented by one sample only. As so much of metallurgical control depends on the assay information of the alloy and slag melts from furnaces, it was decided to characterise the possible variation in melt chemistry and temperature. Sampling campaigns and continuous temperature measurement of the melts were performed for different alloy and slag taps at a major ferrochrome producer.
