40|$|Thirty-three in-patients {{attended}} for non-contrast enhanced {{computed tomography}} (CT) of chest and/or abdomen within a six-week period (11 M, 21 F). All had measurement of their full blood profile within the previous 72 hours. Patients with a blood dyscrasia or known history of active bleeding were excluded. All patients were imaged using a Siemens Somatom Plus S scanner. The scanning parameters were standardised at 210 mA, 120 kV, 10 mm slice thickness, pitch of 1. Following image review, circular regions of interest (ROI) were defined within the lumina of the aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC) {{at the level}} of the superior mesenteric artery origin. The mean <b>attenuation</b> <b>value</b> was calculated using on-board computer software, and recorded. The mean patient age was 59. 6 years (range 18 - 85 years). A non-parametric correlation analysis was performed and a linear regression plot obtained. A significant correlation was demonstrated between haemoglobin measurement and the aortic and IVC <b>attenuation</b> <b>value.</b> The correlation was stronger (r = 0. 64) for the aortic <b>attenuation</b> <b>value</b> than for the IVC attenuation values (r = 0. 57). In addition, if anaemia is defined as less than 14 g/I for a male and less than 12 g/I for a female, then, in our study group, no male with an aortic <b>attenuation</b> <b>value</b> greater than 50 HU and no female with an aortic attenuation greater than 45 HU was found to be anaemic. The results demonstrate a significant correlation between patients' haemoglobin measurement and the derived aortic <b>attenuation</b> <b>value.</b> We do not propose this as a method of accurately measuring the patient's haemoglobin; however, we feel that it may be possible for a radiologist at non-contrast enhanced CT examination to note the probable presence of anaemia...|$|E
30|$|For {{detection}} of thromboemboli, a threshold value of 140 Hounsfield Unit (HU) {{was chosen as}} the minimally-necessary enhancement value in the vessel. Generally, CT <b>attenuation</b> <b>value</b> of thrombus is 50 – 80 HU, plaque (mainly fat and fiber) of the coronary artery is less than 120 HU, and plaque (mainly calcification) of the coronary artery is higher than 120 HU (Schroeder et al. 2004). The contrast discrimination threshold (namely, CT value difference by which radiologists never fails to distinguish among tissues) is approximately 20 HU (Ariji et al. 1993). Therefore, theoretically, thrombus without including calcification can be detected when CT <b>attenuation</b> <b>value</b> in the vessel is higher than 140 HU.|$|E

Methods: The study included 80 male subjects assigned to experimental (with training) and control (without training) groups. The following procedures were performed: occupational history, objective and subjective assessment of hearing protectors. Only subjects {{in the experimental group}} received training and guidance on proper hearing protector insertion. Results: <b>Attenuation</b> <b>values</b> were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group at all frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) investigated through the objective (MIRE) and subjective (REAT) methods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study {{was to assess the}} role of a 64 -slice multidetector CT (MDCT) scanner in the {{characterization}} of different solid renal masses, using a simplified approach to correct the postenhancement <b>attenuation</b> <b>values.</b> The study included 96 consecutive adults (58 men, 38 women) with renal masses; 93 with unilateral and three with bilateral masses. All of our patients underwent multiphasic CT study including pre- and postcontrast corticomedullary (CM) and nephrographic phases. We analyzed the images and corrected the postcontrast <b>attenuation</b> <b>values</b> at the CM phase. The postbiopsy or -surgical data were used as reference standard. There were 53 masses at the right kidney, 40 at the left kidney, and three bilateral. The final diagnosis of the 96 solid parenchymal masses were 28 clear-type renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 22 papillary-type RCC, 21 chromophobe-type RCC, six XP 11. 2 chromosomal translocation–type RCC, 15 angiomyolipoma (AML), and seven oncocytoma. All the AML had fat, with <b>attenuation</b> <b>values</b> less than - 40 HU at the nonenhanced scan. There is no difference in the precontrast <b>attenuation</b> <b>values</b> for the different types other than AML. At the postcontrast CM phase after the correction of the <b>attenuation</b> <b>values,</b> the clear cell type could be separated easily, with <b>attenuation</b> <b>values</b> > 20 with specificity, sensitivity, and overall accuracy of 92, 84, and 93 %, respectively.

40|$|Perfusion {{computed}} tomography (CT) method {{has been used}} to differentiate malignant pulmonary nodules from benign nodules based on the assessment for the change of the CT <b>attenuation</b> <b>value</b> within the pulmonary nodules. Instead of using the change of the CT <b>attenuation</b> <b>value,</b> a set of fractal features based on fractional Brownian motion model is proposed in this paper to automatically distinguish malignant nodules from benign nodules. In a set of 107 CT images from 107 different patients with each image containing a solitary pulmonary nodule, our experimental results obtained from a support vector machine classifier show that the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the ROC curve are 83. 11 %, 90. 92 %, 71. 70 %, 80. 05 %, 87. 52 %, and 0. 8437, respectively, by using the proposed fractal-based feature set. Such a result outperforms the conventional method of using the change of the CT <b>attenuation</b> <b>value</b> as the feature for classification. When combining this conventional method with our proposed fractal-based method, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the ROC curve can be promoted to 88. 82 %, 93. 92 %, 82. 90 %, 87. 30 %, 90. 20 %, and 0. 9019, respectively.

In this case, the [...] "static" [...] image is less affected by the motion noise than the ordinary calculated radiographic image. The reason is that the E(D) values are calculated by averaging the series of <b>attenuation</b> <b>values</b> computed from the corresponding series of photon numbers (from the underexposed images) and converted into a logarithm.

Noncontrast head DECT scans were acquired with 2 X-ray tubes operated at 80 [*]kV and Sn 150 [*]kV between 32 minutes and 20 {{hours after the}} onset. Using these DECT scans, the X-map was reconstructed based on 3 -material decomposition and compared with a simulated standard (120 [*]kV) computed tomography (CT) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). ResultsThe X-map showed more sensitivity to identify the lesions as an area of lower <b>attenuation</b> <b>value</b> than a simulated standard CT in all 6 patients.

Preoperative HRCT scans were obtained with 1 -cm intervals in 38 subjects. With a semiautomatic evaluation procedure, the percentage areas occupied by <b>attenuation</b> <b>values</b> inferior to thresholds ranging from - 900 Hounsfield units (HU) to - 970 HU were calculated for the lobe or lung to be resected. Emphysema was microscopically quantified by using a computer-based method, measuring the perimeters and interwall distances of alveoli and alveolar ducts. The strongest correlation was found for - 950 HU. As a second step, we evaluated possible correlations between PFT and microscopic measurements. Finally, considering the microscopic measurements as a standard, we tried to investigate their relationships with each of the PFT and with the relative area occupied by <b>attenuation</b> <b>values</b> lower than - 950 HU for both lungs. This revealed that the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide associated with HRCT quantification is sufficient to predict microscopic measurements.

Materials and Methods: We reviewed the records of 75 patients who underwent SWL for urinary calculi measuring 5 to 20 mm.
