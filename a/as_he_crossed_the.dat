5|$|A {{moment of}} silence was also held for Weylandt before stage 11, as his funeral took place the same day. Pieter Weening also gave the first pink jersey to be {{presented}} {{to him on the}} podium to Weylandt's surviving family, and stage 11 winner John Gadret stated that he had had Weylandt in his thoughts <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> line and dedicated his win to him, even though the two were not well acquainted.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E
5|$|Five days later, {{teammate}} {{and close}} friend Vasil Kiryienka rode {{to victory in}} a solo effort, and he too dedicated the stage victory to Tondó, pointing skyward <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> finish line. The team had met to consider withdrawing from the race after Tondó's death, but instead the riders unanimously voted to ride on. Kiryienka commented that the squad at the Giro hoped to get a further stage win (as Francisco Ventoso's win had come before Tondó's death) to honor him, while {{other members of the}} team grieved with Tondó's family. In {{the final days of the}} race, many fans wrote signs memorializing Tondó as they had with Weylandt earlier on.|$|E

5|$|Hill was {{qualifying}} for a 1997 event at Sonoma when his car suffered severe vibration <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> finish line. The car {{went out of}} control and was completely destroyed. Hill had two broken toes and a shoulder contusion, which were not serious injuries. The run had been fast enough to make Hill the fastest qualifier, and Hill wanted to race his backup car in the first round on the day after the accident. The NHRA had a rule that the car used for qualifying had {{to be used in the}} event, so the sanctioning body did not allow him to compete. The rule was changed after the event to allow racers to race on race day even if they do not use the same car.|$|E
5|$|Harclay had {{deployed}} his men on foot to {{hold the}} bridge from the northern side. Additional forces were placed at a nearby ford, though contemporary sources do not specify {{the exact location of}} this ford. The royal pikemen were deployed in a schiltron formation, a tactic learned from the Scots in the Scottish wars. The formation proved effective against the oncoming cavalry. The rebels divided into two columns; one led by Hereford and Roger de Clifford, attacking the bridge on foot, the other under Lancaster, trying to cross the ford by horse. According to a graphic description in the chronicle the Brut, Hereford was killed <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> bridge by a pikeman hiding underneath, who thrust his spear up through the Earl's anus. Clifford was also severely injured, and that column of the army fell into disarray. Lancaster's party fared little better; under heavy archery fire his cavalry was cut off before it even reached the ford, and was forced to retreat. This event shows an early – if not entirely novel – effective use of the longbow against cavalry, a tactic which was to become central to future English military success.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attacks on}} the final climb came from Barguil and Van Avermaet, {{followed}} by Yates, while Rodríguez and Valverde waited in the main group. Yates passed Barguil and was chasing Van Avermaet, {{who was in the}} lead of the race. Towards the top of the climb, however, Van Avermaet was hit from behind by one of the motorbikes providing television coverage of the race. He was knocked to the ground and the frame of the bike was broken; Van Avermaet was unable to finish the race. Yates therefore led the race alone {{at the top of the}} final climb as the race descended into San Sebastián. Unlike in the 2014 race, when he had crashed out of the lead group on the final descent, Yates extended his lead to 15 seconds as the road flattened out and was able to keep this advantage to the end of the race. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> finish line, Yates was unaware that he had won the race, as he believed that the initial breakaway had not been caught. It took some time for the message to come through from his team that he had won. In the group behind, Gilbert sprinted to second place ahead of Valverde.|$|E

25|$|Ullrich was {{defending}} champion in 1998. He took the yellow jersey on stage 7, a time trial, over 58km of undulating roads. However, on stage 15 Marco Pantani blew the Tour apart {{with a victory}} which began on the Galibier. Ullrich was without support when Pantani attacked. Pantani topped the Galibier alone. It was misty and the roads were wet. The descent was dangerous and Pantani increased his lead. By {{the bottom of the}} final climb, Les Deux Alpes, Pantani had nearly four minutes. Telekom brought Udo Bölts and then Riis to pace Ullrich. Pantani was race leader <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> line. Ullrich finished almost nine minutes back, dropping to fourth position, six minutes behind Pantani.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, at Fort Duquesne, the French {{garrison}} {{consisted of}} only about 250 regulars and Canadian militia, with about 640 Indian allies camped outside the fort. The Indians were {{from a variety of}} tribes long associated with the French, including Ottawas, Ojibwas, and Potawatomis. Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur, the Canadian commander, received reports from Indian scouting parties that the British {{were on their way to}} besiege the fort. He realised he could not withstand Braddock's cannon, and decided to launch a preemptive strike, an ambush of Braddock's army <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Monongahela River. The Indian allies were initially reluctant to attack such a large British force, but the French field commander Daniel Liénard de Beaujeu, who dressed himself in full war regalia complete with war paint, convinced them to follow his lead.|$|E

After Caerlaverock eventually succumbed, Edward passed through Dumfries again <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Nith to take his invasion into Galloway. With the Scottish nobility having requested Vatican support for their cause, Edward on his return to Caerlaverock was presented with a missive directed to him by Pope Boniface VII. Edward held court in Dumfries at which he grudgingly agreed to an armistice. On 30 October, the truce solicited by Pope Boniface was signed by Edward at Dumfries. Letters from Edward, dated at Dumfries, were sent to his subordinates throughout Scotland, ordering them to give effect to the treaty. The peace was to last till Whitsunday in the following year.|$|E
50|$|A {{tradition}} {{connected to}} the race is the custom to choose a kranskulla.

She is dressed in the traditional folk costume of Dalarna. With the event of the women's race, Tjejvasan in 1988, a male kransmas was also appointed.

50|$|The {{painting}} was originally attributed to Caravaggio by Roberto Longhi in 1916. This {{is one of}} only two known Caravaggios on a theme from Classical mythology, although this is due more to the accidents of survival than the artist's oeuvre.

25|$|The final 10-minute {{shoot-out}} {{began with}} very close lap times. As the chequered flag fell everyone {{was on their}} final lap. Button {{was the first of}} the main contenders to cross it for the final time and he didn't improve and stayed 5th. Next was Barrichello <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> line and didn't improve and stayed 2nd. Kovalainen looked set for pole position but a lockup and a slide in the final corner could only get him up into second, so Hamilton didn't feel the need to complete his lap with no one else on fast laps. Hamilton got his first pole position of the season, but more importantly, it was a McLaren 1–2. Barrichello came third and a surprise 4th for Vettel as he split the Brawns. Räikkönen even with race fuel on board posted a lap time that was 1.279 seconds quicker than Luca Badoer's time in Q1 on low fuel. This was also the first time Lewis Hamilton had been on pole since the 2008 Chinese Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|Possibly {{because of}} Thornton's delay in {{crossing}} {{the river and}} the withering artillery fire that might hit them from across the river, the 93rd Highlanders were ordered to leave Keane's assault column advancing along the river and move across the open field to join the main force on the right of the field. Keane fell wounded <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> field with the 93rd. Rennie's men managed to attack and overrun an American advance redoubt next to the river, but without reinforcements they could neither hold the position nor successfully storm the main American line behind it. Within a few minutes, the American 7th Infantry arrived, moved forward, and fired upon the British in the captured redoubt: within half an hour, Rennie and nearly all of his men were dead. In the main attack on the right, the British infantrymen either flung themselves to the ground, huddled in the canal, or were mowed down by a combination of musket fire and grapeshot from the Americans. A handful {{made it to the top}} of the parapet on the right but were either killed or captured. The 95th Rifles had advanced in open skirmish order ahead of the main assault force and were concealed in the ditch below the parapet, unable to advance further without support.|$|E
25|$|After a {{break in}} competition, Sagan came back in May at the Tour of California. On the first stage, he {{finished}} second, in the slipstream of Mark Cavendish. He again came in second position {{on the next day}} to Cavendish, but this time he lost by half-a-wheel. On stage 3, Sagan once more reaped second position after a lone breaker, Toms Skujiņš, made it to the finish a minute before him. On Stage 4, Sagan won the day by powering away from Wouter Wippert and Cavendish on the small incline before the line. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> finish, Sagan banged his front wheel twice on the tarmac and treated the crowd to a no-footed wheelie afterward to celebrate. On the fifth stage, Sagan came in third position. However, in the ensuing Time Trial in Santa Clarita, Sagan imposed himself on the flat and slightly technical circuit, grabbing the general classification jersey in the process. On the following day's seventh stage climb up Mount Baldy, Sagan lost the overall lead to Julian Alaphilippe, however he put in a surprisingly strong performance to end the day two seconds behind Alaphilippe in the overall standings, and giving him a chance of taking the general classification through time bonuses on the final stage. He took a second out of Alaphilippe's lead in the intermediate sprint on the last stage to Pasadena, before pipping Tyler Farrar for third place on the finish line, taking a four-second bonus which gave him the overall win by three seconds.|$|E
