25|$|But, at {{the quantum}} phase transition, the {{localization}} lengths of the electrons becomes infinite (i.e. they delocalize) and this compromises the Fermi-liquid assumption of an inherently free electron gas (where individual electrons must be well-distinguished). The quantum Hall transition will therefore {{not be in}} the Fermi-liquid universality class, but in the F-invariant' universality class that has a different value for the critical exponent. The semi-classical percolation picture of the quantum Hall transition is therefore outdated (although still widely used) <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> understand the delocalization mechanism as an instanton effect.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{served as}} a sort of {{opposite}} to the popular idea that The Waste Land {{served as a}}n expression of disillusionment after World [...] War I, even though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. World War II itself has a direct mention in only a few of Eliot's writings. However, World War II does affect the poem, especially with the disruption caused by the war being reflected within the poem as a disruption of nature and heaven. The poem describes society in ways similar to The Waste Land, especially with its emphasis on death and dying. The place is connected to where Eliot's family originates, and, as such, is also the place where his family will symbolically end. In {{the second part of the}} poem, nature is experiencing disorder, and it is suggested that humans too may burn, and also that reason, knowledge, and science cannot save people. The errors of our past become the reasons for war and conflict <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> become humble in order to escape the destruction. However, darkness consumes the rulers of the world and society. This is, in part, due to Adam's fall, and the resulting concept of original sin. Christ is our savior <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> seek redemption to overcome our human failings. Eliot states that he has been involved with fighting for humanity and trying to help mankind learn what is important. Only through Christ is man able to be redeemed.|$|E

[...] Dmitry Medvedev, the prime minister, called for a ban on non-traditional alcoholic liquids like the bath lotion, stating that [...] "it's an outrage, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> {{put an end to}} this". Days later, the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Putin planned to lower taxes on alcohol in an effort to curb the use of unsafe alcohol substitutes, requiring officials to present a plan by 31 March 2017.|$|E

[...] In January 1985, Monsignor John P. Languille sent a memo to all Los Angeles social service directors, ordering them to cease referring homeless women to the shelter Vaughan supervised [...] "because of [...] pro-abortion position". Vaughan was reportedly expelled in February 1985 but in April 1986 she spoke to the Los Angeles Times {{to say that the}} Church had closed the case without requiring her to retract her statement. With the help of her superior, Sister Miriam Therese Larkin of St. Louis, Missouri, she retained her position in the order, and Languille's memo was overturned.|$|E

500|$|Myrie-Williams joined League Two side Port Vale on loan on 24 November, {{joining the}} club until January 2012. A day later, on 25 November, {{he made his}} debut for Port Vale in a 0–0 home draw against Torquay United, playing the whole match. During the game, he {{impressed}} manager Micky Adams— [...] "He (Myrie-Williams) lifted me, as I'm asking people to be positive and show character, because the fans are disappointed {{with the way things}} have gone recently, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> give them something to shout about, which I believe he did.

In his next appearance for the club, he scored the equalising goal in a 2–1 win at Dagenham & Redbridge, when he [...] "blasted in" [...] a [...] "25-yard blockbuster"– fellow Stevenage loanee Madjo went on to score the winning goal. Myrie-Williams' effort was Vale's first goal in 502 minutes (more than five games) of football. He won a penalty in his fourth game for the club, which was converted by Marc Richards to give Vale a 2–1 win at Hereford United. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored one goal in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E
500|$|The plot which {{involved}} Rachel and Kurt attracted uniformly favorable reviews. Fallon called it [...] "one of the episode's strongest subplots", and Salon.com Matt Zoller Seitz deemed it the episode's [...] "most successful and affecting." [...] Bell named Rachel and Kurt as her favorite Glee pairing, and Futterman wrote that their [...] "friendship {{has grown from}} something catty into something genuine and relatable and their interactions are likely the most authentic for any aspiring musical theater performers among Glee viewers." [...] Within his generally negative review of the episode, VanDerWerff noted that the NYADA mixer scene [...] "features {{some of the best}} work Chris Colfer and Lea Michele have contributed to the show." [...] In contrast, the adult storylines were generally poorly received. Zoller Seitz branded Will and Emma's relationship boring, and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly disliked the fact the season began with them in an established relationship: [...] "I feel like I missed a huge leap for Emma <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have it acknowledged." [...] Fallon disparaged Will as being [...] "insufferable", and attributed this to [...] "Morrison's wooden characterization, the stilted writing [...] the flat purpose that the character serves on the show". Sue's storyline was described as nonsensical by VanDerWerff, who wrote that she [...] "has decided to take her crusade against the glee club to a congressional district-wide audience, because, well, she was the most popular character in season one, and she will be again, via blunt force, if necessary." [...] Reiter, however, found Sue to be [...] "in perfect form in this episode, neither too mean nor too misty", and enjoyed her storyline.|$|E
