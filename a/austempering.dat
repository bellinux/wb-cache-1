50|$|<b>Austempering</b> is heat {{treatment}} that {{is applied to}} ferrous metals, most notably steel and ductile iron. In steel it produces a bainite microstructure whereas in cast irons it produces a structure of acicular ferrite and high carbon, stabilized austenite known as ausferrite.

The resulting steel, called bainite, produces an acicular microstructure in the steel that has great strength (but less than martensite), greater ductility, higher impact resistance, and less distortion than martensite steel.

5000|$|The {{most notable}} {{difference}} between <b>austempering</b> and conventional quench and tempering {{is that it}} involves holding the workpiece at the quenching temperature {{for an extended period}} of time.

50|$|Tempering {{may also}} be {{performed}} on normalized steels. Other methods of tempering consist of quenching to a specific temperature, which is above the martensite start temperature, and then holding it there until pure bainite can form or internal stresses can be relieved. These include <b>austempering</b> and martempering.|$|E
50|$|No {{tempering}} {{is required}} after <b>austempering</b> if the part is through hardened and fully transformed to either Bainite or ausferrite.

50|$|<b>Austempering</b> is a {{hardening}} {{process that is}} used on iron-based metals to promote better mechanical properties. The metal is heated into the austenite region of the iron-cementite phase diagram and then quenched in a salt bath or other heat extraction medium that is between temperatures of 300 - 375 C. The metal is annealed in this temperature range until the austenite turns to bainite or ausferrite (bainitic ferrite + high-carbon austenite).|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} uses of {{austempered}} steel was in rifle bolts during World War II. The high impact strength possible at high hardnesses, and the relatively small section size of the components made austempered steel ideal for this application. Over subsequent decades <b>austempering</b> revolutionized the spring industry followed by clips and clamps. These components, which are usually thin, formed parts, do not require expensive alloys and generally possess better elastic properties than their tempered Martensite counterparts. Eventually austempered steel made {{its way into the}} automotive industry where one of its first uses was in safety critical components. The majority of car seat brackets and seat belt components are made of austempered steel because of its high strength and ductility. [...] These properties allow it to absorb significantly more energy during a crash without the risk of brittle failure. Currently, austempered steel is also used in bearings, mower blades, transmission gear, wave plate, and turf aeration tines. [...] In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century the <b>austempering</b> process began to be applied commercially to cast irons. Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI) was first commercialized in the early 1970s and has since become a major industry.|$|E
50|$|Interrupted {{quenching}} {{methods are}} {{often referred to}} as tempering, although the processes are very different from traditional tempering. These methods consist of quenching to a specific temperature that is above the martensite start (Ms) temperature, and then holding at that temperature for extended amounts of time. Depending on the temperature and the amount of time, this allows either pure bainite to form, or holds-off forming the martensite until much of the internal stresses relax. These methods are known as <b>austempering</b> and martempering.|$|E
50|$|<b>Austempering</b> is a {{technique}} used to form pure bainite, a transitional microstructure found between pearlite and martensite. In normalizing, both upper and lower bainite are usually found mixed with pearlite. To avoid the formation of pearlite or martensite, the steel is quenched in a bath of molten metals or salts. This quickly cools the steel past the point where pearlite can form, and into the bainite-forming range. The steel is then held at the bainite-forming temperature, beyond {{the point where the}} temperature reaches an equilibrium, until the bainite fully forms. The steel is then removed from the bath and allowed to air-cool, without the formation of either pearlite or martensite.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>austempering</b> {{of steel}} was first pioneered in the 1930s by Edgar C. Bain and Edmund S. Davenport, {{who were working}} for the United States Steel Corporation at that time. Bainite must have been present in steels long before its {{acknowledged}} discovery date, but was not identified because of the limited metallographic techniques available and the mixed microstructures formed by the heat treatment practices of the time. Coincidental circumstances inspired Bain to study isothermal phase transformations. Austenite and the higher temperature phases of steel were {{becoming more and more}} understood and it was already known that austenite could be retained at room temperature. Through his contacts at the American Steel and Wire Company, Bain was aware of isothermal transformations being used in industry and he began to conceive new experiments ...|$|E
50|$|As with {{conventional}} quench and tempering the material being heat treated must be cooled from the austenitizing temperature {{quickly enough to}} avoid the formation of pearlite. The specific cooling rate {{that is necessary to}} avoid the formation of pearlite {{is a product of the}} chemistry of the austenite phase and thus the alloy being processed. The actual cooling rate is a product of both the quench severity, which is influenced by quench media, agitation, load (quenchant ratio, etc.), and the thickness and geometry of the part. As a result, heavier section components required greater hardenability. In <b>austempering</b> the heat treat load is quenched to a temperature which is typically above the Martensite start of the austenite and held. In some patented processes the parts are quenched just below the Martensite start so that the resulting microstructure is a controlled mixture of Martensite and Bainite.|$|E
50|$|Martempering {{is similar}} to <b>austempering,</b> in that the steel is {{quenched}} in a bath of molten metal or salts to quickly cool it past the pearlite-forming range. However, in martempering, {{the goal is to}} create martensite rather than bainite. The steel is quenched to a much lower temperature than is used for austempering; to just above the martensite start temperature. The metal is then held at this temperature until the temperature of the steel reaches an equilibrium. The steel is then removed from the bath before any bainite can form, and then is allowed to air-cool, turning it into martensite. The interruption in cooling allows much of the internal stresses to relax before the martensite forms, decreasing the brittleness of the steel. However, the martempered steel will usually need to undergo further tempering to adjust the hardness and toughness, except in rare cases where maximum hardness is needed but the accompanying brittleness is not. Modern files are often martempered.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{research}} into the isothermal transformation of steels {{was a result of}} Bain and Davenport's discovery of a new microstructure consisting of an [...] "acicular, dark etching aggregate." [...] This microstructure was found to be [...] "tougher for the same hardness than tempered Martensite". Commercial exploitation of bainitic steel did not become common overnight. Common heat treating practices at the time featured continuous cooling methods and were not capable, in practice, of producing fully Bainitic microstructures. The range of alloys available produced either mixed microstructures or excessive amounts of Martensite. The advent of low-carbon steels containing boron and molybdenum in 1958 allowed fully Bainitic steel to be produced by continuous cooling. Commercial use of bainitic steel thus came about {{as a result of the}} development of new heat treating methods, those that involve a step holding the work piece at a fixed temperature for a period of time sufficient to allow transformation became collectively known as <b>austempering.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Austempering</b> {{offers many}} {{manufacturing}} and performance advantages over traditional material/process combinations. It may {{be applied to}} numerous materials, and each combination has its own advantages, which are listed below. One of the advantages that is common to all austempered materials is a lower rate of distortion than for quench and tempering. This can be translated into significant cost savings by adjusting the entire manufacturing process. The most immediate cost savings are realized by machining before heat treatment. There are many such savings possible in the specific case of converting a quench and tempered steel component to austempered ductile iron (ADI). Ductile iron is 10% less dense than steel and can be cast near to net shape, both characteristics that reduce the casting weight. Near net shape casting also reduces the machining cost further, which is already reduced by machining soft ductile iron instead of hardened steel. A lighter finished part reduces freight charges and the streamlined production flow often reduces lead time. In many cases strength and wear resistance can also be improved.|$|E
