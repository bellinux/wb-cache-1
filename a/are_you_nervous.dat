40|$|Imagine you are {{a first-time}} {{freshman}} at {{the one and only}} Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Are you excited? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>nervous?</b> What about? You arrive a whole week early to participate in Week of Welcome. You are kept so busy, with so many different activities both on and off campus, and meeting so many different people. By the time {{the first day of school}} comes, you are worn out, but have had one of the best weeks of your life. You feel more prepared, made tons of new friends, and experienced new places. This sounds exciting to be a part of and I can tell you from experience it is! This very basic description, however, could hold true for the very first-ever Week of Welcome, or this upcoming 60 th Week of Welcome, or WOW, for short. WOW has become a monumental favorite tradition for Cal Poly and the surrounding community, but is also known nationally to be one of the largest volunteer college orientation programs in the nation. 1 Freshman Orientation at Cal Poly existed previously, but became WOW officially in 1957. Why begin an official Week of Welcome? What were the original goals? In this paper, I will argue Cal Poly started a week-long orientation tradition that was designed to help new students succeed, rally the campus and community in a common goal, and create a better campus culture...|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from being}} Carey's second highest {{worldwide}} seller, Daydream served as her most personal and directly influenced album at the time. During the album's recording, Carey grew as an artist, {{as well as}} a writer. For {{the first time in her}} career, Carey was able to make music that she truly related to, R and hip hop. While Columbia allowed Carey more leniency with the music she recorded, they became hesitant when she featured Ol' Dirty Bastard in the remix for [...] "Fantasy". They feared the sudden change was completely left field for her music, and worried it would jeopardize the album's success. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Carey openly spoke of her issues with Columbia: [...] "Everybody was like 'What, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> crazy?' They're <b>nervous</b> about breaking the formula. It works to have me sing a ballad on stage in a long dress with my hair up." ...|$|R
30|$|Our outcome {{variable}} is the Mental Health Inventory (MHI- 5), a sub-scale of the Short Form (SF- 36) Health Survey (see Ware et al. 2000). It consists of five items (scored on a 6 -point scale) that assess {{the frequency of}} anxiety and mood disturbance symptoms over the 4 -week period preceding the interview. The five items are the following: (i) Have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> a <b>nervous</b> person; (ii) Have you felt so down in the dumps that nothing could you cheer up; (iii) Have you felt calm and peaceful; (iv) Have you felt down; and (v) Have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> a happy person. Like all SF- 36 sub-scales, raw scores on each item are summed and then transformed so that the scale values range from 0 to 100, with relatively low scores indicative of worse mental health.|$|R
