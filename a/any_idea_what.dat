5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> they are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished a lovely meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a pot of boiling water and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and back in the kitchen, Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E
25|$|We {{know that}} our {{consciousness}} inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually {{are not aware of}} the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> our liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E
500|$|T. Liam McDonald of PC Gamer {{wrote that}} he was [...] "fascinated by the strong sense of style and the {{intellectual}} approach to terrific subject matter". Steven Levy and Patricia King of Newsweek found the game to be [...] "richly detailed and original". In 2012, Andy Hughes of Topless Robot put the game {{at the top of}} his list of [...] "9Surprising Literary References In Videogames". Hughes wrote that the game was one that could be played from start to finish [...] "without having <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> the hell's going on", noting its references to a wide variety of subjects, including Egyptian mythology, , and the Bermuda Triangle.|$|E

500|$|Lyon's Inn was [...] "a {{place of}} {{considerable}} antiquity", with records from 1413. Originally a hostel, it {{was purchased by}} the inhabitants and turned into an Inn of Chancery. Initially a small but respected Inn that educated people as noted as Sir Edward Coke, Lyon's Inn became a disreputable institution that [...] "perished of public contempt long before {{it came to the}} hammer and the pick". By the time it was dissolved it was inhabited only by the lowest lawyers and those struck off the rolls, and when surveyed it was found that it was run by only two Ancients, neither of whom had <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> their duties were, and the Inn had not dined for over a century. The Inn was dissolved in 1863 and replaced with the third Globe Theatre.|$|E
500|$|Selman {{wanted to}} include {{things in the}} episode that [...] "only really hard-core foodies would have <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> we were talking about. This was like a love letter to foodie culture." [...] Food {{references}} featured in the episode include jokes about sriracha sauce and sous-vide cooking, referrals to chefs Wylie Dufresne, Frank Bruni, and Ruth Reichl, a mention of the soup phở from Vietnam and how to pronounce it correctly, and {{the inclusion of the}} El Chemistri owner who is based on the Spanish chef José Andrés (known for using molecular gastronomy). Selman has commented that food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy [...] "lends itself to comedy quite nicely. There’s a dish , for instance, called Regret. The waiter cries into your soup when he serves it. The human tear is the final ingredient." [...] The fictional character Swedish Chef is also seen in the episode, and the scene where the meth dealer is reminded of his childhood after eating the apple pie is a reference to the Pixar film Ratatouille, which was written and directed by former Simpsons consultant Brad Bird.|$|E
500|$|The {{role was}} the most {{difficult}} to cast, and eventually the filmmakers decided to approach Cleese, noting [...] "Who would you rather make the argument [...] for mankind than John Cleese?" [...] Stoff, a producer, had met Cleese a few times beforehand and had noted his intellect. The actor was surprised the filmmakers were interested in him, and decided playing a dramatic role would be easier than to play a comedic one at his age. He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in synchronity with normal human speech patterns. Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often philosophizes about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters. Cleese spoke about portraying abilities outside his own experience in the scene in which Klaatu corrects a formula Barnhardt has written on a blackboard: [...] "The trouble is, I {{had to be able to}} write the equation, because Barnhardt has been working on it for 60 years. I learned to carefully copy things down that mean nothing to me at all. In A Fish Called Wanda, I spoke a lot of Russian without having <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> it means." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a lively}} {{exchange}} over {{what has come}} to be referred to as [...] "the Chinese room argument", John Searle sought to refute the claim of proponents of what he calls [...] "strong artificial intelligence (AI)" [...] that a computer program can be conscious, though he does agree with advocates of [...] "weak AI" [...] that computer programs can be formatted to [...] "simulate" [...] conscious states. [...] His own view is that consciousness has subjective, first-person causal powers by being essentially intentional due simply to the way human brains function biologically; conscious persons can perform computations, but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are. [...] To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese, Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker (Searle himself, in fact), a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input, and boxes filled with Chinese symbols. [...] In this case, the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program. [...] Searle argues that with such a machine, he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese, nor having <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> the questions and answers could possibly mean. [...] If the experiment were done in English, since Searle knows English, he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions, and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve. [...] Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages, but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English. [...] Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language, but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped.|$|E

According to Steele, [...] "We were given the pages day to day. We had hardly <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> was going down on that film. We {{had no idea of}} the end, or the beginning, either, not at all." ...|$|E

During the raid on Fairy Tale headquarters, he reveals his monster form of a Crow Tengu. In the Season II epilogue bonus comics, he begins dating Koko Shuzen (although [...] "neither of them has <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> a relationship is" [...] and their dates end up being sparring sessions).|$|E

[...] However, he did not win another game for two months, and his performance dropped off markedly. [...] He finished the 1974 season with a 14–12 record and a 4.32 ERA in 41 starts. He walked an astounding 158 batters in 1974 (a Tigers single-season record) for a career high rate of 5.0/9 IP. [...] At the end of the 1974 season, Coleman said: [...] "It was really strange.
