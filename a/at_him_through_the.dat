500|$|Frank Sinatra {{stopped his}} car. The light was red. Pedestrians passed quickly across his {{windshield}} but, as usual, one did not. It {{was a girl}} in her twenties. She remained at the curb staring <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> corner of his left eye he could see her, and he knew, because it happens almost every day, that she was thinking, It looks like him, but is it? ...|$|E
2500|$|... 18 April 1992: Brendan McWilliams, an {{employee}} of the British Army, was shot dead by the IRA at his home, Nialls Crescent, off Killylea Road, Armagh. At least 18 shots were fired <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> front door from a high velocity weapon.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of June 20, 1947, as Siegel sat with his {{associate}} Allen Smiley in Virginia Hill's Beverly Hills home reading the Los Angeles Times, an assailant fired <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window with a [...]30 caliber military M1 carbine, hitting him many times, including twice in the head. No one was charged with the murder, and the crime remains officially unsolved.|$|E
60|$|She {{was looking}} up <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> smiling <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tears that suffused er eyes.|$|R
60|$|Frink looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> doubtfully, <b>through</b> all <b>the</b> service kept glancing <b>at</b> <b>him</b> doubtfully, till Babbitt was nervous.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Our situation, Mr. Tottle,’ resumed <b>the</b> lady, glancing <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> one of <b>the</b> eyelet-holes, ‘is a most {{peculiar}} {{and delicate}} one.’ ...|$|R
2500|$|Rowling {{revealed}} in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince that young Merope Gaunt made {{efforts to get}} as close to Tom as she could, peering <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> windows and bushes at every opportunity. Morfin noticed his sister's affection for Tom, and hexed him as he rode by, covering him in hives. This breach of wizarding law, and the ensuing violent struggle with Ministry of Magic officials, led to Marvolo and Morfin being imprisoned in Azkaban. As surmised by Dumbledore, once Merope was alone and no longer dominated by her father, she could make her move for Tom. She offered Tom a drink laced with a love potion as he rode by one day without his attractive companion, Cecilia. He became infatuated with Merope and they eloped. Within {{three months of the}} marriage, Merope became pregnant. Merope decided to stop giving Tom the love potion, having come to the belief such enchantment of a man was tantamount to slavery. She also revealed her witch status to Tom, believing either that he {{had fallen in love with}} her on his own or he would at least stay for their unborn child. She was wrong, and Tom quickly left his pregnant wife and went home to his parents, claiming to have been [...] "hoodwinked" [...] and tricked into marrying Merope. Tom Marvolo Riddle, their son, was born on 31 December 1926 and was left to grow up in an orphanage, as Merope had died soon after giving birth.|$|E
60|$|She laughed <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> darkness, and at {{the sound}} of her laugh his eyes glowed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No--don't do your duty!' She {{looked up}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gloom, {{illuminating}} her own face and {{eyes with the}} candle she held.|$|E
60|$|She put {{her head}} back and looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> sideways, {{laughing}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> glitter of her hair.|$|R
60|$|The {{first person}} I saw there was Mr. Shelmardine. He was sitting right {{across from me}} and a smile glimmered in his eyes. I did not look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> service I was subdued enough to have {{satisfied}} even Aunt Martha.|$|R
60|$|It was on {{that night}} that Grandemont first {{perceived}} a new and singular expression in Adèle's eyes whenever she looked <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> And <b>through</b> <b>the</b> years following that expression was always there. He could not read it, for it was born of a thought she would never otherwise reveal.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young girl}} looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> dusk. [...] "But I suppose she doesn't have a {{headache}} every day," [...] she said sympathetically.|$|E
6000|$|... "I rejoice to meet you," [...] said Kenyon. But {{they looked}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eye-holes of their black masks, without {{answering}} a word.|$|E
60|$|She made no answer; {{she only}} stood looking down <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> warm dusk and smiling. He {{went into the}} house, and he {{remained}} at Baden-Baden till Gordon came back.|$|E
60|$|Meg {{began to}} cry. I suppose she looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> her tears. <b>The</b> next thing I heard was a {{cry from the}} old woman, {{and the sound of}} {{staggering}} feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Time {{indeed for}} me as well." [...] And {{encouraged}} visibly by his glow of concentration, she looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air she had painfully made clear. Yet she was still on her guard. [...] "Don't think, however, I'll {{do all the work}} for you. If you want things named you must name them." ...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the trip}} to the NCAAs, George Washington {{announced}} that Lonergan had signed a contract extension that keeps <b>him</b> <b>at</b> GW <b>through</b> <b>the</b> 2020-21 season.|$|R
60|$|The stout bowyer {{passed down}} {{the fringe of}} bowmen, amidst a running fire of rough wit. Here and there a bow was thrust out <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hedge for his {{professional}} advice.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the master}} of course {{was unable to find}} them, the effects of hunger {{probably}} blinding his senses. M'liss grew uneasy. At length she peered <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> leaves in an elfish way, and questioned:-- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{drove to}} the station with them, and saw them into the train. To the {{tightened}} pressure of his hand it seemed that Annette's fingers responded just a little; her face smiled <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> dark.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis paradise intirely," [...] {{observed}} Larry, {{removing his}} cigarette for a moment, and winking facetiously {{at a small}} monkey which happened to peep <b>at</b> <b>him</b> just then <b>through</b> <b>the</b> foliage overhead.|$|R
6000|$|Gervasio rose suddenly. [...] "This shrine..." [...] {{he began}} in a fierce voice, his face {{inflamed}} as with sudden wrath. And there he stopped short. The priest was staring <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>through</b> <b>the</b> open door came Leocadia {{with a bowl of}} steaming broth. [...] "We'll talk of this again," [...] he said, and there was a sort of thunder rumbling in the promise.|$|R
50|$|Porcius escapes {{and climbs}} {{up to the}} roof, and Flavia throws a {{tambourine}} <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He goes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> glass roof, falls and dies. Meanwhile, Susannah says she could not go back because Titus needs him.|$|R
60|$|He {{flung the}} pack from off his {{shoulders}} {{as he spoke}} and fell to unstrapping it, while the round face of the lass (her eyes big with curiosity) peered down <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> grated iron bars.|$|E
60|$|The first {{object that}} greeted the pastor's eyes on awaking {{in the morning}} was a black visage, {{and a pair of}} {{glittering}} eyes gazing <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> half open door with an expression of the utmost astonishment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{and take}} {{a seat in the}} bay-window, ladies," [...] he called out to them, as they looked in <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ribs of the wall. He jocosely made room for them on the trestle on which he sat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she whispered. She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> now, and <b>through</b> <b>the</b> veil of {{her tears}} {{she seemed to}} see his soul shining in his eyes. The tones of a distant church bell were borne {{to them on the}} valley breeze.|$|R
60|$|One trivial misadventure occurred. When Lady Hammergallow {{welcomed the}} Angel she looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> her glasses. <b>The</b> {{apparent}} {{size of her}} eyes startled him. His surprise and his quick attempt to peer over the brims was only too evident. But the Vicar had warned him of the ear trumpet.|$|R
6000|$|... 18. 'The {{sacrifice}} of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord; but the prayer of the upright is his delight. He loveth him that followeth after righteousness' (Prov 15:8,9). That our prayers may be heard, the heart should be right with God, and our souls <b>at</b> peace with <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Son of his love.--Mason.--Ed.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy felt Miss Merril's gaze upon him, and, as had {{happened}} before, his ingenuity failed him. Her smile vaguely suggested comprehension, and, for no ostensible reason, that disturbed him. He also saw Louis grinning down <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> skylights.|$|E
60|$|Joe Graddy's {{breathing}} {{proclaimed that}} he had succumbed at once, but Frank lay for a considerable time winking owlishly at the stars, which returned him the compliment with interest by twinkling <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> branches of the overhanging trees.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes flashed}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> darkness, yet {{he could see}} that one thing at least he had achieved. Her bosom was rising and falling quickly, her voice shook as she {{answered}} him. For {{the first time he had}} penetrated that intolerable reserve.|$|E
60|$|More than {{satisfied}} with his information Alan went to bed. For hour after hour that night he lay tossing and turning, haunted by the recollections of the dreadful sights {{that he had seen}} and of the horrible Asika, horrible and half-naked, glaring <b>at</b> <b>him</b> amorously <b>through</b> <b>the</b> crystal eyes of Little Bonsa. When at last he fell asleep it was to dream that he was alone in the water with the god which pursued him as a shark pursues a shipwrecked sailor. Never did he experience a nightmare that was half so awful. Only one thing could be more awful, the reality itself.|$|R
50|$|From then on, Szpilman {{decided to}} stay hidden on the roof, coming down only at dusk to search for food. He was soon forced to change his plans. Lying on the roof one day, he {{suddenly}} heard a burst of fire; two Germans {{were standing on the}} roof shooting <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Szpilman slithered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> trapdoor onto the stairway, and down into the expanse of burnt-out buildings.|$|R
5000|$|On April 2, 2015, Smart {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} become the new men's head basketball coach at Texas. In Smart's first season at Texas, the Longhorns won 20 games and received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, which the Houston Chronicle described as having, [...] "surpassed all realistic expectations." [...] That offseason, Smart received a contract extension, keeping <b>him</b> <b>at</b> Texas <b>through</b> <b>the</b> 2022-23 season.|$|R
