5|$|At the Beijing Olympics, on 13 August 2008, the Singapore women's {{table tennis}} team, coached by Liu Guodong and with Li {{as the team}} captain leading {{teammates}} Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu, beat teams from the United States and Nigeria with comfortable 3–0 wins. On 14 August, the Singapore team also defeated the Netherlands 3–0 to reach the semifinals, but not before a gruelling five-game doubles match against the Dutch players Li Jie and Elena Timina which Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu eventually won 3–2. The next day, 15 August, the Singapore team defeated the South Korean team of Dang Ye-Seo, Kim Kyung-Ah <b>and</b> <b>Park</b> Mi-Young 3–2 in the semifinals, which went to five matches. Li lost her singles match to Korea's Kim, but beat Kim <b>and</b> <b>Park</b> in the doubles with her partner Wang. Singapore's Feng won both her singles matches against Dang <b>and</b> <b>Park.</b>|$|E

40|$|Buildings can be located, {{designed}} {{and managed to}} optimize transportation <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> efficiency. This paper describes ways to improve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) transportation <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> credits. Typical LEED programs reduce building energy consumption 20 - 60 %. Cost effective mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management programs can provide similar motor vehicle trip <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> generation reductions, resulting in large economic, social and environmental benefits. However, the current LEED rating system overlooks {{some of the most}} effective mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management strategies <b>and</b> encourages practitioners to choose strategies based on ease of implementation rather than effectiveness. As a result, the current LEED rating system is unlikely to implement mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management to the degree optimal. This paper recommends a different approach which defines performance targets needed to achieve LEED categories (silver, gold, platinum). Developers would establish mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management plans that indicate how targets will be met, how performance will be evaluated, and what additional strategies will be deployed if needed to achieve targets. This optimizes mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management programs, <b>and</b> responds to changing demands. However, it is unnecessary to wait for a major reform to improve and expand LEED transportation credits; new credits proposed in this paper could be quickly incorporated into the existing LEED rating system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{time-dependent}} network equilibrium model that simultaneously considers a traveler's choice of departure time, route, <b>parking</b> location <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> duration in road networks with multiple user classes <b>and</b> multiple <b>parking</b> facilities. In the proposed model, travelers are differentiated by their trip purpose <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> duration, parking locations {{are characterized by}} facility type <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> charge, <b>and</b> the decision-making process of travelers on travel <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> choices is assumed to follow a hierarchical choice structure. The model is formulated as a variational inequality problem, and is solved by a heuristic solution algorithm. Numerical results for two example networks are presented to show the solution quality and investigate the solution sensitivities to some input data. It is found that parking behavior is significantly affected by travel demand, walking distance, <b>parking</b> capacity, <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> charge. The proposed model provides {{a useful tool for}} studying the complex temporal and spatial interaction between road traffic <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> congestion, <b>and</b> can be used to assess the effects of various <b>parking</b> policies <b>and</b> infrastructure improvements at a strategic level. ...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house <b>and</b> <b>park</b> to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and {{the largest and most}} drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house <b>and</b> <b>park</b> were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established {{in the southern part of}} Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and the East Coast main line railway station at Grantham. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish church.|$|E
