5|$|<b>A</b> <b>tug</b> of war tournament {{was held}} on 16 July at Catalan Cross, Boulogne Forest in Paris {{as part of the}} 1900 Summer Olympics. The only match of the tournament was played between a team from the Racing Club de France, {{representing}} France, and a mixed team consisting of three Danish athletes and three Swedish athletes. The mixed Scandinavian team won the match 2–0.|$|E
5|$|Predator {{avoidance}} {{may also}} explain the frequent behaviour where S.latus will carry food items {{back to a}} shelter before consuming them. When two S.latus individuals compete for a food item, they may use the enlarged second antennae to flip their opponent over, by wedging the antennae underneath the opponent's body and quickly raising them. An alternative strategy is to grip an opponent and begin the tail-flipping movement, or to engage in <b>a</b> <b>tug</b> of war.|$|E

50|$|The first USS Triton (later YT-10) was <b>an</b> iron-hulled <b>tug</b> {{purchased}} by the U.S. Navy in 1889. After more than 40 years of service as <b>a</b> Navy yard <b>tug,</b> she was sold off in 1930 and began a second career as <b>a</b> commercial <b>tug.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The second Saco (YT-31) was <b>a</b> steam <b>tug,</b> {{built in}} 1912. She was {{acquired}} by the Navy in 1918 and served as <b>a</b> yard <b>tug</b> until 1927.|$|R
5|$|The torpedo bombers {{attacked}} Giffen's {{ships in}} two waves between 19:00 and 20:00. Two torpedoes hit the heavy cruiser , causing heavy damage and bringing {{her to a}} dead stop. Three of the Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships. In response, Halsey sent <b>a</b> <b>tug</b> to take Chicago under tow and ordered Giffen's task force to return to base the next day. Six destroyers were left behind to escort Chicago and the tugboat.|$|E
5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by <b>a</b> <b>tug,</b> and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|E
5|$|In April 1918, Bosna, {{along with}} three other monitors, two patrol boats and <b>a</b> <b>tug</b> were formed into Flottenabteilung Wulff (Fleet Division Wulff) {{under the command of}} Flottenkapitän (Fleet Captain) Olav Wulff. Flottenabteilung Wulff was sent through the mouth of the Danube and across the Black Sea to Odessa, where it spent several months {{supporting}} the Austro-Hungarian troops enforcing the peace agreement with Russia. It returned to the Danube at the end of August, and was anchored at Brăila on 12 September. On 16 October, Bosna {{and the rest of the}} 1st Monitor Division sailed from Brăila to Belene. The Danube Flotilla then protected Austro-Hungarian troops withdrawing towards Budapest, fighting French and irregular Serbian forces as they withdrew, and arrived on 6 November.|$|E
50|$|Wando recommissioned at the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, on 15 March 1933. She was {{reclassified}} on 27 February 1936 from <b>a</b> seagoing <b>tug</b> (AT-17) to <b>a</b> harbor <b>tug,</b> YT-123.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Confederacy, Blue Light continued to perform duty as <b>an</b> ordnance <b>tug</b> at Boston, Massachusetts, until 1870. From 1871-June 1873, she served as <b>a</b> yard <b>tug</b> at the Washington Navy Yard.|$|R

5|$|In April 1918, Körös, {{along with}} three other monitors, two patrol boats and <b>a</b> <b>tug,</b> were formed into Flottenabteilung Wulff (Fleet Division Wulff) {{under the command of}} Flottenkapitän (Fleet Captain) Olav Wulff. Flottenabteilung Wulff was sent through the mouth of the Danube and across the Black Sea to Odessa, where it spent several months {{supporting}} the Austro-Hungarian troops enforcing the peace agreement with Russia. It returned to the Danube at the end of August, and was anchored at Brăila on 12 September. On 16 October, Körös {{and the rest of the}} First Monitor Division sailed from Brăila to Belene. For several weeks the Danube Flotilla was engaged in protecting Austro-Hungarian troops retreating towards Budapest, fighting French and irregular Serbian forces as they withdrew; the flotilla arrived in Belene on 6 November.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1903, the {{expedition}} reached Port Stanley, where they received their first {{news from the}} outside world since leaving the Cape Verde Islands. After a week's rest, Scotia departed for Buenos Aires, where she was to be repaired and provisioned for another season's work. Bruce had further business in the city; he intended to persuade the Argentine government to assume responsibility for the Laurie Island meteorological station after {{the expedition}}'s departure. During the voyage to Buenos Aires, Scotia ran aground in the Río de la Plata estuary, and was stranded for several days before floating free and being assisted into port by <b>a</b> <b>tug,</b> on 24 December.|$|E
5|$|Shipping {{incidents}} {{resulting from}} the storm caused several deaths. A schooner carrying seven people sunk, killing all its occupants. <b>A</b> <b>tug</b> boat sank {{off the coast of}} Mobile, Alabama while towing a lumber barge; the fate of the crew is unknown. A ship named the American SS Catopazi sank between Charleston, South Carolina and the northern coast of Cuba, with all 30 crew members lost. Near Daytona Beach, a vessel carrying 2,000 cases of liquor sank along with all six crewmen. The last incident, involving a yacht, occurred off the coast of Georgia. The ship sank near Savannah, Georgia with the 12 crew members drowning. The total loss of life at sea was at least 55. Shipping throughout the East Coast was crippled by the storm as vessels were forced to seek shelter at port.|$|E
50|$|Tests using <b>a</b> {{powerful}} <b>tug</b> to tow <b>a</b> conundrum were disappointing {{even when}} <b>a</b> second <b>tug</b> was added. Banks, {{a man with}} no seamanship skills, suggested that {{the wake of the}} tugs engines was pushing the conundrum backwards and impeding movement; separating the two tugs greatly improved performance and <b>a</b> third small <b>tug</b> was added behind the conundrum to help with steering.|$|R
6000|$|But even as {{she spoke}} the noise of wheels was heard. A wagon stopped before the door; there came <b>a</b> <b>tugging</b> and lifting, with a sound as of {{crunching}} gravel, and then a [...] "There!" [...] of great relief.|$|R

5|$|Several {{fatalities}} {{occurred during}} {{the construction of the}} bridge. A baulk of timber fell on one man when a rope slipped, and another died when he fell from the part-completed structure, injuring himself on the staging as he fell. Only {{a few days after the}} bridge's opening, a rowing boat trying to pass underneath was caught in a giant eddy and capsized, one occupant being drowned. Over the succeeding years a number of accidents have happened at the bridge involving larger vessels. The trow Brothers was lost after a collision with one of the piers in 1879, and the Victoria, employed in the bridge's construction, was wrecked in the 1880s. In 1938, <b>a</b> <b>tug</b> and two barges got into difficulties and were carried along broadside by the tide into the bridge; a connecting hawser snagged one of the piers and the vessels capsized, with several fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Delta caused {{considerable}} {{damage in the}} Canary Islands. The storm claimed nineteen lives and caused a total of €312million ($364million 2005 US dollars) damage throughout the archipelago. Eighteen died when a boat sank off the Canary Islands; twelve of the bodies were never found. The nineteenth man was killed when while trying to repair his roof during the storm; winds threw him from his ladder. The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest hit, with many uprooted trees and landslides reported. The peak gust recorded at La Palma was 95mph (152km/h), and at Tenerife the maximum gust was 90mph (147km/h). Some patients at Tenerife's University Hospital were evacuated to a safer {{part of the building}} when paneling from the hospital's heliport was torn free and smashed some of the building's windows. Off Santa Cruz's southern quay <b>a</b> <b>tug</b> boat broke its ties, collided with another vessel, and sank. Passengers at Tenerife North Airport, who were stranded when their flights canceled, witnessed parts of the new international terminal's roof tear off in the wind. In La Palma a falling palm tree, trunk snapped by the wind, injured the leg of a German tourist. Many palm trees along the Avenida Marítima were also blown down. The storms winds blew out windows and collapsed cornices, although other structural damage was minimal. Metal plates that had been used to board up buildings were strewn all over the island.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 the Baedeker Raids were in {{operation}} against British cities {{in retaliation for}} RAF Bomber Commands attacks on Germany. The Luftwaffe was stepping up its campaign although it was fully engaged on the Eastern Front. On 18 April Do 217s raided Portsmouth in retaliation for an attack on Lübeck on 28/29 March. An attack on Rostock resulted in retaliation with raids on Bath, Exeter, Canterbury, Norwich and York. On the night of 26–27 April 1942 the Luftwaffe attacked Bath. MacLachlan took off in {{the evening of the}} 26 April and headed for airfields around Evreux and Dreux. He claimed a I./Kampfgeschwader 2 (KG 2—Bomber Wing 2) Dornier Do 217 destroyed which came down near Evreux severely damaged. A second was damaged but his port cannon jammed preventing its destruction. Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory sent his congratulations and his exploits were printed in The Times newspaper. On 30 April MacLachlan and Kuttelwascher set out again with a 25-minute interval between both. Kuttelwascher claimed a Do 217 and He 111, but MacLachlan settled for the destruction of two locomotives between Le Havre and Rouen. He also damaged <b>a</b> <b>tug</b> boat on the Seine and destroyed another locomotive near Yvetot. These successes were achieved in two missions on the same night.|$|E
60|$|The {{natural result}} of this indulgence was that he soon fell asleep, and even the {{rumbling}} of the trains as they passed failed to awaken him, until after some time, when {{he became aware of}} <b>a</b> <b>tugging</b> and pulling at his coat.|$|R
2500|$|USS Algonquin, [...] {{completed}} as El Toro in 1891 for the Southern Pacific Railroad's Morgan Line, was <b>a</b> small harbor <b>tug</b> {{commissioned by}} the United States Navy 2 April 1898. Renamed Accomac, after Accomac, Virginia, June 1898, renamed Nottoway in 1918 and, after the Navy adopted alphanumeric hull numbers on 17 July 1920, classified as YT-18, <b>a</b> district <b>tug.</b> On 5 October 1942 the name was cancelled and the tug was simply YT-18 until 1944 when classification was changed to YTL-18, <b>a</b> little harbor <b>tug.</b> Over the years as <b>a</b> Navy <b>tug,</b> from 1898 to 1946, the tug served from Cuba to Boston.|$|R

5|$|Such a large glider {{had never}} been {{constructed}} before by the British military, and to test the design, a half-scale prototype model was first designed; designated GAL. 50 it still required an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bomber to act as <b>a</b> <b>tug</b> to get it airborne, and was first flown in September 1941. However, it only flew once; the test pilot approached the landing area too low, attempted to raise the flaps for extra glide, and instead crashed the prototype and wrecked it. However, the trial {{was considered to be}} a success and the first full-scale prototype model was finished at GAL's works in Hanworth, Middlesex in March 1942. The Hamilcar was transported to RAF Snaith in Yorkshire, as GAL's airfield at Hanworth was too short for the glider to take off from; moving the glider to a secure military airfield would also ensure that it remained secret. Its first flight was conducted on 27 March 1942, towed by a Handley Page Halifax bomber. A second prototype was completed in June 1942, and further testing and development took place at a number of different airfields, including the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment at RAF Beaulieu; all flight trials appear to have been successful, and there were few differences between the prototypes and the production models.|$|E

25|$|Wilson's {{nickname}} of 'Tug' reputedly {{comes from}} an incident when he repeatedly ordered a battleship {{to try to come}} alongside, and in exasperation offered her captain <b>a</b> <b>tug</b> to assist.

50|$|During her service, Tillamook changed designations three times. On 17 July 1920, {{when the}} Navy adopted the modern system of {{alpha-numeric}} hull designations, she {{was classified as}} <b>a</b> fleet <b>tug</b> and redesignated AT-16. On 31 January 1936, a number of old tugs previously classified as fleet tugs were reclassified as harbor tugs, and Tillamook became <b>a</b> harbor <b>tug</b> designated YT-122. She received her final classification, as <b>a</b> medium harbor <b>tug,</b> on 13 April 1944 and was redesignated YTM-122.|$|R
