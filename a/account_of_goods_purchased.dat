40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} the {{standard}} approach for measuring output and productivity in the trade sector has become obsolete. The key problem is that changes in prices <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> <b>purchased</b> for resale are not accounted for. We outline a consistent accounting framework for measuring trade productivity and provide new estimates, taking into <b>account</b> <b>purchase</b> prices <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> sold in a double deflation procedure. We find strong productivity improvements in the UK and US compared to France, Germany and The Netherlands since the mid- 1990 s. This finding is robust for various productivity measurement models...|$|R

40|$|Market {{research}} data are utilized {{to examine the}} use of changes in shopping behavior {{and changes in the}} quality <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> <b>purchased</b> as methods <b>of</b> mitigating the effects of the 2002 Argentine financial crisis. Although the total quantity and real value <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> <b>purchased</b> fell during the crisis, consumers are found to be spending more days shopping. This increase in shopping frequency occurs through consumers <b>purchasing</b> lower-quality <b>goods</b> from a wider variety of shopping channels. This paper provides the first estimates of the magnitude of such effects during an economic crisis, and suggests that this increase in shopping frequency can be an important coping mechanism for households. Shopping more often is shown to enable households to seek out lower prices and locate substitutes, allowing a given level of expenditure to buy more goods. * Thanks to Sebastian Gimenez of LatinPanel for help in obtaining and using the market {{research data}} use...|$|R

40|$|In some {{business}} applications, the transaction behavior of each customer is tracked separately with a customer signature. A customer's signature for buying behavior, for example, may contain informa- tion on the likely place <b>of</b> <b>purchase,</b> value <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> <b>purchased,</b> type <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> <b>purchased,</b> and timing <b>of</b> purchases. The signature may be updated whenever the customer makes a transaction, and, because of storage limitations, the updating {{may be able}} to use only the new transaction and the summarized information in the customer's current signature. Standard sequential updating schemes, such as expo- nentially weighted moving averaging, can be used to update a characteristic that is observed at random, but timing variables like day-of-week are not observed at random, and standard sequential estimates of their distributions can be badly biased. This paper derives a fast, space-efficient sequential estimator for timing distributions that is based on a Poisson model that has periodic rates that may evolve over time...|$|R

By analyzing 9 case studies of customer-supplier relationships in the Italian high precision air conditioning industry, this paper investigates what suppliers and customers do in order to integrate their operations across the supply chain.
