5|$|Alcoholism {{and poor}} health afflicted Clark during his final years. In 1809 he {{suffered}} a severe stroke. When he fell into an operating fireplace, Clark suffered <b>a</b> <b>burn</b> on his right leg that was so severe {{it had to be}} amputated. The injury made it impossible for Clark to continue to operate his mill and live independently. As a result, he moved to Locust Grove, a farm eight miles (13km) from the growing town of Louisville, and {{became a member of the}} household of his sister, Lucy, and brother-in-law, Major William Croghan, a planter.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday, April 29, Black went to Lee's {{residence}} at 11a.m. looking for evidence, {{and found a}} blood-smeared shirt {{at the bottom of}} <b>a</b> <b>burn</b> barrel. The blood was smeared high up on the armpits and the shirt smelled unused, suggesting to the police that it was a plant. The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed that Frank had arranged the plant.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{returns to}} Washington and is congratulated by Mulder {{for being the}} first person to make a second X-File appearance. Ed was brought to <b>a</b> <b>burn</b> center in Philadelphia where the ergot {{chemicals}} were found in his blood; it was also in Scully's blood, but not enough to cause hallucinations. Mulder wonders if this all happened because of their earlier argument, to which Scully replies that not everything is about him.|$|E

5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and <b>a</b> <b>burn</b> may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, {{asking her}} to take Climbié {{permanently}} because Manning did not want her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including <b>a</b> <b>burn</b> {{on her face and}} a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed {{and he said that he}} hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely that at least some of the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantis {{crew had}} two Florida return {{opportunities}} for the day, {{as well as two}} for a California landing, giving the managers time to evaluate the weather and use California if necessary. After choosing to pass on the first opportunity for KSC and evaluate the second, managers on the ground decided that the weather in Florida was too dynamic to risk bringing the orbiter in, and opted to land at Edwards Air Force Base instead. The de-orbit burn was initiated at 14:24 UTC, <b>a</b> <b>burn</b> of the shuttle's engines that brought it out of orbit to begin the orbiter's reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. Atlantis successfully landed at Edwards Air Force Base on Runway 22 at 8:39am PDT after 197 orbits in space and a distance of approximately 5.2million miles.|$|E

5|$|Geopyxis carbonaria is {{widespread}} on burned soil or charcoal {{in the spring}} and throughout the growing season. It {{is one of the most}} common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after <b>a</b> <b>burn.</b> The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve as an indicator of imminent morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G.carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} episode, an amnesic Kay {{is accused of}} murdering defense {{attorney}} Tsubasa Kagome. Edgeworth is brought up before the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, which threatens to take his badge if he becomes involved with Kay's case; Edgeworth voluntarily gives up his badge and continues to investigate with help from prosecutor Franziska von Karma. He discovers that someone has been auctioning off evidence from legal cases, and finds a recording indicating that Kagome's murderer had <b>a</b> <b>burn</b> mark on their chin. When Edgeworth is called to defend himself against the committee, Mikagami reveals Bansai Ichiyanagi, {{the head of the}} investigation committee and Yumihiko's father, as the auctioneer and the one responsible for legal corruption in his former position as chief prosecutor. Edgeworth tricks him into revealing his burn mark, identifying him as Kagome's murderer. Kay then remembers being attacked by someone and Shelly de Killer reveals the concept of the mastermind to Edgeworth and Kay.|$|E
5|$|Natasha sustains <b>a</b> <b>burn</b> on {{her neck}} and she becomes {{insecure}} about it. Natasha sees Andrew and Summer kissing, which leaves her devastated. To stop Andrew from breaking up with her, Natasha tells him she is pregnant. Michael, though initially angry, tells his daughter that he will support her. Andrew books Natasha in for an ultrasound scan and after {{trying to get out}} of it, Natasha buys fake ultrasound images over the internet. She convinces Andrew not to come into the doctor's office with her and she gives him the fake pictures. Summer reveals the images are fake and Natasha explains that she lied because Andrew cheated on her. Michael tells Natasha that he no longer trusts her and she becomes ostracised at school. Natasha is thrown off the Mathletes team and Lisa Devine (Sophie Tilson) takes her place as the most popular girl in the school. Chris befriends Natasha and she and Summer apologise to each other for their actions. Chris and Natasha try to get Summer and Andrew back together and Natasha successfully challenges Lisa for the Mathletes captaincy.|$|E

5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets <b>a</b> <b>burn</b> on {{the back}} of his neck {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition proves that he did not kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{arrive in}} Comity after arguing over {{directions}} along the way. They meet a local detective, Angela White (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), {{and go to}} Boom's funeral. Scully, in a bad mood, is skeptical of these claims. The high school principal, Bob Spitz, interrupts the funeral by ranting Inquisitorial-style about Satanic cults murdering their children when suddenly the coffin starts smoking and catches on fire. Mulder and Scully go into separate rooms to interview Margi and Terri, both of whom offer an identical story about a satanic ceremony where a baby was sacrificed. Scully thinks their stories are cliché and points {{out the fact that}} the belief in a satanic conspiracy is illogical and paranoid. Looking at the latest victim's body, Mulder and Detective White find <b>a</b> <b>burn</b> mark {{in the shape of a}} horned beast; Scully says she doesn't see anything. Mulder goes to see White to apologize for Scully's behavior and the two visit the local astrologist Madame Zirinka who claims the town's crazy behavior is due to the rare planetary alignment of the planets Mars, Uranus, and Mercury. Terri and Margi watch basketball practice, lusting over one of the players, Scott, whose girlfriend is fellow cheerleader Brenda (much to Terri and Margi's displeasure). One of the other players accidentally spills a table of drinks on them, so they cause the basketball to bounce underneath the bleachers and it closes when he goes to get it, killing him. Scully is angry at Mulder for ditching her to be with Detective White.|$|E

25|$|Shrub fires {{typically}} concentrate in {{the canopy}} and spread continuously if the shrubs are close enough together.

Surface and below-ground soil temperatures during <b>a</b> <b>burn</b> are generally higher than those of forest fires because the centers of combustion lie closer to the ground, although this can vary greatly. Common plants in shrubland or chaparral include manzanita, chamise and Coyote Brush.|$|E
