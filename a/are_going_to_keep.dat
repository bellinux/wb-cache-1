500|$|The {{show was}} {{controversial}} from its beginning {{and has made}} the news several times. In the early seasons, some parents and conservatives characterized Bart as a poor role model for children and several United States public schools even banned The Simpsons merchandise and t-shirts. In January 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush made a speech during his re-election campaign in which he said: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." [...] In 2002, the show was nearly sued by the Rio de Janeiro tourist board for creating an unreal image of {{the city on the}} show.|$|E
500|$|From Autumn to Ashes {{formed on}} Long Island in 2000 with Francis Mark (drums, vocals), Steve Salvio (guitar) and Benjamin Perri (vocals) — Perri {{provided}} screaming vocals, while Mark sung clean vocals. Commenting {{on the name}} of their band, Scott Gross (guitar) said, [...] "you are absolutely {{not going to get the}} right answer on this one because that would pretty much end the band" [...] and that [...] "no one is going to know the reason and we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it that way." [...] The term [...] "Autumn" [...] refers to both the season and a fictional character the band created. Mark and Gross planned to use the character in a book. For the first few months as a touring band, From Autumn to Ashes claimed to have sold half of their equipment, a car, and spent between $3,000 and $4,000 making demos and hand distributing them.|$|E
500|$|The January 30, 1992 rerun of {{the episode}} {{featured}} a brief alternate opening, which was written {{in response to a}} comment made by the then President of the United States, George Bush, three days earlier. The show had previously had a [...] "feud" [...] with the President's wife Barbara Bush when, in the October 1, 1990 edition of People, she called The Simpsons [...] "the dumbest thing [...] had ever seen". The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter to Bush in which they posed as Marge Simpson. Bush immediately sent a reply in which she apologized. Later, on January 27, 1992, George Bush made a speech during his re-election campaign which included the statement [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." ...|$|E

500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded {{the finale}} with a B+; he praised the writers [...] "for once again {{introducing}} {{a new world}} that feels fully formed, with its own rich backstory that they could choose to explore {{if they have the}} time and the inclination." [...] Murray concluded his review, [...] "It may be that Fringe has bitten off more than it can chew here, and the storytelling is about to get hopelessly convoluted, as it often does once time-travel enters the picture. But for now, I’m going to enjoy living with and thinking over what I’ve seen so far. And I’m going to trust that no matter how crazy Fringes fourth season gets, the writers <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> bringing everything back to less mind-bending questions". Some reviewers questioned the logic of Peter having never existed, though others expressed their trust in the writers' ability to make it work.|$|E
500|$|On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush made {{a speech}} during his {{re-election}} campaign that reignited the feud between The Simpsons and the Bushes. At that point, family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, to which effect he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington, D.C.: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons". The next broadcast of The Simpsons was a rerun of [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] on January 30, 1992. It included a new opening, which {{was a response to}} Bush's speech. The scene begins in the Simpsons' living room. Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Patty and Selma all stare at the television and watch Bush's speech. After Bush's statement, Bart replies [...] "Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying {{for an end to the}} Depression too." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode makes {{references}} to several real-life persons. The piano-playing satirist who annoys Bart is {{a reference to}} Mark Russell and/or Tom Lehrer. Bob Arnold, the corrupt congressman, tells Lisa that {{there are quite a}} few women senators, but Lisa asserts that there are only two. At the time of airing there were indeed only two female senators: Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. Then-President George H. W. Bush is featured briefly in the episode. Shortly after it aired, Bush disparaged The Simpsons in a speech during his re-election campaign on January 27, 1992. At that point family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, so he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." [...] As a result, Bush appeared in future episodes in a more negative light.|$|E

6000|$|She {{replied in}} the affirmative. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> 'em," [...] she said, [...] "but I can't get his apple-mill and press. I wish could; it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sold, they say." ...|$|R
500|$|In the October 1, 1990 {{edition of}} People, First Lady Barbara Bush called The Simpsons [...] "the dumbest thing [...] had ever seen" [...] {{which led to}} the writers sending a letter to Bush posing as Marge Simpson.

[...] The writers decided that they wanted to respond by adding a response to the next broadcast of The Simpsons, which was a rerun of [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] on January 30. The broadcast included a new tongue-in-cheek opening where they watch Bush's speech. Bart replies, [...] "Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying {{for an end to the}} Depression, too". The criticism eventually led to the idea for the episode [...] "Two Bad Neighbors", which has George and Barbara move into the house across the street from the Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|The {{season premiere}} episode was [...] "Stark Raving Dad", which guest starred Michael Jackson as the {{speaking}} voice of Leon Kompowsky. One of Jackson's conditions for guest starring {{was that he}} voiced himself under a pseudonym. While he recorded the voice work for the character, all of his singing was performed by Kipp Lennon, because Jackson wanted to play a joke on his brothers. Michael Jackson's lines were recorded at a second session by Brooks. The January 30, 1992 rerun of the episode featured a brief alternate opening, which was written {{in response to a}} comment made by then-President of the United States George H. W. Bush.

500|$|In 1990 William Bennett, who at {{the time}} was drug czar of the United States, visited a drug {{treatment}} centre in Pittsburgh and upon noticing a poster of Bart remarked, [...] "You guys aren't watching The Simpsons, are you? That's not going to help you any." [...] When a backlash over the comment ensued, Bennett apologized, claiming he [...] "was just kidding" [...] and saying [...] "I'll sit down with the little spike head. We'll straighten this thing out." [...] In a 1991 interview, Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, calling him [...] "angry, confused, frustrated." [...] In response, Matt Groening said, [...] "That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal. He thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just wished they dare do." [...] On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." [...] The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply {{in the form of a}} short segment which aired three days later before a rerun of [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] in which Bart replied, [...] "Hey, we're just like the Waltons.

6000|$|... "And do you suppose, sir," [...] Mr. Mulready {{asked with}} intense bitterness, [...] "that I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you here doing nothing all your life, {{while you are}} pleased to watch me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's polite," [...] {{said the}} girl, indignantly. [...] "After giving you your clothes, too. What {{do you think}} my uncle will say <b>to</b> me? He <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you here till Friday." ...|$|R
500|$|Bart's rebellious, bad boy nature, which {{underlies}} his misbehavior {{and rarely}} leads to any punishment, led some parents and conservatives to characterize {{him as a}} poor role model for children. In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a [...] "threat to learning" [...] because of his [...] "underachiever and proud of it" [...] attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. Others described him as [...] "egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited". In a 1991 interview, Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, calling him [...] "angry, confused, frustrated". In response, Matt Groening said, [...] "That sums up Bart, all right.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the police chief, {{the president of the}} Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis called the team [...] "pathetic" [...] while saying he [...] "commended" [...] the officers, before threatening that other officers might follow suit, saying: [...] "If (the players) <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their stance, all officers may refuse to work there." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fourth}} Test of their five-Test {{series against the}} West Indies in 1966, England were 3–0 down and had lost the series. Needing someone {{to come in to}} {{revitalise}} the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, [...] "I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, and we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the pressure on and keep it on for five days." [...] What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch – or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England {{went on to win the}} game by an innings and 34 runs.|$|E
