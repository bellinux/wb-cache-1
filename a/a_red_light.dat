Naturalised Austrian rider George Berger responded, travelling from London to Harworth to help him with his riding position. In late 1955, Simpson ran <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> in a race and was suspended from racing for six months by the BLRC. During his suspension he dabbled in motorcycle trials, nearly quitting cycling but unable to afford a new motorcycle necessary for progress in the sport.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{dreams of}} <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> that {{leads him to}} the corpse {{of a young girl}} buried in a park in Manassas, Virginia. When he awakens, he heads to the park and finds the girl's skeleton. The girl was {{determined}} to have been murdered by John Lee Roche (Tom Noonan), a serial killer who murdered thirteen girls throughout the 1980s; his modus operandi was cutting a heart out of the clothes of each victim. Mulder had captured Roche by deducing that he committed the murders while traveling as a vacuum cleaner salesman. Roche's hearts were never found, although he confessed to all of the murders.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Frank {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts House of Representatives where he served for eight years. He {{made a name for himself}} in the mid-1970s as a {{political}} defender of the Combat Zone, Boston’s notorious red light district. Neighborhoods in Frank’s district bordered the Combat Zone. As a means of dealing with crime in the area (including violence, police corruption and the infiltration by organized crime), he introduced a bill into the Massachusetts General Court that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> district, which would have been moved to Boston’s Financial District. The bill, which had the support of Boston’s Police Commissioner, never came up for a vote. Later, when Frank was running for Congress, opponents erroneously portrayed him as having attempted to permit red-light districts in all Bay State communities.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time after}} 7:00pm, a Woodsville, New Hampshire {{resident}} {{heard a loud}} thump outside of her house. Through her window she could see a car up against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. The car pointed west on the eastbound side of the road. She telephoned the Grafton County Sheriff's Department at 7:27pm to report the accident. According to the 911 log, the woman claimed to have seen a man smoking a cigarette inside the car. However, the woman later stated {{that she had not}} seen a man nor a person smoking a cigarette, but rather had seen what appeared to be <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> glowing from inside the car, potentially from a cell phone. At about the same time another neighbor saw the car as well as someone walking around the vehicle. She witnessed a third neighbor pull up alongside the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> in order to allow drivers at the green light to turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane.|$|E

5|$|On {{his way to}} a meeting, Webber {{goes through}} <b>a</b> <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> and collides with another vehicle, {{resulting}} in him becoming T-boned. Webber is taken to the neighboring Mercy West Hospital, where he is treated by former colleague Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and subsequently discharged. Ferguson finally agrees to the surgery, after constant pleads from Lexie, and makes a start to physical therapy. Lexie returns home to see her sister Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her new husband Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) having sex in the kitchen. Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is at home, begging her husband Karev to spend time with her, but he dismisses her. At Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane)'s apartment, his girlfriend Lexie has moved in, and his bisexual ex-girlfriend Torres walks in on Sloan in the shower. Lexie expresses her concern to Torres about doing this, and she apologizes. Robbins confronts Shepherd, the hospital's chief of neurosurgery, and asks him to run an expensive test to see if Andy has Tethered spinal cord syndrome, which reveals that he has it, and it is reversed through surgery. Stevens notices the girl Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) saved, Amanda (Shannon Lucio), sitting outside the hospital, and tells her to go get a life, because O'Malley did not save her so she could be miserable. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens unites with Karev, and Webber announces that Seattle Grace will be merging with Mercy West.|$|E

40|$|Red light running, a {{significant}} road safety problem at signalized intersections Phil. Kicks and E. Matsoukis <b>As</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running is defined any observation during which a vehicle crossed the stop line after {{the occurrence of}} <b>a</b> <b>red</b> traffic <b>light.</b> <b>A</b> number of studies on <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running behavior have indicated that <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running is <b>a</b> significant road safety problem. In order {{to gain a better}} understanding of the occurrence of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running and the characteristics of this high accident risk behavior, the Transport Study Unit of the University of Patras, Greece has carried out a relevant project. This work consisted of various parts: 1. Review of existing literature on <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running and its impact on road safety; 2. Analysis of accidents involving <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running; 3. Find out what measures have been taken elsewhere; 4. Conduct an observation pilot study for a signalized intersection in the Patras, to identify <b>red</b> <b>light</b> incidents. In the conclusions it is found, that an analysis of accidents alone, does not provide information on the extent of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running on <b>a</b> road network. The study indicates that a number of other issues ought to be investigated, before countermeasures, such as e. g. <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras should be suggested...|$|R
