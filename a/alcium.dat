The term “digestive juice calcium ” is more in-clusive necessitating consideration of the quantity reabsorbed. For the purpose of this discussion the endogenous fecal calcium will be considered as all the calcium secreted into the intestine including that quantity which may be reabsorbed. With the ap-plication of radioisotope technics to the study of intestinal calcium secretion, it became possible to make an estimate of the endogenous fecal calcium so defined.

40|$|C <b>alcium</b> {{homeostasis}} in cardiac myocytes is {{of functional}} importance {{for at least}} three rea-sons. First, cardiac myocytes must achieve a resting cytosolic calcium ion concentration ([Ca 2 +]) of < 200 nmol/L if the contractile elements are to relax. With extracellular [Ca 2 "] at 1 mmol/L, this low [Ca 2 "] must be maintained {{in the presence of a}} 5, 000 -fold gradient for Ca 2 ' across the sarcolemma. Second, cou-pling of excitation to contraction (E-C coupling) in heart involves a complex interaction of membrane elec-tric events mediated by specific ion channels in the sarcolemma. This results in calcium influx, the release of calcium from intracellular stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via Ca 2 +-specific channels in the SR membrane, and subsequent extrusion of the calcium...|$|E

40|$|Calcium {{homeostasis}} balances passive calcium leak {{and active}} calcium uptake. Human Bax inhibitor– 1 (hBI- 1) is an antiapoptotic protein thatmediates a calcium leak and {{is representative of}} a highly conserved and widely distributed family, the transmembrane Bax inhibitor motif (TMBIM) proteins. Here, we present crystal structures of a bacterial homolog and characterize its calcium leak activity. The structure has a seven-transmembrane-helix fold that features two triple-helix sandwiches wrapped around a central C-terminal helix. Structures obtained in closed and open conformations are reversibly interconvertible by change of pH. A hydrogen-bonded, pKa (whereKa is the acid dissociation constant) –perturbed pair of conserved aspartate residues explains the pH dependence of this transition, and biochemical studies show that pH regulates calcium influx in proteoliposomes. Homology models for hBI- 1 provide insights into TMBIM-mediated calcium leak and cytoprotective activity.

With this method, false low results were found in the serum and urine of patients receiving intravenous calcium gluconate. The interference can be prevented by ashing of the specimen. <b>ALCIUM</b> GLUCONATE is frequently administered in clinical and experi-mental circumstances in which magnesium metabolism is being stud-ied. Calcium giuconate has been used to study the effects of calcium on blood levels and renal excretion of magnesium (1, 2).

40|$|A {{theoretical}} nalysis of {{the relevant}} thermodynamic and electrochemical data revealed that the electrolytic regenera-tion of the calcium reductant and the solvent salt from the spent salt of the neodymium oxide reduction process is feasi-ble. Electrolytic decomposition f CaO dissolved in CaC 12 -CaF 2 molten salt between a graphite anode and a Ca-Zn molten pool cathode was achieved at a potential higher than 2. 2 V, which was determined from current-voltage curves. Calcium recovery {{in the range of}} 10 to 20 % was obtained in these experiments. Electrolytic <b>alcium</b> transport experiments proved that the poor calcium recovery was not due to difficulty of calcium incorporation i to the Ca-Zn molten pool cathode. Chemical equil ibrium experiments along with chemical analysis of the phases established that the parasitic formation of calcium carbonate at the anode was the primary reason for the low calcium recovery.

This is a known locality for pectolite and prehnite. The contents of one vug revealed a white-pink mass with small acicular crystals discernible.

The biological significance of these observations is cliscussecL Cells which are immature Or possess a high rate of mitotic activity are in general very sensitive to radiation damage (1). Therefore, the rat intestinal epithelium, which completely regenerates every 3 to 5 days, is an extremely radiosensitive tissue (2). Marked alterations in the physiologic function of the gastrointestinal tract are produced by relatively small doses of radia-tion. Symptoms of whole-body irradiation in the rat are anorexia, dehydration, diar-rhea. reduced gastric emptying, and intesti-nal propulsive motility (3). Further, ir-radiation has previously been shown to reduce the intestinal absorption of carbohy-drate, fatty acids, sodium, and fluid (4 - 7).

40|$|Abstract. The tensile {{strength}} and {{elongation at break}} of epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) was investigated by adding different concentration of calcium stearate. Two grades of epoxidized natural rubber (ENR), namely, ENR 25 and ENR 40 were used as model materials. Semi-efficient vulcanization (semi-EV) was used throughout the study. The tensile property of unaged and aged ENR vulcanizates was determined by using U-CAN electron tensile testing machine. Results indicate that {{tensile strength}} and elongation at break of unaged ENR 25 and ENR 40 vulcanizates increase gradually with increasing concentration of calcium stearate up to about 1 phr of calcium stearate and after which, the tensile strength and elongation at break drop with a further increase in calcium stearate loading. For a similar <b>alcium</b> stearate concentration, the tensile strength and elongation at break of ENR 40 vulcanizates exhibits a consistently higher value than that of ENR 25 vulcanizates, {{which is due to}} the higher crosslink density of ENR 40 which contains more epoxide groups than ENR 25. For aged samples, the addition of calcium stearate could enhance the tensile strength and elongation at break of aged samples. Percentage retention of tensile strength and elongation at break also gradually increases with calcium stearate loading. That means that the incorporation of calcium stearate is found to improve the aging resistance of ENR vulcanizates. This is because calciu...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. With {{the use of}} single-cell {{digital imaging}} of the {{fluorescent}} Ca 2 + indicator dye fura- 2 we investigated Ca 2 + signaling in human T lymphocytes and NK cells during activation {{by a variety of}} stimuli. A low percentage of resting T cells or T cell blasts displayed oscillations in cytosolic Ca 2 + when stimulated with the mitogenic lectin PHAor by the addition of OKT 3 mAb followed by a secondary cross-linking antibody. Lymphokine-activated T killer cells were more responsive than resting cells. A comparison of PHA, cross-linked anti-CD 3, and a heteroconjugate mAb showed that at least 20 % of the cells from these T cell preparations oscillated. Addition of PHA or cross-linked anti-CDl 6 caused NK cells to oscillate. In contrast, thapsigargin, a microsomal ATPase blocker, resulted in a relatively uniform, slowly rising and sustained Ca 2 + response in all cell types studied. The maintenance of both thapsigargin- and receptor-induced responses required Ca 2 + influx driven by a negative membrane potential. Because Ca 2 + oscillations occurred in response to stimuli which mimic the normal activation of lymphocytes, and inasmuch as the percentage of oscillating cells increases with state of activation, these oscillations may {{play an important role in}} mitogenic activation. journal of /rnrnuno/ogy, 1993, 150 : 2620.

The 3 ~p MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra of the low-phosphate-concentration (0. 79 ~mol P sorbed g- 1 CaCO 3) sample {{show that the}} sorbed phosphate is most likely unprotonated, but the 3 ~p nucleus has a dipolar coupling to nearby protons. At this low concentration, the sorbed phosphate {{is not in the}} form of hydroxyapatite, nor does its spectrum resemble the 3 ~p CP-MAS NMR spectra of amorphous calcium phosphates previously characterized byother investigators. The solid state 3 ~p NMR spectra of samples with 3. 33 - 36. 72 #tool P sorbed g- ~ CaCO 3 suggest the formation of a carbonated, apatitic-like phase.

40|$|ABSTRACT Stimulation {{through the}} antigen {{receptor}} (TCR) of T lymphocytes triggers cytosolic <b>alcium</b> ([Ca 2 +]i) oscillations that are critically dependent on Ca 2 + entry across the plasma membrane. We {{have investigated the}} roles of Ca ~+ influx and depletion of intracellular Ca 2 + stores in the oscillation mechanism, using single-cell Ca 2 + imaging techniques and agents that deplete the stores. Thapsigar-gin (TG; 5 - 25 nM), cyclopiazonic acid (CPA; 5 - 20 p,M), and tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ; 80 - 200 p,M), inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPases, {{as well as the}} Ca 2 ÷ ionophore ionomycin (5 - 40 nM), elicit [Ca 2 +]i oscillations in human T cells. The oscillation frequency is ~ 5 mHz (for ATPase inhibitors) to ~ 10 mHz (for ionomycin) at 22 - 24 °C. The [Ca 2 +]i oscillations resemble those evoked by TCR ligation in terms of their shape, amplitude, and an absolute dependence on Ca 2 + influx. CaZ+-ATPase inhibitors and ionomycin induce oscillations only within a narrow range of drug concentrations that are expected to cause partial depletion of intracellular stores. Ca 2 +-induced Ca z+ release {{does not appear to be}} significantly involved, as rapid removal of extracellular Ca 2 + elicits the same rate of [Ca 2 +]i decline during the rising and falling phases of the oscillation cycle. Both transmem-brane Ca z+ influx and the content of ionomycin-releasable Ca 2 + pools fluctuate in oscillating cells. From these data, we propose a model in which [Ca 2 +]i oscillations in T cells result from the interaction between intracellular Ca 2 ÷ stores and depletion-activated Ca ~+ channels in the plasma membrane...|$|E
40|$|The hot Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) in {{clusters}} of galaxies {{is a very}} large repository of metals produced by supernovae. We aim to accurately measure the abundances in the ICM of many clusters and compare these data with metal yields produced by supernovae. Using the data archive of the XMM-Newton X-ray observatory, we compile a sample of 22 clusters. We fit spectra extracted from the core regions and determine the abundances of silicon, sulfur, argon, <b>alcium,</b> iron, and nickel. The abundances from the spectral fits are subsequently fitted to supernova yields determined from several supernova type Ia and core-collapse supernova models. We find that the argon and calcium abundances cannot be fitted with currently favoured supernova type Ia models. We obtain a major improvement of the fit, when we use an empirically modified delayed-detonation model that is calibrated on the Tycho supernova remnant. The two modified parameters are the density where the sound wave in the supernova turns into a shock and the ratio of the specific internal energies of ions and electrons at the shock. Our fits also suggest that the core-collapse supernovae that contributed to the enrichment of the ICM had progenitors which were already enriched. The Ar/Ca ratio {{in clusters}} is a good touchstone for determining the quality of type Ia models. The core-collapse contribution, which is about 50 % and not strongly dependent on the IMF or progenitor metallicity, does not {{have a significant impact on}} the Ar/Ca ratio. The number ratio between supernova type Ia and core-collapse supernovae suggests that binary systems in the appropriate mass range are very efficient (~ 5 - 16 %) in eventually forming supernova type Ia explosions.
