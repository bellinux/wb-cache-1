25|$|In the Cairo museum may be {{seen the}} statue of {{a man from the}} period of the Great Pyramid of Giza, {{possibly}} 4000 B.C. The expression of the face and the realism of the carriage have never been surpassed by any Egyptian sculptor of this or any other period. The figure is carved out of a solid block of sycamore, and in accordance with the Egyptian custom the arms are joined on. The eyes are inlaid with pieces of opaque white quartz, with a line of bronze surrounding to imitate the lid; a small disk of transparent rock crystal forms the iris, while <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> polished ebony fixed behind the crystal imparts to it a lifelike sparkle. The IV., V. and VI. dynasties cover the finest period of Egyptian sculpture. The statues found in the tombs show a freedom of treatment which was never reached in later times. They are all portraits, which the artist strove his utmost to render exactly like his model. For these are not, like mere modern statues, simply works of art, but had primarily a religious signification (Maspero). As the spirits of the deceased might inhabit, these Ka statues, the features and proportions were closely copied.|$|E
500|$|B. edulis is {{considered}} one of the safest wild mushrooms to pick for the table, as no poisonous species closely resemble it. The most similar poisonous mushroom may be the devil's bolete (Rubroboletus satanas), which has a similar shape, but has a red stem and stains blue on bruising. It is often confused with the very bitter and unpalatable Tylopilus felleus, but can be distinguished by the reticulation on the stalk; in porcini, it is a whitish, net-like pattern on a brownish stalk, whereas it is a dark pattern on white in the latter. Porcini have whitish pores while the other has pink. If in doubt, tasting <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> flesh will yield a bitter taste. It can also resemble the [...] "bolete-like" [...] Gyroporus castaneus, which is generally smaller, and has a browner stem.|$|E
500|$|These {{were ready}} in February 1940, and Dunning, Eugene T. Booth and Aristid von Grosse then {{carried out a}} series of experiments. They {{demonstrated}} that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched. Pegram forwarded the results to Briggs on March 11, 1940; they were subsequently published to the Physical Reviews March 15 and April 15, 1940 issues. [...] Briggs reported to Watson on April 9 that it was doubtful that a chain reaction could be initiated in uranium without uranium enrichment, and therefore urged that research be undertaken into isotope separation technology. Nier, Booth, Dunning and von Grosse's [...] results were discussed by Jesse Beams, Ross Gunn, Fermi, Nier, Merle Tuve and Harold Urey at the spring meeting of the American Physical Society in Washington, D.C., in the last week of April 1940. The New York Times reported that conferees argued [...] "the probability of some scientist blowing up a sizable portion of the earth with <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> uranium." ...|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 2 {{and a half}} stars out of four, calling it a [...] "a barbed, uncompromising attack on {{generally}} observed community standards". In The New York Times, Vincent Canby declared it [...] "the Ben Hur of sketch films, {{which is to say that}} it's <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> out <b>of</b> proportion", concluding it was amusing, but he wished it were consistently amusing. Variety staff assessed it as disgusting, ridiculous, tactless, but above all, amusing.|$|R
500|$|In 1980 Donen {{made the}} science fiction film Saturn 3, {{starring}} Kirk Douglas, Farrah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel. Donen first {{read the script}} when its writer (and Movie Movies set designer) John Barry showed it to him, prompting Donen to pass it along to Lew Grade. Donen was initially hired to produce, but Grade asked him to complete the film when first-time director Barry was unable to direct. According to Donen [...] "only <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> what Barry shot {{ended up in the}} finished film." [...] It was a critical and financial disaster and initially Donen {{did not want to be}} credited as director. In the early 1980s Donen was attached to direct an adaptation of Stephen King's The Dead Zone and worked with writer Jeffrey Boam on the script. Donen eventually dropped out of the project and David Cronenberg directed the film a few years later. Boam stated that Donen was initially attracted to making the film because he wanted to [...] "connect with contemporary youthful audiences" [...] and that the script that they worked on together was [...] "very close to the script that David wound up making." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{morning after}} the November 2015 Paris attacks, German pianist Davide Martello brought a grand piano to the street {{out in front of}} the Bataclan, where 89 concertgoers had been shot dead the night before, and {{performed}} an instrumental version to honour the victims of the attacks; video of his performance went viral. This led Katy Waldman of Slate to ponder why [...] "Imagine" [...] had become so frequently performed as a response to tragedy. In addition to its general popularity, she noted its musical simplicity, its key of C major, [...] "the plainest and least complicated key, with no sharps or flats" [...] aside from one passage with [...] "a plaintive major seventh chord that allows <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> E minor into the tonic". That piano part, [...] "gentle as a rocking chair", underpins lyrics that, Waldman says, [...] "belongs to the tradition of hymns or spirituals that visualize a glorious afterlife without prophesizing any immediate end to suffering on earth". This understanding is also compounded by the historical context of Lennon's own violent death, [...] "remind us that the universe can run ramshod over idealistic people". Ultimately, the song [...] "captures the fragility of our hope after a violent or destructive event ... t also reveals its tenacity".|$|E

He estimated it to be 'at least a few million dollars' and said: [...] "You can't buy that kind of empowerment. To just know that as far as you are aware, you have not got a price; that there is not an amount of money large enough to make you compromise even <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> principle that, as it turned out, would make no practical difference anyway.

60|$|Miss Stokes still came to {{the station}} with the wain: Monkey-nuts, Albert called her, though not to her face. For she was very clear and good-looking, almost she seemed to gleam. And Albert was <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> afraid <b>of</b> her. She very rarely {{addressed}} Joe whilst the hay-loading was going on, and that young man always turned his back to her. He seemed thinner, and his limber figure looked more slouching. But still it had the tender, attractive appearance, especially from behind. His tanned face, a little thinned and darkened, took a handsome, slightly sinister look.|$|R

2500|$|Helmsley {{was known}} for [...] "tyrannizing her employees". According to Alan Dershowitz, while breakfasting with her {{at one of the}} Helmsley hotels, the waiter brought him a cup of tea with <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> water spilled on the saucer. She grabbed the cup from him and smashed it on the floor, then demanded that the waiter get down {{on his hands and knees}} and beg for his job." [...] In another account of Helmsley's behavior, she had a {{barbecue}} pit constructed for her home. The work was performed by Eugene Brennan, a personal friend of Jeremiah McCarthy, the chief engineer of Helmsley-Spear. When the final bill came to $13,000, she refused to pay, citing shoddy workmanship. When McCarthy pleaded with her to honor the bill, citing the favor done on his behalf and informing her that Brennan had six children to support, Helmsley replied, [...] "Why didn't he keep his pants on? Then he wouldn't need the money".|$|E

It includes four songs {{recorded in the}} studio, followed by the same four songs recorded live at the Capitol Theater in Olympia, Washington {{as part of the}} Yoyo A Go Go Festival in July 1994. [...] "Pizza Break" [...] acts as an intermission between the two recordings. The album is notable for containing the first live performances of Nirvana members Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl {{following the}} death of Kurt Cobain, whom the track [...] "I'll Love You Anyway" [...] was written about. The live tracks also feature Ira Kaplan of Yo La Tengo.|$|R
50|$|The video {{begins with}} the band walking in a hallway {{in a high school}} and a clown as well {{sometimes}} holding something on his nose. Then the band starts playing in a locker room which appears to be happening at night. Jonathan Davis is seen singing and in some clips he is sitting in the locker room in the dry shower but with a few people spraying <b>a</b> little <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> water on his hair to tease him. This represents some of his painful experiences in high school of being teased. It also features the band in a gym and clips of jocks in their football jerseys and cheerleaders seen by someone who walks in the halls. One of the cheerleaders goes into the bathroom and starts smiling in the dark room with a little light and starts brushing her hair with her hands. Clips also show the band performing in a dark room. The video ends off with the cheerleader in the bathroom taking off her shirt showing a tattoo on her back showing the band's logo. The music video most likely could be them in a school after a football game at night. The music video aired in 1996 and was directed by McG.|$|R

5000|$|On 13 July 1923, the Waterloo County Pioneers' Memorial Association {{was formed}} with the {{patronage}} of the Waterloo Historical Society, and {{its board of}} directors included its members and descendants of the first Mennonite families to move to the area. The tower was conceived by William Henry Breithaupt, president of the association, who wanted to commemorate the Mennonites who had moved to the area (and also the first farmers of Waterloo Region), and to heal the wounds of earlier nationalism that led to the city's name change. Breithaupt, according to local historian Rych Mills, [...] "was trying to just re-jig our history <b>a</b> little <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> because <b>of</b> all the troubles we went through in World War One." [...] A group petitioned the council of the County of Wellington to build the tower.|$|R

The great cricket match was perhaps the most searching and awkward time they annually went through together, for Jolyon had been at Eton. They would be particularly careful during that match, continually saying: [...] "Hooray! Oh! hard luck, old man!" [...] or [...] "Hooray! Oh! bad luck, Dad!" [...] to each other, when some disaster at which their hearts bounded happened to the opposing school. And Jolyon would wear a grey top hat, instead of his usual soft one, to save his son's feelings, for a black top hat he could not stomach. When Jolly went up to Oxford, Jolyon went up with him, amused, humble, and a little anxious not to discredit his boy amongst all these youths who seemed so much more assured and old than himself. He often thought, 'Glad I'm a painter' for he had long dropped under-writing at Lloyds--'it's so innocuous. You can't look down on a painter--you can't take him seriously enough.' For Jolly, who had a sort of natural lordliness, had passed at once into a very small set, who secretly amused his father. The boy had fair hair which curled a little, and his grandfather's deepset iron-grey eyes. He was well-built and very upright, and always pleased Jolyon's aesthetic sense, so that he was <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> afraid <b>of</b> him, as artists ever are of those of their own sex whom they admire physically. On that occasion, however, he actually did screw up his courage to give his son advice, and this was it: ...|$|R

A band of braided grasses about her brow held in place a few gaudy feathers from the parakeet, while other bits of grass were fashioned into imitations of arm and leg ornaments of metal. Geeka was a perfect little savage; but at heart she was unchanged, being the same omnivorous listener as of yore. An excellent trait in Geeka was that she never interrupted in order to talk about herself. Today was no exception. She had been listening attentively to Meriem for an hour, propped against the bole of a tree while her lithe, young mistress stretched catlike and luxurious along a swaying branch before her.|$|E
