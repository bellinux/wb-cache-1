40|$|Masih and Masih (1996) {{recently}} {{presented an}} analysis of crime in a temporal Granger-causal framework, and explored empirically some of the determinants of crime in Australia using annual data over the period 1963 - 90. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the role exerted by earnings inequality and unemployment in the determination of crime. Using a panel of <b>annual</b> <b>regional</b> <b>data</b> from 1979 to 1993 for England and Wales, we find that the growth in earnings inequality and unemployment impact positively on five types of criminal activity examined. ...|$|E
40|$|Subnational {{regional}} jurisdictions {{rarely have}} {{at their disposal}} a reasonable array of timely statistics to monitor their economic condition. In light of this, we develop a procedure that simultaneously estimates a quarterly time series for all regions of a country based upon quarterly national and <b>annual</b> <b>regional</b> <b>data.</b> While other such techniques exist, we suggest a temporal error structure that eliminates possible spurious jumps. Using our approach, regional analysts should now be able to distribute national growth among regions as soon as quarterly national figures are released. In a Spanish application, we detail some practicalities {{of the process and}} show that our proposal produces better estimates than the uniregional methods often used.

40|$|Housing markets may {{significantly}} affect {{the relationship between}} regional population and employment, if housing supply is not fully accommodative to demand. We analyse the relationships between housing supply, regional population and employment empirically in a three-equation dynamic model. <b>Annual</b> <b>regional</b> panel <b>data</b> are used for the Netherlands, where a strong tradition of spatial planning exists. We find that net internal migration is strongly determined by housing supply, whereas employment growth has no statistically significant impact. Growth of the housing stock is only moderately affected by population and employment, possibly {{as a result of}} restrictive spatial policies. Employment adjusts substantially towards a long-run relationship with the regional population. The analysis further indicates that labour markets drive this long-run adjustment more than local consumer demand. Hence, people follow houses rather than jobs, and jobs follow people in the long run. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{regard to}} {{territorial}} differences, the Centre and South {{are more inclined}} to get married in church and to avoid Lenten weddings. This result may seem to contrast with that reported by Ruiu and Breschi (2015). In particular, they claim that the North is more likely to respect religious precepts. However, {{it must be noted that}} the results of the two works are not directly comparable in empirical terms. In fact, Ruiu and Breschi’s analysis is based on <b>annual</b> <b>regional</b> <b>data</b> on the number of celebrations in April. As such, we must consider a much wider interval of time (approximately 30  years), while estimating a mean effect for this time interval on the fluctuations in April marriages, in terms of Lenten days that fall in this month. Therefore, if we want to measure change, it makes more sense to compare the picture of the country taken by Federici (1964) with the one proposed in this work, rather than Ruiu and Breschi (2015), who aimed to describe the transition from the old model of wedding seasonality to the current one, a change that naturally took place over a long period.|$|E
