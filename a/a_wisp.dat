5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E

25|$|Australia was 151 {{for seven}} – {{and the man}} wreaking the havoc was F. R. Brown! That was the {{remarkable}} part of this afternoon of sensations...one would not expect him to run through a first-class side of batsman, yet here was {{his name on the}} board with three Test batsman to his credit at a very small cost and at a very vital stage of the game. With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and an ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> of straw in his mouth to make him look like the original Farmer Brown.|$|E

25|$|Covered by {{only four}} riflemen, he fought {{for four hours}} under terrific enemy small-arms fire and {{repeatedly}} returned to his own lines to prepare demolition charges and obtain serviced flame throwers. He returned to the front, frequently {{to the rear of}} hostile emplacements, to wipe out one position after another. At one point, <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> of smoke alerted him to the air vent of a Japanese bunker, and he approached close enough to put the nozzle of his flamethrower through the hole, killing the occupants. On another occasion, he was charged by enemy riflemen who attempted to stop him with bayonets and he killed them with a burst of flame from his weapon.|$|E

500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are widely}} {{contrasting}} views about Brown's personality. He was well-liked in Australia when he captained England there in 1950–51 as recorded by O'Reilly (see above). According to Kay, Brown had a hearty appetite {{for food and}} drink and was combative and forceful by nature, which endeared him to the Australian public. Jack Fingleton commented: [...] "With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> of straw in his mouth {{to make him look}} like the original Farmer Brown". On the other hand, professional players viewed Brown's silk neckerchief with contempt as it [...] "enhanced the impression of a bumptious windbag". Brown was considered [...] "a bully who preyed on weakness or quirk of character".|$|E
2500|$|The Kecksburg UFO {{incident}} occurred on December 9, 1965, at Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, United States. A large, brilliant fireball {{was seen by}} thousands in at least six U.S. states and Ontario, Canada. It streaked over the Detroit, Michigan – Windsor, Canada area, reportedly dropped hot metal debris over Michigan and northern Ohio, starting some grass fires, and caused sonic booms in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. It was generally assumed and reported by the press to be a meteor after authorities discounted other proposed explanations such as a plane crash, errant missile test, or reentering satellite debris. However, eyewitnesses in the small village of Kecksburg, about 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, claimed something crashed in the woods. A boy said he saw the object land; his mother saw <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> of blue smoke arising from the woods and alerted authorities. Another reported feeling a vibration and [...] "a thump" [...] {{about the time the}} object reportedly landed. Others from Kecksburg, including local volunteer fire department members, reported finding an object in the shape of an acorn and about as large as a Volkswagen Beetle. Writing resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs was also said to be in a band {{around the base of the}} object. Witnesses further reported that intense military presence, most notably the United States Army, secured the area, ordered civilians out, and then removed an object on a flatbed truck. The military claimed they searched the woods and found [...] "absolutely nothing." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16 - 18 mm. The head and thorax are grey, spotted with white. The abdomen is grey. The forewings are dust grey, thickly dusted with white and brown scales forming scattered flecks or blotches, {{one of which}} is generally present on the middle of the space between the base of the wing and the fissure. A larger one is found before the fissure and separated from it by a whitish space, below this is a longitudinal streak of scales, bordered basally by a white spot and separated from the spot before the fissure by a whitish space. Two blackish streaks or spots occur on the costa, the larger one above the base of fissure, the other half-way between it and the apex of the wing. The fringes are greyish, cut with white under the apices of the lobes and on the anal angles, where there is <b>a</b> white <b>wisp.</b> <b>A</b> similar <b>wisp</b> is found before the apex and on the anal angle of the second lobe. A brown dot sometimes rests on the base of each of the three wisps. The hindwings are brownish grey with a diffuse brown dot on the apex of each feather or at least on the first. Adults are on wing in April, June and December.|$|R
