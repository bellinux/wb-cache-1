5|$|Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th {{century the}} advowson of Chesham Woburn {{remained}} attached to Woburn Abbey and was transferred, {{along with the}} abbey building, to John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford. The advowson of Chesham Leicester was sold, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> had a succession of owners, eventually coming into the ownership of prominent local landowners the Skottowe family, who purchased it from Sir Francis Whichcote, MP for Cambridgeshire. From 1601 onwards, other than a brief period between 1623–1660, the appointees of Chesham Woburn and Chesham Leicester were the same person, and thus the parish was served by a single vicar, although he continued to be appointed by the holders of each advowson separately. In 1769 John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, who had inherited Chesham Woburn, also acquired Chesham Leicester <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> the parish was served by a single vicar assisted by multiple curates; in 1767 {{the two halves of}} the parish were formally unified by an Act of Parliament.|$|E

In 1982, Laucke was selected by Andrés Segovia to perform for the PBS network at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. He became Segovia's pupil, and studied with other classical guitar players including Julian Bream and Alirio Díaz. Laucke performed mainly on classical guitar until 1990, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> his concerts consisted solely of flamenco and new flamenco.|$|E
5|$|Millions {{turned out}} in major cities across Egypt on the 25th, {{especially}} in Cairo's Tahrir Square. In the beginning, tensions were high between the police and protesters with violence breaking out in Suez and Alexandria.

5|$|By this point, the Luftwaffe had {{subjected}} the UK {{to a major}} {{air campaign}} and caused {{an enormous amount of}} destruction and displacement of civilians. However, it failed to bring the UK to peace talks, nor had any obvious effect on economic output. At the end of May the Germans called off The Blitz, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> the UK would be subject to dramatically lower rates of bombing. How much of this was due to the effects of the night fighter force has been a matter of considerable debate among historians. The Germans were turning their attention eastward, and most of the Luftwaffe was sent to support these efforts. Even in May, the losses represent only 2.4% of the attacking force, a tiny number that was easily replaceable by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|Château Gaillard was {{captured}} in 1204 by the king of France, Philip II, after a lengthy siege. In the mid-14th century, the castle was the residence of the exiled David II of Scotland. The castle changed hands {{several times in the}} Hundred Years' War, but in 1449 the French king captured Château Gaillard from the English king definitively, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> it remained in French ownership. Henry IV of France ordered the demolition of Château Gaillard in 1599; although it was in ruins at the time, it was felt to be a threat to the security of the local population. The castle ruins are listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. The inner bailey {{is open to the public}} from March to November, and the outer baileys are open all year.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{part of the}} Diocese of Lincoln, {{it served}} what was {{historically}} the largest parish in Buckinghamshire, and the church traditionally had two vicars. Initially the advowson (the right to appoint the vicar) was held jointly {{by a pair of}} prominent local families, but {{in the wake of the}} 12th century civil wars of the reign of King Stephen(1135–1154), the advowsons were granted to the monks of Woburn Abbey and to the Abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis in Leicester, each of whom appointed their own vicars to the parish. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries Woburn Abbey, together with its half of the advowson, was granted to the Earls of Bedford, while the half that had belonged to Leicester Abbey passed through a succession of private owners. In 1769 the Duke of Bedford acquired the Leicester half of the advowson and unified the parish, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> the parish was served by a single vicar.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Queensland at 17 against Victoria in December 1933, having never previously attended a first-class match as a spectator. He conceded only six byes {{and took a}} catch in an innings of 542 in a tidy performance, and made 17 and three in an innings defeat, but was dropped after the match. Queensland officials had ruled {{that it was not}} advisable to take such a young player on away trips to Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. Tallon reclaimed his position when Queensland returned for their home games <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> was the first-choice wicket-keeper for the state. He played in only one other first-class match for the 193334 season, scoring 13 and taking a catch and a stumping in an eight-wicket win over South Australia.|$|E

A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author.

5|$|In 1876 Ferdinand de Rothschild {{began work}} on Waddesdon Manor, a short {{distance}} south of the Tramway's station at Waddesdon (later renamed Waddesdon Road). The top of Lodge Hill, a landmark, was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into the hill {{to provide access to}} the construction site. Transport of materials was by horse, but the contractors had to get enormous stone blocks up the hill. Rothschild's contractors built a line, known as the Winchendon Branch, which turned off the Tramway between Waddesdon and Westcott stations and ran south to the foot of Lodge Hill. From there a cable tram ran on narrow gauge rails up the hill to a gully close to the building site. Materials were hauled along the cable tramway in tubs by a steam-powered winch. The Winchendon Branch was hastily and cheaply built; after one of the Tramway's locomotives derailed there on 5 July 1876 Jones refused to allow his engines on it, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> materials were hauled along the branch by horses.|$|E

5|$|Jogaila was duly baptised at the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków on 15 February 1386 <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> {{formally}} {{used the}} name Władysław or Latin versions of it. The marriage took place three days later, and on 4 March 1386 Jogaila was crowned King Władysław by archbishop Bodzanta. He was {{also to be}} legally adopted by Jadwiga's mother, Elizabeth of Bosnia, so retaining the throne {{in the event of}} Jadwiga's death. The royal baptism triggered the conversion of most of Jogaila's court and noblemen, as well as mass baptisms in Lithuanian rivers, a beginning of the final Christianization of Lithuania. Though the ethnic Lithuanian nobility were the main converts to Catholicism—both paganism and the Orthodox rite remained strong among the peasants—the king's conversion and its political implications created lasting repercussions for the history of both Lithuania and Poland.|$|E
5|$|The Duke died in 1889, and in 1894 the {{trustees}} of his estate {{set up the}} Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O) {{with the intention of}} extending the line from Brill to Oxford. Rail services from London to Oxford were very poor at this time; despite being an extremely roundabout route, had the connection from Quainton Road to Oxford been built {{it would have been the}} shortest route between Oxford and the City of London. The Metropolitan Railway leased the Brill Tramway from 1December 1899, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> the MR (the Metropolitan line of the London Underground from July 1933) operated all services on the line.

5|$|The Grodno Sejm, held in {{the fall}} of 1793, {{nominated}} him for a membership in a military commission; this caused him to be viewed with suspicion by the majority of the dissatisfied military, and he {{was not included in the}} preparations for the upcoming uprising. Thus he was taken by surprise when the Kościuszko Insurrection erupted, and his own brigade mutinied. He declared his support for the insurgents after the libation of Warsaw, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> took an active part in the uprising, defending Warsaw and leading an army corps in support of an uprising in Greater Poland. His courage was commended by Tadeusz Kościuszko himself, the Supreme Commander of the National Armed Forces, who promoted him to the rank of general.|$|E

5|$|The third {{variation}} {{added by}} Petipa was also composed by Drigo and has survived {{as one of}} the most beloved passages of Giselle. This variation, sometimes dubbed as the Pas seul, was arranged in 1887 for the ballerina Elena Cornalba. The variation was also danced by Cornalba's successors in the role of Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre. Cornalba's variation was first performed outside of Russia by Olga Spessivtzeva in 1924 at the Paris Opéra, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> all productions staged outside of Russia included the variation. There was much confusion at that time as to who was responsible for composing the music, leading many ballet historians and musicologists to credit Ludwig Minkus as the author, a misconception which still persists.|$|E
5|$|Other offices {{included}} the sworn clerks, the examiners, the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight sworn clerks, so called {{because they were}} sworn officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn clerks were assisted by 24side clerks, of whom each sworn clerk appointed three. Each side clerk studied under a sworn clerk for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk's name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to sworn clerk, first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn clerks themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the files of the depositions. In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be sworn officers of the court, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>then</b> <b>on</b> each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron's name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an examiner, each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a sworn officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E
