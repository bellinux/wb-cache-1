5000|$|Like {{many other}} workers' leaders of his generation, such as Hjalmar Branting in Sweden, Stauning was a charismatic leader who played an {{important}} role in integrating Danish society after the social changes following the Industrial Revolution and common suffrage.

The following Great Depression brought Danish unemployment to unprecedented heights. This period of widespread social malaise was fertile ground for leaders, who could communicate a confident and coherent vision to the masses.

[...] Their own analysis found that excess mortality in Danish same-sex marriages since 1995 was [...] "restricted to the first few years after a marriage, presumably reflecting preexisting illness at the time of marriage". Similarly, critics have argued that obituaries in gay-themed newspapers, which Cameron used to estimate homosexual mortality, do not provide a representative sample of deaths and ignore surviving members of the same generation.|$|R
40|$|Ariel is {{an example}} of a new {{approach}} to user interfaces called Augmented Reality (see Wellner et al., 1993, Mackay et al., 1993). The goal is to allow users to continue to use the ordinrny, everyday objects they encounter in their daily work, and then to enhance or augment them with functionality from the computer. Ariel is designed to augment the use of a particular type of paper document: engineering drawings. Computer information (menus, multimedia annotations, access to a media space) is projected onto a drawing and users can interact with both the projected information and the paper drawing. The design of Ariel is based on studies of users in a distributed cooperative work setting (the construction of a bridge) combined with a scenario-based design approach in which users contribute to the development of design scenarios. This video shows the third Ariel prototype. Future versions will continue to evolve, based on input from users when the system is installed at the work site.

The choice to accept or discard suboptimal food is taken either before or after purchase (hence, in the retail store or in the household). The aim of the European research project COSUS (Consumers in a sustainable food supply chain) was to increase consumer acceptance of suboptimal food, before and after purchase, by implementing targeted strategies that are based on consumer insights, and that are feasible for and acceptable by the food sector. To reach this aim, different methodological approaches were applied to analyze this issue, to experiment with different aspects, and to test the resulting interventions. Each of these approaches was undertaken by competent consortium <b>partners</b> from <b>Denmark,</b> Germany, Norway, Sweden and The Netherlands.

Within European funded project INSTALL (Innovative Solutions to Acquire Learning to Learn), to be developed {{over the next two years}} in Italy (lead <b>partner),</b> Romania, <b>Denmark,</b> Ireland, and Spain, this paper discusses the effectiveness of the use of qualitative tools to promote a reflexive competence on the formative experience and so a functional adjustment to the university context. The Narrative Mediation Path (NMP) is an innovative and qualitative methodology that develops a group training process targeted to disadvantaged students. NMP, based on the psychological concept of mentalization, also known as reflexive competence (Fonagy & Target, 1997; Allen & Fonagy, 2008), combines into one methodology four discursive modules: Metaphoric, Iconographic, Writing and Bodily. The use of ???multidimensional??? narrative (Hermans, 2001), promote a progressive cognitive and emotional involvement of the student; a gradual transition from exploration of the entire university experience to a specific and individual experience and a gradual evolution from a reconstructive function of the formative experience to a planning function that allows students to act in an effective way in the university context. The results suggest that the use of different discursive modules supports the students in the recognition of different abilities...|$|R

40|$|Whilst UK HE {{is facing}} radical and {{fundamental}} transformation {{as a consequence}} of funding changes in England, HE systems across Europe are also addressing challenges related to skills shortages and funding gaps. Of particular concern across Europe is the experience of part time vocational learners who face barriers in transition to academic study, markedly so in countries such as Germany where the passage between these educational experiences is impermeably set from an early age. In England, there is in theory greater permeability but in practice, the social class system has created constructs which set limits to individual aspiration and progression into and through higher education, more so for part time students. This paper reports on the preliminary stages of a German Federal Republic funded project, Opening up Universities to Lifelong Learning (OPULL). Led by Leuphana University and comprising <b>partners</b> in <b>Denmark,</b> Finland and the UK, the project aims to identify good practice in transitions between vocational and academic study and full time and part time modes in order to enhance opportunities for lifelong learning. The first phase of the project has mapped the educational systems of each of the participating countries, highlighting the existing opportunities for flexibility and examples of good practice which might be tested in other contexts. This work will form the basis of the future phases which will conduct comparative evaluation of part time student experiences, explore the potential for transferrable recognition of prior achievement for vocational learners and recommend models for European -wide lifelong learning schemes. The mapping reports revealed a range of issues which highlight the importance of cultural context but also reveal some potentially transferable practices. This paper focuses on the learning from the German and English mapping exercises and shows that, whilst there have been some effective initiatives in the latter which might transfer well, they have all been victims of policy short-termism. The consequences and implications for the next phase of the project are discussed. ...|$|R

In 2012 the British Ceramics Biennial invited KHiB to develop a site-specific artistic response to the former Spode Factory in Stoke-on-Trent as {{a key element of}} their 2013 exhibition programme. The project explores the landscape and associated histories of post-industry, with an initial emphasis on Stoke-on-Trent, a world-renowned ceramics capital that bears evidence of fluctuations in global fortunes. The original Spode Factory, situated in the heart of Stoke-on-Trent, was once a keystone of the city’s industrial heritage, which operated upon its original site for over 230 years. Amongst Spode’s contributions to ceramic history are the perfection of under-glaze blue printing and fine bone china. In 2008 Spode’s Church Street site closed, with most of its production infrastructure and contents left intact. The site and its remnants has been the point of departure for the interdisciplinary artistic research of over 50 participating artists, historians and theoreticians over six residencies. Topographies is a framework, formulating topics and research strands which are treated as questions and approaches that are addressed through artistic practice. By honing in on the particular history and the singularity of this site, Topographies questions what is, and how can ceramic and clay be understood as both material and subject in contemporary art practice. How can we perceive the material (clay/ceramics) to be or constitute a site? Moreover, how do ceramics and clay form and construct our understanding of the site?

40|$|This study {{revolves}} around a research on, to what extend the constitutional, {{political and social}} processes of nation-building {{could be seen as}} the missing link, in South Sudan’s ‘New Deal’ process, initiated early after the country’s independence in 2011. ‘The New Deal’ was a breakthrough agreement between fragile states and partners, to change the policy and practice of engagement. Focussing on state-building and aid-effectiveness. South Sudan launched the New Deal in August 2012, {{and was one of the}} pilot countries, with <b>partner</b> countries being <b>Denmark,</b> Netherlands and the U. K. After the outbreak of violence in South Sudan in December 2013, the process of the New Deal collapsed. The current crisis has been a continuum of the violent processes of state consolidation and the failure of an elite compact to consolidate its control over the state, failing to respond to the dominance of a small elite class over the politics of the state. Despite that fact, that the current conflict does not have its roots in ethnicity - tribalism, nepotism, corruption, and exclusion on ethnicity, age, or gender bases are often seen as the main causes for state-fragility in South Sudan. Thereby a major conclusion in this study is that a sense of national unity and collective national identity could help prevent future conflict. Furthermore, its concluded that ethnic diversities is a major driver for conflict in South Sudan at the moment, and that a state building project, without reference to nation-building, would be unlikely to have a successful outcome. By that conclusion, it is not being stated that nation-building were the missing link, in the failed New Deal process initiated in 2011, as many factors have had a role to play in that failure. However, the conclusion is, that a future similar project will be sure to fail as well, if not placing a greater emphasis on nation-building, and hereby the important involvement of the youth, civil society and local actors...|$|R
