The author found that namely during the considered period a long-term problem of uneven zoning of the Kharkiv medical network emerged.

The participants were recently retired group, aged 50 and above (N= 47, 42 female). Prior training sessions were arranged for the participants before the intervention period. Pre and post assessment of depressive mood was measured through applying the original form of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and positive mood was measure through the positive affect items of the CED-D sub-scale. Data was analyzed with descriptive statistics, paired t test, general linear model-repeated measure and multiple response frequency analysis. Our main finding observed a non-significant change in positive and depressive mood in the pre-post intervention period. At both measurement levels, the participants had an high level of positive mood and low level of depressive symptoms.
