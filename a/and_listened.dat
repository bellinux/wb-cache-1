In this research, the correlational method was used and it was carried out in October to November 2014 at SMA Muhammadiyah 1 Surakarta. The population was science class of the eleventh grade students of SMA Muhammadiyah 1 Surakartain Academic Year 2014 / 2015, which consisted of three classes. The number of population was 73 students and this research took 30 students as the sample by cluster random sampling. A questionnaire was used to collect the data of students’learning motivation, whilean objective test was used to collect the data of vocabulary mastery <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension. Single <b>and</b> Multiple Linear Regression and Correlation were used to analyze the data. The result of the analysis shows that (1) there is a positive correlation between students’ learning motivation <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension (to= 2. 5); (2) there is a positive correlation between vocabulary mastery <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension(to= 2. 14); and (3) there is a positive correlation between students’ learning motivation, vocabulary mastery simultaneously, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension(Fo= 3. 54).
