2500|$|Disc brakes are {{increasingly}} used on {{very large and}} heavy road vehicles, where previously large drum brakes were nearly universal. One {{reason is that the}} disc's lack of self-assist makes brake force much more predictable, so peak brake force can be raised without more risk of braking-induced steering or jackknife on articulated vehicles. Another is disc brakes fade less when hot, and in a heavy vehicle air and rolling drag and engine braking are small parts of total braking force, so brakes are used harder than on lighter vehicles, and drum brake fade can occur in a single stop. For these reasons, a heavy truck with disc brakes can stop in about 120% the distance of a passenger car, but with drums stopping takes about 150% the distance. In Europe, stopping distance regulations essentially require disc brakes for heavy vehicles. In the U.S., drums are <b>allowed</b> <b>and</b> <b>are</b> typically preferred for their lower purchase price, despite higher total lifetime cost and more frequent service intervals.|$|E
2500|$|Typical cache [...] "treasures", {{also known}} in the geocaching world as swag, are not high in {{monetary}} value but may hold personal value to the finder. Aside from the logbook, common cache contents are unusual coins or currency, small toys, ornamental buttons, CDs, or books. Although not required, many geocachers decide to leave behind signature items, such as personal Geocoins, pins, or craft items, to mark their presence at the cache location. Disposable cameras are popular as they allow for anyone who found the cache {{to take a picture}} which can be developed and uploaded to a Geocaching web site listed below. Also common are objects that are moved from cache to cache called [...] "hitchhikers", such as Travel Bugs or Geocoins, whose travels may be logged and followed online. Cachers who initially place a Travel Bug or Geocoins often assign specific goals for their trackable items. Examples of goals are to be placed in a certain cache a long distance from home, or to travel to a certain country, or to travel faster and farther than other hitchhikers in a race. Less common trends are site-specific information pages about the historic significance of the site, types of trees, birds in the area or other such information. Higher-value items are occasionally included in geocaches as a reward for the First to Find (called [...] "FTF"), or in locations which are harder to reach. Dangerous or illegal items, weapons, food and drugs are not <b>allowed</b> <b>and</b> <b>are</b> specifically against the rules of most geocache listing sites.|$|E

Traditionally, Christmas Eve {{would be the}} climax of the Nativity Fast, and thus only an odd number of lenten dishes are presented on that evening. The table is usually not cleared after the dinner and until the next morning, to leave some food for the holy spirits - a custom which probably comes from pagan pre-Christian times. On that day, a Bulgarian budnik is set alight. On Christmas, however, meat dishes are already <b>allowed</b> <b>and</b> <b>are</b> typically served.|$|E

40|$|Summary. We present {{algorithms}} for {{the efficient}} insertion and removal of con-straints in Delaunay Triangulations. Constraints {{are considered to}} be points or any kind of polygonal lines.

As a result, a fully Dynamic Constrained Delaunay Triangulation is achieved, able to efficiently maintain a consistent triangulated representation of dynamic polygo-nal domains.
