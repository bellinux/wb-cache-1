A Hydrazine <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Propulsion</b> System upper <b>stage</b> was flown aboard the Minotaur to demonstrate its ability to deploy payloads to multiple orbits, however only mass simulators were deployed after the HAPS burn.|$|R
50|$|Minotaur I rockets {{consist of}} the M55A1 first stage and SR19 {{second stage of}} a {{decommissioned}} Minuteman missile. The Orion 50XL and Orion 38, from the Pegasus rocket, are used as third and fourth stages. A HAPS (Hydrazine <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Propulsion</b> System) upper <b>stage</b> can also be flown if greater precision is needed, or the rocket {{needs to be able}} to manoeuvre to deploy multiple payloads.It can place up to 580 kg of payload into a 185 km low Earth orbit at 28.5 degrees of inclination.|$|R

The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>propulsion</b> subsystem and the impetus for the current hydrogen/oxygen technology program is examined.

The approach used is to select a vehicle and a mission and then select a scavenging system for detailed weight analysis. The Shuttle 2 vehicle on a Space Station rendezvous mission was chosen for study. The propellant scavenging system scavenges liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen from the launch propulsion tankage during orbital maneuvers and stores them in well insulated liquid accumulators {{for use in a}} cryogenic <b>auxiliary</b> <b>propulsion</b> system. The fraction of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>propulsion</b> propellant which may be scavenged for propulsive purposes is estimated to be 45. 1 percent.
