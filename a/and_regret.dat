5|$|Critics {{classify}} Little Gidding as a poem of {{fire with}} an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire. The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter, with attention paid to the arrival of summer. The images of snow, which provoke desires for a spiritual life, transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire, earth, air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four. Following this is a discussion on death and destruction, things unaccomplished, <b>and</b> <b>regret</b> for past events.|$|E
5|$|Her {{relationship}} with the Jesuits was complex. Members of this order educated her, served as her confessors, and supervised the religious education of her eldest son. The Jesuits were powerful and influential {{in the early years}} of Maria Theresa's reign. However, the queen's ministers convinced her that the order posed a danger to her monarchical authority. Not without much hesitation <b>and</b> <b>regret,</b> she issued a decree which removed them from all the institutions of the monarchy, and carried it out thoroughly. She forbade the publication of Pope Clement XIII's bull which was in favour of the Jesuits and promptly confiscated their property when Pope Clement XIV suppressed the order.|$|E

5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss <b>and</b> <b>regret</b> {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights when the wind was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that you left... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch me like this, and you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E

25|$|In the Codex Chimalpopoca, {{it is said}} Quetzalcoatl was coerced by Tezcatlipoca into {{becoming}} {{drunk on}} pulque, cavorting with his sister, Quetzalpetlatl, a celibate priestess, and neglecting their religious duties.

The next morning, Quetzalcoatl, feeling shame <b>and</b> <b>regret,</b> had his servants build him a stone chest, adorn him in turquoise, and then, laying in the chest, set himself on fire.

25|$|After the war, Bleichrodt {{was held}} by the Allies on war crimes charges {{pertaining}} to {{the sinking of the}} City of Benares. Bleichrodt was accused of sinking the ship with the full knowledge that it had been transporting evacuees. He reaffirmed the German position {{that there was no way}} that he or the crew of the submarine could have known who was on board. It was upheld and he was acquitted.

25|$|Critics {{were mixed}} in their {{opinions}} on the gameplay, some considering it too complex and some too simple. Carden criticized the difficulty in reaching the different endings without following a guide, and how it sometimes is unclear what the effects of some player choices will be; Fenner did however find it fun and compelling to use knowledge from one playthrough {{to go back and}} make different choices while aiming for another ending. Rogan disliked how the player choice system was simpler than the one in Steins;Gate, calling it a step back for the series, and Helm thought that the player choices lacked the tension <b>and</b> <b>regret</b> of the original game's. Fenner appreciated how the RINE system improved upon the text messages from the previous game, allowing the player to see what exact message they would send prior to sending it while simultaneously automatically saving the game. Carden, Rogan and Helm appreciated the Tips system, considering it a helpful way to make sure that players understand concepts and terms discussed in the game.|$|E
