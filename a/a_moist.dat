5|$|Since 1977, {{the rich}} {{vertebrate}} fauna found at Baden-Württemberg reflect <b>a</b> <b>moist</b> {{region of the}} Middle Triassic in Germany. Along with Batrachotomus, palaeontologists recovered remains of fishes, amphibians, such as Gerrothorax and Mastodonsaurus, and even animals like nothosaurs and the distinct marine reptile Tanystropheus. Flora of the locality consisted of horsetails, ferns, cycads and conifers, suggesting that there was rich vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting is {{a highly}} prized table fish often rated equal to the King George whiting, making it a common target for both {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries. The flesh is white, tender and has <b>a</b> <b>moist,</b> low oil content composition, making it easily digestible. Investigations into the aquaculture of the species began in the 1980s, and {{has led to the}} development of farmed sand whiting.|$|E

5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as primary ingredients. Various spices are typically used, and {{it tends to}} be <b>a</b> <b>moist</b> cake. Applesauce cake prepared with chunky-style apple sauce may be less moist. Several additional ingredients may also be used in its preparation, and it is sometimes prepared and served as a coffee cake. The cake dates back to early colonial times in the United States. National Applesauce Cake Day occurs annually on June 6 in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Strepsirrhines {{have a long}} snout {{that ends}} in <b>a</b> <b>moist</b> and touch-sensitive rhinarium, {{similar to that of}} dogs and many other mammals. The rhinarium is {{surrounded}} by vibrissae that are also sensitive to touch. Convoluted maxilloturbinals on the inside of their nose filter, warm, and moisten the incoming air, while olfactory receptors of the main olfactory system lining the ethmoturbinals detect airborne smells. The olfactory bulbs of lemurs are comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are known}} to form even when normal conditions are not met. For example, cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude (e.g., at the 500hPa level, or 5.9km) can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures, as a certain lapse rate is required to force the atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection. In <b>a</b> <b>moist</b> atmosphere, this lapse rate is 6.5°C/km, while in an atmosphere with less than 100% relative humidity, the required lapse rate is 9.8°C/km.|$|E

50|$|The flora {{depends on}} the {{availability}} of water. The northern section {{to the west of the}} Okavango Delta and into Namibia has <b>a</b> <b>moister</b> climate and the Baikiaea plurijuga woodland with bush savanna is dominant. In the hardveld areas to the south, the climate becomes more arid and the plants are dominated by xerophytic acacia.|$|R
5|$|A storm system {{moved to}} the {{northern}} and central Great Plains region during the day, as strong winds helped push <b>a</b> <b>moist</b> air mass northward ahead of the system. Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon ahead of a cold front from southeast South Dakota into central Kansas. Strong winds along with instability in the atmosphere created favorable conditions for supercell development {{with the potential to}} produce strong tornadoes. At approximately 6:35 pm CDT (2335 UTC) a tornado hit the Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Little Sioux, Iowa, killing four Boy Scouts after a chimney collapsed on them and injuring 48others. The camp received a tornado warning 12minutes before it struck. There were 93campers and 25staff members at the camp. The campers were between 13and 18 years old and were attending a leadership training camp. The tornado was rated EF3on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} hours of February10, 2009, a strong, {{middle and upper}} storm system moved across the Four Corners region into the central and southern Great Plains. <b>A</b> <b>moist,</b> low-level air mass streamed northward across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased throughout {{the afternoon}} across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Cooling aloft, {{in conjunction with the}} approaching storm system, led to atmospheric instability, resulting in thunderstorms. A very strong wind field increased with height through the lower troposphere, resulting in a wind shear favorable for rotation in the thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{tropical}} depression tracked to the northwest, and was forecast to peak as a 50mph (80km/h) tropical storm while continuing on a northwest motion. Located within {{an area of}} weak wind shear, deep convection increased near the center, and banding features became more pronounced. Anticyclonic flow aloft and <b>a</b> <b>moist</b> troposphere allowed the depression to intensity into Tropical Storm Sergio on November 14. Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, Sergio turned to the southeast, believed {{to be due to}} the flow associated with a mid- to upper-level trough to its northeast. It steadily intensified, and Sergio attained hurricane status on November 15 while located about 420miles (675km) southwest of Acapulco. With a small, distinct eye located {{in the center of the}} deep convection, Sergio rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) about 6hours after becoming a hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Later that day, a {{low-level}} low-pressure area developed west of Wichita Falls {{at the intersection}} of a dry line extended southward across Central Texas and the stationary front extended eastward across the Red River valley. With the low-pressure system now in place, the air mass over the Red River valley became increasingly unstable, featuring surface temperatures near 90°F (32°C) and high dew points caused by the northerly surge of moisture induced by the subtropical jet. The combination of high temperatures and <b>a</b> <b>moist</b> atmosphere resulted in a favorable environment for thunderstorm development. However, despite the heat, temperatures alone were insufficient in breaking the capping inversionan area of warmer air aloft that prevents the relativity cooler air near the surface from rising. Instead, the approaching shortwave trough provided the impetus necessary to force convection to occur, allowing for the formation of showers and thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} is a fire hazard, {{especially if}} the material is finely divided. In <b>a</b> <b>moist</b> environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide sand {{is probably the most}} effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a heat sink, and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.|$|E
5|$|Plants grow best in <b>a</b> <b>moist</b> but well-drained, acidic soil, {{with added}} peat being helpful. They may be grown in coastal gardens in a {{sheltered}} position, and generally require {{some degree of}} shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard pruning after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult to transplant, though it can be readily grown as a pot plant. Along {{with other members of}} the genus, Epacris impressa initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>moist</b> winds {{from the}} Pacific (also called “Chinooks”) {{are forced to}} rise over the mountains, the {{moisture}} in the air is condensed and falls out as precipitation, while the air cools at the moist adiabatic rate of 5°C/1000m (3.5°F/1000ft). The dried air then descends on the leeward side of the mountains, warming at the dry adiabatic rate of 10°C/1000m (5.5°F/1000ft).|$|R

5|$|The North {{is known}} for its often crumbly cheeses, of which Cheshire cheese is the {{earliest}} example. Unlike Southern cheeses like Cheddar, Northern cheeses typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>moist,</b> sharp-tasting cheese. Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes, which are themselves well represented in Northern England. Parkin, an oatmeal cake with black treacle and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} Welsh cheese is Caerphilly, named in 1831 but made long before that. Originally {{a method for}} storing excess milk until it could be brought to market, it was <b>a</b> <b>moist</b> cheese that would not last very long. Production of the cheese was halted due to milk {{rationing}} after World War II, although it was still made in England. There, the cheese was produced very quickly and sold early in its maturation process, creating a dryer cheese. In the 1970s, production of Caerphilly returned to Wales and over the following few decades {{a variety of new}} cheeses have also been produced in Wales.|$|E
5|$|With {{very warm}} sea surface temperatures, high ocean heat content, low wind shear, and <b>a</b> <b>moist</b> air mass, Omar quickly {{reached its peak}} {{intensity}} early on October16 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130mph (215km/h). During the intensification phase, the forward motion of the hurricane increased to 20mph (32km/h). Once in the Atlantic Ocean, Omar began to rapidly weaken, with winds decreasing by 50mph (85km/h) in 12 hours. Visible satellite images depicted an exposed low-level circulation with convection displaced to the east due {{to a combination of}} very high wind shear and dry air. By October17, most of the deep convection associated with the system dissipated; however, a brief decrease in wind shear allowed Omar to re-strengthen to its secondary peak, with winds of 85mph (140km/h). During this phase, convection redeveloped around the center and an eye reformed. Later that day, the trough that caused the rapid northeastern motion bypassed Omar, leading to decreasing movement.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with <b>a</b> <b>moist</b> upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E
