30|$|Despite this {{transnational}} way of life, {{qualitative studies}} have also demonstrated that Senegalese migrants’ cross-border activities are constrained by their lack of secure legal status (Kaag, 2008; Kane, 2011). Riccio (2001, 2008) highlights the important role that acquisition of the permesso di soggiorno plays for Senegalese migrants in Italy: without it, they {{are not able to}} practice the circular transnational livelihoods that purportedly mark the Senegalese migration experience. The legal constraint is all the more important given the often precarious <b>administrative</b> <b>situations</b> in which Senegalese migrants in Europe find themselves (Vickstrom, 2014). Senegalese have long been suspected of participating in “clandestine” or irregular migration strategies in Europe. Senegalese migrants were often seen as “false tourists” in France during the late 1960 s (Diop, 1993; Spire, 2005) and were publicly visible in the sans papiers movement in the 1990 s (Timera, 1997). In Italy and Spain, they remain among the nationalities with the highest rates of irregularity (UNODC, 2013). Research has also demonstrated that variation in these three countries’ immigration policies has created different configurations of irregularity among Senegalese migrants (Vickstrom, 2014).|$|R

40|$|Interlocal {{cooperation}} {{in the delivery of}} services {{is the subject of this}} thesis project. The study surveys the types of cooperation communities can engage in. It also examines how three communities cooperate in the provision of police and public works services. Interlocal cooperation can be defined as collaborative efforts undertaken by two or more communities. In this study, cooperation is looked at in terms of the provision of services. Such cooperation can be formal or informal, single function or multi-function, and supplementary or complete. In any case, it is seen as a means for improving the delivery of services. Local services are financed through property taxes. People, these days, are demanding cuts in their property taxes. At the same time, they continue to demand services. The pressure is on administrators to find ways to provide services more efficiently and effectively. Administrative and organizational constraints hamper efforts to cooperate formally. The administrators of service systems of ten have the power to make verbal agreements among themselves. Such agreements are more amenable to the variety of administrative and organizational conditions, which exist in a group of communities. As a result, it was not shocking to find that cooperative efforts undertaken by the three communities examined are primarily informal. Informal cooperation has its place and communities should cooperate with one another in the delivery of services in whatever formal or informal manner their organizational and <b>administrative</b> <b>situations</b> necessitate...|$|R

Within each approach, considering the reflection as the process and mechanism, the authors point to its globality, solidity, ontology. The author emphasizes that management activity is a specific kind of professional activity that imposes certain requirements for manager's personality and his professional skills. It is indicated that reflexivity is important in the professional activity of a manager of educational institutions as it promotes and increases the area of internal and external activity, demonstrates the methods of control, manager's assessment and awareness of his activities. Also, the paper presents the results of the empirical research that studied the reflexivity level of future department managers of the centers of high education. The solid analysis of the research results indicates the predominance of the middle level of reflectivity, the dominance of the intrapsychological type, this confirms the fact that future managers mostly focus on external reflects, such as behavior and activity. The majority of respondents possessed their ability mostly to retrospective and situational type of reflectivity. The author emphasizes that it is important for future specialists who will manage educational institutions to develop the reflectivity.

The five most representative strategical periods for the production units in each location were identified and it was verified that the local natural and social-economical conditions did represent relevant enabling factors for the huge contrasts in development between both locations.

The states that were allied against France (Prussia, Austria and Russia), reconquered the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank in 1814. After a two-year transitional period, Obereisenbach passed to the Kingdom of Bavaria in a departure from what was generally considered the new border arrangements, with the Glan downstream {{from the mouth of the}} Steinalb generally being held to be the border between Bavaria and Prussia (or until 1834 the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Principality of Lichtenberg). This exceptional arrangement, which also affected Sankt Julian and Eschenau, was part of an exchange against a village in the Oster valley. Sankt Julian at ﬁrst became the seat of a Bürgermeisterei (“mayoralty”) together with Eschenau and Obereisenbach. The merged municipality was called Sankt Julian-Obereisenbach. The mayoralty was united with the one in Ulmet in 1861, but became separate again in 1887. Just after the Second World War, there was an armed confrontation with some French occupational troops, who had been mistaken by the populace for “plundering Russians” who had been forced labourers, now freed, in the only just ended time of the Third Reich. The shooting killed one inhabitant from Obereisenbach. In 1958, a watermain was built in the village. In the course of administrative restructuring in 1968, the Bürgermeisterei of Sankt Julian was dissolved, and in 1972, within the Verbandsgemeinde of Lauterecken, Sankt Julian became the hub of the like-named Ortsgemeinde with the constituent communities (Ortsteile) of Eschenau, Gumbsweiler, Obereisenbach and Sankt Julian.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis article {{deals with}} health and {{healthcare}} access of migrant populations, placing the debate around {{the point of}} view of migrants (individuals and family) as well as of professionals working with them. The article questions on the one hand the social determinants of health and the determinants of healthcare access by taking into consideration the set of constraints, incoherencies and resources available for health and healthcare. On the other hand, it shows how healthcare professionals implement new forms of action destined to migrants. In a changing local and national institutional context the issue raised is how to set up actions towards migrants in the domain of health and healthcare. Further, it considers how to ensure that existing structures and organizations are adapted to the situation of a population that is, more than others, likely to remain at the margins of the healthcare system?The article studies the administrative and juridical healthcare access for migrants in France. Two main assessments can be put forward: first of all, the migrants’ pathways to healthcare are characterized by long delays before accessing primary care; second, healthcare pathways appear as “coordinated” (between emergency healthcare and common access) only when residential and <b>administrative</b> <b>situations</b> are solved and stable. Our global observations are based on fieldwork in France; they show that there are very heterogeneous ways to access healthcare for newly arrived migrants, and generally that they stay longer than other precarious populations in the circuit of emergency humanitarian health. We also notice that the difficulties in accessing healthcare for migrants are only a part of the difficulties experienced in migratory experience. We attempt to describe types of daily barriers (<b>administrative</b> <b>situations,</b> difficulties in accessing rights, negative representations of migrants within society and/or social and sanitary services, language) and to underline the necessity of taking into account the socio-spatial dimensions of healthcare access in everyday life. The article includes a methodological section explaining the fieldwork (interviews with patients and professionals) and describing the content of the interview grid (see figure 1.) The patients’ points of view are described through the use of “synthetic biographies”. These biographies underline the everyday spatial constraint obliging individuals to develop tactics and strategies to move to the city (and between cities) in order to access different services. The professionals’ points of view are analyzed in regard to their professional practices, and the way they use some “tinkering” to favor new forms of actions targeting migrants. We can observe in the fieldwork the multiplication of “go towards” practices, usually used in the medico-social field (and generally to set up actions meant to “go towards” individuals identified as precarious –in the domain of addictions or HIV-AIDS). These actions include a spatial register: actions tend to “go towards” people living in the street or in squats. These professional practices lead to a type of medicine that is institutionally framed but concern very specific professional acts. We thus analyze the way this tinkering becomes possible and how it appears in the interviews we have conducted with general practitioners. The discussion and conclusion aim at considering the different spatial inscriptions of these forms of actions in public health. We have also studied the situation of migrants in precarious situations: on the one hand they endure the deleterious effects of their living conditions, but they can also develop very original spatial knowledge and multi-situated sociability that can be analyzed as ““mobility know-how”. Cet article aborde les enjeux de santé relatifs aux populations migrantes primo-arrivantes en les interrogeant du point de vue de l’expérience des individus et des professionnels qui travaillent à leur contact. D’un côté, il interroge les déterminants sociaux de la santé et de l’accès aux soins tels qu’ils se présentant pour les migrants, en prenant en compte l’ensemble des contraintes, des ruptures, mais aussi des ressources mobilisables pour la santé et les soins.
