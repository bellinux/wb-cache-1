2500|$|But Nemec {{was still}} left [...] "with certain doubts and questions", {{such as how}} our {{understanding}} of Vijnanabhiksu's views might change if more of his works were <b>available</b> <b>in</b> <b>translation,</b> and whether premodern Indian philosophers might have been [...] "more aware of their mutual differences than this volume allows". Despite such doubts, Nemec suggested that the volume would be [...] "of value to medievalists, scholars of Vedānta, Sāṃkhya, and Yoga, and of Indian philosophy more generally, to scholars concerned with colonialism, and even those concerned with communal relations in contemporary South Asia." ...|$|E
2500|$|In modern times, {{the book}} has often been viewed as a typical inquisitorial manual, a {{perception}} that many historians have refuted. According to historian Jenny Gibbons: [...] 'in the 1970s, when feminist and Neo-Pagan authors {{turned their attention to}} the witch trials, the Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of Witches) was the only manual readily <b>available</b> <b>in</b> <b>translation.</b> Authors naively assumed that the book painted an accurate picture of how the Inquisition tried witches. Heinrich Kramer, the text's demented author, was held up as a typical inquisitor. His rather stunning sexual preoccupations were presented as the Church's [...] "official" [...] position on witchcraft. Actually the Inquisition immediately rejected the legal procedures Kramer recommended and censured the inquisitor himself just a few years after the Malleus was published. Secular courts, not inquisitorial ones, resorted to the Malleus.|$|E
2500|$|In Journal of Asian Studies, Tulasi Srinivas {{wrote that}} she [...] "found this book very valuable, {{challenging}} of my assumptions", calling the book [...] "erudite and thought provoking", and its argument [...] "powerful, well researched and delivered, and... remarkably persuasive". She wondered whether [...] "penetrability" [...] between various philosophical schools might be overstated, and how views of Vijnanabhiksu might change if {{more of his}} works were <b>available</b> <b>in</b> <b>translation.</b> She regarded the book as having [...] "political ramifications that suggest that the origins of Hinduism are not only the Vedas, as Hindu nationalists claim... nor a product of British colonial rule... as understood by some scholars." [...] She also viewed the book as significant for its [...] "broader political and critical claim that Bhedabheda Vedanta is valuable and on par with the better known schools of Indian philosophy".|$|E

50|$|The {{velocity}} of {{transmission of the}} Renaissance throughout Europe can also be ascribed to {{the invention of the}} printing press. Its power to disseminate knowledge enhanced scientific research, spread political ideas and generally impacted the course of the Renaissance in northern Europe. As in Italy, the printing press increased the availability of books written in both vernacular languages and the publication of new and ancient classical texts in Greek and Latin. Furthermore, the Bible became widely <b>available</b> <b>in</b> <b>translation,</b> a factor often attributed to the spread of the Protestant Reformation.|$|E
