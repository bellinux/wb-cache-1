5|$|After 1898, {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in admitting new members. Four were {{admitted}} between 1906 and 1908, followed {{by only one}} in the 1915, three in 1924, and two in 1935. In 1940 the average member age was 69.|$|E
5|$|By 16:00, {{with the}} Franco-Bavarian troops besieged in Blenheim and Oberglau, the Allied centre of 81 squadrons (nine squadrons had been {{transferred}} from Cutts' column), supported by 18 battalions was firmly planted amidst the French line of 64 squadrons and nine battalions of raw recruits. There was now <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in the battle: Marlborough wanted to concert the attack upon the whole front, and Eugene, after his second repulse, {{needed time to}} reorganize.|$|E
5|$|DNA damage {{checkpoint}} is {{a signal}} transduction pathway that blocks cell cycle progression in G1, G2 and metaphase and slows down {{the rate of}} S phase progression when DNA is damaged. It leads to <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in cell cycle allowing the cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide.|$|E
6000|$|The President gave my hand an unsympathetic wag {{and dropped}} it. He {{did not say}} a word but just stood.

5|$|On 24 November Allenby {{ordered the}} relief of the three {{divisions}} of the EEF's XXI Corps and Desert Mounted Corps. In order to move such large formations <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> was unavoidable and so the attack was discontinued, but von Falkenhayn and his Ottoman Army took notice of the temporary cessation of hostilities.|$|E
5|$|The Adagio is in sonata {{form and}} {{presents}} a single theme. While the exposition modulates to a re-statement {{of the theme}} in F major, the recapitulation modulates to D major. The movement ends in that key, pianissimo, with a segue (an explicit direction given by Haydn to avoid too long <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> between the movements) to the D-major minuet.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} modification is {{expansion of the}} original material. The expansions frequently repeat preceding measures or consist of rests or left-hand figurations without the melody, providing <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in the motion. This is especially noticeable in the Adagio, minuet and finale of the C minor Sonata, the middle section of the Andantino in the A major Sonata, and the first movement of the B-flat Sonata.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} phase of the attack by {{infantry}} in the 75th Division (XXI Corps) were to capture the line Tel el Turmus–Qastina–Yazur and then seize Mesmiye. On their left infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division were to secure the line Yazur–Beshshit and then seize Qatra. After <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> for the artillery to be brought forward, the second phase attacks on the final objectives of Junction Station for the 75th and al-Mansura for the 52nd (Lowland) Divisions were to be made. The first phase was due to start at 08:00 hours on 13 November preceded by one hour's bombardment.|$|E
5|$|In mid-February, Wellington's army {{broke out}} of its small area of conquered {{territory}} near Bayonne. Moving east, the Allies drove the French back from several river lines. After <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in the campaign, the western-most Allied corps surrounded and isolated Bayonne. Resuming their eastward drive, the remaining two Allied corps pushed Soult's army back to Orthez where the French marshal offered battle. In subsequent operations, Soult decided to abandon the large western port of Bordeaux and fall back east toward Toulouse. The next action was the Battle of Toulouse.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Mughar Ridge {{was fought}} on 13 November by the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the 75th Division in the centre, with the Australian Mounted Division on their right flank and the Anzac Mounted Division and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions on the infantry's left flank. The battle {{was divided into}} two stages with <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> for {{artillery}} to be brought forward. Following the Yeomanry's successful charge up onto El Mughar ridge, two crucial fortified villages were captured by elements of the 52nd (Lowland) Division. This victory resulted in the subsequent occupation of Junction Station, a vital railway station on the Turk's lines of communication between Jaffa and Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The British {{policy as}} stated in the {{declaration}} was to face numerous challenges to its implementation in the following years. The first of these was the indirect peace negotiations which took place between Britain and the Ottomans in December 1917 and January 1918 during <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in the hostilities for the rainy season; although these peace talks were unsuccessful, archival records suggest that key members of the War Cabinet may have been willing to permit leaving Palestine under nominal Turkish sovereignty as part of an overall deal.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{included a}} scripting team, who inserted pre-programmed scripts into the dialogue, a process {{referred to as}} scripting: these scripts {{could be used to}} change characters' animations, stop the text {{in the middle of a}} sentence, automatically proceed to the next text box, and pan the camera. The staff had to envision how scenes would look, and used these scripts to create a flow of character animations and add dramatic tension, such as adding <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> after a character sighs to increase the dramatic effect.|$|E
5000|$|A {{reviewer}} in The Sydney Morning Herald, while praising some {{values in}} the novel, was rather disappointed, noting: [...] "'...there is an underlying sentimentality, <b>a</b> <b>pausing</b> on non-significant details of domesticity, a shapelessness of structure, an animated discursiveness like the monologue of a long-winded telephone-caller." ...|$|R

60|$|Even as {{he spoke}} a pistol-shot resounded through the night. It cut through the deathly silence of the forest like a spiteful curse, and was {{answered}} by another--then, after <b>a</b> short <b>pause,</b> <b>a</b> swift-tearing volley followed.|$|R
5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he {{knew he was going to}} get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after <b>a</b> <b>pause.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{refusal of}} the {{military}} leaders of the Swabian League to withdraw troops from the northern front {{to send them to}} the Grisons as Maximilian had demanded made the king return to Lake Constance. The differences between the Swabians, who preferred to strike in the north, and the king, who still hoped to convince them to help him win the struggle in the Val Müstair, led to <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in the hostilities. Troops were assembled at Constance, but an attack did not occur. Until July, nothing of significance happened along the whole front.|$|E
5|$|While {{conventional}} English sonnet form {{described by}} Gascoigne {{is seen in}} Sonnet 86, the Petrarchan sonnet form, which requires <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> between the first eight lines and the last six lines is also evident. At the end of line eight Shakespeare uses a period to bring the sonnet to a stop, changing the sonnet's direction by moving away from rhetorical questions to a more decisive tone within the sestet, which seems to answer the distress of the octave.|$|E

5|$|After Henry's death {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in the {{conflict}} with France, during which {{many of the new}} fortifications were alllowed to deteriorate. There was little money available for repairs and the garrisons were reduced in size. East Cowes was abandoned around 1547 and fell into ruin, while the bulwarks along the Downs were defaced and their guns removed; they were formally removed from service in 1550. In 1552 the Essex fortifications were decommissioned, and several were subsequently pulled down. The expense of maintaining the fortifications in Hull led the Crown to agree a deal with the town authorities to take over management of them. Milton and Higham were demolished between 1557 and 1558. Mersea Fort was temporarily decommissioned, before being brought back into active service.|$|E
5|$|Cosell:... but (the game)'s {{suddenly}} {{been placed}} in total perspective for us; I'll finish this, they're in the hurry-up offense.Gifford: Third down, four. (Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, {{you have got to}} say what we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, we have to say it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after <b>a</b> <b>pause)</b> Indeed, it is.|$|E
5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After <b>a</b> <b>pause,</b> the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E

50|$|In the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, {{and many}} Commonwealth nations, it {{is a double}} ring. For most countries, it {{consists}} of a 0.4-second pulse, <b>a</b> 0.2-second <b>pause,</b> <b>a</b> 0.4-second pulse, and <b>a</b> 2-second <b>pause.</b> In all cases except Australia, the pulse is made by mixing a 400 Hz and 450 Hz sine wave; Australia uses up to three different combinations of frequencies. The example shown is created by mixing 400, 425, and 450 Hz sine waves.|$|R
