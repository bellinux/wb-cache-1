5|$|In his (1991) novel Roman Blood, Steven Saylor renders a fictionalized, yet informed, {{rendition}} {{of how the}} Roman punishment poena cullei might occur. The reference to the punishment is in connection with Cicero's (historically correct, and successful) endeavours to <b>acquit</b> Sextus Roscius of the charge of having murdered his own father.|$|E
5|$|Seven Republicans—Senators Grimes, Ross, Trumbull, William Pitt Fessenden, Joseph S. Fowler, John B. Henderson, and Peter G. Van Winkle—voted to <b>acquit</b> the President. With Stevens bitterly {{disappointed}} at the result, the Senate then adjourned for the Republican National Convention; Grant {{was nominated}} for president.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday 18 June {{the court}} opened at 9am; 12 {{defendants}} {{were charged with}} breaking into the house of Rebecca Waddelow in Littleport and stealing personal property and money. After hearing evidence, the judges held a discussion. Mr Justice Abbott informed the jury that a mistake {{had been made in}} the indictment, directing the jury to <b>acquit.</b> All 12 defendants were pronounced not guilty.|$|E
60|$|Sixth. We {{are said}} to be {{justified}} by his blood. 'Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him' (Rom 5:9). Justified, that is, acquitted--1. <b>Acquitted</b> before God (Eph 5:26,27). 2. <b>Acquitted</b> before angels (Matt 28:5-8). 3. <b>Acquitted</b> by the law (Rom 3:21-23). 4. <b>Acquitted</b> in the court of conscience (Heb 9:14).|$|R

5|$|In post-trial analyses, {{blame for}} the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have been picked almost {{exclusively}} from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a noblesse oblige toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those {{in the eastern part}} of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential juror who knew Milam or Bryant, for the fear that such a juror would vote to <b>acquit.</b> Afterward, Whitaker noted that this was a mistake, as anyone who had personally known the defendants usually disliked them. One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, acquiesced and voted with the rest of the jury to <b>acquit.</b> In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man. But two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense's case. They said that the prosecution had not proved that Till had died, nor that it was his body that was removed from the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, {{even though he had}} not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to <b>acquit,</b> meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial began}} in January 2005; the judge, Mr Justice Mackay, warned {{that it could}} go on for a year. On 14 July, the judge {{instructed}} the jury to <b>acquit</b> all defendants on charges of manslaughter. A few days later, Balfour Beatty changed its plea to guilty on the health and safety charges and, on 6 September, Network Rail was found guilty of breaching health and safety law. Network Rail were fined £3.5 million while Balfour Beatty were fined £10 million. All of the manslaughter charges against the executives were dismissed by the judge.|$|E

50|$|The fifth person {{arrested for}} same crime, was tried in {{absentia}} for the Piazza Fontana but was later <b>acquitted</b> in appeal for {{complete lack of}} evidence on March 12, 2004. On May 3, 2005 the supreme Court of Cassation definitively <b>acquitted</b> Zorzi from the accusation. In 2014 the supreme Court of Cassation <b>acquitted</b> Zorzi from the accusation.|$|R

5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} Docherty's body indicated she {{had probably been}} suffocated, but {{it could not be}} proven. Although the police suspected the men of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven—a Scottish legal verdict to <b>acquit</b> an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards, his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, as of 2017, it remains.|$|E
5|$|Sentenced to 25 {{years of}} hard labor, Hartmann refused to work. He was {{eventually}} put into solitary confinement, which enraged his fellow prisoners. They began a revolt, overpowered the guards, and freed him. Hartmann made a complaint to the Kommandants office, asking for a representative from Moscow and an international inspection, {{as well as a}} tribunal, to <b>acquit</b> him of his unlawful conviction. This was refused, and he was transferred to a camp in Novocherkassk, where he spent five more months in solitary confinement. Eventually, Hartmann was granted a tribunal, but it upheld his original sentence. He was subsequently sent to another camp, this time at Diaterka in the Ural Mountains.|$|E
5|$|While ashore {{during the}} peace Macnamara {{contrived}} to become {{embroiled in a}} duel. While walking his Newfoundland dog in Hyde Park on 6 April 1803 he had an altercation with Colonel Robert Montgomery, when their dogs began fighting. Harsh words were exchanged, and the two parties fought a duel that evening at Chalk Farm. Both men were wounded, the colonel mortally. Macnamara was arrested {{on a charge of}} manslaughter and put on trial at the Old Bailey on 22 April. Macnamara defended himself from the charge on the grounds that he had received an affront and that it was necessary for him to challenge it in order to maintain his position as a naval officer. He summoned many of his naval friends, among whom Viscounts Hood and Nelson, Lord Hotham, Sir Hyde Parker, Sir Thomas Troubridge, Captains Martin, Towry, Lydiard, Moore and Waller; and General Churchill and Lord Minto, to testify in his defence. They supported his assertion that he was the 'reverse of quarrelsome' and the jury took ten minutes to <b>acquit</b> him.|$|E
50|$|On January 13, 2014, Manuel Ramos was <b>acquitted</b> of {{second-degree murder}} and {{involuntary}} manslaughter in the 2011 death of Thomas. Jay Cicinelli was <b>acquitted</b> of involuntary manslaughter and {{excessive use of}} force.|$|R
50|$|In 1628 Lord Dunboyne {{was tried}} by his peers for {{manslaughter}} but <b>acquitted.</b> In 1743 Nicholas Netterville, 5th Viscount Netterville was <b>acquitted</b> of murder by his peers, as was Lord Lorton in 1798.|$|R

5|$|The trial, Illinois vs. August Spies et al., {{began on}} June 21, 1886, {{and went on}} until August 11. The trial was {{conducted}} {{in an atmosphere of}} extreme prejudice by both public and media toward the defendants. It was presided over by Judge Joseph Gary. Judge Gary displayed open hostility to the defendants, consistently ruled for the prosecution, and failed to maintain decorum. A motion to try the defendants separately was denied. The defense counsel included Sigmund Zeisler, William Perkins Black, William Foster, and Moses Salomon. Selection of the jury was extraordinarily difficult, lasting three weeks, and nearly one thousand people called. All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed. In the end a jury of 12 was seated, most of whom confessed prejudice towards the defendants. Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would <b>acquit</b> if the evidence supported it, refusing to dismiss for prejudice. Eventually the peremptory challenges of the defense were exhausted. Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed, a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random. The bailiff proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position and attitudes toward the defendants. The prosecution, led by Julius Grinnell, argued that since the defendants had not actively discouraged the person who had thrown the bomb, they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators. The jury heard the testimony of 118 people, including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and the defendants Fielden, Schwab, Spies and Parsons. Albert Parsons' brother claimed there was evidence linking the Pinkertons to the bomb. This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers.|$|E

5000|$|One {{example of}} an ex post facto {{criminal}} law in the UK is the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This law allows people <b>acquitted</b> for murder to be retried if there is “new, compelling, reliable and substantial evidence” that the <b>acquitted</b> person really was guilty. This Justice Act applies retroactively {{and can be used}} to re-prosecute people who were <b>acquitted</b> before the Criminal Justice Act went into effect in 2005, or even before the Criminal Justice Act was passed in 2003. As a result, the defendants who were <b>acquitted</b> in the murder of Stephen Lawrence were allowed to be retried, even though this murder occurred in 1993 and the defendants had been <b>acquitted</b> in 1996. Many people have criticized the Criminal Justice Act because of its essential abolition of prohibition against both ex post facto and double jeopardy laws ...|$|R

Following a state trial that ended with the jury <b>acquitting</b> the three police officers charged, a federal investigation led to plea agreements with three police officers and the indictment of five police officers, including the three who were <b>acquitted</b> in state court. Before trial, one of these five pleaded guilty. The federal jury <b>acquitted</b> one of the remaining police officers and the three police officers who were <b>acquitted</b> in state court were convicted in federal court.|$|R
