40|$|Introduction Eliminating the {{residual}} debris and {{bacteria in the}} root canal system {{is one of the}} main purposes of the endodontic treatment. However, the complexity on the anatomy of the root canal system makes it difficult to eliminate the bacterial biofilm existing along the root canal surface and necrotic pulp tissue by mechanical instrumentation and chemical irrigation. Recently, more effective irrigant delivery systems for root canal irrigation have been developed. The purpose of this review was to present an overview of root canal irrigant delivery techniques and devices available in endodontics. Review The contents of this paper include as follows; - syringe-needle irrigation, manual dynamic irrigation, brushes - sonic and ultrasonic irrigation, passive ultrasonic irrigation, rotary brush, RinsEndo, EndoVac, Laser Conclusion Though technological advances during the last decade have brought to fruition new <b>agitation</b> <b>devices</b> that rely on various mechanisms, there are few evidence based study to correlate the clinical efficacy of these devices with improved outcomes except syringe irrigation with needle and ultrasonic irrigation. The clinicians should try their best efforts to deliver antimicrobial and tissue solvent solutions in predictable volumes safely to working length...|$|E
40|$|Objective : The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the antibacterial efficacy of 3 % sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) with sonic <b>agitation</b> <b>devices.</b> Materials and Methods: Fifty extracted human single-rooted teeth were collected. Canals were prepared up to Profile # 35 / 0. 06. Forty teeth were inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis and incubated for 24 hours. The teeth were then divided into five groups based on the agitation device used. Group 1 - was agitated with EndoActivator. Group 2 was agitated with Waterpik Power Flosser. In Group 3, Waterpik flosser was used with a nickel-titanium file. Group 4 (positive control) was not subjected to any agitation, and Group 5 -was the negative control. Superficial and deep dentinal shavings were collected from coronal and apical halves and sowed in brain heart infusion (BHI) agar to evaluate colony-forming units (CFU/mL). Results: Krusal Wallis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Mann-Whitney U test showed that Group 3 showed a smaller number of CFUs/mL Group 2 showed a relatively greater number of CFU/mL. The deep apical dentin areas showed more number of CFUs relative to other sites. Conclusion: The nickel-titanium file attached to the Waterpik Power Flosser system was found to be as effective as the EndoActivator in antibacterial efficacy against E. faecalis...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{literature}} references comparing {{the use of}} aqueous polymer quenching solutions with petroleum oil quenchants {{for a wide range}} of steels of varying hardenability and the relating parameters of describing properties of the quenching mediums. There are relatively little similar relating correlations between parameters of describing properties of the different quenching mediums. The quenchants used included: conventional quenching oil, martempering oil, and 5 % and 25 % aqueous polymer quenchant solutions (APQSs) of a polymer quenchant. These quenching media were selected to represent a broad range of quench severities as quantified by cooling curve analysis (ASTM D 6482) using a standard Inconel 600 probe and the Tensi <b>Agitation</b> <b>Device.</b> The test of correlation conducted between the Hardening Power parameters according to examples of oils and polymers.

30|$|Active smokers {{admitted}} to an ICU, present more <b>agitation,</b> self-removal of <b>devices,</b> need for physical restraint and receive higher doses of sedatives, neuroleptics and analgesics [5]. Agitated behaviour {{might be a}} consequence of nicotine withdrawal, but may also be due to delirium or abstinence of concomitant alcohol and/or drug use. Until now {{it is unclear whether}} tobacco use confers higher risk of delirium during ICU stay [8].|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{severity}} of the conditions of the study patients, and the above limitations, the OSP strategy resulted in significantly shorter mechanical ventilation duration. Similar findings have been observed in previous randomized studies on light sedation in less severely ill ICU populations. This finding is important, as physicians may be reluctant to adopt a light sedation strategy among the most severely ill patients. Indeed, as <b>agitation</b> and <b>device</b> removal may be perceived as particularly dangerous in this population, physicians may favour continuous intravenous sedation. The present trial did not show that oversedation prevention was associated with lower mortality, but it showed that it was associated with secondary benefits of faster weaning and extubation.|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} 2 G-ethanol {{production from}} lignocellulosic biomass requires transforming this biomass into fermentable sugars before performing alcoholic fermentation. This {{first step of}} biotransformation is accomplished by cellulases and represents the major technical and economic challenge for the process development. Cellulases are industrially produced by the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei, endowed with a strong secretory capacity. This fungus is strictly aerobic, it {{is influenced by the}} shear stress induced by strong agitation rate and its growth induces a viscosity increase {{as a consequence of the}} formation of three-dimensional structures of microorganisms (from micrometer to millimeter). These characteristics make the production process scale-up complex as strong links exist between morphological and physiological states of fungus and the process conditions. In this context, this work aims at developing a scale-down approach to better understand the answer of Trichoderma reesei to its culture conditions. Based on a multi-tools combination, this method involves the use of microscopy coupled to image analysis of T. reesei cells and the development of a specific method for viscosity measurement using original <b>agitation</b> <b>devices.</b> Both the growth of the fungus and its enzyme production capacity are taken into account as physiological parameters. They are characterized at the laboratory scale, at mixing time and shear stress values expected at the industrial scale. The cultures are carried out using fed-batch and chemostat modes in order to impose different constraints. The obtained results allow validating the methods at small scale and providing their main advantages and limitations...|$|E
40|$|The 340 Complex is a less-than- 90 -day {{storage unit}} for mixed waste {{generated}} on the Hanford Site. The 340 Complex receives liquid waste from various {{buildings in the}} 300 Area via underground transfer lines, or by containers from generators supporting Hanford Site programs. The tanks used for waste storage at the 340 Complex include two 57 kiloliter tanks within the 340 Underground Storage Vault and six 30 kiloliter tanks within the 340 A building. The two underground vault tanks provide primary waste storage while the six tanks in the 340 A building provide reserve storage capacity. The 340 A Building tanks are not equipped with <b>agitation</b> <b>devices</b> and/or equipment. Consequently, past usage of the tanks {{has resulted in the}} formation, deposition, and settling of waste water solids. The deposited tank solids contain radioactive material that represent a source of radiation exposure to workers. For as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) purposes, the solids must be removed periodically from the tanks. The most recent tank solids removal effort occurred in the early 1980 s. The removal of solids from the 340 A building tanks constitutes a modification, in accordance with WAC 173 - 460 - 020 (14), and, in accordance with WAC 173 - 460 - 040, the proposed activities are subject to New Source Review. In accordance with WAC 173 - 460 and WAC 173 - 400, this document serves as a Notice of Construction (NOC) for periodically removing solids from the 340 A Building tanks...|$|E
40|$|A {{magnetic}} solid-phase extraction method {{based on}} agarose coated magnetic nanoparticles (ACMNPs) coupled to {{a magnetic field}} <b>agitation</b> (MFA) <b>device</b> was developed and used for the preconcentration and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometric determination of trace amounts of MoVI in beans. The formation of the nanoparticles and their encapsulation in agarose micro-flakes was conducted in a single step. The nanomagnetic agarose particles were activated by an epichlorohydrin method, functionalized by phenylephrine and used for selective preconcentration of MoVI. The influence of different analytical parameters such as pH, extraction time, type and volume of eluent and amount of adsorbent on the preconcentration of MoVI were investigated. No important interferences were observed for {{the determination of the}} analyte in presence of several other metal ions. The capacity of the adsorbent for MoVI at pH 4. 0, was 13. 2 µg per mL of its packed volume. Eight replicated analyses at the optimized conditions resulted in a recovery of 95. 3 % with a relative standard deviation of 4. 9 %. The detection limit of the method (3 &# 963;) for MoVI was 49 ng L- 1. The method was successfully applied to the determination of MoVI in beans samples...|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} endodontic treatment, alkaline solutions {{of sodium}} hypochlorite (NaOCl) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) {{are used in}} combination to disinfect the root canal system and to eliminate debris and smear layers. An important concept that has emerged over recent years {{is the use of}} active physical methods for agitating these fluids to improve their penetration within areas that are not reached by endodontic instruments and to accelerate the chemical actions of these alkaline fluids against planktonic microorganisms, biofilms, soft tissue remnants and smear layers. Ultrasonic agitation and more recently pulsed lasers have emerged as two promising methods for activating endodontic irrigation fluids. Ultrasonic <b>agitation</b> with piezoelectric <b>devices</b> employs a moving tip, while laser agitation uses a stationary tip. Both methods cause cavitation, followed by implosions and shear forces which assist with debridement. Fluid streaming further enhances the activity of the fluids. While agitation enhances performance of irrigants, extrusion of fluids from the root canal during activation is a hazard that must be controlled...|$|R
40|$|In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, dissolution testing {{is a very}} important tool in drug development and quality control. There is a need to establish the in vivo performance of products that contain probiotic agents for vaginal administration by developing in vitro methods of evaluation. In order to achieve a close in vitro–in vivo correlation for a tablet containing a probiotic agent for vaginal administration, the various parameters that must be considered when designing a dissolution apparatus include volume and composition of the dissolution medium, environmental conditions of the absorption site, and surface exposure of the tablet. The primary objective of the present investigation was the design of a dissolution apparatus that could simulate the vaginal environment for vaginal tablets containing a probiotic agent. The newly fabricated dissolution apparatus was found to be successful in minimizing the volume of the dissolution medium and in eliminating the risk of exposure of the vaginal formulation to <b>agitation</b> and sampling <b>devices.</b> Thus, the dissolution apparatus may prove to be of value for carrying out routine quality control tests...|$|R
