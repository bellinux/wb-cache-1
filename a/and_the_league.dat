In early 1945, Liaquat and the Congress leader Bhulabhai Desai met, with Jinnah's approval, and agreed that after the war, the Congress <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> should form an interim government {{with the members of}} the Executive Council of the Viceroy to be nominated by the Congress <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> in equal numbers.
