The Church of Scientology placed a 48-page advertising supplement in 1.8million copies of USA Today.

2500|$|Doing the Impossible {{official}} synopsis mentions [...] "three fifteen-year-old {{girls are}} starting their sophomore {{year of high}} school. The 'impossible' thing they <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> living according to God's standards in modern society. Megan gets {{the lead in the}} high school play, but her character is a rather 'loose' woman. Her leading man is more interested in 'fun' than appropriateness… Ashley has a learning disability and wrestles with feeling dumb and unattractive. Brittney is very smart, but overweight. She deals with her body image as well as where a smart female fits in society without being considered aggressive. Baha’i school on Sunday mornings adds the different perspectives of other students." ...|$|E

They are the ones who, as soon as one plan fails, get busy right away and think of another plan and try that. If the thing they <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> a good thing, sooner or later they succeed. If they are trying to do a wrong thing, very likely all their plans fail, as they should.|$|E

"Introduce you to Mr. March, our editor, Mr. Beaton," [...] Fulkerson said, {{rolling his}} head in the {{direction}} of the elder man; and then nodding it toward the younger, he said, [...] "Mr. Dryfoos, Mr. Beaton." [...] Beaton shook hands with March, and then with Mr. Dryfoos, and Fulkerson went on, gayly: [...] "We were just talking of you, Beaton--well, you know the old saying. Mr. March, as I told you, is our editor, and Mr. Dryfoos has charge of the publishing department--he's the counting-room incarnate, the source of power, the fountain of corruption, the element that prevents journalism being the high and holy thing that it would be if there were no money in it." [...] Mr. Dryfoos turned his large, mild eyes upon Beaton, and laughed with the uneasy concession which people make to a character when they do not quite approve of the character's language. [...] "What Mr. March and I <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to carry on this thing so that there won't be any money in it--or very little; and we're planning to give the public a better article for the price than it's ever had before. Now here's a dummy we've had made up for 'Every Other Week', and as we've decided to adopt it, we would naturally like your opinion of it, so's to know what opinion to have of you." [...] He reached forward and pushed toward Beaton a volume a little above the size of the ordinary duodecimo book; its ivory-white pebbled paper cover was prettily illustrated with a water-colored design irregularly washed over the greater part of its surface: quite across the page at top, and narrowing from right to left as it descended. In the triangular space left blank the title of the periodical and the publisher's imprint were tastefully lettered so as to be partly covered by the background of color.|$|E

Conor Oberst (of Bright Eyes) sort of does it, but way more in an emotional, self-loathing type way. ... It goes way beyond simple spoof. What Kids Against Combs <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> awaken an entire {{generation}} and say, Gosh! Look around you! You have rights!" ...|$|E

The fact is that since the disengagement, Hamas has fired only at civilians. Even in this war, to my astonishment, I see that they are not aiming at the army concentrations along the border but time and again at civilian communities.|$|E

Due {{in part to the}} changing circumstances surrounding the album's rollout, the series was shelved before any episodes were completed, though several portions have been leaked to YouTube. Corgan later said, [...] "Yeah, I think you can find a few bits and pieces, but it never got finished unfortunately.

50|$|The {{movie was}} shot in Pacific Grove and around the Monterey Peninsula. Sloan Wilson wrote the first screenplay, which covered the 22-year span of the novel.

And while this may sound corny, it can be assisted by love and understanding. Amid some rather tempestuous social activities, this is {{what we are trying to}} demonstrate. That there are two affairs may sound sensational but that's not the point. We have received the approval of the Johnstone office because the intent of the picture is a moral one. Frankness and impatience will help pull the cork on a situation blocked by intolerance. What we <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> dramatise that pulling of the cork.|$|E
5000|$|Ásta {{replaced}} Jón Þór Ólafsson as Pirate Party MP for Reykjavik Constituency South in 2015 when {{he stepped}} down from the role. For the remainder of the 2011 parliamentary term, from 2015 to 2016, she served as a member of Environment and Communications Committee and as an observer on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Explaining the Pirate Party's success in the polls, Ásta said [...] "Iceland is an unusual place, politically speaking. There’s a void in Icelandic politics when it comes to liberal parties. In Denmark and Sweden, there are many liberal parties, so there is less space for a Pirate Party. They have parties that are consistently liberal, and have been since the ‘60s. There’s a reason Denmark was the first country to legalise porn in 1969. In Iceland, there’s a lot of social conservatism, even though people want to be libertarians as far as the market, etcetera. What the Pirates <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> more of social liberalism." ...|$|E

This incident made me feel sad, though many Chinese have been understanding. It disclosed many problems for government and company supervision of the milk sources, quality and marketing administration ... The government will put more efforts into food security, taking the incident as a warning.What we <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to ensure no such event happens in future by punishing those leaders as well as enterprises responsible.

And all they <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> {{see if they can}} find money that they can seize to fund their operations. To me what they do is illegal, improper, and not good public policy." [...] Hinojosa also said of Texas' Drug Task Forces, [...] "They don't need probable cause to stop you. They just stop you. They will profile you, which is illegal, ask to search your vehicle without probable cause, which is also illegal, and I refuse. But a lot of citizens don't know that and what they do is go through your car, snoop around, see what they can find and let you go if they don't find any money. Those drug task forces have no business operating in our state." ...|$|E
5000|$|Various {{civil rights}} leaders of the black {{community}} criticized Beck leading up to the event, under the auspice that picking the anniversary of Dr. King's 1963 speech was a [...] "deliberate way to distort King's message." [...] Rev. Carlton W. Veazey, minister of the National Baptist Convention and president of Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, held a press conference to announce his opposition to Beck's rally. After referring to Beck's comment from July 2009 that President Barack Obama has [...] "over and over again" [...] exposed himself as [...] "a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture", Veazey stated: What they <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> divert the nation from the agenda of Martin Luther King to their agenda, and I think that's hijacking his legacy. What they have said all the time, have been trying to divide people, trying to exclude people. For him to lead a rally with that kind of attitude taints the whole affair.|$|E

What we <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> be in a planning mode where we talk with each other on campus and listen to those who have been here like alumni and management experts.
