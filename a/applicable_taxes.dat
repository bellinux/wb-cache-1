2500|$|In effect, {{this section}} of the Act {{establishes}} national underwriting standards for residential loans. It is not the intent of this section to establish rules or regulations that would require a loan to be made that would not be regarded as acceptable or prudential by the appropriate regulator of the financial institution. However, the loan originator shall make a reasonable and good faith effort based on verified and documented information that [...] "at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to the terms, and all <b>applicable</b> <b>taxes,</b> insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and other assessments". Also included in these calculations should be any payments for a second mortgage or other subordinate loans. Income verification is mandated for residential mortgages. Certain loan provisions, including prepayment penalties on some loans, and mandatory arbitration on all residential loans, are prohibited.|$|E

50|$|The {{advertising}} of pricing {{information is}} another topic {{of concern for}} governments. In the United States for instance, {{it is common for}} businesses to only mention the existence and amount of <b>applicable</b> <b>taxes</b> at a later stage of a transaction. In Canada and New Zealand, taxes can be listed as separate items, {{as long as they are}} quoted up-front. In most other countries, the advertised price must include all <b>applicable</b> <b>taxes,</b> enabling customers to easily know how much it will cost them.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, an {{advantage}} {{of this type of}} shopping is that the merchant is typically not required by law to add sales tax to the price of the goods, unless they have a physical presence in the customer's state. Instead, most states require the resident purchaser to pay <b>applicable</b> <b>taxes.</b> There has been periodic discussion about amending the law to make these sales taxable, especially with the rise of online shopping (see e.g. Amazon tax).|$|E
50|$|Promoting tax-free {{shopping}} {{and making it}} easier for tourists to claim the refund back, has helped to attract travellers to many countries. TFS is subject to national regulations, such as minimum spend and restrictions on the types of products on which it can be claimed. Refunds can only be claimed on goods which are exported. However, buying goods tax free does not mean travellers are exempt from paying <b>applicable</b> <b>taxes</b> on their purchases when they get home.|$|E
50|$|When someone {{pays for}} goods or {{services}} with local money, the income to the business is taxable. Similar to gift cards, the <b>applicable</b> <b>tax</b> is taken {{at the time of}} purchase and paid to the IRS at the time of redemption by the merchant.|$|R

50|$|Employees {{participating}} in a Section 79 plan offered by a sponsoring corporation may receive up to $50,000 in group term life insurance at no cost, if the plan is non-discriminatory. Any amount over this limit is deemed a 'permanent benefit'. The employee should realize {{a portion of the}} permanent benefit as W-2 taxable income, and pay any <b>applicable</b> <b>taxes</b> accordingly. Contributions to a Section 79 plan are tax-deductible, though for owner(s), and 2% or more shareholders, contributions are only deductible if paid by, and from, a C Corporation.|$|E
50|$|City {{and church}} {{officials}} announced in February 2014 that a meetinghouse and a 32-story residential building {{will be built}} on a lot adjacent to the temple site, at 1601 Vine Street. The residential structure and meetinghouse were designed by Paul L. Whalen of RAMSA. The meetinghouse will serve approximately 1,000 of the 25,000 Latter-day Saints in the Philadelphia area and will include a family history center. The residential building is anticipated to include 258 apartments and 13 townhouses, along with retail space, and be subject to regular, <b>applicable</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a fair {{publishing}} agreement, every 100 {{units of}} currency that flows to the publisher gets divided as follows: 50 units {{go to the}} songwriter and 50 units to the publisher minus operating and administrative fees and <b>applicable</b> <b>taxes.</b> However, the music writer obtains a further 25 units from the publisher's share, if the music writer retains {{a portion of the}} music publishing rights (as a co-publisher). In effect, the co-publishing agreement is a 50/50 share of royalties in favor of the songwriter if administrative costs of publishing are disregarded. This is near international practice.|$|E
50|$|Tax {{returns in}} the United States are reports {{filed with the}} Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or with the state or local tax {{collection}} agency (California Franchise Tax Board, for example) containing information used to calculate income tax or other taxes.

50|$|Initially, Rachael {{only used}} item prices against her $40 limit. She started {{including}} <b>applicable</b> <b>taxes</b> and tips {{during the first}} season. On occasion, she does go over budget; however, during her trips to Philadelphia and Arizona, she did so on purpose. Her cheapest day was in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2003, when she spent just under $25 USD including taxes and tips (at the time, less than $40 Canadian, although she budgeted for $40 USD). On occasions, she has had to get creative to stay on-budget; for example, she accidentally blew half her budget on her second meal in her first Miami episode.|$|E
5000|$|The late {{government}} of Azerbaijan approved the Law on Protection of Foreign Investments in 1992 on which full legal protection was provided for international investors. The law also ensures equal treatment towards both foreign and local investors and enables the repatriation of profits, revenues and other investment-related funds {{as long as}} <b>applicable</b> <b>taxes</b> have been paid. The Law on the Protection of Foreign Investments protects foreign investors against nationalization and requisition, excluding certain specified circumstances. The nationalization of property can occur when authorized by parliamentary resolution, although cases of official nationalization or requisition against foreign companies have not been recorded in Azerbaijan.|$|E

50|$|Sales tax is {{calculated}} by multiplying {{the purchase price}} by the <b>applicable</b> <b>tax</b> rate. Tax rates vary widely by jurisdiction and range from less than 1% to over 10%. Sales tax is collected by the seller {{at the time of}} sale. Use tax is self assessed by a buyer who has not paid sales tax on a taxable purchase. Unlike the value added tax, a sales tax is imposed only at the retail level. In cases where items are sold at retail more than once, such as used cars, the sales tax can be charged on the same item indefinitely.|$|R
50|$|As {{the post-war}} {{situation}} in the region made way {{for the emergence of}} the modern state of Kuwait, Aminoil and the Kuwait government engaged in protracted discussions over new arrangements, amid strong differences of opinion.

50|$|The {{pricing policy}} of the {{low-cost}} carriers is usually very dynamic, with discounts and tickets in promotion. Like other carriers, even if the advertised price may be very low, it often does not include charges and taxes. With some airlines, some flights are advertised as free (plus <b>applicable</b> <b>taxes,</b> fees and charges). Depending on the airline, perhaps as many (or as few) as {{ten percent of the}} seats on any flight are offered at the lowest price, and are the first to sell. The prices steadily rise thereafter to a point where they can be comparable or more expensive than a flight on a full-service carrier.|$|E
50|$|A sealed {{train is}} one that travels internationally under customs and/or {{immigration}} seal, without its contents legally recognized as entering or leaving the nations traversed between {{the beginning and end}} of the journey or subject to any otherwise <b>applicable</b> <b>taxes.</b> The most notable use of a sealed train was the return of Vladimir Lenin to Russia from exile in Switzerland in 1917, but the practice was used a number of times throughout the 20th century to allow the migration or transport of controversial individuals or peoples. For instance, sealed trains were used for repatriation of combatants in the Spanish Civil War, Jewish emigration from Nazi Germany to the United States, and expulsion of East German refugees to West Germany.|$|E

50|$|Even where countries’ {{corporate}} laws permit {{companies to}} be thinly capitalised, revenue authorities {{in those countries}} will often limit the amount that a company can claim as a tax deduction on interest, particularly when it receives loans at non-commercial rates (e.g. from connected parties).
