2500|$|On January 24, 2017, Aleynikov's {{conviction}} was reinstated by the First Department of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. [...] The {{appellate court}} found the trial court's reasoning—that an electronic {{copy of the}} code was not a [...] "tangible" [...] reproduction—made [...] "little sense," [...] as a compact disc and <b>a</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>drive</b> are both [...] "unquestionably tangible." [...] The appellate court {{also found that the}} trial court erred in concluding that Aleynikov lacked [...] "intent to appropriate," [...] holding that the evidence [...] "permits a rational inference that defendant intended to exercise permanent control over the use of Goldman's source code, as opposed to a short-term borrowing." [...] Aleynikov's lawyer has stated that he will seek [...] "immediate leave to appeal" [...] the decision.|$|E

50|$|As mentioned, the CCR {{standard}} uses eXtensible Markup Language (XML) as it {{is aimed}} at being technology neutral to allow for maximum applicability.

This is aimed at producing flexible expression of structured data in avenues such as electronic health record (EHR) systems. In terms of the CCR's transportability, secure carriage and transmission of the electronic file can occur via physicaltransport media, for example on <b>a</b> USB <b>thumb</b> <b>drive,</b> tablet or phone, CD ROM, or smart card, and in an electronic sense, secure transmission can occur via a network line, or the Internet.|$|R

25|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{controversy}} and court appeal, Panahi broke the ban imposed on him from making films and made the documentary feature This Is Not a Film (2011) in collaboration with Iranian filmmaker Mojtaba Mirtahmasb. This film was made for €3,200 and shot on a digital camcorder and, partly, an iPhone. It was shot in four days over a ten-day period in March 2011 and its title was inspired by René Magritte's painting The Treachery of Images. In the film, Panahi sits in his apartment making phone calls about his court case, watching TV news stories, interacting with his neighbors, talking about his past films and describing scenes from the film that he had begun shooting when he was arrested (much as he had described scenes from films to his sisters as a child). Ten days before the opening of the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, This Is Not a Film was announced as a surprise entry into the festival. It was smuggled out of Iran on <b>a</b> USB <b>thumb</b> <b>drive</b> that had been hidden inside a cake. Panahi's wife and daughter attended the festival. In December 2012 it was shortlisted as one of 15 films eligible for Best Documentary Feature at the 85th Academy Awards.|$|R
