25|$|Justice Loh {{also created}} <b>a</b> <b>buzz</b> in legal circles by departing from the {{inherent}} tendency test and instead favouring the real risk test.

Under his definition, a statement with even a small risk of undermining public confidence in the courts would be found to be in contempt. The use of the real risk test is also significant as it {{comes at a time when}} the Government is planning to codify the law on contempt.|$|E
