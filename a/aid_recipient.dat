2500|$|Whilst {{the above}} {{conception}} of aid {{has been the}} most pervasive within development geography work, {{it is important to remember}} that the aid landscape is far more complex than one directional flows from 'developed' to 'developing' countries. Development geographers have been at the forefront of research that aims to understand both the material exchanges and discourse surrounding 'South-South' development cooperation. 'Non-traditional' foreign aid from Southern, Middle Eastern and post-Socialist states (those outside the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD) provide alternative development discourses and approaches to that of the mainstream Western model. Development geographers seek to examine the geopolitical drivers behind the aid donor programmes of [...] "LEDCs", as well as the discursive symbolic repertoires of non-DAC donor states. Two illustrative examples of the complex aid landscape are that of China, which has been active as an aid donor throughout the latter half of the twentieth century but published its first report on foreign aid policy as recently as 2011 and India, an often cited <b>aid</b> <b>recipient,</b> but which has had donor programmes to Nepal and Bhutan since the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} f the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant program at Oregon State University achieved its goal of providing equal access to the benefits of higher education for students who have low financial resources as compared to students not receiving student financial aid. Design: The study had two major segments. The first segment compared 150 Basic Educational Opportunity Grant recipients with 150 non-financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients.</b> These two groups were pair-matched to control for predicted freshman year grade point average. The two groups were compared over a five year period with respect to the following variables related to persistence or non-persistence: 1) academic year grade point average, 2) academic year mean completed credit hours, 3) withdrawal rates, 4) suspension rates, 5) return rates for the next fall term, and 6) graduation rates. The second part of the study investigated the possible differences between the various Basic Grant award levels when Basic Grant recipients were compared on the six variables. The six variables were also studied in relation to the various type(s) of financial aid received in addition to the Basic Grant. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study the following conclusions were drawn: 1. There was no significant difference between the number of credit hours earned by Basic Educational Opportunity Grant <b>recipients</b> and non-financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients.</b> 2. Basic Educational Opportunity Grant <b>recipients</b> and non-financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> did not have significantly different grade point averages. 3. There were no significant differences between Basic Educational Opportunity Grant <b>recipients</b> and non-financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> with respect to withdrawal and suspension rates. 4. There was no significant difference in the combined fourth and fifth year graduation rate between Basic Educational Opportunity Grant <b>recipients</b> and non-financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients.</b> 5. There were no significant differences in the return rates in the second through fifth years of study between Basic Educational Opportunity Grant <b>recipients</b> and non-financial <b>aid</b> <b>recipients.</b> The return rate for the sixth year, fall term, 1980, was significantly higher for Basic Educational Opportunity Grant recipients. 6. There were no significant differences in the persistence of Basic Educational Opportunity Grant recipients when the various Basic Grant awards were compared. 7. Significant differences were found in the second year return rate and the fourth year graduation rate for Basic Educational Opportunity Grant recipients when the different types of aid packages were compared. Summary: It may be concluded that the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant program has met its goal of providing equal access to the benefits of higher education at Oregon State University. The five year study indicated that students receiving the Basic Grant persisted at a rate at least equal to that of students of the same ability level who did not receive student financial assistance...|$|R

The {{fundamental}} reason behind foreign aid practice, as the selectorate theory suggests, is to improve the survival of political leaders in both donor and recipient states. They argued that the size of leader's winning coalition and government revenues affect leader's decision making on policy concession and aid. By analyzing the bilateral aid transfers by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations between 1960 and 2001, they discovered that leaders in <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> countries are more likely to grant policy concession for donors when the winning coalition is small because leaders with small winning coalitions can easily reimburse supporters for their concession. As the result, relatively poor, small coalition systems are most likely to get aid. The conclusion of their study shows that interest exchange is the primary reason for foreign aid practice and OECD members have little humanitarian motivation for aid giving. Nancy Qian's study supported this conclusion by arguing that “The literature shows that the primary purpose of aid is often not to alleviate poverty and that out of all of the foreign aid flows, only 1.69% to 5.25% are given to the poorest twenty percent of countries in any given year" ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive aid. The aid budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced: the donor agency observes the performance of the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> imperfectly; the donor agency and the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> are subject to inefficiency; the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> experiences corruption; and adjustment of <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> performance is costly. Incentives between the aid donor and the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> are intentionally aligned - to explore the best-case for the policy intervention. Immediate implications are then that optimal level of effort and governance in the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> increase under performance intensity of aid. Moreover, performance intensity of aid has fundraising effects. While the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> also has an incentive to increase the measurement noise in governance, this incentive is weaker than that to raise true underlying governance, is weakest for the poorest aid recipients and provided that the donor agency is sufficiently efficient, measurement error itself will serve to raise optimal effort in the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient.</b> The importance of aid agency self-monitoring is thereby identified. Three important qualifications on the anticipated success of the policy emerge, however. Despite the elimination of incentive misalignment, aid donors may come to rely on performance intensity precisely where such a reliance is likely to be least successful in aid recipients. Second, performance intensity of aid maximizes its impact under conditions where it is supplemented by technical assistance to improve the effectiveness of own effort by the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient.</b> Finally, under convex adjustment costs the general class of optimal time paths in governance in aid recipients will be non-monotone, such that governance may get worse before they get better - optimally so. Performance intensive policy may thus appear to fail - immediately after imposition. ...|$|E

E¤ort in the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> is subject to variable e¢ciency. Finally, adjustment of performance in the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> is costly both in the level of e¤ort, and in the time rate of change in the performance measure.

Second, performance intensity of aid generates incentive e¤ects, such that the optimal level of governance in the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> will increase under strengthening performance intensity of aid. Thirdly, improving governance in the <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> in turn was shown to lead to increased budgetary allocations to aid in the legislature that allocates aid resources.
