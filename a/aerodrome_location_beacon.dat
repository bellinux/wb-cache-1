There are tracking or logistic applications where actual position coordinates are not necessary. Determining the room in a building an object is located can be more useful then the actual coordinates. We present an inexpensive and robust wireless <b>location</b> <b>beacon</b> network that can track the location of emergency responders or users in an indoor environment. <b>Location</b> <b>beacons</b> are placed at predetermined positions in a building. The <b>location</b> <b>beacons</b> are used to determine the presence of the user in an area of a building. The <b>location</b> <b>beacon</b> network does not track the user 2 ̆ 7 s coordinates.

40|$|Broadcasting in ad hoc {{networks}} {{is required}} for many routing and other network-layer protocols to request information like routes or locations about destination nodes. Most of these routing protocols use a simple flooding mechanism that can cause broadcast storms, particularly in high density environments. Although many techniques have been proposed {{to address the problem}} of broadcast storms, they require additional periodic <b>location</b> <b>beacons</b> or do not satisfactorily reduce transmission redundancy in high density environments. We propose Cell Broadcast, a broadcast protocol that significantly reduces redundancy without the use of beaconing and while maintaining complete reachability in a high density environment. The proposed technique divides a terrain into cells. These cells help a node to determine its geographic relationship with a broadcasting node. This geographic relationship can eliminate rebroadcasts not only from nodes close to a broadcasting node but also from a majority of nodes near the transmission edge of the broadcasting node. The effect is that, in a high density environment, only a few nodes located near the 4 diagonal corners of a transmission range need to rebroadcast to maintain 100 % reachability. To the best of our knowledge, this technique is not present in any existing techniques that do not use <b>location</b> <b>beaconing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Indoor environments present {{opportunities}} for a {{rich set of}} location-aware applications such as navigation tools for humans and robots, interactive virtual games, resource discovery, asset tracking, location-aware sensor networking etc. Typical indoor applications require better accuracy than what current outdoor location systems provide. Outdoor location technologies such as GPS have poor indoor performance because of the harsh nature of indoor environments. Further, typical indoor applications require different types of location information such as physical space, position and orientation. This dissertation describes the design {{and implementation of the}} Cricket indoor location system that provides accurate location in the form of user space, position and orientation to mobile and sensor network applications.

40|$|As {{the field}} of sensor {{networks}} matures, {{research in this area}} is focusing not only on fixed networks, but also on mobile sensor networks. For many reasons, both technical and logistical, such networks will often be very sparse for all or part of their operation, sometimes functioning more as disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs). While much work has been done on localization methods for densely populated fixed networks, most of these methods are inefficient or ineffective for sparse mobile networks, where connections can be infrequent. While some mobile networks rely on fixed <b>location</b> <b>beacons</b> or per-node, onboard GPS, these methods are not always possible due to cost, power and other constraints. In this paper we present the Low-density Collaborative Ad-Hoc Localization Estimation (LOCALE) system for sparse sensor networks. In LOCALE, each node estimates its own position, and collaboratively refines that location estimate by updating its prediction based on neighbors it encounters. Nodes also estimate (as a probability density function) the likelihood their prediction is accurate. We evaluate LOCALE’s collaborative localization both through real implementations running on sensor nodes, as well as through simulations of larger systems. We consider scenarios of varying density (down to 0. 02 neighbors per communication attempt), as well as scenarios that demonstrate LOCALE’s resilience in the face of extremely-inaccurate individual nodes. Overall, our algorithms yield up to a median of 21 X better accuracy for location estimation compared to existing approaches. In addition, by allowing nodes to refine location estimates collaboratively, LOCALE also reduces the need for fixed <b>location</b> <b>beacons</b> (i. e. GPSenabled beacon towers) by as much as 64 X. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the implementation of}} indoor real-time localisation system (RLTS) using wireless sensor networks. A RLTS consists of anchor nodes (i. e. nodes with fixed and known <b>locations),</b> <b>beacon</b> nodes and a <b>location</b> engine: the <b>beacon</b> node to be localised sends a packet which is captured from some anchor nodes, the anchor nodes forward the information extracted from the packet to the location engine for the estimation {{of the position of}} the transmitting beacon node. The authors present an algorithm that achieves beacon node localisation accuracy of a few metres in indoor environments. The algorithm is based on two steps: in the first step, the algorithm computes the ranging between anchor nodes and beacon node, in the second one, the algorithm estimates the beacon node localisation. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is used for the ranging estimation. The proposed approach avoids dedicated and expensive devices, which are used for the synchronisation between beacon and anchor nodes, to compute the time-of-flight of the signal. The authors introduce a confidence parameter for improving accuracy (based on the standard deviation of the RSSI), and an anchor nodes selection strategy for tackling the problem of nonline- of-sight communication between nodes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Geographical routing {{in mobile}} {{wireless}} sensor networks has attracted big attention {{in recent years by}} introducing new challenges. When a node has a packet to forward, it selects the closest available neighbor to the sink as the next forwarder regarding only the location parameter. However, this routing strategy does not consider the topology changes caused by the mobility of nodes, which may degrade performance or cause failures. To overcome this problem, we propose an efficient greedy forwarding mechanism based on a new decision metric that considers the distance to the sink, the moving direction and the moving speed of the forwarding candidate neighbors of a sender node. The moving direction depends on both distance and angle of a neighbor according to the sink between two successive <b>location</b> <b>beacons.</b> Associated with the well-known GPSR routing protocol, our proposal achieved good performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, average path length, control packet overhead and energy consumption.

The ideas of an innovative light-emitting diode (LED) -based <b>location</b> <b>beacon</b> system are developed and verified. The system developed is a combination of several latest technologies which include a CMOS vision sensor, high brightness LEDs, and digital image processing techniques. It belongs to a new kind of simplex communication link. A digital camera is used to capture images contained in the LED beacon signal. The captured digital images are processed by the algorithms developed and a location code is extracted. The location code can be used for calibration of a vehicle positioning system which may consist of a GPS, Inertial Navigation System (INS) and other sensors. The issues examined include the structure of the transmitter and the receiver, the signaling method, the transmission protocol of the LED panel, the relationship between the camera capturing rate and the LED pattern update rate, the digital camera exposure technology, and the efficiency of the image processing algorithms. Experiments using a prototype transmitter and a receiver were performed.
