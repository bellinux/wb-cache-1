Para verificar a possível ação biológica e a eficiência desse material, neste estudo foram realizadas: avaliação do desempenho dos filtros percoladores no pós-tratamento de esgoto sanitário, utilizando como meio suporte serragem desse tipo, gerada em curtumes - essa é uma forma de {{resolver}} o problema do pós-tratamento de esgoto sanitário e de atenuar os efeitos tóxicos da serragem de couro curtido tipo wet blue; avaliação e monitoramento de parâmetros indicadores que permitam controle simples sobre o processo - pode-se citar entre eles: DBO 5, DQO, NTK e nitrogênio amoniacal; e verificar a eficiência dos filtros percoladores na redução da quantidade de coliformes fecais presentes em esgoto sanitário. O sistema apresentou excelente eficiência principalmente na remoção de DQOtotal de 60 % (&# 963 = ± 30 %) e DQOdissolvida 60 % (&# 963 = ± 13 %). De início a remoção de coliformes foi total - o que pode evidenciar o efeito tóxico da serragem, devido à grande presença de cromo na serragem; no entanto, exames posteriores detectaram a existência de coliformes nos efluentes de todos os filtros levantando uma dúvida a respeito da toxicidade da serragem. Ainda que se conheçam inúmeras formas de tratamento de efluentes líquidos, a proposta de usar serragem de couro - que é gerada em curtumes em grande quantidade - como meio suporte em filtros percoladores pode significar um passo para que se encontre solução conjunta tanto para a serragem - resíduo indesejável - como para o pós-tratamento de esgoto sanitário. The {{research proposal}} was {{to perform a}} preliminar test upon the hypothesis that type wet blue leather sawing would be adequated {{as a means of}} percolator filter support destinated to the sanitary sewage post treatment. To investigate the possible biological action and that of the material efficiency some actions were taken: performance evaluation of the percolators filters in the sanitary sewage post treatment, using as <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>means</b> the sawing of that type, generated in a tanning plant - this is one way of solving the problem of sanitary sewage post treatment, as well as, to attenuate the toxic effects of the type wet blue leather sawing; the evaluation and monitoring of indicator parameters that turn to a possible simple control on the process - such as BOD 5, COD, NTK and amoniacal nitrogen; to investigate the percolator filter efficiency in the reduction of fecal coliform population that are present in the sanitary sewage. The system presented an excellent efficiency, mainly in the removal of CODtotal 60 % (&# 963 = ± 30 %) and CODdissolved 60 % (&# 963 = ± 13 %). In the beginning the coliform removal was total - what could have been caused by the sawing toxic effect, due to substancial amounts of chromium in the sawing; however, later analysis detected the existence of coliforms in the effluents of all filters originating a questionable subject about the sawing toxicity. Despite {{the fact that there are}} a great number of liquid effluenttreatments, the proposal of the use of leather sawing - generated in large amounts in tanning plants - as <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>means</b> for percolator filters, might be a step to find out a conjunction solution for the sawing - undesirable residue - as well as for the sanitary sewage post treatment...|$|E

The purpose of this thesis work is to understand the AM process starting from powders in <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>mean,</b> usually <b>a</b> gel (in this case powders were of a material similar to polypropylene) and then illustrate the buckling behaviour of a honeycomb core panel produced with this technique (with particular focus {{to the definition of}} a model which can be used in general, also with different base materials). Starting from the properties of base material (powder), the behaviour of the material deposed by AM was studied, with an initial hypothesis of material isotropy, later confirmed with the calculation of elastic properties. Afterwards, since the base material is similar to polypropylene, it was defined an elastic-plastic law to describe the non-linear behaviour of the material, based on data given by the producer and on similar curves found in literature. Those assumptions were verified with traction tests on specimens produced by AM, and therefore the model was validated. With the same microstructural model the compression behaviour of the material was estimated using a curve comparable to the traction one (with estimated values of base material properties derived from compression and bending data given by the producer) : this material model was used for the buckling study of a honeycomb core panel in transverse compression...|$|R
