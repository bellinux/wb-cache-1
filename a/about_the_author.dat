25|$|Emperor Ichijō's court, {{dominated}} by the powerful Fujiwara clan, was the seat of two rival imperial empresses, Teishi and Shōshi, each with ladies-in-waiting who were proficient writers producing works honoring their mistresses and the Fujiwara clan. The three most noteworthy Heian era diaries in the genre of Nikki Bungaku– Murasaki's Murasaki Shikibu nikki, Sei Shōnagon's The Pillow Book and Izumi Shikibu's (Izumi Shikibu Nikki)– came from the empresses's courts. Murasaki's diary covers a discrete period, most likely from 1008 to 1010. Only short and fragmentary pieces of the diary survive and its importance lies, in part, in the revelations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> about whom most of the known biographical facts come from it and from her c.1014 short poetry collection, the Murasaki Shikibu shū (or Poetic Memoirs).|$|E

25|$|The {{value of}} Riis's {{autobiography}} {{lies in the}} description of his origins as a social reformer. His early experiences in Ribe gave Riis a yardstick with which to measure tenement dwellers’ quality of life. The account of the development of his powers of observation through his experiences as a poor immigrant lent authenticity to his news articles and larger works. Its themes about self-sufficiency, perseverance, and material success are prime examples of an archetype that successful Europeans like Riis used to demonstrate the exceptional opportunities that seem to exist only in the United States. In spite of its triumphalist outlook, The Making of an American remains useful as a source for students of immigration history and sociology who want to learn more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of How The Other Half Lives and the social reform movement that he helped to define.|$|E

As the city is heavily associated with Austen, the company took advantage of Becoming Janes release in order to celebrate the author and her writings. In late September 2007, Bath launched the seventh Jane Austen festival, which included a parade of people in Regency costumes, readings, tours, and discussions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>author.</b> In addition, the city offered events such as Tea with Mr. Darcy to mark the release of the Becoming Jane DVD.|$|E

2500|$|The author names {{himself in}} the text as [...] "John", but his precise {{identity}} remains a point of academic debate.

Modern scholarship generally takes a different view, and many consider that nothing can be known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> except that he was a Christian prophet. Some modern scholars characterise Revelation's author as a putative figure whom they call [...] "John of Patmos". The bulk of traditional sources date the book to the reign of the emperor Domitian (AD 81–96), and the evidence tends to confirm this.|$|E
