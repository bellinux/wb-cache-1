25|$|St. Gregory VII having, indeed, {{abridged}} {{the order}} of prayers, and having simplified the Liturgy as performed at the Roman Court, this <b>abridgment</b> received the name of Breviary, which was suitable, since, according to the etymology of the word, it was an <b>abridgment.</b> The name has been extended to books which contain in one volume, {{or at least in}} one work, liturgical books of different kinds, such as the Psalter, the Antiphonary, the Responsoriary, the Lectionary, etc. In this connection it may be pointed out that in this sense the word, as it is used nowadays, is illogical; it should be named a Plenarium rather than a Breviarium, since, liturgically speaking, the word Plenarium exactly designates such books as contain several different compilations united under one cover. This is pointed out, however, simply to make still clearer the meaning and origin of the word; and section V will furnish a more detailed explanation of the formation of the Breviary.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these concerns, in several 20th-century versions of the Bible, including two major committee translations, the chapter and verse numbers were moved to the margins, but they remained the organizing feature of the text.

25|$|In the 15th and 25th Anniversary Editions of The Princess Bride, Goldman {{claimed that}} he wanted to adapt Morgenstern's sequel, Buttercup's Baby, but was unable to do so because Morgenstern's estate wanted Stephen King to do the <b>abridgment</b> instead.

25|$|According to the text, Moroni {{then made}} an <b>abridgment</b> (called the Book of Ether) {{of a record}} from a {{previous}} people called the Jaredites.

25|$|Boardman {{became a}} member of the State House of Representatives for the period 1803–05 and again in 1816, before {{becoming}} a member of the State's upper house between 1817–1819, and a member of the State Senate between 1819–1821. On March 4, 1821, he was elected to the US Senate while living in Litchfield, Connecticut. He is listed by the <b>Abridgment</b> of the Debates of Congress, from 1789 to 1856 as having been present at Senate proceedings on December 3, 1821, in Washington DC in the company of Class-3 Connecticut senator James Lanman.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the second}} longest play in the canon after Hamlet and is the longest of the First Folio, whose version of Hamlet is shorter than its Quarto counterpart. The play is often abridged; for example, certain {{peripheral}} characters are removed entirely. In such instances, extra lines are often invented or added from elsewhere in the sequence to establish the nature of characters' relationships. A further reason for <b>abridgment</b> is that Shakespeare assumed that his audiences would be familiar with his Henry VI plays and frequently made indirect references to events in them, such as Richard's murder of HenryVI or the defeat of Henry's queen, Margaret.|$|E
5000|$|Bills {{of rights}} {{are in their}} origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects, <b>abridgments</b> of {{prerogative}} in favor of privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince.
