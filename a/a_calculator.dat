5|$|To {{fund the}} new project, Roberts sold 15% of MITS to fellow Air Force officer, Lieutenant William Yates. He also got an {{investment}} from another Weapons Laboratory officer, Major Ed Laughlin. Several other officers and {{scientist at the}} lab were interested in this {{state of the art}} calculator kit and helped with the design. Forrest Mims wrote the assembly manual in return for <b>a</b> <b>calculator</b> kit.|$|E
5|$|Ed Roberts' {{interest}} in computers began {{in high school}} when he built a simple digital computer from relays. His first real experience with computers came while at Oklahoma State University where engineering students had free access to an IBM 1620 computer. Roberts' office at Weapons Laboratory had {{the state of the}} art Hewlett-Packard 9100A programmable calculator in 1968. In July 1970, a semiconductor company, Electronic Arrays, announced a set of six LSI ICs that would make a four-function calculator. Roberts was determined to design <b>a</b> <b>calculator</b> kit.|$|E
5|$|From 1971 Texas Instruments {{had been}} making {{available}} the building block for a simple calculator on a single chip and the TMS0803 chipset appeared {{in a number of}} Sinclair calculators. Clive Sinclair wanted to design <b>a</b> <b>calculator</b> to compete with the HP-35 using this series of chips. Despite scepticism about the feasibility of the project from Texas Instruments engineers, Nigel Searle was able to design algorithms that sacrificed some speed and accuracy in order to implement scientific functions on the TMS0805 variation.|$|E

50|$|While {{their core}} {{business}} is now mainly {{focused on the}} construction industry, CI has developed other specialty products such as <b>a</b> kitchen <b>calculator,</b> <b>a</b> Quilters' <b>calculator</b> (the FabriCalc), and the Time Master, as well as developing a series of cost-effective digital devices to measure blueprint takeoffs.|$|R
5|$|In the Dreamcast {{version of}} the game, a meter on the system's Visual Memory Unit shows how the player is doing with the female characters: it shows three blocks, which have hearts inside if the player is doing well. In the PlayStation Portable version, the player has access to a glossary, which {{explains}} various key words used in the game. In the Android version, the player gets points throughout the game, {{which can be used}} to unlock applications such as <b>a</b> <b>calculator,</b> a calendar, and mini-games.|$|E
5|$|Sheldon Plankton {{is married}} to a {{supercomputer}} named Karen Plankton, who is also his sidekick and best friend. Karen is Plankton's own invention, assembled from <b>a</b> <b>calculator</b> and a mass of wires. She was Plankton's first invention when he was in grade school, and they dated before he became evil. Her system is built into most of Plankton's machines (including the Chum Bucket itself) so that she and Plankton can communicate while the latter is on a mission. She is a Mark II Surplus UNIVAC with 256 gigabytes of random-access memory.|$|E
25|$|Personal {{computers}} {{often come}} with <b>a</b> <b>calculator</b> utility program that emulates the appearance {{and functions of}} <b>a</b> <b>calculator,</b> using the graphical user interface to portray <b>a</b> <b>calculator.</b> One such example is Windows Calculator. Most personal data assistants (PDAs) and smartphones also have such a feature.|$|E
5000|$|His inventions {{included}} several machines for mass-producing cigarettes, <b>a</b> clockwork <b>calculator,</b> <b>a</b> prototype {{for a movie}} camera, and the microdiorama.|$|R
50|$|For comparison, <b>a</b> {{handheld}} <b>calculator</b> performs {{relatively few}} FLOPS. A computer response time below 0.1 {{second in a}} calculation context is usually perceived as instantaneous by a human operator, so <b>a</b> simple <b>calculator</b> needs only about 10 FLOPS to be considered functional.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> Dashboard <b>Calculator</b> widget is {{included}} in all versions of macOS from Mac OS X Tiger onwards. It only has the basic mode of its desktop counterpart.

25|$|Since UTF-8 uses {{groups of}} six bits, it is {{sometimes}} useful to use octal notation which uses 3-bit groups. With <b>a</b> <b>calculator</b> which can convert between hexadecimal and octal it can be easier to manually create or interpret UTF-8 compared with using binary.|$|E
25|$|Aged 18, {{he got a}} job {{working out}} the payroll for 160 people: this was a task that took him only a few hours, without the need for <b>a</b> <b>calculator.</b> However, he became {{unemployed}} a decade later when his employers decided to computerize payroll accounting, and he was replaced by two full-time accountants and a computer.|$|E
25|$|The PERT {{is divided}} into three subsections: Mathematics, Reading and Writing. Each section {{consists}} of 25 operational items (basis of the studentâ€™s placement score) and 5 field test items used to continuously enhance the operational test bank. The test is untimed.

25|$|The {{microprocessor}} is {{a computer}} chip that processes instructions and communicates with outside devices, controlling most of the operations of a computer through the central processing unit on a single integrated circuit. The first commercially available microprocessor was a silicon-based chip, the Intel 4004, co-invented in 1971 by Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin, and Stanley Mazor for <b>a</b> <b>calculator</b> company named Busicom, and produced by Intel.|$|E
25|$|Although today many use calculators and {{computers}} instead of abaci to calculate, abaci still remain in common use in some countries. Merchants, traders and clerks {{in some parts}} of Eastern Europe, Russia, China and Africa use abaci, and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children. Some people who are unable to use <b>a</b> <b>calculator</b> because of visual impairment may use an abacus.|$|E
25|$|As ' goes to zero, versin(') is the {{difference}} between two nearly equal quantities, so a user of a trigonometric table for the cosine alone would need a very high accuracy to obtain the versine in order to avoid catastrophic cancellation, making separate tables for the latter convenient. Even with <b>a</b> <b>calculator</b> or computer, round-off errors make it advisable to use the sin2 formula for small'.|$|E

25|$|The AMC 8 is a 25 multiple-choice question, 40 minute {{test for}} middle schoolers {{designed}} to promote the development and enhancement of problem solving skills. No problems {{require the use of}} <b>a</b> <b>calculator,</b> and their use has been banned since 2008. Though the contest is typically held on a Thursday in November, in 2017 the AMC 8 will take place on Tuesday, November 14.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} difference between <b>a</b> <b>calculator</b> and computer is that a computer can be programmed {{in a way that}} allows the program to take different branches according to intermediate results, while calculators are pre-designed with specific functions (such as addition, multiplication, and logarithms) built in. The distinction is not clear-cut: some devices classed as programmable calculators have programming functions, sometimes with support for programming languages (such as RPL or TI-BASIC).|$|E
25|$|Retail : Multiple {{players in}} the retail market have offerings that enable {{consumers}} and businesses to calculate their carbon footprint, most commonly through a web-based interface including <b>a</b> <b>calculator</b> or questionnaire, and sell them offsets {{in the amount of}} that footprint. In addition many companies selling products and services, especially carbon-intensive ones such as airline travel, offer options to bundle a proportional offsetting amount of carbon credits with each transaction.|$|E
