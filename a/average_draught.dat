50|$|The {{working or}} draught type {{is the oldest}} of the Finnhorse types, and has had its own {{separate}} breeding section since the studbook was first split in 1924. Though {{the oldest of the}} Finnhorse types, it is rare today, with a total of only about 1,000 horses registered in the working section as of 2004. Draught-type Finnhorses are heavier and have a longer body than horses of the trotter and riding types. Though relatively small compared to other draught breeds, Finnhorses have considerable pulling power and can pull very heavy loads because of the breed's good pulling technique, with powerful take-off and a low, efficient body stature during the actual pulling. The Finnish Draught type is, pound for pound, stronger than many larger <b>draught</b> breeds. An <b>average</b> horse in <b>draught</b> work is capable of pulling about 80 percent of its own weight, while a Finnhorse can pull as much as 110 percent. In work horse competitions, the best Finnhorses can achieve even higher results, pulling more than 200 percent of their own body weight.|$|R
40|$|A plough {{which is}} small and light enough to be pulled by donkeys and small oxen is now being {{manufactured}} in Zimbabwe {{as a result of}} cooperation between the Silsoe Research Institute, UK and Bulawayo Steel Products Ltd in Zimbabwe. Research carried out by SRI and research partners. has found that the <b>average</b> size of <b>draught</b> animals available in sub-Saharan Africa bas significantly reduced. As a result of drought conditions to which small animals are better adapted, small oxen are the only available power source in many areas, whilst in others only donkeys are available. These smaller animals have difficulty in pulling traditional ploughs which are too large for them, and this is causing serious problems for some smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. The new plough requires up to 20 % less draught effort than traditional ploughs and is suitable for smaller animals. Following successful tests carried out by SRI and the Institute of Agricultural Engineering in Zimbabwe, the plough is becoming very popular, with five hundred sold {{in the last few months}} atone. There bas also been demand from Zambia, Botswana and other Southern African countries.

40|$|Displacement {{ventilation}} (DV) is an {{air distribution}} system, which supplies cool fresh air at floor level and extracts exhausted {{air at the}} ceiling. Air draught is reduced as heat sources (e. g. the train passengers) generate the vertical air movement in the cabin. This study provides contributions to the question whether a displacement ventilation system could complement or replace ordinary ventilation systems in rail cars without decrements of passengers’ well-being in terms of thermal comfort. The benefit could be a reduction of energy consumption. In a first experiment, new air outlets were installed in a rail car mock-up. Outlets were integrated into the existing air conditioning system and fixed under the passenger seats. They were suitable to supply a sufficient amount of cool air with low speed to the cabin. A sample of 80 subjects participated in the first study. In a simulated train ride of several hours, four experimental groups of 20 subjects each were exposed to a total temperature range of 20 °C to 27 °C. Objective and subjective data were gathered to evaluate individual levels of thermal comfort under the different physical conditions. Typical for DV we found a rather steep temperature gradient of 5 °C between 0. 1 m and 1. 3 m inside the cabin. The highest level of thermal comfort was found for an average ambient temperature of 24 °C. The rather low temperature in the legroom area {{did not have any}} negative effects on the comfort assessments. Comfort ratings of the subjects were generally predictable by the <b>average</b> temperature. Air <b>draught</b> and humidity played a minor role in our study. In a further experiment we will examine whether passengers’ assessments of thermal comfort can be further increased by a combination of displacement ventilation with microjet outlets in the cabin ceiling. The intention of the hybrid ventilation concept is to compensate for the warm air layer over the passengers’ heads with a fresh air flow from above...|$|R

50|$|A {{total of}} fifty-nine French sailing frigates were built between 1777 and 1790, with a {{standard}} design averaging a hull length of 135 ft and an <b>average</b> <b>draught</b> of 13 ft. The new frigates recorded sailing speeds of up to 14 kn, significantly faster than their predecessor vessels. They were able to fight with all their guns when the seas were so rough that comparable two-deckers had to close the gun-ports on their lower decks (see the Action of 13 January 1797, for an example when this was decisive). Like the larger 74 which was developed at the same time, the new frigates sailed well and were good fighting vessels due {{to a combination of}} long hulls and low upperworks compared to vessels of comparable size and firepower.|$|E

5000|$|The Beagles {{were not}} built to a {{standard}} design, with detailed design being left to the builders of individual ships in accordance with a loose specification. They were between 263 ft and 275 ft long between perpendiculars, with a beam of between 26 ft and 28 ft, with an <b>average</b> <b>draught</b> of 8 ft. It was expected that the ships would displace 850 LT but the builder's designs came out heavier, at about 945 LT normal and 1100 LT full load. Five Yarrow or White-Forster boilers fed direct-drive steam turbines driving three propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at [...] to give a speed of 27 kn. Three funnels were fitted. The Beagle-class was designed to carry a gun armament of five 12-pounder (76 mm) guns, with two mounted {{side by side on}} a raised platform on the ship's forecastle, two on the ship's beams, with the port gun mounted ahead of the starboard gun and one aft. While the ships were building, however, it was decided to replace the two forecastle guns by a single 4-inch (102 mm) gun, giving a gun armament of one BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VIII and three QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns) Torpedo armament consisted of two 21 in torpedo tubes, with one between the ship's funnels and the aft gun, and one right aft at the stern of the ship. These torpedoes had a range of 1000 yd at 50 kn or 12000 yd at 30 kn. Two spare torpedoes were carried.|$|E
40|$|Surface {{spreading}} of slurry {{leads to}} the inevitable emission of ammonia into the environment. Injection of slurry on grassland reduces these emissions. However, injection of slurry by deep working injector tines with goose foot chisels (wings) requires high draught forces. This type of injection has {{the risk of the}} crop dying back under dry soil conditions and is not possible on all soil types. In recent years, new slurry application techniques for grassland have been developed that achieve a large reduction in emissions of ammonia, but require less draught force. These techniques include cutting a shallow slit in the sward, into which slurry is applied, and application of the slurry in bands on the soil surface using a trailing foot implement. In a series of experiments on sandy loam, day and peat soils, the draught force requirement of single elements of five new slurry application techniques was investigated. The application techniques were a trailed sliding foot element and four shallow injection elements: angled-disc coulters (double-disc opener), thick-disc coulter, flat disc coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter and knife coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter. The application technique, working depth and soil conditions had a significant influence on the draught force. For a working depth of 5 cm, the required draught forces per shallow injector element, measured in this experiment, were in the range of 202 - 706 N for a double-disc opener, 284 - 991 N for a thick-disc coulter, 361 - 1260 N for a flat-disc coulter plus injector and 389 - 1358 N for a knife coulter plus injector. The lowest draught forces occurred on peat soil and the highest forces on dry clay. The trailing foot required an <b>average</b> <b>draught</b> force of 39 N. The draught force of the trailing foot did not relate to the soil conditions but an effect of the grass sward condition was suggested. (C) 1998 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|E
