5|$|Lung cancer, {{also known}} as lung carcinoma, is a {{malignant}} lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. This growth can spread beyond the lung {{by the process of}} metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known <b>as</b> <b>primary</b> lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{synthesized}} mRNA molecules {{are known}} <b>as</b> <b>primary</b> transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA {{that appears in}} the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA {{is associated with a}} variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and {{is the first step in}} post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete.|$|E

5|$|Stir frying: Stir frying is a Chinese cooking {{technique}} used for preparing {{food in a}} wok. It originates from the Han Dynasty, but did not fully develop until the Song Dynasty.

It {{was not until the}} Ming Dynasty that stir frying was popularized <b>as</b> <b>primary</b> cooking method of Chinese cuisine.

In 2007, J.K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore, a character in her Harry Potter series, was gay caused some controversy. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians <b>as</b> <b>primary</b> characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps telling of the evolution of public perception of same sex relationships that the relationships are unmentioned or only peripherally noted in reviews.|$|E

5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants <b>as</b> <b>primary</b> producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E

Metro's attempts to reduce crime, combined with how the station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind, has contributed to Metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the United States.
