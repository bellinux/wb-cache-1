40|$|The {{ability to}} collect weather data in near-real time has {{improved}} because of technological advances, enabling weather data users to obtain more weather data over wider areas, {{and in a}} more timely fashion. The number of near-real time climate networks is increasing as new applications are found for climate data. More than fifteen states in the United States have established <b>automated</b> <b>weather</b> station <b>networks.</b> This paper presents an overview of recent developments in <b>automated</b> <b>weather</b> data collection in the United States and gives {{a detailed description of}} the network in Nebraska. Near-real time weather data has many applications in agricultural decision making and in other economic sectors as well. Automated networks such as the one that exists in Nebraska can provide a practical, efficient, and cost-effective way of monitoring drought and assessing its impacts. In the United States, drought monitoring activities have been developed, at times, to support drought planning efforts by state government. Drought planning can be defined as actions taken by government, industry, individual citizens, and others in advance of drought for the purpose of mitigating some of the impacts associated with its occurrence. Planning for drought /i. e., risk management/ has been shown to be more effective than the traditional approach /i. e., crisis management/. Activities associated with drought planning include the development of a monitoring or early warning system, operational impact assessment programs, an institutional structure for coordinating governmental actions, appropriate drought assistance programs, financial resources to maintain operational programs and initiate research required to support drought assessment and response activities, and educational programs to promote the adoption of appropriate drought mitigation strategies. Drought plans must be integrated within national and state or provincial levels of government, including regional organizations and the private sector, where applicable; they must also be adaptable to many sociopolitical situations and levels of government. A ten-step planning process is proposed in this paper as a way of developing drought plans that are appropriate to many sociopolitical situations and levels of government.

Sensors deployed in the field with real-time monitoring networks such as the <b>Automated</b> <b>Weather</b> Data <b>Network</b> (AWDN) in Nebraska have not only become affordable but enhanced the monitoring capability of the network with valuable soil moisture data added to the existing stream of hourly and daily weather data for precipitation, air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, and soil temperature.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} soil moisture in quantifying drought {{through the development of}} a drought index using observed and modeled soil moisture. In Nebraska, rainfall is received primarily during the crop-growing season and the supply of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico determines if the impending crop year is either normal or anomalous and any deficit of rain leads to a lack of soil moisture storage. Using observed soil moisture from the <b>Automated</b> <b>Weather</b> Data <b>Network</b> (AWDN), the actual available water content for plants is calculated as the difference between observed or modeled soil moisture and wilting point, which is subsequently normalized with the site-specific, soil property–based, idealistic available water for plants that is calculated as the difference between field capacity and wilting point to derive the soil moisture index (SMI). This index is categorized into five classes from no drought to extreme drought to quantitatively assess drought in both space and time. Additionally, with the aid of an in-house hydrology model, soil moisture was simulated in order to compute model-based SMI and to compare the drought duration and severity for various sites. The results suggest that the soil moisture influence, a positive feedback process reported in many earlier studies, is unquestionably a quantitative indicator of drought.

Two different timeframes, 2005 - 2009 and 1985 - 2005, were used to include the newest network, CRN, in the analysis. Daily data were collected from each of these networks within the specified timeframe. Root mean square error (RMSE) between each candidate station and the surrounding stations within 500 kilometers were calculated and evaluated to determine spatial accuracy of the network. This study found that in the 5 year analysis, CRN versus AWDN, the two networks were not significantly different enough to denote the network with high spatial accuracy.

Historical weather data was used to develop a range of conditions experienced at the location. Sound weather data improves the dependability of management strategies. Data from weather stations on the <b>Automated</b> <b>Weather</b> Data <b>Network</b> and the Colorado AgMet network were evaluated based upon net radiation and dew point temperature observations expected in an irrigated agricultural setting. This weather data was used to create a relationship between the Penman-Montieth evapotranspiration (ET) and Hargreaves ET and the geographical location of the weather stations. The AquaCrop model was calibrated to data from the Carbon Sequestration Project at Mead, Nebraska. The model was able to accurately predict canopy cover (R 2 = 0. 96), biomass production (R 2 = 0. 98), and yields (R 2 = 0. 84, RMSE = 0. 72 Mg ha- 1). The model was also able to track ET throughout the growing season. The weather data and calibrated model were used to simulate the impact of irrigation timing throughout the growing season and to determine the timing of irrigation events that produced the highest marginal yields for different system capacities and initial soil water contents. Using the optimized irrigation distribution, a management strategy was developed to deficit irrigate corn based upon days after planting, initial soil water content, well-waterd ET, and a yield goal. The model predicted yields within 10 % of the yield goal for the majority of simulations. It translated geographically and expressed the ability to account for differences in system capacity.

However, the application of Penman-Monteith relies on many climate parameters such as relative humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and wind speed. Therefore, there exists a need to determine the parameters that are most sensitive and correlated with dependent variable (i. e., ET), to strengthen the knowledge base. However, the sensitivity of ET using Penman-Monteith is oftentimes estimated using meteorological data from climate stations. Such estimation of sensitivity may vary spatially and thus there exists a need to estimate sensitivity of ET spatially. Thus, in this paper, based on One-AT-A-Time (OAT) method, a spatial sensitivity tool that can geographically encompass all the best available climate datasets to produce ET and its sensitivity at different spatial scales is developed. The spatial tool is developed as a Python toolbox in ArcGIS using Python, an open source programming language, and the ArcPy site-package of ArcGIS. The developed spatial tool is demonstrated using the meteorological data from <b>Automated</b> <b>Weather</b> Data <b>Network</b> in Nebraska in 2010. To summarize the outcome of the sensitivity analysis using OAT method, sensitivity indices are developed for each raster cell. The demonstration of the tool shows that, among the considered parameters, the computed ET using Penman-Monteith is highly sensitive to solar radiation followed by temperature for the state of Nebraska, as depicted by the sensitivity index. The computed sensitivity index of wind speed and the relative humidity are not that significant compared to the sensitivity index of solar radiation and temperature...|$|R
