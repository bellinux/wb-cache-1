5|$|Unlike {{all other}} Panthera species, jaguars very rarely attack humans. However, jaguar attacks {{appear to be}} on the rise with {{increased}} human encroachment on their habitat and a decrease in prey populations. Sometimes jaguars in captivity attack zookeepers. In addition, it appears that attacks on humans had been more common in the past, at least after Conquistadors arrived in the Americas, {{to the extent that the}} jaguar had a fearsome reputation in the Americas, akin to the lion and tiger in the Old World. Nevertheless, even in those times, the jaguar's chief prey was the capybara, not the human, and Charles Darwin reported <b>a</b> <b>saying</b> of Native Americans that people would not have to fear the jaguar much, as long as capybaras were abundant.|$|E

In <b>a</b> <b>saying</b> thought to have been originally recorded in Q, the historical Jesus defended John shortly after John's death.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a small-scale, {{qualitative}} study on children 2 ̆ 7 s perspectives about their participation in decision-making processes regarding supervised contact. The paper begins with {{an overview of the}} study and a summary of findings in relation to four key research questions framed around the idea of children having <b>a</b> <b>say,</b> that is, children 2 ̆ 7 s views and perspectives of their participation in family law decision-making processes. These key questions include: What are children 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of having <b>a</b> <b>say?</b> What are children 2 ̆ 7 s understandings of having <b>a</b> <b>say?</b> Did children want <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in the decision for them to have supervised contact? How did having (or not having) <b>a</b> <b>say</b> feel? Discussion focuses on what importance children place on having <b>a</b> <b>say</b> in family law matters, a finding that is contrasted with children 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of marginalisation and exclusion from decision-making processes and of ambivalence and reluctance sometimes expressed around having <b>a</b> <b>say.</b> Children 2 ̆ 7 s idea of having <b>a</b> <b>say</b> as taking place in and through particular forms of dialogue and conversation, thus enabling the recognition of children and respect for what they have to say, are also explored. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of the study for professionals working in family la...|$|R

25|$|In July, 1945, {{when the}} world’s first atomic bomb was {{exploded}} in the Trinity Test, Oppenheimer was famously supposed to have quoted <b>a</b> <b>saying</b> from the Bhagavad-Gita: ‘Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.’ Oppenheimer had studied Sanskrit at Berkeley and it was Cherniss who introduced Oppenheimer to his Sanskrit teacher, Arthur W. Ryder. In 1945, after Hiroshima and Nagasaki when Oppenheimer {{had become one of}} the world’s most famous scientists, Cherniss saw him at Berkeley.|$|E
25|$|In 839 Jang proved {{instrumental}} in the seizure of power by Silla's King Sinmu following the overthrow of King Minae. Kim Ujing (later King Sinmu) approached Jang for help in taking the throne from the usurper who had killed Ujing‘s father. Jang is purported to have replied, “The ancients had <b>a</b> <b>saying,</b> ‘To see {{what is right and}} not to do it is want of courage.’ Though I am without ability, I shall follow your orders.” Thereupon Jang dispatched a force of 5000 men under the command of his closest companion and adviser Jeong Yeon (who had since also returned from Tang) in support of Sinmu's claim. The success of Sinmu's power grab won Jang Bogo the post of Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|Entirely {{different}} in origin {{is the first}} part of the second section, drawn undoubtedly from an old tannaitic source. Four sentences of this section are cited in the Talmud as being taken from a Baraita (B. B. 90b; Sanh. 76b; Shab. 88b), and one in the name of Abba Arika (Sanh. l.c.), who often quoted old sentences and maxims (Er. 54a). The composition shows that this section is not taken from the Talmud, for the division into 12 good and 12 bad classes of men is not found in the latter. The other half of this section, however, is probably a later interpolation, belonging properly to the third section. For this section begins with <b>a</b> <b>saying</b> of Ben Azzai concerning four things the contemplation of which would keep men from sin: hence the four classes of four things each that are enumerated in the second section.|$|E

25|$|In July 1994, the Jewish {{community}} center (AMIA) in Buenos Aires was bombed, killing 85 people and wounding more than 200. The community's archives were partially {{destroyed in the}} bombing. In 2005, an Argentine prosecutor said the AMIA bombing {{was carried out by}} a 21-year-old Lebanese suicide bomber who belonged to Hezbollah. In 2006, Argentine Justice indicted seven high-ranking former Iranian officials and one senior Hezbollah member, charged with participating in the planning and execution of the AMIA bombing. In 2007, Interpol ordered a red notice to capture the Iranian fugitives. Since then, the Argentine government has requested that Iran extradite the Iranian citizens accused for the attack in order to be judged by an Argentine or a foreign court, but Iran has refused. In response to the deadly attack, Miguel Ángel Pichetto, Senator from the Front for Victory (FpV) said that “real Argentines and Jewish Argentines” were killed, <b>a</b> <b>saying</b> reflecting the attitude towards Jews in the country in those days.|$|E
25|$|According to <b>a</b> <b>saying</b> {{attributed}} to Muhammad in the hadith Sahih Bukhari, women {{are allowed to}} go to mosques. However, as Islam spread, Muslim authorities stressed the fears of unchastity from interaction between sexes outside their home, including the mosque. By pre-modern period it was unusual for women to pray at a mosque. By the late 1960s, women in urban areas of the Middle East increasingly began praying in the mosque, but men and women generally worship separately. (Muslims explain this by citing the need to avoid distraction during prayer prostrations that raise the buttocks while the forehead touches the ground.) Separation between sexes ranges from men and women on opposite sides of an aisle, to men in front of women (as {{was the case in the}} time of Muhammad), to women in second-floor balconies or separate rooms accessible by a door for women only. Women in the state of ritual impurity, such as menstruation, are forbidden from entering the prayer hall of the mosque.|$|E

By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of days you didn’t worry about washing. You were wet through most of the time so it didn’t matter.|$|E
