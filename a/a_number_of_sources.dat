In 2006, he was banned from entering the UK; al-Awlaki repeatedly used a video link for public speeches from 2007 to 2009.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln's service {{during the}} Black Hawk War {{has been a}} source of {{discrepancies}} and questioning, with two major battle sites being affiliated with Lincoln in the aftermath of combat. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> assert that on June 26, 1832, the morning after the second battle, members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at Kellogg's Grove to help bury the dead. One of the soldiers in the company was Abraham Lincoln.

5|$|By May 29, {{four days}} before the opening of the convention, trainloads upon trainloads of delegates, lobbyists, reporters, and {{campaign}} followers had arrived at the Union and Dearborn railway stations in Chicago. Candidate supporters channeled through the Chicago streets with daily parades and rallies. Pre-convention possible outcomes of the voting were published by <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sources.</b> One, from the Albany Evening Journal, predicted Blaine with 277 votes, Grant with 317, Sherman with 106, and 49 for the other candidates. All of these predicted candidate vote totals were short of the 379 needed to win. Many in Chicago knew that a victor, most probably Grant, would only be determined if the unit rule, which postulated that all delegates from a particular state must vote for the candidate preferred by that state's delegation, was to be in effect. If that was not the case, then a long deadlock would result until one side succumbed to the other.|$|E

5|$|Gold {{seems to}} have been {{acquired}} from <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sources.</b> Gold probably came from Sasu (southern Sudan), as well as more nearby Ethiopian sources, though the latter isn't well documented for the north. A gold trade from the southern areas of Ethiopia such as the medieval province/kingdom of Innarya has been attested from the 6th century (i.e. from the writings of Cosmas Indicopleustes) and continued through James Bruce's day (18th century). Gold also came from more northerly sources such as Gojjam, Beja lands, and what is now Eritrea, though the latter two are less certain. However, a recent gold exploration assay in Eritrea has found significant gold deposits at Emba Derho, and deposits are also attested at Zara in central-western Eritrea.|$|E
5|$|The costumes used in {{the show}} drew {{inspiration}} from <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sources,</b> such as Japanese and Persian armour. Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the Inuit. Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled with string and latex resembling catgut. Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can distinguish the main characters. Björk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses are designed for easy removal. All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.|$|E

That year she was assigned as a depot ship for submarines at Kronstadt and later Helsinki. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have their ships interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. Petr Veliky reached Kronstadt in April in {{what became known as the}} 'Ice Voyage'. The ship was hulked on 21 May 1921 and used to store mines. She was renamed Blokshiv Nr. 1 on 4 December 1923 and forced aground in shallow water by autumn floods in September 1923. She was not refloated and repaired until 5 October 1927. On 1 January 1932 she was renamed to Blokshiv Nr. 4, and to BSh-3 on 16 May 1949, by which time she was being used as a barracks ship at Kronstadt. The ship was stricken on 18 April 1959 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E

5|$|NC1 was {{the first}} to be sentenced, on 28 February 1990, after {{pleading}} guilty to having sex with someone under the age of consent. He was given six months' custody in a detention centre, the maximum possible sentence for a youth charged with that offence. Kerry Carrington and Andrew Johnson, writing in The Australian Feminist Law Journal, said it was likely that prosecutors did not charge NC1 with rape, as a conviction on such a charge would have been unlikely {{due to a lack of}} evidence; Leigh's complaints about the incident as reported by witnesses were hearsay and therefore inadmissible in court. On 11 May the sentence was reduced on appeal to 100 hours' community service. In reducing his sentence the judge stated the evidence obliged him to find that the sex was consensual, and that it was better for NC1 to do something positive for the community rather than possibly being led further astray in custody. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> state the judge reached the conclusion that the sex had been consensual because of the inadequate way the evidence was presented to the court.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews Binaural Cue Coding (BCC). BCC is a lossy {{technique}} for either reducing either <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>source</b> signals or <b>a</b> multichannel audio signal to one audio channel plus side information. In {{the case when}} <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>source</b> signals (e. g. separately recorded instruments) are reduced to one audio channel plus side information, the BCC synthesis allows rendering <b>of</b> each <b>source</b> as if the separate source signals were given. The same side information supports different playback setups (e. g. binaural headphone playback, stereo loudspeaker playback, multi-channel loudspeaker playback). In the case when a stereo or multi-channel audio signal is reduced to one audio channel plus side information, the BCC synthesis renders a stereo or multi-channel audio signal with a spatial image similar to the original signal. The BCC representation of audio signals requires only the bitrate for one audio channel, which can be coded with conventional audio or speech coders, plus a few kb/s for the BCC side information. Existing mono broadcasting or communications systems can be upgraded with BCC for spatial audio by transmitting the BCC side information {{in addition to the}} existing mono audio transmission. 1...|$|R
