5|$|In February 1082, Dyrrhachium fell after a Venetian or Amalfian citizen {{opened the}} gates to the Normans. The Norman army {{proceeded}} to take most of northern Greece without facing much resistance. While Guiscard was in Kastoria, messengers arrived from Italy, bearing news that Apulia, Calabria, and Campania were in revolt. He <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV, {{was at the}} gates of Rome and besieging Pope Gregory VII, a Norman ally. Alexios had negotiated with Henry and given him 360,000 gold pieces in return for an alliance. Henry responded by invading Italy and attacking the Pope. Guiscard rushed to Italy, leaving Bohemond in command of the army in Greece.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Thorpe, Holmes {{and two of}} the latter's {{business}} acquaintances—John le Mesurier and George Deakin—appeared before magistrates at Minehead, Somerset, in a committal {{hearing to}} determine whether they should stand trial. The court heard evidence of a conspiracy from Scott, Newton and Bessell; it <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Bessell was being paid £50,000 by The Sunday Telegraph for his story. At the conclusion, the four defendants were committed for trial at the Old Bailey. This was set to begin on 30 April 1979, but when in March the government fell, and a general election was called for 3 May, the trial was postponed until 8 May.|$|E
5|$|Sercey's {{force had}} {{subsequently}} broken up as it proved {{too expensive to}} maintain as a cohesive force. By late 1798, Sercey was at anchor in Batavia with only two vessels, the 20-gun corvette Brûle-Gueule and the 40-gun frigate Preneuse, which had arrived in Batavia from a diplomatic mission to the Kingdom of Mysore {{in a state of}} near-mutiny; Captain Jean-Matthieu-Adrien Lhermitte had been forced to execute five men for disobedience en route. Sercey <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> two additional frigates, Forte and Prudente would not be joining him: his orders had been countermanded by Governor Malartic on Île de France and these frigates were now cruising independently against British trade in the Indian Ocean. Sercey decided to augment his forces by uniting them with the allied Spanish squadron at Manila in the Spanish Philippines, his frigates arriving on 16 October 1798, although the admiral remained at Surabaya. The Spanish squadron had been severely damaged in a typhoon of April 1797 and repairs had taken nearly two years: when British frigates raided Manila in January 1798 not one Spanish ship was in a condition to oppose them.|$|E
25|$|While {{investigating}} the Qunari plot, the Inquisitor <b>learns</b> <b>that</b> the elven gods, the Evanuris, were in truth extremely powerful mages from ancient times who became corrupt and arrogant in their power, and that Fen'Harel had led a rebellion against them. They <b>also</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> the Veil {{was created by}} Fen'Harel, and that his doing so caused the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. The Inquisitor can <b>also</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Solas is Fen'Harel, depending on how well they search.|$|R

25|$|The {{explorer}} William Cormack {{had founded}} the Beothuk Institute in 1827 to foster friendly {{dealings with the}} Beothuk and support their culture. His expeditions found Beothuk artifacts but he <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the group was dying out. Learning of Shanawdithit, in the winter 1828–1829, Cormack brought her to his center so he could learn from her. He drew funds from his institute {{to pay for her}} support.|$|E
25|$|The Italian Fleet {{was spotted}} by a Sunderland flying boat at 12:00, depriving Iachino of any {{advantage}} of surprise. The Italian Admiral <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Formidable was at sea, {{thanks to the}} decryption team aboard Vittorio Veneto. Nevertheless, after some discussion, the Italian headquarters {{decided to go ahead}} with the operation, to show the Germans their will to fight and confidence in the higher speed of their warships.|$|E

25|$|But Paley, {{according}} to CBS historian Robert Metz, <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Benny chafed under NBC's almost indifferent {{attitude toward the}} talent that attracted the listeners. NBC, {{under the leadership of}} David Sarnoff, seemed at the time to think that listeners were listening to NBC because of NBC itself. To Paley, {{according to}} Metz, that was foolish thinking at best: Paley believed listeners were listening because of the talent, not because of which platform hosted them. When Paley said as much to Benny, the comedian agreed. Because Paley took a personal interest in the Benny negotiations, as opposed to Sarnoff, who had never met his top-rated star, Benny was convinced to make the jump. He convinced a number of his fellow NBC performers (notably Burns and Allen, Edgar Bergen, Red Skelton and Kate Smith) to join him.|$|E
25|$|Two scandals {{were also}} hurting the department. The city {{was forced to}} pay $1.75 million to settle a lawsuit by {{the family of a}} {{transgender}} person after firefighters ridiculed the person rather than treating her after an automobile accident. The death led to allegations by D.C.'s large LGBT population that the department was plagued by widespread homophobia. As well, it came to light that D.C. fire department radio equipment did not work on the same frequencies as the Washington Metro, and for years firefighters' radios had not worked in subway tunnels. The public <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the fire department was encouraging wealthy, mostly white, citizens in upper Northwest to call the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad for emergency medical services instead of serving the area with its own ambulances (which took much longer to respond). Members of the D.C. City Council criticized this as giving wealthy residents better service than poor ones.|$|E
25|$|When European colonials {{entered a}} region, they {{invariably}} brought new resources and capital management. Different investment strategies were employed, which included focuses on health, infrastructure, or education. All colonial investments have had persistent effects on postcolonial societies, but {{certain types of}} spending {{have proven to be}} more beneficial than others. French economist Elise Huillery conducted research to determine specifically what types of public spending were associated with high levels of current development. Her findings were twofold. First, Huillery observes that the nature of colonial investments can directly influence current levels of performance. Increased spending in education lead to higher school attendance; additional doctors and medical facilities decreased preventable illnesses in children; and a colonial focus on infrastructure translated into more modernized infrastructure today. Adding to this, Huillery <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> early colonial investments instituted a pattern of continued spending that directly influenced {{the quality and quantity of}} public goods available today.|$|E

25|$|Investigators also ascertained Collins {{had either}} been acquainted {{with most of}} the victims, had {{currently}} or previously lived close to their place of residence, or had likely established possible prior contact prior to their murder. In the case of victims Mary Fleszar and Joan Schell, investigators were able to establish he had been a neighbor of both women, and {{that at the time of}} Fleszar's disappearance, Collins had actually worked in an office at the Eastern Michigan University located directly opposite the hallway from the office where Fleszar had herself worked. Through interviewing a recent girlfriend of Collins, investigators <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> she had lived in an apartment complex directly across the road from the home of victim Dawn Basom, and that, throughout their courtship, Collins had been a regular visitor to her apartment. As such, he may have become acquainted with Basom throughout the time he frequented his girlfriend.|$|E
25|$|Mosby's initial {{letter to}} his {{superior}} (Frederick W. Seward, son of {{the former secretary of}} state and who had been wounded by Mosby's ex-subordinate while defending his father from an assassination attempt on the night of President Lincoln's assassination) languished. However, Special Treasury Department Inspector DeB. Randolph Keim made a whirlwind inspection of Far East consulates and found many similar bookkeeping irregularities. Eventually, in March 1879, Mosby wrote to General Thomas C. H. Smith, a friend of President Hayes, about a similar embezzlement scheme operated by David B. Sickels (U.S. Consul at Bangkok) and his vice-consul Torrey (a Hong Kong native whose correspondence to the fired Loring Mosby accepted and read). Mosby <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Bailey had charged (and pocketed) $10,000 per year for shipments of opium to the United States from Macao, although Mosby proposed to issue the required certificate for the legal export for just $2.50.|$|E
25|$|In 1847, {{during a}} seven-month visit to England, he was {{appointed}} conductor at the London Drury Lane Theatre by its then-musical director, the popular French musician Louis Antoine Jullien. He was impressed with its quality when he first heard the orchestra perform at a promenade concert. In London he <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> he knew far more English than he had supposed, although still did not understand half of what was said in conversation. He began writing his Mémoires. During his stay in England, the February Revolution broke out in France. Berlioz arrived back in France in 1848, only to be informed {{that his father had}} died shortly after his return. He went back to his birthplace to mourn his father along with his sisters. Meanwhile, Harriet's health was declining due to alcohol abuse and she suffered a series of strokes that left her an invalid. Berlioz paid for four servants to look after her on a permanent basis and visited her almost daily. He began composition of his Te Deum.|$|E

25|$|In August 2002, the Cherokee Nation {{conducted}} a survey of 115,026 Cherokee citizens who live within the 14 counties of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. Their aim was to evaluate {{the status of the}} language. Of those surveyed, 91% reported that they at least heard the language being used in the public domain; 18% heard the language used in hospitals, 14% reported hearing it at church, 12% used/heard the language at home, 9% heard it in stores, 8% heard it at work, 7% heard it at school, 7% heard it on grounds, 6% heard it in courts, and 8% heard it in other settings. In the home, Cherokee was only used by 17% of survey respondents; the overwhelming majority spoke only English in the home setting. 18% of the surveyed persons spoke Cherokee as a first language, and 5% had learned Cherokee and English jointly as primary languages. At the beginning of the 20th century, 75% of Cherokee citizens are believed to have been raised bilingually in Cherokee and English. Today, only about 5% or less are raised in Cherokee-speaking homes. Many speakers, perhaps the majority, are over fifty years of age. Another 2002 survey indicated that the Cherokee language was very close to extinction, as few people younger than the grandparental generation were found who were fluent in the language. Usually, older adults are the final speakers of a language. If they do not pass it along to their descendants, the language will be lost. Thus, the 2002 estimate for the lifespan of the language was only about 30–40 years. The Cherokee language in North Carolina was found to be particularly imperiled, with perhaps fewer than 1,000 remaining speakers and elderly speakers dying off far more quickly than new speakers were emerging. From such surveys the Cherokee Nation <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> most of its members believed preservation of Cherokee culture and language for future generations is essential.|$|E
500|$|Leake's fleet {{arrived in}} late August at Bay Bulls. [...] From the {{inhabitants}} {{they learned that}} two French fishing ships were loading at Trepassey Bay, and that two French warships were at anchor near the French capital at Plaisance.

500|$|Moreover, he {{discovered}} that the fourth and eighth squares (from #1 in the top left corner then clockwise around the board) always contained cash and never a [...] "Whammy." [...] He <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> square #4 always contained the top dollar values and that, {{in the second round}}, contestants were awarded an additional spin if landing on those spots ($3,000, $4,000, or $5,000 in square #4, and $500, $750, or $1,000 in square #8). This proved crucial to Larson's theory, as he could retain control of the board in the second round as long as he wished if he kept following the patterns.|$|E
500|$|According to a 1987 {{interview}} with reporter Roger Starr of The New York Times, she learned much about pool through such activities but [...] "she <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that,</b> even in fun, pool stars {{did not like}} losing in public, especially not to children, and less, even, to girl children. She also discovered that young men, including her brothers, shared the feeling of shame over losing to girls. She recalls, 'Whenever my brother Paul, the youngest of my four brothers, beat me at pool on the table downstairs at home, he would run through the house shouting 'I won, I beat her'. I guess that was one reason I worked all the harder at my game.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{expedition}} {{then proceeded}} on to Logstown, a large Indian settlement a short {{way down the}} Ohio River. After parleying with the Indians, the Mingo [...] "Half King" [...] Tanacharison and three of his men agreed to accompany the British expedition {{to meet with the}} French. Washington <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> many of the Ohio tribes were as unhappy about the British plans for settling the area as they were of the French plans to fortify it. Leaving Logstown on November 30, they arrived at Fort Machault on December 4. The commander there, Captain Philippe-Thomas de Joncaire, directed Washington to his superior officer, stationed at Fort LeBoeuf, further north. [...] While dining with Joncaire, Washington learned of French intentions to [...] "take possession of the Ohio".|$|E
