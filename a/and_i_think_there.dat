500|$|Speaking to The Times {{about the}} ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the {{collaborative}} writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: [...] "Everybody on the show thinks they can put in good jokes, despite the fact that Ben Elton <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are already quite a few good ones in there to start with. It does usually end up funnier, but it's time to do something over which I have more control." [...] Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that: [...] "They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script...sometimes we would just say to them [...] "if you stood up and tried to act this script out, you would find out things about it." [...] Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.|$|E
500|$|... e.The immense {{scope of}} The Century caused {{headaches}} for those developing it. It survived three {{major changes in}} narrative approach, three different executive producers, and various attempts to axe the entire project. By the time it aired, {{all of the people}} interviewed for their anecdotes of World War I had died. Jennings, though, downplayed criticism of the program's rocky history. [...] "Name me a news organization that doesn't have some degree of turmoil on a major project," [...] he said. [...] "What people care about in The New York Times is what gets in the paper. It's the same with us. There {{are people out there who}} think their job is to set the bar for us, but the bar for me is set by the audience, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is a real hunger out there from everyone I encounter to relive and experience and learn from what's gone on over the last 100 years." ...|$|E
500|$|GoldenEye 007 {{introduced}} stealth elements {{not seen}} in previous first-person shooter games. Doak explained how this was implemented: [...] "Whenever you fired a gun, it had a radius test and alerted the non-player characters within that radius. If you fired the same gun again within {{a certain amount of}} time, it did a larger radius test <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was a third even larger radius after that. It meant if you found one guy and shot him in the head and then didn't fire again, the timer would reset". Windows throughout the game were programmed so that enemies cannot see through them while the player can. Though decidedly unrealistic, this was an intentional feature made to encourage the player to use windows to covertly spy on enemies. The game's multiplayer mode was added late in the development process; Martin Hollis described it as [...] "a complete afterthought". According to David Doak, the majority of the work on the multiplayer mode was done by Steve Ellis, who [...] "sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned GoldenEye into a multiplayer game." ...|$|E

500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1971 {{conference at}} Columbia University, Borges {{was asked about}} the story by a student from the {{creative}} writing program. He recalled, [...] "When the Germans were defeated I felt great joy and relief, {{but at the same time}} I thought of the German defeat as being somehow tragic, because here we have perhaps the most educated people in Europe, [...] who have a fine literature, a fine tradition of philosophy and poetry. Yet these people were bamboozled by a madman named Adolf Hitler, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is tragedy there." ...|$|E

Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable.|$|R
500|$|Speaking in the 1990s, Harrison {{said of the}} Bangladesh relief effort: [...] "Now it's all {{settled and}} the UN own the rights to it themselves, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> been about 45 million dollars made." [...] Sales of the DVD and CD of the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh {{continue}} to benefit the cause, {{now known as the}} George Harrison Fund for UNICEF.|$|R

I'm always working on music and if a second album came out then that would be a great thing to happen."

2500|$|The {{death penalty}} was a notable issue during the 1988 presidential election. It {{came up in}} the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, when Bernard Shaw, the {{moderator}} of the debate, asked Dukakis, [...] "Governor, if Kitty Dukakis [...] were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?" [...] Dukakis replied, [...] "No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime." [...] Bush was elected, and many, including Dukakis himself, cite the statement as {{the beginning of the end}} of his campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky {{supports}} the Tamils' {{right to self-determination}} in Tamil Eelam, their homeland in the North and East of Sri Lanka. In a February 2009 interview, {{he said of the}} Tamil Eelam struggle: [...] "Parts of Europe, for example, are moving towards more federal arrangements. In Spain, for example, Catalonia by now has a high degree of autonomy within the Spanish state. The Basque Country also has a high degree of autonomy. In England, Wales and Scotland in the United Kingdom are moving towards a form of autonomy and self-determination <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are similar developments throughout Europe. Though [...] they're mixed with a lot of pros and cons, but by and large I think it is a generally healthy development. I mean, the people have different interests, different cultural backgrounds, different concerns, and there should be special arrangements to allow them to pursue their special interests and concerns in harmony with others." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{newspaper}} highlighted {{four factors}} driving {{the opposition to}} the mosque: a dislike of immigrants, a fear that Christianity was losing its grip on a Bible Belt heartland, a [...] "swell of fear and hatred" [...] prompted by terrorist attacks, and the insecurity of the worst economic climate since the Great Depression. In past slumps, Chinese immigrants had been ostracized for being non-Christians, Catholics had been ostracized for being [...] "the wrong kind of Christians", and this time Muslims were suffering the brunt of prejudice. Rabbi Rami Shapiro noted that [...] "Muslims are in the way of God's plan" [...] for some anti-Muslim Christian Zionists, who believe that Muslims in Iran and Iraq will be forced out of their homes by Israeli expansion that will pave the way for the Second Coming of Jesus. Professor Ron Messier, who teaches Islamic studies and lives in Murfreesboro, commented: [...] "It's happened because this is an election year <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> were some political candidates who thought that, here in Middle Tennessee, {{a lot of people have}} very right leanings and they could gain some political leverage by promoting fear about people who have been here for 20 years or more without ever being an issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|Doc at the Radar Station (1980) helped {{establish}} Beefheart's late resurgence. Released by Virgin Records during the post-punk scene, {{the music was}} now accessible to a younger, more receptive audience. He was interviewed in a feature report on KABC-TV's Channel 7 Eyewitness News {{in which he was}} hailed as [...] "the father of the new wave. One of the most important American composers of the last fifty years, [...] a primitive genius"; Van Vliet said at this period, [...] "I'm doing a non-hypnotic music to break up the catatonic state... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is one right now." [...] Huey of Allmusic cited the Doc at the Radar Station as being [...] "...generally acclaimed as the strongest album of his comeback, and by some as his best since Trout Mask Replica", [...] "even if the Captain's voice isn't quite what it once was, Doc at the Radar Station is an excellent, focused consolidation of Beefheart's past and then-present". Van Vliet's biographer Mike Barnes speaks of [...] "revamping work built on skeletal ideas and fragments that would have mouldered away in the vaults had they not been exhumed and transformed into full-blown, totally convincing new material". During this period, Van Vliet made two appearances on David Letterman's late night television program on NBC, and also performed on Saturday Night Live.|$|E

2500|$|Asked by the Dallas Observer for {{his view}} of {{religion}} and spirituality, Lennon said,I'm not against religion, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it serves a purpose in our society {{and it can be}} helpful to certain groups of people.
