5|$|Ten Nights in a Bar Room is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from the novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There by Timothy Shay Arthur, the production focuses on Joe Morgan after {{he has become a}} hopeless drunkard. Often Morgan's young daughter, Mary, comes to beg her father to return home. One day, she appears during a fight between the two men and is fatally struck by a bottle thrown by the saloon-keeper. Before Mary dies she asks her father to promise to swear off alcohol and he accepts. He is reformed and becomes successful, while the saloon-keeper is killed in a fight in <b>an</b> <b>irony</b> of fate. The film was released on November 4, 1910 and met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|<b>An</b> <b>irony</b> {{was that}} 72 years earlier the Nez Perce had greeted in {{friendship}} the half-starved Lewis and Clark Expedition on Weippe Prairie. Clark, it was reputed, {{had a son}} with a Nez Perce wife and that son, now an elderly man, was with Joseph.|$|E

25|$|<b>An</b> <b>irony</b> to the XR-400 {{story is}} that Budd tried to sell the idea to Ford first. In 1961, Budd {{combined}} a 1957 Ford Thunderbird body with a 1961 Ford Falcon chassis to produce a sporty convertible. When Ford turned them down, Budd shifted focus to AMC. Ford went on to base the Mustang on the Falcon chassis.|$|E
25|$|In Menor's Cabin, a small museum {{near the}} south {{entrance}} of Grand Teton National Park and {{adjacent to the}} Chapel of the Transfiguration, {{is a picture of}} young Cliff Hansen and his mother, Sylvia, which was taken in the early 1920s. The photograph is posted under the cattle exhibit and is meant to demonstrate the hardiness of early Wyoming pioneers. This is a bit of <b>an</b> <b>irony</b> as in 1943 {{he was a member of}} an armed protest of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's designation of the land as Jackson Hole National Monument.|$|E
25|$|The LIRR {{and other}} railroads that {{became part of}} the system have always had freight service, though this has diminished. The process of {{shedding}} freight service accelerated with the acquisition of the railroad by New York State. In the 21st century, there has been some appreciation of the need for better railroad freight service in New York City and on Long Island. Both areas are primarily served by trucking for freight haulage, <b>an</b> <b>irony</b> in a region with the most extensive rail transit service in the Americas as well as the worst traffic conditions. Proposals for a Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel for freight have languished more than a century.|$|E

25|$|Capp portrayed {{himself in}} a cameo role in the Bob Hope film That Certain Feeling, for which he also {{provided}} promotional art. He was interviewed live on Person to Person on November 27, 1959, by host Charles Collingwood. He also appeared as himself on The Ed Sullivan Show, Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows, The Red Skelton Show, The Merv Griffin Show, The Mike Douglas Show, and guested on Ralph Edwards' This Is Your Life on February 12, 1961, with honoree Peter Palmer. Capp also freelanced very successfully as a magazine writer and newspaper columnist, {{in a wide variety}} of publications including Life, Show, Pageant, The Atlantic, Esquire, Coronet, and The Saturday Evening Post. Capp was impersonated by comedians Rich Little and David Frye. Although Capp's endorsement activities never rivaled Li'l Abner's or Fearless Fosdick's, he was a celebrity spokesman in print ads for Sheaffer Snorkel fountain pens (along with colleagues and close friends Milton Caniff and Walt Kelly), and—with <b>an</b> <b>irony</b> that would become apparent later—a brand of cigarettes, (Chesterfield).|$|E
500|$|The Industrial Records website {{explains}} that the musicians wanted to re-invent rock music, and that their uncensored records were about {{their relationship with the}} world. They go on to say that they wanted their music to be an awakening for listeners so that they would begin to think for themselves and question the world around them. [...] Industrial Records intended the term industrial to evoke the idea of music created for a new generation, with previous music being more agricultural: P-Orridge stated that [...] "there's <b>an</b> <b>irony</b> in the word 'industrial' because there's the music industry. And then there's the joke we often used to make in interviews about churning out our records like motorcars —that sense of industrial. And ... up till then the music had been kind of based on the blues and slavery, and we thought it was time to update it to at least Victorian times—you know, the Industrial Revolution".|$|E
500|$|... "I {{really had}} {{no option but to}} agree to do it, despite my {{reservations}} about working in television. Coming so quickly after my decision to stay on the radio, this was quite <b>an</b> <b>irony.</b> I was given one day of training... from one minute to zero, at which point you have to say goodbye. I did not find that easy at all... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would ask him a question, and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go. I would then thank him, turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised. Miraculously, {{for the rest of the}} tournament I always heard 'zero' in my ear at the moment I said goodbye... the whole experience served to confirm my belief that my decision to stick with Test Match Special was the right one." ...|$|E

500|$|Truss {{highlights}} the importance that Gibbons places on detachment as a necessary adjunct to effective writing: [...] "Like many a good doctor, {{she seems to have}} considered sympathy a peculiar and [...] redundant emotion, and a terrible waste of time." [...] This matter-of-fact quality in her prose might, according to Gibbons's Guardian obituarist Richard Boston, be a reaction against the turbulent and sometimes violent emotions that she witnessed within her own family who, she said, [...] "were all madly highly-sexed, like the Starkadders". It is, observed Neville, <b>an</b> <b>irony</b> that the overheated [...] melodrama [...] that Gibbons most disliked {{was at the heart of}} her one great [...] success; [...] Gibbons's writings on everyday life brought her restrained approval, but no noticeable literary recognition. Nevertheless, her straightforward, style, unadorned except in parody, is admired by Rachel Cooke, who praises her as [...] "a sworn enemy of the flatulent, the pompous and the excessively sentimental." [...] While short of sentimentality, Gibbons's writing, in prose or verse, did not lack sensitivity. She had what one analyst described as [...] "a rare ability to enter into the feelings of the uncommunicative and to bring to life the emotions of the unremarkable".|$|E
500|$|Australian activist Julian Assange—the {{founder of}} WikiLeaks—appeared as himself. Many of his lines {{were written by}} Australian author Kathy Lette, {{who is one of}} Assange's friends. According to Lette, [...] "Julian and The Simpsons {{producers}} asked me to rewrite his scene and dialogue. I guess they just wanted me to add a little Aussie irony to the script. Julian does not suffer from <b>an</b> <b>irony</b> deficiency! I used to write a sitcom for Columbia Pictures, the long-running series The Facts of Life, so the producers knew I could fire off a quip or two." [...] In 2010, Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant to extradite Assange from Britain to Sweden for questioning in relation to sexual assault allegations made against him there. Assange was arrested in England, before being freed on conditional bail until a decision would be made {{as to whether or not}} he should be extradited to Sweden. Assange recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in England. Jean, who directed Assange's performance from Los Angeles, only acquired a phone number to call and received no information about the whereabouts of the activist. According to Jean in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening had found out through a rumor that Assange wanted to appear on the show. Casting director Bonnie Pietila was therefore given the task to contact Assange and make sure the guest appearance could happen. The episode features no reference to Assange's legal situation at the time of his recording. Jean commented that he is [...] "a controversial figure, and there's a good reason he's controversial. There was discussion internally whether or not to have him on the show, but ultimately we went ahead and did it." [...] Groening has said in an interview that [...] "We [...] dare ourselves to do things and Julian Assange was a dare." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writer Jerry Izenberg once noted that, [...] "the Nation became Ali's {{family and}} Elijah Muhammad became his father.

2500|$|It is <b>an</b> <b>irony</b> that Semmelweis's critics {{considered}} themselves positivists.

[...] To them, [...] "Semmelweis seemed to be reverting to the speculative theories of earlier decades that were so repugnant to his positivist contemporaries".|$|E
2500|$|Many {{painters}} have emulated Sadequain {{openly and}} widely {{and even the}} copies fetch large sums for the copiers, <b>an</b> <b>irony</b> since Sadequain himself hardly ever sold his paintings in spite of offers from the royals and the common public. In a recent auction in a London auction house one of his painting was sold for $108,000. His masterpiece rendition of [...] "Sureh-e-Rehman" [...] has inspired many known painters of the modern era and it can even be found adorning the facades of many houses in Karachi in exacting resemblance of Sadequain's signature script.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{broadcast}} of the 2000 Sydney Olympics in September, the Whitlams' track, [...] "Sydney 2000 Olympic Theme", was played – it is a B-side from their 1995 single, [...] "I Make Hamburgers". The track was reworked as [...] "You Gotta Love This City" [...] on Love This City. Its choice for the Sydney Olympics is <b>an</b> <b>irony,</b> as the song's protagonist commits suicide by jumping in the Harbour {{at the end of}} the song, disgusted at the city's crass pursuit of money: It dawns on him / The horror / We got the Olympic Games.|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court {{decision}} in Gregg v. Georgia in 1976 once again {{allowed for the}} death penalty to be imposed. [...] (A Texas case was a companion case in the Gregg decision and was upheld by the Court; the Court stated that Texas' death penalty scheme could potentially result in fewer death penalty cases, <b>an</b> <b>irony</b> given that post-Gregg Texas has by far executed more inmates than any other state.) [...] However, the first execution in Texas after this decision would not take place until December 7, 1982 with that of Charles Brooks, Jr.. Brooks was also the first person to be judicially executed by lethal injection in the world, and the first African American to be executed in the United States since 1967.|$|E
2500|$|The {{enormity of}} the Holocaust has {{prompted}} much analysis. The Holocaust has been characterized as a project of industrial extermination. This led authors such as Enzo Traverso to argue in The Origins of Nazi Violence that Auschwitz was explicitly a product of Western civilization originating from medieval religious and racial persecution that brought together a [...] "particular kind of stigmatization...rethought {{in the light of}} colonial wars and genocides." [...] Beginning his book with a description of the guillotine, which according to him marks the entry of the Industrial Revolution into capital punishment, he writes: [...] "Through <b>an</b> <b>irony</b> of history, the theories of Frederick Taylor" [...] (taylorism) were applied by a totalitarian system to serve [...] "not production, but extermination." ...|$|E
2500|$|Appiah {{has been}} a critic of {{contemporary}} theories of Afrocentrism. In his essay [...] "Europe Upside Down: Fallacies of the New Afrocentrism," [...] Appiah argues that current Afrocentricism is striking for [...] "how thoroughly at home {{it is in the}} frameworks of nineteenth century European thought," [...] particularly as a mirror image to Eurocentric constructions of race and a preoccupation with the ancient world. Appiah also finds <b>an</b> <b>irony</b> in the conception that if the source of the West lies in ancient Egypt via Greece, then [...] "its legacy of ethnocentrism is presumably one of our moral liabilities." [...] Appiah's critique of contemporary Afrocentrism has been criticized by some of its leading proponents, such as Temple University African American Studies scholar and activist Molefi Asante, who has characterized Appiah's work as [...] "anti-African." ...|$|E
