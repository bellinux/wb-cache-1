5|$|In September, Salih entered Aleppo's citadel victoriously. Afterward, he had Mawsuf and the qāḍī Ibn Abi Usama executed. However, Salih {{released}} Thu'ban {{in return}} for financial compensation <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> city's dāʿī (chief Isma'ili propagandist) to depart safely. Salih also confiscated the estates of numerous upper class Aleppines.|$|E

Diane Sawyer's motion for summary judgment was granted and she was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|An {{affiliate}} of the MTV Network until then, Comedy Central decided, {{in part due}} to the success of South Park, to have its own independent sales department. By the end of 1998, Comedy Central had sold more than $150 million worth of merchandise for the show, including T-shirts and dolls. Over the next few years, Comedy Central's viewership spiked largely due to South Park, adding 3 million new subscribers {{in the first half of}} 1998 alone <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> network to sign international deals with networks in several countries.|$|E

5|$|Beyond the {{decorative}} {{features of the}} building, the 5th Avenue Theatre also contained notable technical features when originally built. An ascending orchestra pit and independent Wurlitzer organ platform allowed the musicians to be raised up to main stage height or to orchestra pit level from the basement below. The ventilation system had thermostatic controls throughout the building, <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> air to be 'washed' prior to its introduction into the venue at outlets under every third seat.|$|E

5|$|In 1932 {{the line}} to Upminster was {{electrified}} and new vehicles were purchased. After the District Railway became part of London Underground, similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935–40 New Works Programme fitted electro-pneumatic brakes and air-operated doors {{to most of the}} District line stock <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor cars were not suitable for conversion and so some trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957.|$|E

According to frontman Tobin Bawinkel, this familiarity allowed Rioux to encourage the band to advance musically and think differently. During January 2012, the band recorded the entire album at the Atlas Studios in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Nasser {{played a}} {{significant}} part in the strengthening of African solidarity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, although his continental leadership role had increasingly passed to Algeria since 1962. During this period, Nasser made Egypt a refuge for anti-colonial leaders from several African countries <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> broadcast of anti-colonial propaganda from Cairo. Beginning in 1958, Nasser had {{a key role in}} the discussions among African leaders that led to the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} to be a third-person shooter so that players can see the three characters change and evolve as it progresses, and that the perspective differentiates the game from others shooters in the market. The game was meant to feature narrative gameplay, in which the game was to be played without any cutscenes so that the entire story would be told through gameplay sequences only. However, the idea was downplayed as the development team realized that having cutscenes helps players to be more emotionally connected <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> team to create dramatic scripted sequences.|$|E
5|$|The tournaments {{were not}} without controversy. Players complained about Microsoft's {{tardiness}} in posting the official {{rules for the}} first playoff, and {{it was believed that}} the top posted score was not achievable by fair means. Officials, however, stated that the score was possible, <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> results to stand. In the second playoff, Microsoft initially named the runner up as the North American finalist, after disqualifying the winner for no publicly stated reason, but eventually had to send the second runner up to Tokyo when the first was unable to produce a passport in time.|$|E
5|$|This {{military}} operation {{had a major}} political role, since {{the leaders of the}} government, including King Vittorio Emanuele III and his family, and Prime Minister Badoglio, fled from Rome to Brindisi after the surrender. Brindisi at the time was controlled only by the Italian Army, but its quick occupation by British troops secured the safety of the Italian leaders <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> declaration of war by Italy against Germany.|$|E

5|$|After redevelopment, {{wind shear}} {{continued}} to be a problem, with convection located southwest of the center. Early on August17, a pulse in the monsoon increased thunderstorms <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> system to become better organized. The convection became more concentrated and the circulation less exposed. As a result, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vongfong early on August18, still in the central South China Sea. Around that time, the storm began moving more quickly to the northwest due to a developing ridge to its northeast. Although the JMA estimated peak 10minute sustained winds of only 75km/h (45mph), the JTWC assessed Vongfong as continuing to intensify to peak 1minute winds of 100km/h (65mph), early on August19. By that time, the storm was near Hainan, and at 1240UTC that day, Vongfong made landfall in southern China near Wuchuan, Guangdong. It quickly weakened over land, dissipating early on August20 to the west of Guilin.|$|E
5|$|Although Theophilos's {{principal}} commanders, Theophobos and the Domestic of the Schools Manuel, both advised for {{a surprise}} night attack, the Emperor sided with {{the opinion of the}} other officers and resolved to wait and launch his attack on the next day. The Byzantine army attacked at dawn, and initially made good progress: they drove back one wing of the opposite army, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the Arabs. Near noon, Theophilos resolved to reinforce the other wing, and detached 2,000 Byzantines and the Kurdish contingent to do so, abandoning his post and passing behind his own army's lines. At this point, however, Afshin launched his Turkish horse-archers in a ferocious counter-attack which stymied the Byzantine advance <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> Arab forces to regroup. The Byzantine troops then noticed the emperor's absence, and, thinking he had been killed, began to waver. This soon turned into a disorderly retreat; some men fled as far as Constantinople, bringing with them the rumour that the Emperor had been killed. Some units, however, were apparently able to retreat in good order and assemble at a place called Chiliokomon.|$|E
5|$|Although {{electoral fraud}} was common, {{it was not}} ignored by the Emperor, {{politicians}} or observers of the time. The problem was considered a major issue and {{attempts were made to}} correct abuses, with legislation (including the electoral reforms of 1855, 1875 and 1881) repeatedly being enacted to combat fraud. The 1881 reforms brought significant changes: they eliminated the two-stage electoral system, introduced direct and facultative voting, <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> votes of former slaves and enfranchised non-Catholics. Conversely, illiterate citizens were no longer allowed to vote. Participation in elections dropped from 13% to only 0.8% in 1886. In 1889, about 15% of the Brazilian population could read and write, so disenfranchising the illiterate does not solely explain the sudden fall in voting percentages. The discontinuation of mandatory voting and voter apathy may have been significant factors contributing to the {{reduction in the number of}} voters.|$|E
