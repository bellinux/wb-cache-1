5|$|Many of {{the larger}} lemur species consume leaves (folivory), {{particularly}} the indriids. However, some smaller lemurs such as sportive lemurs (genus Lepilemur) and woolly lemurs (genus <b>Avahi)</b> also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so. The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of {{the part of the}} leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.|$|E
25|$|The Bemaraha woolly lemur (<b>Avahi</b> cleesei), {{also known}} as Cleese's woolly lemur, is native to western Madagascar. The {{scientist}} who discovered the species named it after Cleese, mainly because of Cleese's fondness for lemurs and his efforts at protecting and preserving them. The species was first discovered in 1990 {{by a team of}} scientists from Zurich University led by Urs Thalmann, but was not formally described as a species until 11 November 2005.|$|E
25|$|On May 14, 2011, Plex {{announced}} {{support for}} Linux. Three Linux flavors were initially supported: Ubuntu 10.01, Slackware 13.1 used in unRAID NAS devices, and ReadyNAS (NAS from Netgear using Intel CPUs). It should also work for other GNU Linux distribution or versions, as the C++ code is highly portable {{and the only}} hard dependency is <b>Avahi</b> for Bonjour-based network discovery. The Linux version of Plex Media Server is reported to work on CPUs of any speed (except if the user wants transcoding) and the resident daemon only eats 16MB of RAM.|$|E
500|$|Like all {{sportive}} lemurs, {{they can}} easily be confused with woolly lemurs (genus <b>Avahi),</b> and sometimes with the much smaller dwarf lemurs (genus Cheirogaleus). [...] Unlike the woolly lemurs, sportive lemurs have prominent ears, and they lack the white patches usually found on the thighs of woolly lemurs. [...] All sportive lemurs have long legs compared to their arms and trunk and the face is covered with short hairs.|$|E
500|$|All four genera of sloth lemurs {{are known}} to be a sister taxon (close relatives) of family Indriidae, which {{includes}} the indri (Indri), sifakas (Propithecus), and woolly lemurs (<b>Avahi).</b> [...] This relationship is supported by data from morphological, developmental, and molecular research. [...] Another member of this clade (related group) is the family of monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae). [...] Dental features, such as the morphology of their molar teeth and the modified number of teeth in their toothcomb (a specialized grooming structure found in lemuriforms), have long suggested a relationship. [...] However, other anatomical and developmental traits suggested that monkey lemurs might be more closely related to family Lemuridae, which include five genera of lemur, including the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). [...] Molecular analysis has shown strong support for the former, placing the monkey lemurs in a clade with the sloth lemurs and indriids.|$|E
2500|$|A {{species of}} lemur, the Bemaraha woolly lemur (<b>Avahi</b> cleesei), {{has been named}} in his honour. John Cleese has {{mentioned}} this in television interviews. Also there is mention of this honour in [...] "New Scientist"—and John Cleese's response to the honour.|$|E
50|$|Because the <b>Avahi</b> as {{a species}} is highly {{selective}} in their folivorous diet, depending on plants with specific characteristics, {{it is hard to}} keep <b>Avahi</b> in captivity. Therefore, one of the primary and most general ways of conserving the species is to conserve the forests in which <b>Avahi</b> are currently found.|$|E
50|$|<b>Avahi</b> was {{originally}} developed under the freedesktop.org umbrella, but {{has now become}} a separate project. <b>Avahi,</b> however, makes use of freedesktop.org's D-Bus IPC layer.|$|E
5000|$|Peyrieras' woolly lemur or Peyrieras' <b>avahi</b> (<b>Avahi</b> peyrierasi) is {{a species}} of woolly lemur native to southeastern Madagascar. [...] It weighs about 1 kg.|$|E
50|$|The Sambirano woolly lemur (<b>Avahi</b> unicolor), {{also known}} as the Sambirano <b>avahi</b> or unicolor woolly lemur, is a species of woolly lemur native to western Madagascar.|$|E
50|$|<b>Avahi</b> also {{implements}} binary compatibility libraries that emulate Bonjour and {{the historical}} mDNS implementation Howl, so software made to use those implementations can also utilize <b>Avahi</b> through the emulation interfaces.|$|E
50|$|The western woolly lemur or western <b>avahi</b> (<b>Avahi</b> occidentalis) is {{a species}} of woolly lemur native to western Madagascar, where they live in dry {{deciduous}} forests. These nocturnal animals weigh 0.7-0.9 kg. It is a folivorous species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Avahi</b> {{provides}} {{a set of}} language bindings (Python, Mono, etc.) and ships with most Linux and BSD distributions. Because of its modularized architecture, major desktop components like GNOME's Virtual File System and the KDE input/output architecture already integrate <b>Avahi.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The North Island kaka (Nestor meridionalis septentrionalis), {{a nationally}} {{endangered}} bird from New Zealand, was named by Lorenz in 1896. The western <b>avahi</b> (<b>Avahi</b> occidentalis), a species he described in 1898, is {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "Lorenz von Liburnau’s woolly lemur".|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Architectural {{overview}} of the <b>Avahi</b> software framework ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Avahi</b> project {{started in}} 2004 because Apple's Zeroconf implementation, Bonjour, used the GPL-incompatible Apple Public Source License. In 2006 Apple relicensed parts of Bonjour under the Apache License. However, <b>Avahi</b> had already become {{the de facto}} {{standard}} implementation of mDNS/DNS-SD on free-software operating systems such as Linux.|$|E
50|$|<b>Avahi</b> is {{a system}} which enables {{programs}} to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network. For example, a user can plug their computer into a network and have <b>Avahi</b> automatically advertise the network services running on the machine which could enable access to files and printers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Avahi</b> {{contains}} an implementation of IPv4LL in the avahi-autoipd tool.|$|E
5000|$|The {{endangered}} Bemaraha woolly lemur (<b>Avahi</b> cleesei) {{is named}} after John Cleese.|$|E
50|$|<b>Avahi</b> meridionalis eats leaves (and buds) and, {{much more}} rarely, flowers and {{appears not to}} base food choice on abundance. <b>Avahi</b> meridionalis can eat adult leaves with higher content of easily soluble protein (than non-food leaves) and switch, as soon as possible, on young leaves, richer in crude protein, and poorer in acid {{detergent}} fiber and sugar. In Sainte Luce, A. meridionalis also ate leaves with condensed tannins, alkaloids, and intermediate concentrations of polyphenolics. Contrary to previous studies that considered <b>Avahi</b> spp. a specialist, A. meridionalis acted as leaf eating generalists with moderate selectivity, based on nutritional quality and tolerance of {{a wide array of}} plant secondary metabolites.|$|E
50|$|Also, <b>Avahi</b> (a free Zeroconf implementation) {{started as}} a fd.o project but has now moved elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|Ramanantsoavana's woolly lemur (<b>Avahi</b> ramanantsoavanai), {{also known}} as Ramanantsoavana's <b>avahi</b> or the Manombo woolly lemur, is a species of woolly lemur native to southeastern Madagascar. [...] It weighs about 1 kg. [...] It was {{originally}} considered a subspecies of the southern woolly lemur (A. meridionalis), A. m. ramanantsoavana, but was elevated to a separate species in 2006 based on molecular, phenotypic and morphological data.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Components of some Linux desktop environments {{which are}} daemons include D-Bus, NetworkManager (here called unetwork), PulseAudio (usound), and <b>Avahi.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most Linux {{distributions}} also incorporate and are configured to use zero configuration networking. By default, each computer’s <b>Avahi</b> daemon {{will respond}} to mDNS hostname.local queries, and most shell commands and application program calls that attempt to resolve such names are routed to that daemon by the default hosts: line in the Name Service Switch configuration file. It is also possible to configure the nss-mdns modules and <b>Avahi</b> to resolve hostnames with other pseudo-TLDs.|$|E
5000|$|The Betsileo woolly lemur or Betsileo <b>avahi</b> (<b>Avahi</b> betsileo) is {{a species}} of woolly lemur native to southeastern Madagascar, in the District of Fandriana. [...] It weighs about 1 kg. [...] The pelage differs {{significantly}} from other southeastern woolly lemurs {{in that it is}} primarily light reddish brown on most of the body and grey under the jaw and on the extremities. [...] The pelage is thicker on the head than other eastern woolly lemurs.|$|E
50|$|Avahi's {{performance}} {{resembles that}} of Bonjour, sometimes exceeding it; however <b>Avahi</b> can lose services when managing large numbers of requests simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Black lemur (Eulemur macaco), red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer), weasel {{sportive}} lemur (Lepilemur mustelinus), eastern woolly lemur (<b>Avahi</b> laniger), diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema).|$|E
50|$|The nocturnal lemurs that {{reside in}} the reserve include the Fat Tailed Dwarf Lemur (Cheirogaleus medius), Mouse Lemur and Southern Woolly Lemur (<b>Avahi</b> meridionalis).|$|E
5000|$|A new [...] backend in CUPS 1.4 {{provides}} Bonjour (DNS-SD) based printer discovery. In CUPS 1.6, Bonjour printer {{discovery and}} sharing using <b>Avahi</b> is also supported.|$|E
50|$|<b>Avahi</b> {{is a free}} zero-configuration {{networking}} (zeroconf) implementation, {{including a}} system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. It is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).|$|E
50|$|<b>Avahi</b> {{implements}} the Apple Zeroconf specification, mDNS, DNS-SD and RFC 3927/IPv4LL. Other implementations include Apple's Bonjour framework (the mDNSResponder {{component of}} which is licensed under the Apache License).|$|E
50|$|The woolly lemurs, {{also known}} as avahis or woolly indris, are nine species of strepsirrhine {{primates}} in the genus <b>Avahi.</b> Like all other lemurs, they live only {{on the island of}} Madagascar.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} woolly lemur (<b>Avahi</b> meridionalis), or southern <b>avahi,</b> {{has been}} recently {{recognized as a}} separate species of woolly lemur in 2006 by Zaramody et al. It is a nocturnal and pair-living species. Groups can range from 2 (the parental pair only) to 5 individuals (including the offspring of subsequent years). A study in Sainte Luce forest revealed home range varied from 2.2 to 3.5 ha and that males can have larger home range and cover longer daily distances than females (which can spend more time feeding), {{in agreement with the}} territory defence and mate guarding hypotheses.|$|E
50|$|The mDNS {{protocol}} {{is published}} as RFC 6762, uses IP multicast User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, and is {{implemented by the}} Apple Bonjour, Spotify Connect, Philips Hue, Google Chromecast and open source <b>Avahi</b> (software) software packages.|$|E
50|$|The name <b>Avahi</b> is the Malagasy native {{name and}} {{scientific}} Latin {{name of a}} genus of woolly lemur, a family of primates indigenous to Madagascar. Trent Lloyd found the name, liked it, and it stuck. The logo reflects this.|$|E
50|$|<b>Avahi</b> is a Zeroconf {{implementation}} for Linux and BSDs. It implements IPv4LL, mDNS and DNS-SD. It {{is part of}} most Linux distributions, and {{is installed}} by default on some. If run in conjunction with nss-mdns it also offers host name resolution.|$|E
