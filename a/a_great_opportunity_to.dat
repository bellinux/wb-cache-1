As a result of this pact, on 1 September, the Germans invaded Poland from the west.

25|$|Tennessee's {{inability}} {{to get into the}} end zone came to an end on just the third play of the third quarter, when George took a handoff from McNair and stormed through {{the middle of the field}} for a 68-yard touchdown run. Then after several punts, the Titans put together a 13-play, 73-yard drive, featuring a 26-yard completion from McNair to receiver Chris Sanders. With 12:57 left in the fourth quarter, Del Greco finished the drive with his third field goal, increasing the Tennessee lead to 16–9. Later in the quarter, the Colts had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> come back when wide receiver Terrence Wilkins returned a punt 87 yards to the Titans 3-yard line, but it was overruled by a replay challenge from coach Jeff Fisher. Fisher had to burn a timeout to get his challenge heard over the roaring crowd in the RCA Dome, but it paid off, as the replay showed Wilkins had stepped out of bounds at his own 33-yard line during the return.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, CBS asked Ball to take My Favorite Husband to {{television}} with co-star Richard Denning. She, however, saw {{a television show}} as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> work with Desi as it would keep them both in Hollywood, and perhaps save their shaky marriage. Lucy insisted that Desi play her husband, much {{to the dismay of}} CBS, which was reluctant because Arnaz was Cuban. Network executives believed that audiences would not believe the marriage between an all-American girl and a Latin man. To prove CBS wrong, the couple developed a vaudeville act, written by Carroll and Pugh, that they took on the road with Arnaz's orchestra. The act was a hit and convinced CBS executive Harry Ackerman that a Ball-Arnaz pairing would be a worthwhile venture. At the same time, rival networks NBC, ABC, and DuMont were showing interest in a Ball-Arnaz series, which Ackerman used to convince CBS to sign the duo.|$|E

Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music. If Presley could show the world that he was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record. He also realized that it would be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.|$|E

While the position offered no salary, it afforded Cope <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> collect fossils in the West and publish his finds. Cope's flair for dramatic writing suited Hayden, who needed to make a popular impression with the official survey reports. In June 1872 Cope set off on his first trip, intending to observe the Eocene bone beds of Wyoming for himself. This caused a rift between Cope, Hayden, and Leidy. It was Leidy who had enjoyed receiving many of the fossils from Hayden's collection until Cope joined the survey, and now Cope was hunting for fossils in Leidy's staked territory—at the same time Leidy was to be collecting.

The audience for the program was selected on a contest where fans over the age of 18 could send photos and explain why they were fans of Perry. The episode featuring Perry was recorded on July 22, 2009. For the recording, Perry was dressed in a pale pink chiffon evening gown, with flowers in her hair. She further said: [...] "Some people have an idea who I am, a little piece of the cake, but I get to show off really more. I have a larger-than-life personality and my clothes reflect that. For MTV Unplugged, I wanted to be a mixture of Stevie Nicks and a fairy!".|$|E

Carlo D'Este called Dempsey's comments [...] "excessively harsh" [...] but historians generally support them, suggesting that <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> swiftly capture Caen had been squandered by Bucknall.John Buckley wrote that Bucknall was not ready to support the attack once problems developed and that Erskine was not capable of mastering the situation. Lionel Ellis wrote that the result was [...] "disappointing" [...] but that the fighting power of the Panzer-Lehr Division and with the unexpected arrival of the 2nd Panzer Division, the 7th Armoured Division [...] "could hardly have achieved full success". Michael Reynolds wrote that the 2nd Panzer Division tanks were nowhere near Villers-Bocage. Hubert Meyer wrote that Operation Perch failed because the 50th Northumbrian Division and its armoured brigade could not overcome the Panzer-Lehr-Division, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division attack in the east of the bridgehead failed and because of the rapid counter-attack by advanced elements of the 2nd Panzer Division.|$|E

500|$|... "I See You" [...] {{was written}} by James Horner and Kuk Harrell and {{produced}} by Simon Franglen as the official theme song to James Cameron's 2009 film, Avatar. It {{is the second time}} that Horner and Franglen have collaborated on a theme song for a film directed by Cameron, the first being [...] "My Heart Will Go On", performed by Celine Dion and used for his 1997 film Titanic. In an interview with Rick Edwards for 4Music called Under the Skin of Leona Lewis, Lewis explained how she became involved with Avatar and recording the theme tune. The singer said that she had known about the project for some period of time as she is very interested in film in general, and that she was approached by Cameron to record Avatars official theme song. She continued to say that she was very excited about seeing the film, even before her involvement with the film came to be. Cameron invited Lewis to listen to what they had in mind for the song, and upon hearing it, she [...] "immediately wanted to be on board." [...] One of the reasons Lewis gave as to why she accepted the proposal was that a lot of her second studio album, Echo (2009), was inspired by various films, and she thought it would be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> appear on a soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson was {{the second}} woman, after Margaret Bondfield, to achieve {{a place in the}} British cabinet. As Minister of Education she saw as her main task the {{implementation}} of the 1944 Education Act passed by the wartime coalition. This Act provided universal free secondary education, and raised the minimum school leaving age from 14 to 15 with effect from 1947. All children would take an examination—the [...] "11-plus"—which would determine whether their secondary education would be in a grammar (academic), technical or [...] "modern" [...] school. Many in the Labour Party saw this tripartite arrangement as perpetuating elitism, and wanted a more radical scheme based on what later became known as the [...] "comprehensive" [...] system. This envisaged large schools under a single roof, each with a range of appropriate courses of study for different levels of ability, and flexible movement between courses as children's aptitudes changed. Wilkinson believed, however, that such a major reconstruction was unachievable at that time, and limited herself to more attainable reforms. Her cautious attitude disappointed and angered some of the Labour left wing and teacher' representatives, who considered that <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> incorporate socialist principles into education had been missed. Wilkinson, however, was persuaded to the view that selection at 11 would allow all those with higher IQs, irrespective of class background, to obtain a grammar school education.|$|E
