40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study was to {{discover}} the impacts on intercollegiate student-athletes subsequent to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>coaching</b> change.

This qualitative approach to data collection provided meaningful and rich information that has significant implications for athletic administrators, athletic support services, and college administrators...|$|R
