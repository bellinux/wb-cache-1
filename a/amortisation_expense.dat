500|$|The club {{returned}} to Serie A after gaining promotion in the 1999–2000 season, though after a closely contested relegation battle, they were relegated immediately {{back down the}} following season. They failed to gain promotion following this and slipped further down. The failed 2001–02 Serie B campaign was costly, the cost of production was €70,895,838, just about €10million fewer than in 2000–01 Serie A, heavily due to the high amortisation of the player asset (€33,437,075). However, value of production was just €21,183736 (excluding player profit) and the net loss was €28,856,093 that season. Net asset on 30 June 2002 was €2,166,997, already including about €20million recapitalisation. The club once quoted the law [...] "21 February 2003 No.27" [...] to lower the <b>amortisation</b> <b>expense</b> by extending the amortisation period beyond the contract length of players to 10-year (UEFA ruled the Italian special law was not lawful and all club should use IFRS standards, thus causing a re-capitalization crisis in 2006), which some players contract (with a total residual accounting value of €46,601,225) was amortise in special way for €4,660,123 only and the rest for €1,659,088 in 2002–03, however the cost of production was still exceed the value of production for €19,071,218 in 2002–03. By August 2004, Napoli was declared bankrupt with debts estimated up to €70million. To secure football in the city, film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis refounded the club under the name Napoli Soccer, as they {{were not allowed to}} use their old name. FIGC placed Napoli in Serie C1, where they missed out on promotion after losing 2–1 in play-offs to local rivals Avellino in 2004–05 Serie C1.|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of Australian equivalents of International Financial Reporting Standards (AIFRS) radically alters Australian accounting practices for intangible assets. Under AIFRS, goodwill <b>amortisation</b> <b>expense</b> {{is replaced by}} goodwill impairment loss based on frequent tests {{of the value of}} goodwill, and Australian firms are no longer permitted to recognise certain internally generated intangibles. This paper provides statistics regarding intangible asset reporting by 476 firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2002. We find significant diversity in reporting practices relating to both goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Accordingly, the new accounting rules will potentially reshape ASX-listed firms' financial statements by significant amounts...|$|E
5000|$|Previously, some {{of these}} clubs profited by cross-trading players using the {{football}} transfer market, wherein multiple players were exchanged between clubs, generally involving monetary consideration. [...] This practice typically resulted in short-term financial benefit for the clubs, {{but in the long}} run it increased expenditure through 'amortisation,' (the counterpart for tangible assets is depreciation) of players' financial value. In February 2003, a law was passed that allowed clubs to defer <b>amortisation</b> <b>expenses</b> (Italian Law 91/1981, Article 18B), and avoid recapitalisation through negative equity. Despite the law, many clubs continued to practice cross-trading in order to raise the short-term profit required to meet financial criteria for the 2003- 2004 season. The law was declared unconstitutional in 2005, which caused some clubs to recapitalize and remove their amortisation fund by 30 June 2007. As a result, the clubs had to overcome yet another capital shortfall, which later created controversy when re-evaluating their brand and mortgages to banks.|$|R

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, <b>amortisations</b> and exploration <b>expenses</b> {{for the period}} was A$2.8 billion, representing after tax profit of A$1.65 billion. On 22 August 2014 the company said its oil production was at its highest level in six years. For {{the first half of}} 2014, Santos recorded sales revenue of $1.8 billion, an increase of 20% on the comparable period the previous year. Sales volumes rose by 5% to 28.9 million barrels of oil equivalent. As a result of the company writing off its investment in a coal seam gas project in Indonesia, the 2014 first-half profit being down 24% at $206 million.In 2015, Santos's financial troubles became more evident as the share price crashed to one third of its value from the previous year. It hit a 12-year low and has stayed low since. This occurred because of mounting debt and an oil price slump. CEO David Knox was forced to leave, with chairman Peter Coates stepping into the role and leading a strategic review of the gas company. Options of partial asset sale, even takeovers, has been speculated including [...] "No options will be ruled out from consideration, but neither is any particular option a preferred course at this time," [...] Coates said in a statement.|$|R
