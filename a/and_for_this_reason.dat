Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false morel G.esculenta, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> it is usually not recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Like ale, aloviti men led hail-producing and {{thunderstorm}} clouds: {{when the}} skies darkened, {{such a man}} would fall into a trance, and his spirit would fly out of his body toward the clouds as if his spirit were an ala herself. There was, however, a significant difference– he never led the clouds over the fields of his own village; the damage was done to the neighboring villages. In this respect, aloviti men are equivalent to zduhaći. Besides leading clouds away, an aloviti man could also fight against ale to protect his village. Children, too, could be aloviti, and they fought ale using plough beams. In these fights they were helped by the Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian), <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> people would not hurt these snakes.|$|E

5|$|Reigomys primigenus is an extinct oryzomyine rodent {{known from}} Pleistocene {{deposits}} in Tarija Department, southeastern Bolivia. It is known {{from a number}} of isolated jaws and molars which show that its molars were almost identical to those of the living Lundomys. On the other hand, the animal possesses a number of derived traits of the palate which document a closer relationship to living Holochilus, the genus of South American marsh rats, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> it was placed in the genus Holochilus when it was first described in 1996. The subsequent discoveries of Noronhomys and Carletonomys, which may be more closely related to extant Holochilus than H.primigenus is, have cast its placement in Holochilus into doubt, and it was ultimately made the type species of a separate genus, Reigomys.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Zobel network filters {{is that they}} have a constant resistance image impedance <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> are also known as constant resistance networks. Clearly, the Zobel network filter does not have a problem matching to its terminations and this is its main advantage. However, other filter types have steeper transfer functions and sharper cut-offs. In filtering applications, the main role of Zobel networks is as equalisation filters. Zobel networks are in a different group from other image filters. The constant resistance means that when used in combination with other image filter sections the same problem of matching arises as with end terminations. Zobel networks also suffer the disadvantage of using far more components than other equivalent image sections.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of species are surface feeders, obtaining food {{that has been}} pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. Among the surface feeders some, principally the gadfly petrels, can obtain food by dipping from flight, {{while most of the}} rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface feeders are dependent on their prey being close to the surface, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of seabirds, including wedge-tailed shearwaters, and dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E

5|$|African {{tribes in}} several {{countries}} have termites as totems, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates. Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, sinusitis, tonsillitis and whooping cough. In Nigeria, Macrotermes nigeriensis is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women. In Southeast Asia, termites are used in ritual practices. In Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace. Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits, believing a local guardian dwells within the mound; {{this is known as}} Keramat and Datok Kong. In urban areas, local residents construct red-painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned, where they pray for good health, protection and luck.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{developed}} senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.|$|E
5|$|Gray was {{not chosen}} for camouflage, however, it did, at times, provide {{enough of a}} mask along tree lines during battle; keeping the line of Infantry hidden long enough to strike effectively. At {{the time of the}} American Civil War, the {{usefulness}} of camouflage was not generally recognized. Gray was chosen for Confederate uniforms because gray dye could be made relatively cheaply and it was the standard uniform color of the various State Militias. The gray uniforms worn by early State volunteers was normally a shade of cadet gray, which is not suitable for combat wear, as it gives away the position of the individual easily from its bright blue-gray tones, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> it was preserved by some men for dress-parade functions. The gray mentioned is dull toned, often varying in color depending on the region and time during the conflict, resulting in a uniform that could blend in with the tree lines, or hide the men in the field wearing them.|$|E

5|$|There are {{numerous}} forms in North America {{that tend to}} intergrade with A.pantherina. In 2005, mycologist Rod Tulloss described Amanita aprica, a species that has been confused with A.gemmata {{several times in the}} past. According to mycologists Pierre Neville and Serge Poumarat, the Mediterranean species A.amici (synonymous with A.gemmata f. amici) is similar in appearance to A.gemmata but is larger. According to Tulloss however, their measurements of the cap and stem dimensions of A.amici fell within the range expected for A.gemmata, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason,</b> the two taxa should be considered conspecific. Neville and Poumarat suggest that the name A.gemmata still persists for Mediterranean collections because of its frequent historical misapplication to the native Italian species A.gioiosa, which had not been described as a distinct species until 2004. A.orientigemmata, a mushroom ranging from Japan to China, is a lookalike, but has clamps, unlike A.gemmata. Other differences between the two species include the slightly smaller spores of A.orientigemmata, and differences in the microstructure of the cap warts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E
5|$|In June 1399, Louis, Duke of Orléans, {{gained control}} of the court of the insane Charles VI of France. The policy of {{rapprochement}} with the English crown did not suit Louis's political ambitions, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> he found it opportune to allow Henry to leave for England. With {{a small group of}} followers, Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399. Men {{from all over the country}} soon rallied around the duke. Meeting with Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, who had his own misgivings about the king, Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony. Percy took him at his word and declined to interfere. The king had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland, so Henry experienced little resistance as he moved south. Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, who was acting as Keeper of the Realm, had little choice but to side with Bolingbroke. Meanwhile, Richard was delayed in his return from Ireland and did not land in Wales until 24 July. He made his way to Conwy, where on 12 August he met with the Earl of Northumberland for negotiations. On 19 August, Richard II surrendered to Henry at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. Both men then returned to London, the indignant king riding all the way behind Henry. On arrival, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 1 September.|$|E
