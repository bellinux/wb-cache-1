5|$|The {{majority}} of insects hatch from eggs. The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell (chorion) {{that consists of}} maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the <b>amnion</b> and the serosa. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach Blaptica dubia, as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous. The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, {{such as those in}} the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera, are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive. Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Insects may be univoltine, bivoltine or multivoltine, i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year.|$|E
25|$|A feline litter usually {{consists}} of two to five kittens born after a gestation lasting between 64 and 67 days, with an average length of 66 days. Kittens emerge in a sac called the <b>amnion,</b> which is bitten off and eaten by the mother cat.|$|E
25|$|Most {{reptiles}} lay amniotic eggs {{covered with}} leathery or calcareous shells. An <b>amnion,</b> chorion, and allantois are present during embryonic life. The eggshell (1) protects the crocodile embryo (11) and keeps it from drying out, {{but it is}} flexible to allow gas exchange. The chorion (6) aids in gas exchange between the {{inside and outside of}} the egg. It allows carbon dioxide to exit the egg and oxygen gas to enter the egg. The albumin (9) further protects the embryo and serves as a reservoir for water and protein. The allantois (8) is a sac that collects the metabolic waste produced by the embryo. The amniotic sac (10) contains amniotic fluid (12) which protects and cushions the embryo. The <b>amnion</b> (5) aids in osmoregulation and serves as a saltwater reservoir. The yolk sac (2) surrounding the yolk (3) contains protein and fat rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo via vessels (4) that allow the embryo to grow and metabolize. The air space (7) provides the embryo with oxygen while it is hatching. This ensures that the embryo will not suffocate while it is hatching. There are no larval stages of development. Viviparity and ovoviviparity have evolved in many extinct clades of reptiles and in squamates. In the latter group, many species, including all boas and most vipers, utilize this mode of reproduction. The degree of viviparity varies; some species simply retain the eggs until just before hatching, others provide maternal nourishment to supplement the yolk, and yet others lack any yolk and provide all nutrients via a structure similar to the mammalian placenta. The earliest documented case of viviparity in reptiles is the Early Permian mesosaurs, although some individuals or taxa in that clade may also have been oviparous because a putative isolated egg has also been found. Several groups of Mesozoic marine reptiles also exhibited viviparity, such as mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and Sauropterygia, a group that include pachypleurosaurs and Plesiosauria.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{surgical}} procedures {{have been developed}} to create a neovagina, as none of them is ideal. [...] Surgical intervention should be considered only after non-surgical pressure dilation methods have failed to produce a satisfactory result. [...] Neovaginoplasty can be performed using skin grafts, a segment of bowel, ileum, peritoneum, , buccal mucosa, <b>amnion,</b> or dura mater. [...] Success of such methods should be determined by sexual function, and not by vaginal length alone, as has been done in the past. [...] Ileal or cecal segments may be problematic because of a shorter mesentery, which may produce tension on the neovagina, leading to stenosis. [...] The sigmoid neovagina is thought to be self-lubricating, without the excess mucus production associated with segments of small bowel. [...] Vaginoplasty may create scarring at the introitus (the vaginal opening), requiring additional surgery to correct. [...] Vaginal dilators are required postoperatively to prevent vaginal stenosis from scarring. [...] Other complications include bladder and bowel injuries. [...] Yearly exams are required, as neovaginoplasty carries a risk of carcinoma, although carcinoma of the neovagina is uncommon. [...] Neither neovaginoplasty nor vaginal dilation should be performed before puberty.|$|E

60|$|Section 29. The {{nature of}} the <b>amnion</b> will be {{understood}} by following Figures 4b, 5, and 6 on Sheet 23. The three embryonic layers are indicated by broken lines, dots, and black lines, {{just as they are}} in the frog diagrams. Not only is the embryo slowly pinched off from the yolk sac (y.s.), but, as the yolk is absorbed beneath it, and it grows in size, it sinks into the space thus made, the extra-embryonic somatopleur and epiblast rise up round it as two folds, which are seen closing in 5, and closed in 6, over the dorsal side of the young chick. In this way a cavity, a., lined by epiblast, and called the amniotic cavity, is formed. Dorsal to this, in 6, comes a space lined by somatic mesoblast, and continuous with p.p., the pleuro-peritoneal cavity, or body cavity of the embryo. Outside this, again, is a layer, of somatopleur internally and epiblast externally, the false <b>amnion</b> (f.a.), which is continuous with the serous membrane (s.m.) enclosing the rest of the egg. The student should, carefully copy these diagrams, with coloured pencils or inks for the different layers, and should compare them with the more realistic renderings of Figures 2, 5, and 8, Sheet 24.|$|E

6000|$|The phylum of the Vertebrata is {{the most}} {{interesting}} of all, and is admirably discussed by Professor Haeckel. I can note only a few points which {{seem to me to}} be open to discussion. The Monorhina, having been developed out of the Leptocardia, gave rise, according to Professor Haeckel, to a shark-like form, which was the common stock of all the Amphirhina. From this [...] "Protamphirhine" [...] were developed, in divergent lines, the true Sharks, Rays, and Chimaerae; the Ganoids, and the Dipneusta. The Teleostei are modified Ganoidei. The Dipneusta gave rise to the Amphibia, which are the root of all other Vertebrata, inasmuch as out of them were developed the first Vertebrata provided with an <b>amnion,</b> or the Protamniota. The Protamniota split up into two stems, one that of the Mammalia, the other common to Reptilia and Aves.|$|E

60|$|Laboratory work in {{this portion}} of the science is not usually {{undertaken}} by elementary students of biology, but the reader will probably find it helpful, in the realization of the facts given in this book, to look out for frog spawn, in February and March, and to catch and examine tadpoles of various sizes. A small dissecting dish may be made by pouring melted paraffin wax into one of those shallow china pots chemists use for cold-cream, and tadpoles may be pinned out with entemologists' pins and dissected with needles. But this is a work of supererogation. Partially incubated hen's eggs may be obtained at a small cost almost anywhere, and the later stages profitably examined and dissected under warm water. For a clear understanding of the allantois and <b>amnion,</b> this last is almost indispensable. A few microscopic slides of sections of embryonic chicks should also be compared with our rough diagrams.|$|E
60|$|At any rate, the {{subsequent}} development goes far to justify such a view. The inner cells split into epi-, meso-, and hypo-blast, like the blastoderm in the fowl; {{there is a}} primitive streak and no blastopore; an <b>amnion</b> arises; the yolk sac, small and full of serous fluid, is cut off just as the enormous yolk of the fowl is cut off; and an allantois arises in the same way. There {{is no need to}} give special diagrams-- Figures 3, 4b, 5, and 6 of the fowl will do in all respects, except proportion, {{for the development of the}} rabbit. The differences are such as we may account for, not on the supposition that the rabbit's ovum never had any yolk, but that an abundant yolk has been withdrawn from it. The nutrition of the embryo by yolk has been superseded by some better method. The supposition that the rabbit is descended from ancestors which, like the birds and reptiles, laid eggs with huge quantities of yolk, meets every circumstance of the case.|$|E
60|$|Section 28. Another {{striking}} contrast, due to, or connected with, this {{plethora of}} yolk, is the differentiation of a yolk sac (= umbilical vesicle) {{and the development}} of two new structures, the <b>amnion</b> and allantois, in the fowl. If the student will compare Figure 10 of the frog, he will see that the developing tadpole encloses in its abdomen all the yolk provided for it. This is a physical impossibility in the fowl. In the fowl (Figure 2, Sheet 24) the enormous yolk (Y.) lies outside of the embryo, and, as the cells of the germinal area grow slowly over it, umbilical bloodvessels are developed to absorb and carry the material to the embryo. In the case of an embryo sinking in upon, as it absorbs, this mass of nutritive material, a necessity for some respiratory structure is evident. From the hinder end of the fowl's intestine, in a position corresponding to the so-called, urinary bladder of the frog, a solid outgrowth, the allantois, which speedily becomes hollow, appears. Early stages are shown in Figures 1 and 2, Sheet 24 (al.); while the same thing is shown more diagrammatically on Sheet 23, Figure 6 (all.). This becomes at last a great hollow sac, which is applied closely to the porous shell, and the extent of which will be appreciated by looking at Figure 5, Sheet 24, where the allantois is shaded. Allantoic bloodvessels ramify thickly over its walls, and aeration occurs through the permeable shell.|$|E
