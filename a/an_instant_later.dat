2500|$|At {{this time}} Brahms also chose {{to change his}} image. Having been always clean-shaven, in 1878 he {{surprised}} his friends by growing a beard, writing in September to the conductor Bernhard Scholz [...] "I am coming with a large beard! Prepare your wife for a most awful sight." [...] The singer George Henschel recalled that after a concert [...] "I saw a man unknown to me, rather stout, of middle height, with long hair and a full beard. In a very deep and hoarse voice he introduced himself as 'Musikdirektor Müller'... <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> <b>later,</b> we all found ourselves laughing heartily at the perfect success of Brahms's disguise". The incident also displays Brahms's love of practical jokes.|$|E
2500|$|He {{achieved}} renown {{by a great}} experiment made in 1834 – {{the measurement}} of the velocity of electricity in a wire. He cut the wire at the middle, to form a gap which a spark might leap across, and connected its ends to the poles of a Leyden jar filled with electricity. Three sparks were thus produced, one {{at each end of}} the wire, and another at the middle. He mounted a tiny mirror on the works of a watch, so that it revolved at a high velocity, and observed the reflections of his three sparks in it. The points of the wire were so arranged that if the sparks were instantaneous, their reflections would appear in one straight line; but the middle one was seen to lag behind the others, because it was <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> <b>later.</b> The electricity had taken a certain time to travel from the ends of the wire to the middle. This time was found by measuring the amount of lag, and comparing it with the known velocity of the mirror. Having got the time, he had only to compare that with the length of half the wire, and he could find the velocity of electricity. His results gave a calculated velocity of 288,000 miles per second, i.e. faster than what we now know to be the speed of light (...) , but were nonetheless an interesting approximation.|$|E

Perring, accompanied by full-colour illustrations by A. J. (Angusine Jeanne) MacGregor. The appeal of Bunnikin, Downy Duckling and other animal characters made the book <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> success. <b>Later</b> series included nature books (series 536, some illustrated by, for example, Charles Tunnicliffe and Allen W.

As long as he had the trident, nobody could vanquish Lavana in battle. Lavana wielded the trident and burnt Mandhata and his forces, {{reducing}} them to ashes in <b>an</b> <b>instant.</b> Lavana was <b>later</b> slain by Shatrughna, a descndant of Mandhata. Shatrughna made sure that Lavana did not possess the trident {{at that time and}} killed him.|$|R

Id.Cabasa produced this single, which was released with other songs in March 2006. The reggae tone and playful style of the song made it <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> hit. 9ice <b>later</b> founded his own record company and released all other albums under that label, Alapomeji Records.|$|R

30|$|CSMA is a {{fundamental}} medium access method that is built {{on the concept of}} listen-before-transmit. In this concept, a transmitter probes the medium at locally determined instances. Probing the medium entails detecting the possible ongoing transmission activity by other sessions. If there is such activity, then transmission is deferred, otherwise a packet is transmitted. In either case, the channel is probed at <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>instant</b> under the same rules.|$|R
50|$|Focal-plane {{shutters}} {{may also}} produce image distortion of very fast moving objects or when panned rapidly, {{as described in}} the Rolling shutter article.

50|$|Fields {{was born}} into a Ukrainian Jewish family who fled {{antisemitism}} in Kiev in 1885, and later settled in Dublin. Fields originally ran a sound studio where people could make a recording of their own voice, but later began his photography when he bought a box camera. Fields switched to <b>a</b> Polaroid <b>instant</b> camera <b>later</b> in his career. Field's brother was also a photographer on the bridge. Fields' extensive photographs are recognised as a social record of Dublin from the 1930s to the 1980s, depicting the changing fashions and shopfronts of the city. Nelson's Pillar often featured in Field's photograph until its destruction by Irish republicans in 1966.|$|R

60|$|Unluckily, Mike {{had been}} left at the gate as the sentinel. A more upfortunate {{selection}} {{could not have been}} made; the true-hearted fellow having so much self-confidence, and so little forethought, as to believe the gates impregnable. He had lighted a pipe, and was smoking as tranquilly as he had ever done before, in his daily indulgences of this character, when the unhung leaf came tumbling in upon the side where he sat; nothing saving his head but the upper edge's lodging against the wall. At the same moment, a dozen Indians leaped through the opening, and sprang into the court, raising the yells already described. Mike followed, armed with his shillelah, for his musket was abandoned in the surprise, and he began to lay about him with an earnestness that in nowise lessened the clamour. This was the moment when Joyce, nobly sustained by Blodget and Jamie Allen, poured a volley into the court, from the roofs; when the fray became general. To this point had the combat reached, when Willoughby rushed into the open air followed, <b>a</b> few <b>instants</b> <b>later,</b> by Nick.|$|R
30|$|Nonrepudiation is not {{provided}} by the TESLA authentication algorithm [17] or the original TESLA certificate proposal [19]. The symmetric nature of the basic cryptographic primitive used here—MACs—does not allow for nonrepudiation. Once the hash key for a particular MAC is disclosed, any group member {{would be able to}} generate the MAC for the given message. Therefore, at <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>instant</b> in time, it is impossible to prove that the message was generated by a particular source. The lack of nonrepudiation is a major drawback of the previous TESLA-based source authentication algorithms, compared to public key-based authentication.|$|R
50|$|On 21 May 1959, {{a formal}} {{agreement}} between Varig, Cruzeiro do Sul and VASP created the shuttle service to Rio de Janeiro {{that made the}} airport famous, being {{the first of its}} kind in the world. The service was called Air Bridge (Ponte Aérea), inspired on the Berlin Airlift; its first flight was operated on 6 July 1959. It operated between Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont and Congonhas Airports and comprised regular departures, usually every half-hour, a common check-in counter and simplified tickets and formalities. The service was <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> success. Sadia, <b>later</b> known as Transbrasil, joined the partnership in 1968. In 1999 the service was discontinued, as more competitive economic times made airlines decide to operate their services independently on that route.|$|R
