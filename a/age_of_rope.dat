40|$|PublishedOne {{immediate}} {{challenge for}} the Marine Energy Converters (MECs) industry is solving the cost and weight problems of mooring lines in deepwater (> 75 m). Fibre rope taut mooring lines represent a new and interesting option for the mooring of MECs in deepwater. Synthetic fibre ropes offer {{a solution to the}} weight problems of using steel lines in deepwater as they have a very low weight in water. Also, compared to steel, there are a large number of synthetic fibre material compositions {{with a wide range of}} material properties. A synthetic rope can therefore be designed to have properties that match the mooring requirements. Several materials have potential for mooring line application. Yarns of these synthetic materials can be made into ropes using a number of constructions, some of which are suited to particular fibres. As with any new application, research must be conducted to determine how well the fibre ropes satisfy the performance requirements. The effects <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> fibre <b>ropes</b> will be characterized in the proposed tests. Test facilities at the University of Exeter are unique in the MARINET consortium, as they allow the extensive testing of mooring lines in water. Their testing infrastructure will help us to determine which prospective innovative fibre rope mooring line is best suited for deepwater MECs. Also, the technological and scientific support offered by the well experienced staff is another reason to propose the access to these two tests facilities. The work described in this publication has received support from MARINET, a European Community - Research Infrastructure Action under the FP 7 “Capacities” Specific Programme...|$|R

The shortcomings of modelling and testing <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes are mainly due to neglecting kinetic friction, which disadvantageously affects design optimisation but also opens design opportunities...|$|R
