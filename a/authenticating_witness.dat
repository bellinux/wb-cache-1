5000|$|In practice, circumstantial {{evidence}} {{can have an}} advantage over direct evidence in that it can come from multiple sources that check and reinforce each other. Eyewitness testimony can be inaccurate at times, and many persons have been convicted {{on the basis of}} perjured or otherwise mistaken testimony. [...] Thus, strong {{circumstantial evidence}} can provide a more reliable basis for a verdict. Circumstantial evidence normally requires a witness, such as the police officer who found the evidence, or an expert who examined it, to lay the foundation for its admission. This witness, sometimes known as the sponsor or the <b>authenticating</b> <b>witness,</b> is giving direct (eye-witness) testimony, and could present credibility problems {{in the same way that}} any eye witness does.|$|E
40|$|The {{petition}} for certiorari to the Maryland Court of Appeals by Loren Parker concerned {{the interpretation of}} Maryland Rule of Evidence 5 - 902, specifically the authentication of business records by debt buyers. The central issue was whether a debt purchaser is bound by the same rules of evidence for the admissibility of business records as other Maryland businesses. Rule 5 - 902 (b) provides for the self-authentication of records of a regularly conducted business activity. It requires that a party served with a 5 - 902 (b) notice must object within 5 days. The petitioner debtor argued that this rule was being abused by debt buyers, like Pasadena, who often did nothing to verify the debt. Business records have to be properly authenticated by someone {{with knowledge of the}} business to overcome hearsay objections. The amicus memorandum argues that debt buyers {{should not be allowed to}} self-authenticate the business records of a third party (the original creditor) as if those records were their own. It points out that the failure to object within five days does not bar other objections to the records at the time of trial. Also, any <b>authenticating</b> <b>witness</b> must have personal knowledge of the business, otherwise he or she is not competent to testify. Since the debt buyer has no personal knowledge of the business records practice of the creditor grantor, or of each intermediate debt buyer, it cannot lay a proper foundation for the admission of documents created by other entities. The memoranda urges the grant of certiorari to provide clarity to consumers and businesses about the requirements for self-authentication of records created by third-party predecessors in interest...|$|E
50|$|In August 2013, Flores' family {{provided}} his baptism certificate to the Civil Registry Service of La Paz so that {{he could}} receive government aid for the elderly. Birth certificates did not exist in Bolivia until 1940. Instead, births were documented by baptism records, <b>authenticated</b> by two <b>witnesses.</b> Civil registrar director Eugenio Condori said he has the baptism record but could not show it to reporters due to privacy laws. A police ID card and entry in the civil registry indicating Flores had been born on 16 July 1890, were shown to reporters. If proven, that would have made him 123 years old as of July 6 2013. The longest fully documented lifespan in history is 122 years and 164 days, achieved by France's Jeanne Calment.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{inspired}} by the ever growing need for significance expressed both by my life coaching and pastoral therapy clients as well as the need for existential meaning reported both in the lay press and academic literature. This study reflected on a life that matters with a group of co-researchers in a participatory action research context. The study has been positioned within pastoral theology and invited the theological discourse into a reflection of existential meaning. Adopting a critical relational constructionist epistemology, the research was positioned within a postmodern paradigm. The implications for meaning and research were explored and described. My fellow researchers were invited to reflect on what constitutes a meaningful life or “a life that matters” to them personally. These stories of meaning were explored and situated within personal meaning histories. Meaning discourses introduced to the discussion of “a life that matters” were deconstructed, their effects externalised and embedded in life long meaning stories. In the process outsider witnesses were introduced to these stories, enriching these as we did. Together the research community made up of me and my fellow researchers, reflected on the meaning discourses introduced to the conversation on a life that matters in this way. These discourses included spirituality, purpose, and being meaningful in somebody else’s life. Only then did the group decide that perhaps these discourses were complemented by identity discourses. When we reflected upon the value of the research process as meaning enhancing action in their lives, my co-researchers suggested that it was the reflection process which added most value to their own experiences of meaningfulness. Throughout the research process, the voices of literature were invited into the conversation, exploring their perspectives on existential meaning. These voices acted as outsider <b>witnesses,</b> <b>authenticating</b> the stories of meaningfulness which were introduced by my fellow researchers. This study may serve to revive the conversation both in the practical theology discourse and the pastoral theology discourse. It positions existential meaning within an uncertainty discourse and suggests that reflexive co-construction in the manner suggested previously, can contribute to the meaning enhancing multilogue. Meaning making is introduced in a non-totalitarian way, strongly suggesting that an experience of meaningful living is possible even in postmodern times often described as confusing and potentially relativistically or nihilistically meaningless. This study creates space for spirituality in the existential meaning conversation; perhaps even strongly proclaiming that it should be part of any conversation on meaningfulness. Meaningfulness has been introduced as a local experience devoid of the power discourses of meta narratives and do-it-yourself recipes. Local process rather than universal content was positioned as meaning enhancing in the study, thus opening space for local life knowledges and negating the need to conform to meta-narratives of meaningfulness which may in effect be alienating and disempowering in that they relegate the life knowledges of objectified people into anecdotal and fictional.
