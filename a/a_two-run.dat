50|$|On August 3, 2011, Chavez hit {{his first}} home {{run as a}} Yankee, <b>a</b> towering <b>two-run</b> shot to right field against the Chicago White Sox.|$|R

The Mets added a run in the fourth inning on an RBI single by Conforto, and four more in the sixth inning, {{including}} an RBI single by Juan Uribe, in his first at bat since September 20. The Royals made a few uncharacteristic mistakes in this game, the first coming in the fourth inning when pitcher Yordano Ventura forgot to cover the base on a ground ball to the first baseman, and the second in the sixth inning when Royals pitcher Franklin Morales triple-clutched Granderson's ground ball, allowing all runners to be safe, which led to a 2-run single by Wright.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Uribe re-signed a one-year, $3.25 million {{contract}} with the Giants. He began 2010 as the Giants' second baseman because of an injury to Freddy Sanchez. At the beginning of May, he moved over to shortstop to replace the injured Rentería; {{for most of the}} remainder of the season, he was the Giants' starting shortstop. He hit a game-winning two-run home run on September 5 against Jonathan Broxton, turning a 4–3 deficit into a 5–4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. On September 23, Uribe hit a grand slam against Ryan Dempster and <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> home run in the second inning against the Cubs for a total of six RBIs, helping the Giants win 13–0.|$|E

The {{previous}} night, New York first baseman Tino Martinez had hit <b>a</b> two-out, <b>two-run</b> home run to tie the game in the ninth as well. It marked the first time in World Series history that this had ever occurred. The Yankees would go on to lose Games 6 and 7 of the series, after which Brosius retired.|$|R
5000|$|On May 4, 2012, down 4-3 in {{the bottom}} of the ninth against the Chicago White Sox, Jhonny Peralta hit <b>a</b> walk-off <b>two-run</b> home run to win the game 5-4 for the Tigers. Here's the call from Dickerson: ...|$|R
5|$|In 2012 spring training, Huff {{competed with}} Brandon Belt and Brett Pill for the Giants' first base job. Belt won the job, and Huff {{opened the season}} as the Giants' left fielder. He had two hits and three RBI on April 13, {{including}} <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> home run against Joel Hanrahan in a 50 victory over Pittsburgh. On April 21, because the Giants {{did not have any}} infielders available, Huff was positioned at second base {{for the first time in}} his career in the ninth inning of a tied game against the Mets. He failed to cover second base in a potential double play situation, and the Mets went on to win the first game of the doubleheader 54. After the game, on April 25, Huff was placed on the 15-day disabled list with anxiety issues.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, Kinsler stole {{third base}} for the 21st time in his career, {{building}} on his team record, without ever having been thrown out. On July 19, he led off {{the bottom of the}} first inning with a home run, and 12 innings later he broke a 3–3 tie with <b>a</b> <b>two-run,</b> walk-off home run. Only four times before in major league history had the same batter led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run, and ended the game with another homer. Kinsler suffered a strained left hamstring on July 28, and missed 11 games while on the disabled list.|$|E
5|$|Phillies starter Pedro Martínez {{was removed}} after {{allowing}} four runs in four innings, relieved {{in the fifth}} by Chad Durbin. Durbin allowed a ground rule double to Jeter, who advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt by Hairston and scored on a single by Mark Teixeira. Durbin then hit Rodriguez with a pitch and was relieved by J.A. Happ after recording just one out. Happ allowed <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> double to Matsui, his fifth and sixth RBI of the game, which tied a World Series record for most RBI in a single game set by Bobby Richardson in the 1960 World Series.|$|E
50|$|Dent and Doyle {{pushed the}} score to 5-2 {{in the sixth}} with RBI singles and Reggie Jackson put the final nail in the coffin with <b>a</b> {{tremendous}} <b>two-run</b> blast in the seventh off his Game 2 nemesis, Bob Welch.|$|R
5000|$|May 12: Jhonny Peralta hit <b>a</b> pinch-hit <b>two-run</b> {{homer in}} the top of the eighth inning to tie the game against the Twins, and Tigers went on to win 9-7 after a Brandon Inge RBI triple in the ninth.|$|R
50|$|The Braves took a 3-2 {{lead in the}} third, scoring {{twice on}} three {{consecutive}} one-out doubles by Felix Millán, Tony González, and Hank Aaron. The Mets immediately re-took {{the lead in the}} fourth on <b>a</b> two-out, <b>two-run</b> triple by Bud Harrelson.|$|R
5|$|Ramirez hit <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> {{home run}} in his first Iowa home game at Principal Park on June 30, 2014. Cubs {{prospects}} Arismendy Alcántara and Javier Báez credited Ramirez for his help with their swings. Baez also viewed Ramirez as a good mentor because of how Ramirez comforted him after {{the loss of his}} uncle. On August 23, Ramirez sustained a knee injury. A week later, Iowa manager Marty Pevey announced that Ramirez was going to Arizona for an MRI. With only four games left in Iowa's season, Pevey said that Ramirez was no longer going to coach and play for the team. Pevey said that he was uncertain as to what Ramirez would do next season, as he thought that Ramirez disliked the travel associated with Class AAA baseball.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{made the}} game closer {{in the top}} of the sixth inning, as Chase Utley drew a walk and Ryan Howard {{followed}} him with <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> home run, bringing the score to 7–3. After Raúl Ibañez hit a double into right field, Joba Chamberlain relieved Andy Pettitte and closed the sixth without scoring. Chan Ho Park came in for Happ, ending any Yankees threat that inning. Chamberlain was relieved by Dámaso Marte {{in the top of}} the seventh after allowing two baserunners, but Marte struck out Utley to end the inning scoreless. After Park allowed a single to Rodriguez, Scott Eyre replaced him. Eyre allowed Rodriguez to steal second and intentionally walked Jorge Posada but escaped the inning without allowing a run.|$|E
5|$|The Twins {{finally won}} the American League pennant during the 1965 season. On July 11, {{the day before}} the All-Star break, {{defending}} AL champion Yankees had a one-run lead over the Twins going {{into the bottom of the}} 9th inning, but Killebrew hit <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> home run for the win. Two days later, Killebrew started the All-Star Game at his home field, Metropolitan Stadium, and hit a game-tying two-run home run, erasing what had been a 5–0 National League lead. Elected to play first base on his fifth All-Star team, Killebrew became the first player in All-Star game history to be elected at three different positions, having previously been selected to play third base (1959 and 1961) and left field (1963 and 1964).|$|E
50|$|In {{the bottom}} of the third, the Yankees scored two runs to take the lead on <b>a</b> Berra <b>two-run</b> homer, scoring Slaughter. After that Ernie Johnson would mercifully replace Buhl. Johnson then held the Yankees {{scoreless}} until the seventh inning.|$|R
50|$|The American Leaguers {{came right}} back in their half of the first inning. George Brett walked with one out, Don Baylor doubled him in, and Fred Lynn put the AL up 3-2 with <b>a</b> two-out, <b>two-run</b> homer off Steve Carlton.|$|R
5000|$|Three four-RBI games, {{including}} <b>a</b> pair of <b>two-run</b> homers vs. the Kansas City Royals (May 15, 1970) ...|$|R
5|$|The Yankees scored {{first with}} an Alex Rodriguez walk opening {{the bottom of}} the second inning {{followed}} by <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> home run by designated hitter Hideki Matsui. The Phillies quickly responded with a triple by Carlos Ruiz who then scored on a sacrifice fly from Jimmy Rollins {{in the top of the}} third. Matsui answered back, adding to the Yankees lead again with a single with the bases loaded in {{the bottom of the}} third, scoring Derek Jeter and Johnny Damon. Damon, injured running the bases while scoring, was replaced defensively in the top of the fourth by Jerry Hairston, Jr.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{scoreless}} {{through the first}} two innings. Detroit took a three-run lead {{in the third inning}} which started when Curtis Granderson walked, advanced on a ground out, and scored on a single by Magglio Ordóñez to center field. Ordóñez was then brought home via <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> home run by Tigers' first baseman Miguel Cabrera. The Twins responded {{in the bottom of the}} inning, with Matt Tolbert singling to lead off the inning, advancing to second base on a single by Denard Span, and then moving to third on a flyball out. Tigers' starter Rick Porcello attempted a pickoff throw to first which hit the baserunner Span and went past the first baseman Cabrera. Span was out but Tolbert was able to score on Porcello's throwing error.|$|E
5|$|The lead {{would be}} {{augmented}} {{in the sixth}} when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager Tony La Russa did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit <b>a</b> <b>two-run</b> home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E
5000|$|On April 8, 2012, down 12-11 in {{the bottom}} of the {{eleventh}} against the Boston Red Sox, Alex Avila hit <b>a</b> walk-off <b>two-run</b> home run that barely went over the right field fence to win the game 13-12 for the Tigers. Here's Dickerson's call: ...|$|R
50|$|June 29 - The Yankees {{come back}} from a seven-run deficit to defeat the Red Sox, 9-7. Joe DiMaggio belts two home runs in the win, a three-run shot in the fifth and <b>a</b> tie-breaking <b>two-run</b> blast in the eighth that {{provides}} the margin of victory.|$|R
50|$|The Blue Jays scored {{first with}} a home run by José Bautista leading off the second inning. The Orioles responded two innings later with <b>a</b> go-ahead <b>two-run</b> homer from Mark Trumbo.
