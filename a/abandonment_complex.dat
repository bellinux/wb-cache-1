2500|$|From {{the start}} of the series, the lack of a {{relationship}} with her father serves as motivation for Erica's actions. She {{is an example of the}} Nixon staple of the [...] "lost daddy's girl." [...] Eric abandons her and her mother before {{the start of}} the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe <b>abandonment</b> <b>complex.</b> Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. [...] "Susan added a lot of Erica's background," [...] Behr said. [...] "Rather than playing it as if Erica's just a rotten character, she added the pathos of this child who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how 'My father loves me. I know that he loves me and nobody is going to tell me differently,' she colored it with the knowledge that she had really been deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where they said we have to play this out." [...] In 1989, the Eric Kane character makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley.|$|E
40|$|The Elizabeth City Ships' Graveyard in the Pasquotank River {{represents}} the largest assemblage of deliberately discarded watercraft found in North Carolina to date. Applying Annales School principles to the <b>abandonment</b> <b>complex</b> surrounding Elizabeth City, this research aims {{to illuminate the}} city's historic maritime interaction on Braudel's three levels of history, the longue dure[acute]e, conjonctures, and l'histoire e[acute]ve[acute]nementielle. Grounded in a behavioral/psychological theoretical framework, this research will also provide {{an analysis of the}} abandonment complex's site formation and abandonment processes. This thesis will attempt to assess the potential of a combined Behavioral-Annales theoretical approach for supplementing Elizabeth City's established maritime history, expanding archaeologists' knowledge on abandonment patterns seen throughout North Carolina, and contributing to existing worldwide archaeological research on abandoned vessels.   M.

It is the oldest such construction in the state of Puebla and the church is the only one in Latin America which has been in continuous use since its founding. In the courtyard of the monastery, there is a fountain called the Fuente de las Sirenas (Fountain of the Mermaids). After years of <b>abandonment,</b> the <b>complex</b> underwent extensive restoration in the 2000s. This work discovered colonial era murals on the interior walls. This mural work contains images of deer, bees and jaguars, houses with thatched roofs and daily scenes with Spanish and indigenous people.|$|R
40|$|The {{decline of}} agriculture, {{observable}} mainly in industrialized countries, shows itself {{not only in}} a gradual decrease in the economic weight of the primary sector, {{but also in the}} abandonment of land devoted to agricultural and livestock activities. The phenomenon of agricultural land <b>abandonment</b> is <b>complex</b> and, in order to explain the causes, it is necessary to consider not only the physical and productive features of the land but also the social and economic characteristics of the area. It also appears to be conditioned by production specialization, since traditional livestock-raising areas show a higher risk of abandonment. The process, which is gradual, starts with a reduction in production intensity followed by increasing marginalization and, finally, the total abandonment of land use. Focusing on a representative area on the Cantabrian Coast of northern Spain, this study tests the hypothesis that a large portion of agricultural land in livestock-oriented regions is underused. It also evaluates the viability of forestry as an alternative use for abandoned lands and the potential effects of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} that found that conventional techniques for including users in technology design are likely to fail if the user has autism. The heterogeneity of autistic symptomatology across cognitive, social, behavioural and communication domains suggests a 2 ̆ 7 single user 2 ̆ 7 environment, while rendering typical design interaction techniques meaningless, making the need for assistive technologies great, {{and the risk of}} <b>abandonment</b> high. This <b>complex</b> problem of urgency and constraint was addressed through a Delphi study with a panel of psychologists critiquing design activities for people with autism. The major finding is that while each of the activities may work if modified, all require that the designer is well acquainted with autism in general and has a close working relationship based on trust with the individual user. If these requirements are met, there is no reason that the abandonment rate cannot be reduced. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} on the Sifnos island, Greece, assesses the main factors {{controlling}} vegetation succession following crop abandonment and describes the vegetation dynamics of maquis and phrygana formations in relation to alternative theories of secondary succession. Field survey data were collected and analysed at {{community as well as}} species level. The results show that vegetation succession on abandoned crop fields is determined by the combined effects of grazing intensity, soil and geological characteristics and time. The analysis determines the quantitative grazing thresholds that modify the successional pathway. Light grazing leads to dominance by maquis vegetation while overgrazing leads to phryganic vegetation. The proposed model shows that vegetation succession following crop <b>abandonment</b> is a <b>complex</b> multi-factor process where the final or the stable stage of the process is not predefined but depends on the factors affecting succession. An example of the use of succession models and disturbance thresholds as a policy assessment tool is presented by evaluating the likely vegetation impacts of the recent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy on Sifnos island over a 20 - 30 -year time horizon.

40|$|Improved complex-compound {{sorption}} {{pumps are}} undergoing development {{for use as}} prime movers in heat-pump systems for cooling and dehumidification of habitats for humans on the Moon and for residential and commercial cooling on Earth. Among the advantages of sorption heat-pump systems are that they contain no moving parts except for check valves {{and they can be}} driven by heat from diverse sources: examples include waste heat from generation of electric power, solar heat, or heat from combustion of natural gas. The use of complex compound sorbents in cooling cycles is not new in itself: Marketing of residential refrigerators using SrCl 2 was attempted in the 1920 s and 30 s and was abandoned because heat- and mass-transfer rates of the sorbents were too low. Addressing the issue that gave rise to the prior <b>abandonment</b> of <b>complex</b> compound sorption heat pumps, the primary accomplishment of the present development program thus far has been the characterization of many candidate sorption media, leading to large increases in achievable heat- and mass-transfer rates. In particular, two complex compounds (called "CC 260 - 1260 " and "CC 260 - 2000 ") were found to be capable of functioning over the temperature range of interest for the lunar-habitat application and to offer heat- and mass-transfer rates and a temperature-lift capability adequate for that application. Regarding the temperature range: A heat pump based on either of these compounds is capable of providing a 95 -K lift from a habitable temperature to a heat-rejection (radiator) temperature when driven by waste heat at an input temperature. 500 K. Regarding the heat- and mass-transfer rates or, more precisely, the power densities made possible by these rates: Power densities observed in tests were 0. 3 kilowatt of cooling per kilogram of sorbent and 2 kilowatts of heating per kilogram of sorbent. A prototype 1 -kilowatt heat pump based on CC 260 - 2000 has been built and demonstrated to function successfully...|$|R
40|$|Small {{islands are}} widely {{agreed to be}} {{vulnerable}} to human-induced sea-level rise during the 21 st century and beyond, with forced abandonment of some low-lying oceanic islands being a real possibility. A regional abandonment of islands in the Chesapeake Bay, USA provides an historical analog of such vulnerability as this {{has been linked to}} a mid 19 th Century acceleration in relative sea-level rise. Using a case study approach for Holland Island, Maryland, this hypothesis was tested using a range of physical and human historical data. While sea-level rise was the underlying driver, this analysis shows that the <b>abandonment</b> was more <b>complex</b> than a direct response to sea-level rise. Between 1850 and 1900, Holland Island was a booming community and population increased from 37 to 253, with immigration causing the majority of the increase. At the same time, the upland area where people made their homes was steadily diminishing, losing about 15 ha or 38 % of the total. After 1900, the island experienced a decrease in population to 169 in 1916, with final abandonment in 1918, {{with the exception of one}} family who left by 1920. Final abandonment was triggered by this depopulation as the population fell below a level that could support critical community services, and the community lost faith in their future on Holland Island. It is likely that similar social processes determined the abandonment of the other Chesapeake Bay islands. Looking to the future, it shows that many small low-lying islands could be abandoned due to sea-level rise long before they become physically uninhabitable...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a reading of}} the data of Umm el-Marra (plain Jabbul, western Syria), relating to the transition from the Bronze Age and Middle Bronze Age may contribute to the identification of a crisis during this period. Results of analyzes archaeobotanical, published for the first time, are also discussed. In Umm el-Marra, social, economic and cultural changes coincide with a change in material culture during the transition BA - BM; in some cases, it seems plausible to associate these changes to a crisis by crossing the complex local companies, but other interpretations are also possible. Among these, it is possible that around 2000 BC. AD Umm el Marra was abandoned temporarily and V that the earliest occupation of Middle Bronze is relatively small extension. The ideological and political change is illustrated by the <b>abandonment</b> of mortuary <b>complex</b> Bronze final of the Acropolis ancient site, for an elite, and by changes in mortuary practices between the Bronze Age and Middle Bronze Age. Economic innovations are evident in the Middle Bronze Age in the significant increase in the hunting of wild animals, especially horses, a practice that can be interpreted as a response to a natural or social environment experiencing high stress. Alongside this development, archaeobotanical data indicate a change in feed-related practices. The decline in occupancy in the semi-arid part of the Eastern Jabbul during the transition BA - BM could be interpreted as indicative of a crisis; this, however, like the other mentioned here needs to be deepened by further research...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Shallow soils {{previously}} cultivated under terraced {{systems may}} change their properties after agricultural release and spontaneous plant colonization. Investigations {{were conducted in}} terraced fields (NE Spain) to prove that vegetation installed after the abandonment may generally improve soil properties by the formation of stable organic horizons. However, restriction in plant species along the natural vegetation succession and intensification of erosion processes may occur after abandonment depending on fire frequency and soil use history. Materials and methods: Ten environments with different plant covers under a Lithic Xerorthent were selected and erosion plots (Gerlach type) installed providing their best adaptability at the terrace scale. Selected soil environments represented the sequence of abandonment: from current poorly cultivated soils, soils under pasture, soils under shrubs, and soils under stands of pine and cork trees. Relevant rainfall events producing runoff and erosion were recorded from November 2011 to May 2012. Erosion rates and erosion components were analysed in sediments and water in order to monitor carbon, nitrogen and other nutrient removal by overland flow. Similarly, the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the soil environments under study were determined at the same time interval of runoff erosion. Results and discussion: Soils under pasture, vines and recently burnt pine forest produced the highest runoff followed by soils under shrubs and forest. However, eroded soil yields and nutrient removal were much higher in cultivated soils and soils in recently burnt sites, which had shown poorer soil properties with respect to soils abandoned for longer and preserved by fire. Fire-affected soil environments also showed a thinner organic horizon and reduced water retention. Although erosion rates and nutrient depletion were low in all environments with respect to other areas of Spain, higher splash than water erosion was an early warning indicator of the high susceptibility to degradation of these shallow soils. Conclusions: Results outlined that the renaturalization dynamics after agricultural <b>abandonment</b> are <b>complex</b> biophysical processes involving the parent material, depth to bedrock and other soil properties as well as the succession of vegetative cover and plant associations responsible for building a new soil mantle contrasting with erosion processes.

40|$|The Acropolis-agorà, core {{of ancient}} Naples, {{is a place}} in slow <b>abandonment,</b> where ancient <b>complexes,</b> archaeological fragments, war ruins and urban voids shape a complicated, multiform and unitary spatial system at {{different}} levels. The abandonment is often partial, it is due to several causes and it develops in different times and ways. Although it is a ‘space in ruin’, the Acropolis-agorà keeps the role {{of one of the}} most representative places of the city and for those who live there. Here, heterogeneous overlapping, unchanged traces, not finished, presence of concurrent times create a highly identifiable space. Despite this condition, it is possible to think of these spaces in terms of innovative design, breaking the gap between public and private spaces, between monuments and contexts and thinking of a unitary architecture to be read and used in different ways. The proposed design strategy for Acropolis-agorà consists of a spatial re-interpretation and a consequent functional re-organization. The spatial re-interpretation involves the creation of a system on several levels, the archaeological level, the courts level and that of the roofs, which will hold together, in one spatial sequence, these different elements. The result is a new layer, that we can define as ‘connective’, that is able to build an interconnected space through specific architectural interventions. The consequent functional re-organization aims to hold together fragments of existing functions, that are residential, hospital, university, museum, shopping and crafts, creating a new organization within the three main layers, that gives life to different uses of places. Through these operations, it is possible to fight against dynamics of abandonment and to re-appropriate spaces ‘in ruin’, breaking the contrast between public and private space and getting a change of sense that highlights innovative potential of ancient spaces and new ways to live and perceive them...|$|R
