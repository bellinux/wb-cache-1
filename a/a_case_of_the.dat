For each pair of elements, {{there is a certain}} probability that the algorithm makes the wrong comparison. Noisy binary search can find the correct position of the target with a given probability that controls the reliability of the yielded position. The noisy binary search problem can be considered as <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rényi-Ulam game, which Alfréd Rényi introduced in 1961.|$|E

25|$|The mixed diphthongs {{starting}} in i, u {{and a simple}} diphthong ui are commonly pronounced without noticeable intensifying {{of one of the}} appropriate elements in both acute as well as circumflex cases. It is easy to intentionally intensify the second part in the circumflex accent, but it is common too, {{that it is impossible to}} extract, hear out them from the standard language, the sounds are pronounced without an attention on emphasizing some accentual oppositions. In <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixed diphthongs {{starting in}} a, e the opposition can be understood at least by different quantity of these sounds: lengthened in the acute case, and not lengthen in the circumflex. Such lengthening helps to hold the two accents in the simple diphthongs (au, ai, ei) too (for example, in an ui case, where the first element is short, the opposition between accents is usually lost in a standard language), but in this case the lengthening, emphasis of the second element in the circumflex accentuation (similarly to the emphasis of the first element in the acute accentuation) is characteristic, not unusual.|$|E

500|$|Speaking to Rolling Stone co-founder David Dalton {{before his}} trial, Manson also drew {{parallels}} between the pig noises that close the track and a similar sound, followed by machine-gun fire, that appears in Lennon's White Album sound collage [...] "Revolution 9". Like its rival counterculture publications Los Angeles Free Press and Tuesday's Child, Rolling Stone initially supported Manson, Dalton contending that it was <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conservative-minded authorities framing [...] "some poor hippie guru".

[...] The battle has been described variously as the worst ever defeat of French forces in Morocco, the worst in North Africa and one of the worst in the French colonies.

Greene, a businesswoman, sought an injunction against Associated Newspapers Ltd to prevent them publishing alleged links with Peter Foster; while they claimed to have emails showing links, she asserted that they were false. The test at {{the time for a}} preliminary injunction in defamation cases was Bonnard v Perryman, where it was established that the applicant has to show [...] "a real prospect of success" [...] at trial. The Human Rights Act 1998 established that judges should consider whether applicants are [...] "more likely than not" [...] to succeed at trial, a test applied to confidentiality cases in Cream Holdings Ltd v Banerjee and the Liverpool Post and Echo Ltd. Greene claimed that the Cream test should be applied rather than the Bonnard test.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Mackey's line, [...] "drugs are bad, m'kay?", {{has entered}} popular culture. The Eminem song, [...] "The Kids" [...] (which is {{featured}} on the B-side of the single [...] "The Way I Am" [...] and the clean version of The Marshall Mathers LP), is thematically about drug use, and makes numerous references to South Park and impressions of the show's characters, including an impression of Mr. Mackey's voice and the repetition of his line. The song [...] "Hip Hop Quotables" [...] by Ludacris, from his album Chicken-n-Beer, also contains the line. In 2008, the line was referenced in the dissenting opinion of a judge, in <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Also, in a 2010 marijuana-related court case at the Maryland Court of Appeals, Judge Clayton Greene, Jr. referenced the episode in his dissenting opinion, calling Mr. Mackey's words [...] "immortal". In 2011, during a judiciary committee hearing about a marijuana-related bill in Denver, Colorado, a representative showed off a potential packaging for edible marijuana products. According to {{a group called the}} Cannabis Therapy Institute, the label on the package, which bore the placeholder text, [...] "Legal and governmentally approved statement describing that pot is bad, M-ok", was a reference to the South Park episode.|$|E
500|$|<b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter {{situation}} is a species of cleaner fish and its mimic, though in this example the model is greatly disadvantaged {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their body to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes that then let it clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean—and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's [...] "dance". Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off a piece of its fin before fleeing. Fish grazed on in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, so both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E

500|$|Kubica {{clinched}} the first pole position {{of his career}} {{with a time of}} 1:33.096. Massa qualified less than 0.03seconds behind the BMW and joined Kubica on the front row of the grid. Hamilton took third place, using his team's spare chassis; Räikkönen was next quickest, and despite being critical of his car's set-up was confident in its racing ability. Kovalainen would line up fifth on the grid alongside Heidfeld, who had trouble maximising performance from his tyres. Trulli took seventh place, ahead of Rosberg and Honda driver Jenson Button. Renault driver Fernando Alonso was the last driver to make the third session; Webber missed out on the top ten by 0.009seconds and would start the race in 11th position. Button's teammate Rubens Barrichello took 12th place after a gearbox problem interrupted his second session laps, ahead of Timo Glock of Toyota, Nelson Piquet of Renault and Toro Rosso driver Sébastien Bourdais. Nakajima was the slowest of the second session drivers, and took 16th. Coulthard qualified 17th, ahead of Giancarlo Fisichella of Force India. Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Vettel took 19th, and blamed his set-up: [...] "I felt it was more <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car driving me than me driving the car." [...] Fisichella's teammate Adrian Sutil qualified 20th, ahead of Anthony Davidson of Super Aguri. Davidson's teammate Takuma Sato spun out and crashed into the barriers. Sato's accident damaged his rear wing and suspension and left him unable to continue in the session.|$|E
500|$|Lachlan Kanoniuk, {{music critic}} for The Guardian, noted the [...] "bawdy" [...] jokes and anecdotes shared onstage by Madonna. He {{went on to}} {{describe}} the show as [...] "a weird mix of old vaudevillian-style, M15+, smut humour and bad wordplay; some jokes about clowns, sex jokes that were really quite bad but she had such great comedic delivery". Kanoniuk also compared the show to Prince's Piano & A Microphone Tour, and complimented her singing during [...] "Between the Bars", describing it as [...] "no costume changes, no highly synchronised dance moves, just Madonna playing an acoustic guitar and baring her soul on stage." [...] Francis Gibb from The Times found Madonna's performance during [...] "Intervention" [...] as an intimate and [...] "naked" [...] moment for the singer due to the legal battle. Jon Lisi from PopMatters observed that unlike the Rebel Heart Tour, Madonna had [...] "something to say" [...] with Tears of a Clown show. However he was confused whether Madonna was being vulnerable as a clown or it was <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> singer [...] "trolling us". Citing the instance of singing [...] "Intervention" [...] for Rocco, Lisi explained that [...] "Of course she loves her son, but maybe this was less about her pain and more about the press’ exploitation of her pain. As the show got more intimate with each song and personal anecdote, a disturbing thought crept into my mind: {{what if it was}} meant to be a joke?" [...] Lisi concluded that the show had the ability [...] "represent a transitional point in [...] career", although the purpose was still unclear.|$|E
