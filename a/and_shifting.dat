Many of the challenges associated with that feat remain today; even with modern engineering alterations to the mouth of the river, the strong currents <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> sandbar make it dangerous to pass between the river and the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian deities are {{connected}} {{in a complex}} <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> array of relationships. A god's connections and interactions with other deities helped define its character. Thus Isis, as the mother and protector of Horus, was a great healer {{as well as the}} patroness of kings. Such relationships were the base material from which myths were formed.|$|E

5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
5|$|British colonial {{administration}} was dominated in the 1760s and 1770s by Warren Hastings, {{the first man}} to hold the title of Governor-General. The military arm of the East India Company was directed during the Seven Years' War and the Second Anglo-Mysore War by General Eyre Coote, who died in 1783 during the later stages of the war with Mysore. Company policy, as implemented by Hastings, had involved the company in intrigues <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> alliances involving France, Mysore, the Marathas, and factions within those and other local territories.|$|E
5|$|In mid-November, Allied forces {{attacked}} the Japanese at Buna-Gona in New Guinea. Japanese Combined Fleet naval leaders, headquartered at Truk {{and under the}} overall command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, felt Allied advances in New Guinea posed a greater threat {{to the security of}} the Japanese Empire than an Allied military presence in the southern Solomons. Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> priorities and resources to operations around New Guinea. At this time, the navy did not inform the army of their intentions in this regard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We obtain {{expressions}} for Rydberg level broadening <b>and</b> <b>shift</b> {{cross sections}} <b>and</b> rates suitable for elastic collisions of ground-state rare-gas atoms with Rydberg atoms. The semiclassical impact broadening theory is used. The interaction of a Rydberg atom with a rare-gas atom is approximated by the superposition of polarisation potentials and the Fermi pseudopotential. It is shown that similar expressions for the broadening <b>and</b> <b>shift</b> cross sections {{due to the}} perturber-Rydberg-electron interaction can be obtained in the JWKB approximation for the Rydberg-electron wavefunctions and for the square-well model potential. Consequently the <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> width of the Rydberg level are not very sensitive {{to the shape of}} the potential but only to its normalisation. Expressions for the <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> width in the square-well potential approximation suitable in the high-density limit of the perturb-ing atoms are obtained. Limits of the applicability of the expressions for the broadening <b>and</b> <b>shift</b> cross sections are discussed. Calculated broadening <b>and</b> <b>shift</b> rates agree well with experimental results for the broadening <b>and</b> <b>shift</b> of Rydberg levels with small, medium and large principal quantum numbers by all rare gases excepting neon. 1...|$|R

After arriving in New York draped in flags and bunting, her {{dining room was}} the site of a press luncheon thrown by Lloyd staff celebrating her first arrival in that city. Princess Alice made four more roundtrips through early August, then shifted to Bremen–Suez Canal–Far East service, making her first Lloyd voyage on that route 31August. Princess Alice would continue this pattern—sailing the North Atlantic during the heaviest-trafficked season <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> to the Far East runs for the balance of the year—through 1910.|$|E
5|$|Reception {{towards the}} {{introduction}} of Takedowns was highly positive. Reviewers admired the impact that Takedowns had in transforming the boost mechanic <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> the game's focus to a more aggressive style of driving. GamesTM {{pointed out that the}} hostile behaviour of AI rivals supplemented the system by presenting more opportunities to perform Takedowns, culminating in an intense and dramatic racing experience. Lopez explained that Burnout 3 had intelligently integrated elements of vehicular combat games by introducing Takedowns. Gerstmann commended the game's use of Impact Time and Aftertouch mechanics, which he believed made crashing an entertaining aspect of the game unlike other racers. IGN's Fran Mirabella III was amazed by the crash system; he considered it to be far ahead of anything that had been done before.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> attention.|$|E

5|$|Subdivision {{surfaces}} in computer graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These subdivision surfaces (such as the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface) take a polygon mesh (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to a mesh with more polygons by adding <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> points according to different recursive formulas. Although many points get shifted in this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a subdivision {{of the old}} mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one, plus several more edges and vertices).|$|E
5|$|The largest use {{of lead in}} {{the early}} 21st century is in lead–acid batteries. The {{reactions}} in the battery between lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage. The lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans, so there are fewer toxicity concerns. Supercapacitors incorporating lead–acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia, Japan, and the United States in frequency regulation, solar smoothing <b>and</b> <b>shifting,</b> wind smoothing, and other applications. These batteries have lower energy density and charge-discharge efficiency than lithium-ion batteries, but are significantly cheaper.|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{was one of}} {{two phases}} to build an {{expressway}} bypass {{on the south side of}} Hamilton. Despite this, plans for both The Linc as well as the Red Hill Valley Parkway appeared simultaneously in 1963, when Hamilton City Council approved the 'Hamilton Area Transportation Study' which included the Highway53 Freeway as one of five proposed expressways. These were subsequently added to the city's official plan in 1964. However, political change <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> public attitudes would soon reject the idea of inner-city expressways, instead shifting the focus to public transportation. The cancellation of the Spadina Expressway in Toronto was the turning point in this shift.|$|E
40|$|First-order {{hyperbolic}} {{systems are}} promising {{as a basis}} for numerical integration of Einstein's equations.

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E

The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.|$|E
5|$|Several {{designs for}} the exact method of {{destroying}} the target were suggested. One of these {{was to have the}} satellite carry out a kamikaze attack on the target, while another was to coat it with black paint, blocking its ability to see or transmit, rendering it inoperable. Yet another was for it to use a laser to disable reconnaissance or optical sensors of the target. Another suggestion was for the satellite to carry a nuclear missile, of up to one megaton yield, and launch it at the satellite. However, in July 1959, Joseph V. Charyk directed that all technical efforts were to be focused on developing the inspection function, rather than the kill function, effectively ending its role as a satellite interceptor, <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> the project {{to the development of a}} satellite inspector.|$|E
5|$|That year Clements and Musker {{expanded}} the two-page idea into a 20-page rough script, eliminating {{the role of}} the mermaid's grandmother and expanding the roles of the Merman King and the sea witch. However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Oliver & Company as more immediate releases. In 1987, songwriter Howard Ashman became involved with the writing and development of Mermaid after he was asked to contribute a song to Oliver & Company. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab <b>and</b> <b>shifting</b> the music style throughout the film to reflect this. At the same time, Katzenberg, Clements, Musker, and Ashman revised the story format to make Mermaid a musical with a Broadway-style story structure, with the song sequences serving as the tentpoles of the film. Ashman and composer Alan Menken, both noted for their work as the writers of the successful Off-Broadway stage musical Little Shop of Horrors, teamed up to compose the entire song score. In 1988, with Oliver out of the way, Mermaid was slated as the next major Disney release.|$|E
