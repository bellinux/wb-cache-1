The large multisection flaps extended rearward and downward from the wing's trailing edge to increase the wing area, thus creating extra lift, which was further augmented by positioning the engines so their jet blast across the upper wing surfaces created still more lift. In addition, {{the placement of the}} engines above the wing prevented the engines from ingesting dirt and debris and shielded some of the engine noise from the ground so that the transport could make a quieter approach.|$|E

It is shown that high <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> capability improves performance for low circular orbit (LCO) rendezvous.

2500|$|Bernoulli's {{principle}} {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the lift force on an airfoil, if the behaviour of the fluid flow {{in the vicinity of the}} foil is known. [...] For example, if the air flowing past the top surface of an aircraft wing is moving faster than the air flowing past the bottom surface, then Bernoulli's principle implies that the pressure on the surfaces of the wing will be lower above than below. This pressure difference results in an upwards lifting force. Whenever the distribution of speed past the top and bottom surfaces of a wing is known, the lift forces can be calculated (to a good approximation) using Bernoulli's equations – established by Bernoulli over a century before the first man-made wings were used for the purpose of flight. Bernoulli's principle does not explain why the air flows faster past the top of the wing and slower past the underside. See the article on <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>lift</b> for more info.|$|E
2500|$|His driver, Bobby Unser, {{had been}} testing a new Gurney-designed car at Phoenix International Raceway, and {{was unhappy with}} the car's {{performance}} on the track. Gurney {{needed to do something}} to restore his driver's confidence before the race, and recalled experiments conducted in the 1950s by certain racing teams with spoilers affixed {{to the rear of the}} bodywork to cancel lift. (At that level of development, the spoilers were not thought of as potential performance enhancers—merely devices to cancel out destabilizing and potentially deadly <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>lift.)</b> Gurney decided to try adding a [...] "spoiler" [...] to the trailing edge of the rear wing. The device was fabricated and fitted in under an hour, but Unser's test laps with the modified wing turned in equally poor times. When Unser was able to speak to Gurney in confidence, he disclosed that the lap times with the new wing were slowed because it was now producing so much downforce that the car was understeering. All that was needed was to balance this by adding additional downforce in front.|$|E
2500|$|The wind, {{current and}} waves {{make up the}} balance of forces for any {{drifting}} object. Sufficient information of these forces {{as well as the}} shape of the drifting object should yield the correct resultant drift of the object. Richardson (1997) and Breivik and Allen (2008) noted that there are aerodynamic and hydrodynamic lift and drag components of the wind and current on the parts of the object exposed to the air and current. Figures 1 & 2 depict the various leeway components. [...] The larger component of leeway drift is the downwind component, which is comparable to the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic drag. It is critical to include the component of drift that is perpendicular to the downwind component called the crosswind component of leeway drift, which is comparable to the hydrodynamic and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>lift.</b> The crosswind component causes the drift object to diverge from straight downwind direction. The leeway divergence depends upon the search object as well as the environment. Furthermore, the initial orientation of the object relative to the wind will change the path of the object. It is unknown whether the search object will diverge to the right or left of the downwind direction therefore the range of values of leeway divergence is important in determining the actual trajectory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to clarify generation mechanism of aerodynamic force of flapping airfoil imitating insect’s flight. Hovering flights are important to develop micro air vehicles (MAV) for rescue inquiry devices of disaster area. In order to understand hovering flights of insects, <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> force and flow field around a flapping machine was measured by using time-series analysis of PIV and numerical simulation. PIV measurements were carried out with the flapping machine which was 10 times expanding model of real insects. Experimental results showed a flapping airfoil holds a strong vorticity near the bottom dead center. The leading-edge vortex and the wake-capture process were observed by the PIV measurement, which are important to understand insect’s flight. Moreover, these processes generate large amount of aerodynamic force compare to the sinusoidal flapping motion. It reveals that feathering motion is important to realize the hovering flight...|$|R
2500|$|The 2010 {{model year}} Mustang was {{unveiled}} on November 18, 2008, {{prior to the}} Los Angeles International Auto Show. Production began on January 12, 2009 and it went on sale in March 2009. The 2010 Mustang was a revision of the 2005–2009 models, retaining the D2C platform. Design and development work began in 2005, with 2006 being the year when designer George Saridikas' exterior proposal was chosen, as well as Robert Gelardi's interior proposal under chief S-197 designer Doug Gaffka. Doug Gaffka afterward, became immediately responsible {{for the design of}} the 2008–2009 Bullitt and the GT500KR, upon MY2010 design selection in 2006. [...] The resulting production exterior design of late 2006 was substantially revised, resulting in better aerodynamic performance (Ford claimed the coefficient of drag was reduced by 4% on V6 models and 7% on GT models, and that the front <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>lift</b> was reduced by 37% for V6 models and 23% for GT models.). [...] Specific changes to the exterior include a restyled Mustang emblem, a new headlight design with integrated turn signals, new slimmer side mirror design, a prominent [...] "powerdome" [...] hood, and revised three-lens taillights with LEDs that blink in sequence for turn indication. Additionally, the 2010 Mustang GT used smaller fog lights than the 2005–2009 models though they were still mounted in the car's grille. Fog lights on V6 models (a part of a revised Pony Package first introduced for 2006) are now mounted in the lower fascia below the grille. The radio antenna had been moved {{to the rear of the}} car and the lock for the trunk no longer featured a keyhole on the trunk lid, substituting with a remote trunk release only. In spite of its changes, the 2010 Mustang's overall exterior dimensions were nearly identical to the 2005–2009 models.|$|E

40|$|A dynaplane is a planing vessel {{in which}} the wetted surface at the {{operational}} speed possesses a downward curvature, thereby replicating the camber associated with high efficiency lifting airfoils. In addition, the aspect ratio is chosen to be large {{in order to further}} improve the lifting efficiency. It is the higher planing efficiency together with the relatively small wetted surface that leads to the low resistance of the dynaplane. Typical resistance-to-weight ratios as low as 0. 1 have been achieved in the past. We demonstrate here that a simple analysis can be based on modeling the hydrodynamic influence of the planing surface by means of the corresponding pressure distribution. Remarkably, the precise form of the pressure distribution is unimportant. The efficiency is greatly enhanced by choosing large aspect ratios of the order of 10 - a result analogous to the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> problem. The investigation here shows that resistance-to-weight ratios as low as 0. 025 are possible; hence, even higher levels of performance are ideally possible...|$|R
