5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
5|$|The story's {{main part}} {{takes place in}} {{what seems to be}} a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term {{previous}} to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.|$|E

They never tried to get their sister in trouble or outsmart their mother <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it." [...] Instead, {{he and his brother}} create things for the sheer enjoyment of it or to help out others ("and for the ladies"); for example, Ferb and Phineas carve Candace's face into Mount Rushmore for her birthday, set up a roller derby for a rematch race with his Grandmother Betty Jo's old rival, create a haunted house for their friend Isabella to cure her hiccups and make a super-computer to find out what to do for their mom after being so kind to them.|$|E
500|$|Grunge {{music has}} {{what has been}} called an [...] "ugly" [...] aesthetic, both in the roar of the {{distorted}} electric guitars and in the darker lyrical topics. This approach was chosen both to counter the [...] "slick" [...] elegant sound of the then-predominant mainstream rock and because grunge artists wanted to mirror the [...] "ugliness" [...] they saw around them and shine a light on unseen [...] "depths and depravity" [...] of the real world. Some key individuals {{in the development of the}} grunge sound, including Sub Pop producer Jack Endino and the Melvins, explained grunge's incorporation of heavy rock influences such as Kiss as [...] "musical provocation". Grunge artists considered these bands [...] "cheesy" [...] but nonetheless enjoyed them; Buzz Osborne of the Melvins described it as an attempt to see what ridiculous things bands could do <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with. In the early 1990s, Nirvana's signature [...] "stop-start" [...] song format and alternating between soft and loud sections became a genre convention.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of Mellon Collie, the Pumpkins contributed a number of songs to various compilations. Released in early 1997, the song [...] "Eye", which {{appeared}} on the soundtrack to David Lynch's Lost Highway, relied almost exclusively on electronic instruments and signaled a drastic shift from the Pumpkins' previous musical styles. At the time, Corgan stated his [...] "idea [...] to reconfigure the focus <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the classic guitars-bass-drum rock format." [...] Later that year, the group contributed [...] "The End Is the Beginning Is the End" [...] to the soundtrack for the film Batman & Robin. With Matt Walker on drums, the song featured a heavy sound similar to [...] "Bullet With Butterfly Wings" [...] while still having strong electronic influences. The song later won the 1998 Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance. Though Corgan announced that the song represented the sound people could expect from the band in the future, the band's next album would feature few guitar driven songs.|$|E

[...] MuuMuse-editor Bradley Stern praised the concept of the video as [...] "incredible" [...] and complimented the inclusion of the horse. Popjustice called the music video a [...] "lovely pervoramic pop moment." [...] Due to its sexual content and nature, the music video was censored and banned in numerous Asian countries including Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In an interview with Spanish television channel Cuatro, Minogue responded to the censorship and said: [...] "I think, yes, it's sexy but I also think it's very touching and sensual and the message is love." ...|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} {{negative reaction}} from critics, conservative and feminist anti-porn groups, {{due to its}} sexually explicit photographs which many characterized as hardcore pornography. Taraborrelli opined {{that much of the}} book appears surprising and not shocking. He derided the whole concept as childish and impetuous rather than an adult book. According to him, though Madonna insisted that she was trying to demystify sexuality altogether, the author believed she just wanted to publish pornographic text and pictures <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it. [...] "She was being a brat, not a revolutionary", the author concluded. Author Lucy O'Brien declared that the book was a bold, harrowing exercise in frustration, and despite Madonna's attempt at invincibility, the book appeared as [...] "a curious act of self-destruction". [...] "The overwhelming effect of the book is numbing," [...] stated Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone. [...] "The images are derivative, and Madonna herself seems far too eager to shock; that, not even prurient arousal, seems the ideal response the book tirelessly seeks. The potency of Sexs subject matter is dissipated by Madonna and Meisel's self-congratulatory â€“ and silly â€“ sense of their own 'bravery,' as if their naughty games were somehow revolutionary." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{main point}} of {{disagreement}} between Herring and Barbey concerned {{the timing of}} the landing. Barbey and the Commander of Allied Naval Forces, Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender, did not want a repeat of what happened at Lae, when two LCIs were lost and two LSTs were badly damaged. Although the USAAF and RAAF attacked Japanese air bases in New Britain, this did not stop nine Japanese bombers and 10 fighters attacking Nadzab on 20 September. Moreover, some 23 Japanese warships were sighted in the harbour at Rabaul, and there were reports of Japanese submarines in the area. Accordingly, Barbey proposed landing at 02:00 under a quarter moon, which would allow his ships to unload <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> soon after dawn. Noting that it was the rainy season, and the sky would therefore likely be overcast, Herring doubted that the VII Amphibious Force would be able to locate the beach, and pressed for a dawn landing at 05:15. In the end, a compromise was reached on 04:45. Samuel Eliot Morison, the US Naval historian, noted that: [...] "The Australians proved to be right; 'Uncle Dan's' outfit was not prepared for a neat night landing. The usual snafu developed".|$|E

500|$|Matthews played 22 reserve {{games in}} 1931â€“32, shunning the social scene {{to focus on}} {{improving}} his game. In one of these games, against Manchester City, he attempted to run at the left-back and take him on with a deft swerve as the defender committed himself to a challenge, rather than follow the accepted wisdom of the day which was to first wait for the defender to run at the attacker â€“ his new technique [...] "worked a treat". The national press were already predicting a bright future for the teenager, and though he could have then joined any club in the country, he signed as a professional with Stoke on his 17th birthday. Paid the maximum wage of Â£5 a week (Â£3 in the summer break), {{he was on the}} same wage as seasoned professionals before he even kicked a ball. Despite this his father insisted that Matthews save this money, and only spend any winning bonus money he earned. He made his first team debut against Bury at Gigg Lane on 19 March 1932; the [...] "Potters" [...] won the game 1â€“0 and Matthews learned how physical and dirty opponents could be â€“ <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it.|$|E
500|$|Babe {{made her}} final {{appearance}} on 9 February 2017. In the episode, Babe {{tries to make}} amends with her family by taking care of Sylvie, but instead takes her to the canal and tells her that Stan {{is on the other}} side, before leaving her alone. Badland explained that Babe [...] "would not have actually killed" [...] Sylvie, but instead [...] "enticed her to do something and then walked away from it". When Shirley discovers Babe's actions, she tells her to leave so Babe tries to steal money from the pub's safe. Shirley catches her in the act and announces her actions to Mick. Babe pleads with Mick for another chance, but when she calls Linda a [...] "stuck-up cow", Mick escorts her out. Badland explained that Babe does this because she is [...] "absolutely desperate". Outside the pub, Babe curses the family and exclaimed, [...] "I hope you lose everything and your precious pub", which caused media outlets to question whether it foreshadows speculation the family would lose their pub. Badland believed that [...] "with all the threats she made, Babe might be back at some point." [...] She added that, [...] "She's cursed the Carters, and you don't cross Aunt Babe <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writing in}} Starship Troopers has {{received}} varied responses, with {{the scenes of}} military training and combat receiving praise. In a 2009 retrospective, Jo Walton wrote that Starship Troopers was [...] "military SF done extremely well". She went on to argue that [...] "Heinlein was absolutely at his peak when he wrote this in 1959. He had so much technical stylistic mastery of the craft of writing science fiction that he could [...] 'backwards and in high heels' <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it." [...] Others {{referred to it as}} very readable, and found the military scenes compelling. Heinlein's descriptions of training and boot camp in the novel, based on his own experiences in the military, have been described as being rendered with remarkable skill. A 1960 review in the New York Herald Tribune praised the [...] "brilliantly written" [...] passages describing infantry combat, and also called attention to the discussion of weapons and armor, which, according to other reviewers, demonstrated Heinlein's [...] "undiminished talent for invention". Scholar George Slusser described the book in 1986 as the [...] "ultimately convincing space-war epic", praising in particular the [...] "precisely imagined" [...] weapons and tactics, while a 1979 science fiction encyclopedia referred to it as the [...] "slickest" [...] of Heinlein's juvenile books.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the Variety Map Pack in March 2017, Activision was condemned for deciding that the downloadable content would not be available for free. Common complaints were that the publisher had already generated additional revenue for Remastered by bundling it with Infinite Warfare (increasing its cost to more than an individual game) and by including microtransactions; and that as a remaster, which often includes all previously-released DLC, the map pack should have been released alongside it. Many also argued that selling the DLC for a higher price than its original release was an unprincipled move. Sterling further slated Activision for charging for the DLC, stating that it was [...] "incomprehensible" [...] and that to increase its cost highlighted [...] "just how far [...] can mock its customers <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it", labeling it as the latest scam to befall the game. Erik Kain of Forbes similarly argued that the DLC should have been available free of charge, maintaining his belief that charging for map packs [...] " [...] a huge mistake". However, he felt he could also sympathize with Activision, writing that it was easier for them to set price points for early and late buyers. He also noted that the remaster was cheap in its contribution to the overall price for two bundled games and so further costs for the DLC were justified.|$|E
500|$|Younger or {{subdominant}} male pinnipeds may {{attempt to}} achieve reproductive success in other ways. Subadult elephant seals will sneak into female clusters {{and try to}} blend in by pulling in their noses. They also harass and attempt to mate with females that head out to the water. In otariid species like the South American and Australian sea lions, non-territorial subadults form [...] "gangs" [...] and cause chaos within the breeding rookeries to increase their chances of mating with females. Alternative mating strategies also exist in young male grey seals, which do have some success. Female pinnipeds do appear to have some choice in mates, particularly in lek-breeding species like the walrus, but also in elephant seals where the males try to dominate all the females {{that they want to}} mate with. When a female elephant seal or grey seal is mounted by an unwanted male, she tries to squirm <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away,</b> while croaking and slapping him with her tail. This commotion attracts other males to the scene, and the most dominant will end the copulation and attempt to mate with the female himself. Dominant female elephant seals stay {{in the center of the}} colony where they are more likely to mate with a dominant male, while peripheral females are more likely to mate with subordinates. Female Steller sea lions are known to solicit mating with their territorial males.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson {{continued}} feuding with Tedder in 2010. In December 2009, Tedder {{said that}} he was no longer angry over the accusations Clarkson made, but warned, [...] "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. [...] I don't wanna get some crazy-ass backlash or get my head snapped off for writing a hit song." [...] He later told The Denver Post that he had gotten over the situation and is working on new material for Clarkson's fifth album. Clarkson, however, told the Daily Star that she is writing and recording new songs with new, low-profile producers. [...] "I donâ€™t like working with people who have worked with everyone. Sometimes I get blackmailed into doing so by my label," [...] she said, [...] "but I prefer collaborating with people who aren't on the grid. I donâ€™t want to sound exactly like other people's records." [...] In May, an unreleased electro-pop song by Clarkson called [...] "Wash, Rinse, Repeat" [...] was leaked on the Internet. The song contains auto tuned lyrics that Idolator say are likely written about Tedder: [...] "I can't take the pressure of new. Give me old, rip it off. / Let's see if it sticks to the wall again. / Does it sound familiar? Does it linger in your ear? / Like something you remember from just last year?" [...] and [...] "Music from the past, from the present, well, just last week / We will change a note <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with it, wait and see." [...] Tedder {{said that he}} thinks the song was written about him, too, but admitted he likes the song. [...] "I think Kelly speaks her mind regardless of anything. She's great with lyrics, and I love that she is her own person. She's no puppet." ...|$|E
