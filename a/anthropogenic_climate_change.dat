The abrupt differences in water temperatures north and south of Cape Hatteras directly correlate with the abundance and distribution of Pterois. Pterois expanded along the southeastern coast of the United States and occupied thermal-appropriate zones within 10 years, and the shoreward expansion of this thermally appropriate habitat is expected in coming decades as winter water temperatures warm in response to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change.</b> Although the timeline of observations points to the east coast of Florida as the initial source of the western Atlantic invasion, the relationship of the United States East Coast and Bahamian lionfish invasion is uncertain. Lionfish can tolerate a minimum salinity of 5 parts per thousand and even withstand pulses of freshwater, which means they can also be found in estuaries of freshwater rivers.|$|E

The success of such projects will also depend on the accuracy of the baseline data and the number of countries involved.

40|$|Different {{time scales}} of <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> and their {{differential}} perception in society are discussed. A historical examination of natural <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> {{during the past}} millennium suggests that short-term changes, especially crucial changes, trigger a significant response in and by society. Short-term changes correspond to the 'time horizon of everyday life', that is, to a time scale from days and weeks to a few years. The anticipated <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes,</b> however, are expected to occur on a longer time scale. They require a response by society {{not on the basis}} of primary experience but on the basis of scientifically constructed scenarios and ways in which such information is represented in the modern media for example. Socio-economic impact research relies on concepts that are based on the premise of perfectly informed actors for the development of optimal adaptation strategies.
