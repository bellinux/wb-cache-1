This paper {{introduce}} {{a series of}} tests about properties of seawater <b>and</b> sea-sand <b>concrete,</b> such as impermeability, dry shrinkage, alternate wetting and drying destruction and sulfate attack. The test results show that the impermeability of seawater <b>and</b> sea-sand <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> ordinary <b>concrete</b> is basically same, the coral sand leads to decreasing of concrete impermeability, the admixture can effectively improve the impermeability of coral sand concrete. The difference between the shrinkage rate of seawater <b>and</b> sea-sand <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> the ordinary <b>concrete</b> is not obvious, the shrinkage rate of seawater <b>and</b> coral-sand <b>concrete</b> is larger than ordinary <b>concrete,</b> <b>and</b> the admixtures can effectively inhibit the late drying shrinkage of seawater <b>and</b> sea-sand <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> seawater <b>and</b> coral-sand <b>concrete.</b> In the case of alternate wetting and drying, the pressure generated by the salt crystals would not damage seawater <b>and</b> sea-sand <b>concrete.</b> Potential sulfate attack exits in seawater <b>and</b> sea-sand <b>concrete,</b> the active admixture is able to greatly enhance its ability of resisting sulfate corrosion...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the seismic {{performance}} of hollow reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> bridge columns, <b>and</b> to provide data for developing improved seismic design criteria. By using a sophisticated nonlinear finite element analysis program, the accuracy and objectivity of the assessment process can be enhanced. A computer program, RCAHEST (Reinforced Concrete Analysis in Higher Evaluation System Technology), is used to analyze reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> structures. Tensile, compressive and shear models of cracked <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> models of reinforcing and prestressing steel were used to account for the material nonlinearity of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> prestressed <b>concrete.</b> The smeared crack approach was incorporated. The proposed numerical method for the seismic performance assessment of hollow reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> bridge columns is verified by comparing it with the reliable experimental results. Additionally, the studies and discussions presented in this investigation provide an insight into the key behavioral aspects of hollow reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> bridge columns.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental {{results on the}} effect of nano-CaCO 3 on compressive strength development of mortars <b>and</b> <b>concretes</b> containing high volume fly ash (HVFA). The effect of various nano-CaCO 3 contents such as 1, 2, 3 and 4 % (wt. %) as partial replacement of cement on the compressive strength of mortars are evaluated in the first part. The nano-CaCO 3 content which exhibited the highest compressive strength above is used in high volume fly ash mortars <b>and</b> <b>concretes</b> containing 40 % and 60 % class F fly ash. The results show that among four different nano-CaCO 3 contents, the addition of 1 % nano-CaCO 3 increased the compressive strength of mortars <b>and</b> <b>concretes.</b> The addition of 1 % nano-CaCO 3 also increases the early age and 28 days compressive strengths of HVFA mortars <b>and</b> <b>concretes.</b> The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis results also support the above findings...|$|R
40|$|There {{are both}} {{diversity}} and {{unity in the}} strength characteristics of different geomaterials <b>and</b> <b>concretes.</b> Based on the generalized nonlinear strength theory, a simple but unified strength criterion (USC) is proposed for various materials, such as soils, gravels, rocks, <b>and</b> <b>concretes.</b> Power function is used as the failure curve of the USC in meridian plane, while the shape of failure curve in pi-plane is curved triangle, which is between the SMP and Mises criterion. With only four independent parameters, which are convenient to be determined, the proposed criterion is {{able to take the}} effects of friction, cohesion, hydrostatic pressure, and intermediate principal stress into consideration. The proposed criterion is compared with some widely used unified strength criteria, such as the Zienkiewicz-Pande criterion and the Lade criterion, against the experimental results for various soils, gravels, rocks, <b>and</b> <b>concretes.</b> The comparison between the predicted and observed results confirmed the validity of the proposed criterion used as a USC for geomaterials <b>and</b> <b>concretes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Behavior and {{analytical}} modeling of natural flax fibre-reinforced polymer tube confined plain <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> coir fibre-reinforced <b>concrete</b> L Yan <b>and</b> N Chouw As reinforcement flax fibre {{has the potential}} to replace glass fibre in fibre-reinforced polymer, composite and coir fibre can be used in concrete. To achieve sustainable construction, this study presents an experimental investigation of a flax fibre-reinforced polymer tube as concrete confinement. Results of 24 flax fibre-reinforced polymer tube-confined plain <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> coir fibre-reinforced <b>concrete</b> cylinders under axial compression are presented. Test results show that both flax fibre-reinforced polymer tube-confined plain <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> fibre-reinforced <b>concrete</b> offer high axial compressive strength and ductility. A total of 23 existing design- and analysis-oriented models were considered to predict the ultimate axial compressive strength and strain of flax fibre-reinforced polymer tube-confined plain <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> fibre-reinforced <b>concrete.</b> It was found that a few existing design- and analysis-oriented models predicted the ultimate strengths of all the flax fibre-reinforced polymer tube-confined plain <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> fibre-reinforced <b>concrete</b> cylinders accurately. However, no strain models considered match the ultimate strains of these specimens. Two new equations are proposed to evaluate the ultimate axial strain of flax fibre-reinforced polymer tube-confined plain <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> fibre-reinforced <b>concrete...</b>|$|R

5|$|Dreyfuss {{announced}} that unlike established wooden ballparks {{such as the}} Polo Grounds, he would build a three-tiered stadium out of steel <b>and</b> <b>concrete</b> to increase longevity—the {{first of its kind}} in the nation. Charles Wellford Leavitt, Jr. was contracted to design the stadium's grandstand. A civil engineer, Leavitt had founded an engineering and landscape architecture firm in 1897. He had gained experience in steel <b>and</b> <b>concrete</b> constructs while designing the Belmont and Saratoga racetracks. Based on Dreyfuss' architectural requirements, Leavitt presented a plan for Forbes Field—the only ballpark he would design. Pirates' manager Fred Clarke also had input into the stadium's design, giving groundskeepers advice on the field, in addition to designing and patenting a device to spread and remove a canvas tarpaulin over the infield in case of rain.|$|E
