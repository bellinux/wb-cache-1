5000|$|A {{repeating firearm}} or [...] "repeater" [...] is a firearm that holds {{more than one}} {{cartridge}} and can be fired more than once between chargings. One example of a repeater is the American Springfield Model 1892-99—also made at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts—which were used during the Spanish-American War. Some repeating firearms require manipulation of a bolt (as in bolt <b>action),</b> <b>lever,</b> or slide to eject the fired cartridge case, draw a fresh cartridge from the magazine, and insert it into the firing chamber, and [...] "cock" [...] (draw to the rear and place under spring tension) the hammer or striker, so that pulling the trigger will fire the weapon. Others use either the firearm's recoil or {{a small portion of}} the propellant gas drawn from the barrel, to operate the firearm's mechanism and ready it for the next shot. Such firearms are sometimes called [...] "self-loading," [...] but are more commonly known as semi-automatic, if they fire one shot for every pull of the trigger, or automatic or [...] "full-auto" [...] if they continue to fire until the trigger is released and the magazine is empty.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAcquisition and {{performance}} of instrumental actions are assumed to require both action-outcome and stimulus-response (S-R) habit processes. Over the course of extended training, control over instrumental performance shifts from goal-directed action-outcome associations to S-R associations that progressively gain domination over behavior. Lesions of the lateral part of the dorsal striatum disrupt this process, and rats with lesions to the lateral striatum showed selective sensitivity to devaluation of the instrumental outcome (Yin et al., 2004), indicating that this area is necessary for habit formation. The present experiment further explored {{the basis of this}} dysfunction by examining the ability of rats subjected to bilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway to develop behavioral autonomy with overtraining. Rats were given extended training on two cued instrumental tasks associating a stimulus (a tone or a light) with an instrumental <b>action</b> (<b>lever</b> press or chain pull) and a food reward (pellets or sucrose). Both tasks were run daily in separate sessions. Overtraining was followed by a test of goal sensitivity by satiety-specific devaluation of the reward. In control animals, one <b>action</b> (<b>lever</b> press) was insensitive to reward devaluation, indicating that it became a habit, whereas the second action (chain pull) was still sensitive to goal devaluation. This result provides evidence that the development of habit learning may depend on the characteristics of the response. In dopamine-depleted rats, lever press and chain pull remained sensitive to reward devaluation, evidencing a role of striatal dopamine transmission in habit formation...|$|E

40|$|Biodiversity {{plays an}} {{important}} role in a number of ecological processes highly relevant for food production. In most temperate areas, wild plant and animal species have co-evolved with agriculture. In the last 50 years, a shift occurred between agriculture and wildlife. The evolution of agriculture accelerated to speeds that biodiversity could not keep up with. We illustrate this shift with empirical evidence on agricultural intensification and biodiversity decline. Moving towards improvements requires indicators to monitor the state and trends of both agriculture and biodiversity. The effective benchmarking of farming and livestock systems requires a detailed understanding of agro-ecological processes. The development of indicators raises several problems related to metrics, functional units, time and spatial scales. Some indicators can be misleading and all indicators do not have equivalent properties in terms of accuracy, cost and communication towards decision-makers. We present different challenges for moving toward a win-win partnership between biodiversity and dairy systems. These challenges should account that biodiversity needs space, time and landscape complexity. Modulating the timing and intensity of management is an important <b>action</b> <b>lever</b> for enhancing biodiversity while ensuring acceptable levels of production. Recent theoretical and empirical evidences suggest that organizational innovations at landscape level can help to improve biodiversity by taking advantage of complementarities among different farms. We conjecture that it may be difficult to make a strict allocation of biodiversity loss to dairy systems because in agro-landscapes dairy systems are interacting with other farming systems and human activities. We finally conclude that win-win partnership cannot be achieved independently from other environmental issues...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{complexity}} of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method requires many subjective choices throughout the procedure, which make decision making difficult and LCA results insecure. Our approach consists in combining life cycle thinking and sensitivity analysis to provide information to the actor of a foreground system within a product's life cycle. For any parameter of a foreground system, the trends and quantified influence on impact categories are systematically compared to determine the most effective <b>action</b> <b>levers</b> for actors controlling the process. This approach has been previously applied to a single actor, the farmer, in {{a case study of}} hemp crop production. In this study, we introduce a second life cycle actor: the industrial producer for transformation of hemp straw into insulation products for buildings. The relationships between farming and industrial actors are examined and demonstrate that industrial actors have <b>action</b> <b>levers</b> limited to climate change and energy consumption. Only a joint action of both actors can allow further reduction of climate change and energy consumption impacts. Nevertheless, the farmer action alone can allow reduction of other environmental impacts such as human toxicity or ecotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{issue of}} {{recovering}} platinum from catalytic converter of heavy vehicles, arises for economic (high valuable component {{due to the}} non-negligible presence of platinum that costs around 30 €/g), environmental (low platinum concentration in mines (below 10 g/t) required large consumption of energy), social (ore mining conditions are increasingly drastic) and geostrategic (more than 90 % of platinum stock is located in South Africa and Russia) reasons. Even if some marginal channels exist, the collection rate of platinum from catalytic converters in Europe is still low (around 50 %) while recycling efficiency is high (around 95 %). As heavy vehicles are not considered by any end-of-life directive contrary to the automotive sector submitted to ELV directive, {{the objective of this}} applied research work is to evaluate the impact of other <b>actions</b> <b>levers</b> to close the loop of heavy vehicles catalytic converters which contain larger amount of platinum than in cars. To date, a number of issues that still need to be tackling to close the loop of platinum have been outlined in literature but {{there is a lack of}} operational improvement proposal or simulation to see “what if” scenarios, and therefore evaluate the impact of different changes. Indeed, even though research the on end-of-life management has an extensive literature, there is still lack of in-depth investigation on how to effectively improve the overall end-of-life collection, recovery and efficiency related to platinum from heavy-duty vehicles catalytic converters. Thus, new insights are needed to address and overcome the barriers, systematically analysed in previous state-of-the-art, to an effective circular economy of platinum. In this light, the main objectives of this work are twofold, (i) to construct a methodology that aims at assessing the impact of different <b>actions</b> <b>levers</b> on the road toward the circular economy, (ii) to experience the proposed approach through a significant industrial case study from a manufacturer willing to know how close the loop of their product containing precious raw materials, in order to benefit from economic and environmental spinoffs. Through MFA and SD modeling and simulations, promising <b>actions</b> <b>levers</b> (e. g. re-design to facilitate end-of-life recovery, take-back and remanufacturing offers, product-as-a-service, mandatory recycling rate) will be analyzed. Also, methods of prospective will be used to define relevant and realistic scenarios. The developed approach will assess the contribution of different <b>actions</b> <b>levers</b> in “closing-the-loop” by simultaneously considering environmental and economic parameters. In this paper, we will try to summarize the issues of platinum recovery from end-of-life heavy vehicles, to explain in detail the approach and to present first results of application. The proposed method consists in five steps. First step is about modeling the current situation (defining scope, boundaries of the study, identifying stakeholders, representing value chain). Second step deals with the identification and selection of promising and possible <b>action</b> <b>levers.</b> Third step with scenarios elaborations. Fourth step with simulations realisation. Last step with results analysis and presentation to get feedback from actors. The broader impact of this work will be to provide significant new insights for industrial practitioners about mechanisms to maintain platinum deposit contained in catalytic converter in Europe and therefore to secure supply chain. As such, it will represent a valuable contribution to resource sustainability for European platinum sector in the light of the circular economy...|$|R
