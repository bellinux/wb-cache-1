5|$|The Civil War economy catalyzed a {{shortage}} of United States coinage—gold and silver coins were hoarded given their intrinsic bullion value relative to irredeemable paper currency at the time. In late 1861, to help finance the Civil War, the U.S. government borrowed gold coin from New York City banks in exchange for Seven-thirties treasury notes and the New York banks sold them {{to the public for}} gold to repay the loan. In December 1861, the Trent Affair shook public confidence with the threat of war on a second front. The United States Department of the Treasury suspended specie payments and banks in New York City stopped redeeming paper money for gold and silver. In the absence of gold and silver coin, the premium for specie began to devalue paper currency. After the New York banks suspended specie payments (quickly followed by Boston and Philadelphia) the premium on gold rose from 1–3% over paper in early January 1862 to 9% over paper in June 1862, by which time one paper dollar was worth 91.69 cents in gold. This fueled currency speculation (e.g., redeeming banknotes for silver coin which was then sold at a premium as bullion), and created significant disruption across businesses and trade. Alternate methods of providing small change included the reintroduction of Spanish quarter dollars in Philadelphia, cutting dollar bills in quarters or halves, refusing to provide change (without charging <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> providing silver coins), or the issuance of locally issued shinplasters (i.e., those issued by businesses or local municipalities) was forbidden by law in many states.|$|E

Self-service is a very cost efficient way of delivering services since the retailer harnesses the customers labour power to carry out many of the retail tasks. However, many customers appreciate full service and are willing to pay <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> the benefits of full-service.|$|E

25|$|Yield {{management}} is particularly suitable when selling perishable products, i.e. goods that become unsellable {{at a point}} in time (for example air tickets just after a flight takes off). Industries that use yield management include airlines, hotels, stadiums and other venues with a fixed number of seats, and advertising. With an advance forecast of demand and pricing flexibility, buyers will self-sort based on their price sensitivity (using more power in off-peak hours or going to the theater mid-week), their demand sensitivity (must have the higher cost early morning flight or must go to the Saturday night opera) or their time of purchase (usually paying <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> booking late).|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} in the 20th century was that the acts of demolition were often acts of desperation and last resort; a demolished house could not be valued for probate duty. A vacant site was attractive to property developers, who would pay <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> an empty site that could be rebuilt upon and filled with numerous small houses and bungalows, which would return a quick profit. This was especially true {{in the years immediately}} following World War II, when Britain was desperate to replace the thousands of homes destroyed. Thus, in many cases, the demolition of the ancestral seat, strongly entwined with the family's history and identity, followed the earlier loss of the family's London house.|$|E

The winner, Michael Loam, built one for the proprietors of the Tresavean Mine, in Lanner near Redruth. He used a double-rod design, driven by a waterwheel. In October of that year Loam proposed that the water wheel {{be replaced by a}} steam engine. A 36-inch bore, 6-foot stroke, double-action steam engine was employed, through reduction spur gearing of 5:1. At the same time the stroke of the man-engine beams was increased from 6feet to 12. Coal consumption was 24hundredweight (1,200kg) per day; the engine was in use for only six hours a day, but the boiler was kept at operating temperature continuously. The miners' journey time (in either direction) was reduced from about an hour to twenty-four minutes and output per shift increased by one fifth.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} legal instruments {{for the promotion}} of renewable energy are Law 25,019 from 1998 and Law 26,190 from 2007. The 1998 law, known as the “National Wind and Solar Energy Rules”, declared wind and solar generation of national interest and introduced a mechanism that established an additional payment per generated kWh which, in 1998, meant a 40% premium over market price. It also granted certain tax exemptions for a period of 15 years from the law's promulgation. The 2007 Law complemented the previous one, declaring of national interest the generation of electricity from any renewable source intended to deliver a public service. This law also set an 8% target for renewable energy consumption in the period of 10 years and mandated the creation of a trust fund whose resources will be allocated to pay <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> electricity produced from renewable sources.|$|E
25|$|In May 1889, the Department of the Navy invited {{proposals}} {{for the construction}} of three cruisers of about 2,000 tons displacement each, at a cost of not more than $700,000 each. When the bids were opened on August 22 of that year, Bath Iron Works and William Cramp & Sons submitted bids that were over the limit fixed by Congress in the act of September 1888, and it was decided to re-advertise for proposals. The revised terms reduced the required speed from 18 knots to 17 knots and set <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> increased speed at $23,000 lor each quarter-knot in excess of the required speed of 17 knots; a penalty of $25,000 was set for every quarter-knot short of the required speed and in case of failure to develop and maintain a speed of 16 knots for four hours straight, the vessels could be rejected. The time fixed for completion was also extended from two years to two years and six mouths.|$|E

500|$|The glut was {{replaced}} with a shortage when most federal coins were hoarded amid the economic chaos of the Civil War. Slowest to vanish was the base-metal cent, which only had value because government said it did, and at that time, confidence in government was shaken. [...] Eventually, it too vanished from circulation and commanded <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> change. A variety of makeshifts replaced the vanished coins, such as fractional currency and merchant's tokens. Beginning in 1864, Congress began to authorize base metal coins {{that would not be}} hoarded. [...] It reduced the weight of the cent, causing it to be made of bronze, and also required a two-cent piece of the same metal. [...] The following year saw the initiation of the three-cent nickel and in 1866, the five-cent nickel (today simply known as the nickel) began production. The two-cent piece, initially popular, saw declining mintages as the public preferred the smaller, more convenient nickel coins.|$|E
500|$|In the 1870s and 1880s, public {{interest}} {{grew in the}} low-mintage gold dollar. [...] Collecting coins was becoming more popular, {{and a number of}} numismatists put aside some gold dollars and hoped for increases in value. The Mint most likely channeled its production through some favored Philadelphia dealers, though proof coins could be purchased for $1.25 at the cashier's window at the Philadelphia facility. Banks charged <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> circulation strikes. [...] They were popular in the jewelry trade, mounted into various items. [...] The coins were often exported to China or Japan, where such jewelry was made. [...] The dollars were often damaged in the process; the Mint refused to sell into this trade and did its best to hinder it. Nevertheless, Mint officials concluded that jewelers were successful at getting the majority of each issue. Proof mintages exceeded 1,000 by 1884, and remained above that mark {{for the remainder of the}} series, numbers likely inflated by agents of jewelers, willing to pay the Mint's premium of $.25 per coin. Another use for the gold dollar was as a holiday gift; after its abolition the quarter eagle became a popular present.|$|E
500|$|The Philadelphia Mint {{released}} the new cents {{to the public}} on May 25, 1857. In anticipation of large popular demand, Mint authorities built a temporary wooden structure {{in the courtyard of}} the Philadelphia facility. On the morning of the date of release, hundreds of people queued, one line for those exchanging Spanish silver for cents, the other for those bringing in old copper cents and half cents. From 9 am, clerks paid out cents for the old pieces; outside the Mint precincts, early purchasers sold the new cents at a premium. Snowden wrote to Guthrie, [...] "the demand for them is enormous… we had on hand this morning $30,000 worth, that is three million pieces. Nearly all of this amount will be paid out today." [...] The 1856 specimen became publicly known about the time of issuance, and had the public checking their pocket change; 1856 small cents sold for as much as $2 by 1859. The public interest in the new cents set off a coin collecting boom: in addition to seeking the rare 1856 cent, some tried to collect sets of large cents back to 1793, and found they would have to pay <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> the rarer dates.|$|E

500|$|Clydesdales {{are usually}} bay in colour, but a roaning pattern, black, grey, and {{chestnut}} also occur. Most have white markings, including {{white on the}} face, feet, legs and occasional body spotting (generally on the lower belly). [...] They also have extensive feathering on their lower legs. [...] Roaning, body spotting and extensive white markings {{are thought to be}} the result of sabino genetics. Some Clydesdale breeders want white face and leg markings without the spotting on the body. To attempt getting the ideal set of markings, they often breed horses with only one white leg to horses with four white legs and sabino roaning on their bodies. On average, the result is a foal with the desired amount of white markings. Clydesdales do not have the SB1 (Sabino 1) gene responsible for causing sabino expressions in many other breeds, and researchers theorise that several other genes are responsible for these patterns. Many buyers pay <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> bay and black horses, especially those with four white legs and white facial markings. Specific colours are often preferred over other physical traits, and some buyers even choose horses with soundness problems if they have the desired colour and markings. Roan horses are not preferred by buyers, despite one draught-breed writer theorizing that they are needed to keep the desired coat colours and texture. Breed associations, however, state that no colours are bad, and that horses with roaning and body spots are increasingly accepted.|$|E
