5|$|In {{the final}} {{months of the}} war, Hand {{increasingly}} supported President Woodrow Wilson's post-war foreign policy objectives. He believed the United States should endorse the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles, despite their flaws. This position estranged him from Croly <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>at</b> The New Republic, who vehemently rejected both. Alienated from his old circle on the magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist mood of the country, Hand found himself politically homeless.|$|E
5|$|The Bates {{method has}} been criticized not only {{because there is no}} good {{evidence}} it works, but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight, put themselves <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>at</b> risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} and popularization of the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) in mid-1980s (by Kary Mullis <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>at</b> Cetus Corp.) marked another watershed {{in the history of}} modern biotechnology, greatly increasing the ease and speed of genetic analysis. Coupled with the use of expressed sequence tags, PCR led to the discovery of many more genes than could be found through traditional biochemical or genetic methods and opened the possibility of sequencing entire genomes.|$|E

5|$|Andrea Rita Dworkin (September 26, 1946– April 9, 2005) was an American radical {{feminist and}} writer {{best known for}} her {{criticism}} of pornography, which she argued was linked to rape and other forms of violence against women. Her views were widely criticized by liberal feminists <b>and</b> <b>others.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, she maintained a dialogue with political conservatives, and wrote a topically-related book, Right-Wing Women. After suffering abuse from her first husband, she was introduced to radical feminist literature, and began writing Woman Hating. Coming to New York, she became an activist on several issues and a writer, eventually publishing 10 books on feminism.|$|E
5|$|As Grant {{continued}} to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led {{a group to}} meet with Lincoln, Seward, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>at</b> Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as {{he walked through the}} city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but freedmen greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over.|$|E

5|$|Cameron began acting at age nine, and {{his first}} job was in an {{advertisement}} for a breakfast cereal. His first starring role was at age 13, in the television series Two Marriages. At this age, he appeared in several television shows and films. He became famous in 1985 after being cast as Mike Seaver in the ABC television sitcom Growing Pains. In the series, Mike would eventually have a girlfriend named Kate MacDonald, played by Chelsea Noble, Cameron's future wife. Cameron subsequently became a teen heartthrob in the late 1980s, while appearing {{on the covers of}} several teen magazines, including Tiger Beat, Teen Beat, 16 <b>and</b> <b>others.</b> <b>At</b> the time, he was making $50,000 a week. He was also in a 60-second Pepsi commercial during Super Bowl XXIV.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses inhabit various {{regions of}} the ocean, {{including}} coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in the intertidal zone <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>at</b> abyssal depths. Most species grow fast, mature early and are short-lived. During breeding, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies. The female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies.|$|E
5|$|This {{decompression}} {{model was}} developed by D.E. Yount <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>at</b> the University of Hawaii to model laboratory observations of bubble formation and growth in both inanimate and in vivo systems exposed to pressure variations. It presumes that microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in aqueous media, including living tissues. These bubble nuclei are spherical gas phases that are small enough to remain in suspension yet strong enough to resist collapse, their stability being provided by an elastic surface layer consisting of surface-active molecules with variable gas permeability. These skins resist the effect of surface tension, as surface tension tends to collapse a small bubble by raising internal pressure above ambient so that the partial pressure gradient favours diffusion out of the bubble in inverse proportion to the radius of the surface.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1985, a group {{including}} astronomer Fred Hoyle and physicist Lee Spetner {{published a}} series of papers claiming that the feathers on the Berlin and London specimens of Archaeopteryx were forged. Their claims were repudiated by Alan J. Charig <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>at</b> the Natural History Museum in London. Most of their evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of lithification; for example, they proposed that, based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers, feather impressions were applied to {{a thin layer of}} cement, without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference. They also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather, when visibly this is not the case. In addition, they claimed that the other specimens of Archaeopteryx known at the time did not have feathers, which is incorrect; the Maxberg and Eichstätt specimens have obvious feathers.|$|E
5|$|Carte finally {{assembled}} a syndicate in 1877 and formed the Comedy Opera Company {{to launch a}} series of original English comic operas, beginning with a third collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, The Sorcerer, in November 1877. This work was a modest success, and H.M.S. Pinafore followed in May 1878. Despite a slow start, mainly due to a scorching summer, Pinafore became a red-hot favourite by autumn. After a dispute with Carte over the division of profits, the other Comedy Opera Company partners hired thugs to storm the theatre one night to steal the sets and costumes, intending to mount a rival production. The attempt was repelled by stagehands <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>at</b> the theatre loyal to Carte, and Carte continued as sole impresario of the newly renamed D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Indeed, Pinafore was so successful that over a hundred unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte tried {{for many years to}} control the American performance copyrights over their operas, without success.|$|E
5|$|Constantin von Tischendorf, {{who worked}} with {{numerous}} Bible manuscripts, was known as somewhat flamboyant, and had ambitiously sought money from several royal families for his ventures, who had indeed funded his trips. Simonides, whose name may be a synonym mocking Tischendorf, had a somewhat obscure history, as he claimed he was at Mt. Athos in the years preceding Tischendorf's contact, making the claim at least plausible. Simonides also claimed his father had died and the invitation to Mt. Athos came from his uncle, a monk there, but subsequent letters to his father were found among his possessions at his death. While the word 'forgery' has been bandied about among scholars regarding the claims on the Sinaiticus by Tischendorf, perhaps a more accurate rendering would be recollation and 'adjusted' restoration as Simonides, an expert on hieroglyphics which are represented throughout the Sinaiticus. Simonides claimed the false nature of the document in The Guardian in an exchange of letters among scholars <b>and</b> <b>others,</b> <b>at</b> the time. Henry Bradshaw, a British librarian known to both men, defended the Tischendorf find of the Sinaiticus, casting aside the accusations of Simonides. Since Bradshaw was a social 'hub' among many diverse scholars of the day, his aiding of Tischendorf was given much weight. Simonides died shortly after, and the issue lay dormant for many years.|$|E

5|$|During the {{production}} of A Bug's Life, a public feud erupted between DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Pixar's Steve Jobs and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation. After DreamWorks' acquisition of Pacific Data Images (PDI)—long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation—Lasseter <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>at</b> Pixar were dismayed {{to learn from the}} trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called Antz. By this time, Pixar's project was well-known within the animation community. Both Antz and A Bug's Life center on a young male, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas A Bug's Life relied chiefly on visual gags, Antz was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of Antz was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.|$|E
5|$|In the {{entertainment}} sector various ploys {{were used to}} attract tourists. In 1920 an annual beauty contest, named the Pageant of Pulchritude (also known as the Miss Universe contest) in 1926, was started in Galveston by C.E. Barfield, manager of a local amusement park owned by the Maceos. The contest was part of Splash Day, the kick-off of the summer tourist season each year, {{and became the first}} international beauty contest, attracting participants from England, Russia, Turkey, and many other nations until its demise in 1932. This contest is said to have served {{as a model for the}} modern Miss America pageant <b>and</b> <b>others.</b> <b>At</b> its height the pageant tripled the island's population the weekend it ran. Even after the international contest's closing, Splash Day was revived in various forms and continued to attract tourists. Other annual events included an extravagant Mardi Gras celebration in spring. The grand Buccaneer Hotel was constructed in 1929 creating an additional hotel landmark to compete with the Galvez (in addition to many other smaller hotel venues).|$|E
