25|$|<b>Average</b> <b>load</b> factor, {{in transit}} systems, is {{the ratio of}} the total number of riders to the total {{theoretical}} capacity. A transit vehicle running at full capacity has a 100% load factor, while an empty vehicle has 0% load factor. If a transit vehicle spends half the time running at 100% and half the time running at 0%, the <b>average</b> <b>load</b> factor is 50%. Higher <b>average</b> <b>load</b> factor corresponds to lower energy consumption per passenger, so designers attempt to maximize this metric.|$|E

25|$|The joint Hunting—Airwork Safari/colonial coach {{service from}} London to Nairobi routed via Malta, Wadi Halfa, Khartoum, Juba and Entebbe. It {{utilised}} single-class 27-seat Vikings, which took {{three days to}} complete the journey. Although this compared unfavourably with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), whose regular scheduled services took only 24 hours, load factors averaged 93% during {{the first nine months}} of operation. Hunting-Clan and Airwork continued to achieve very high <b>average</b> <b>load</b> factors of 85-90% because their £98 single fare was £42 cheaper than the comparable BOAC fare. These load factors were much higher than BOAC's, as a result of which the independents doubled the flight frequency on their London-Nairobi Safari/colonial coach route to once-a-week. This service proved to be so popular that a second weekly frequency was eventually added, which was operated alternately by each airline.|$|E
25|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{average annual}} daily traffic (AADT) {{numbers for the}} year 2011 show some variety in the average daily traffic load numbers as the route travels north. The traffic load averages start at their high point on the route, {{with an average of}} 16,530 {{vehicles}} using the short stretch between SR140 and the start of the Birmingham Highway portion. Those numbers then steadily decrease as SR372 heads north, going from 9,390 initially down to just over 3,000 as Cherokee County approaches. The <b>average</b> <b>load</b> stays between 3,000 and 3,500 south of SR20, climbs to 5,500 north of SR20, and goes up once more to around 6,200 north of SR369. The area south of, and into, Ball Ground sees an average vehicle load of between 7,000 and 7,500, cresting once more at 8,680 heading north out of downtown towards I-575/SR5/SR515. However, the short stretch that feeds directly into the aforementioned state route only carries 3,900 vehicles per day, illustrating that the feeder route into SR5 south of Ball Ground sees heavier traffic than this northern spur.|$|E
25|$|In {{and around}} Jasper, where SR53 is {{concurrent}} with SR5/SR515, the route carries between 14,000 and 24,000 vehicles, before rapidly decreasing again to an <b>average</b> <b>load</b> of around 5,000 while concurrent with SR108. SR53 then sees the lowest average vehicle load {{on its way}} across north Georgia between Pickens County and Dawson County, where the averages drop to around 2,500 vehicles per day. Traffic picks up again west of Dawsonville, and reaches numbers of around 13,000 where the route feeds Dawson County and Forsyth County traffic to SR400. Once the route crosses into Hall County and approaches Gainesville, numbers increase yet again to around 23,000 vehicles per day north and into Gainesville, and reach nearly 28,000 vehicles as the route feeds I-985. The averages drop rapidly south of I-985 to around 7,000 as the route approaches Jackson County, and the average only increases again to around 10,000 as SR53 feeds I-85 and then approaches Winder in Barrow County. South and east of Winder, averages drop down to between 3,500 and 5,000 vehicles per day, but then increase one last time to just under 16,000 in Watkinsville, as the route reaches its eastern terminus.|$|E

There are similar deformation features in both the conventional splitting tests and uniaxial compression tests. The stress-strain curves include compaction, elasticity, yielding, and failure stage. Both the vertical deformation and horizontal deformation of splitting fatigue tests under constant <b>average</b> <b>loading</b> can be divided into three stages of “loosening-tightness-loosening. ” The failure modes of splitting fatigue tests under the variational <b>average</b> <b>loading</b> are not controlled by the fracturing process curve of the conventional splitting tests.

25|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{average annual}} daily traffic (AADT) {{numbers for the}} year 2011 show a variety of daily averages across SR20. The traffic load on the highway starts at its lowest daily <b>average</b> <b>load</b> as the route starts into Floyd County, where numbers hover around 5,400 {{vehicles}} per day. These averages increase rapidly as the highway approaches Rome, going from around 12,000 vehicles to a peak of 38,000 vehicles in downtown Rome. As SR20 becomes concurrent with US27/SR1, the numbers decrease {{to an average of}} 32,000, and then decrease more rapidly to around 15,000 as SR20 heads east out of Rome. The vehicle load stays in that area all the way through Floyd County and into Bartow County, as the highway is the main west-to-east thoroughfare between Rome and Cartersville. In Cartersville, where the highway is concurrent with US41, the vehicle count reaches a zenith of just over 41,000, but then drops off sharply as the highway heads into rural Cherokee County, dipping just below 10,000 before increasing again to near 24,000 vehicles per day as it approaches I-575/SR5. On the portion of the highway that is concurrent with I-575/SR5, the highway sees its maximum vehicle load of just over 54,000 vehicles, again dropping rapidly east of I-575/SR5, going from around 24,000 down to 11,000, and further down to around 10,000 as the Forsyth County line is reached.|$|E
