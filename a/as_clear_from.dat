60|$|Mark was walking, with an {{impatient}} step, towards the neck just mentioned, {{and which was}} at no great distance from the ship-yard, when his eye was attracted towards a sandy beach of several acres in extent, that spread itself along {{the margin of the}} rocks, <b>as</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> every impurity as it was a few hours before, when it had been raised from out of the bosom of the ocean. To him, it appeared that water was trickling through this sand, coming from beneath the lava of the Reef. At first, he supposed it was merely the remains of some small portion of the ocean that had penetrated to a cavity within, and which was now trickling back through the crevices of the rocks, to find its level, under the great law of nature. But it looked so pleasant to see once more water of any sort coming upwards from the earth, that the young man jumped down upon the sands, and hastened to the spot for further inquiry. Scooping up a little of the water in the hollow of his hand, he found it sweet, soft, and deliciously cool. Here was a discovery, indeed! The physical comfort for which he most pined was thus presented to him, as by a direct gift from heaven; and no miser who had found a hoard of hidden gold, could have felt so great pleasure, or a tenth part of the gratitude, of our young hermit, if hermit we may call one who did not voluntarily seek his seclusion from the world, and who worshipped God less as a penance than from love and adoration.|$|E

40|$|Traditional Çanakkale {{ceramics}} {{is a kind}} of {{folk art}} which originated from the turkification of Anatolia and the cultural synthesis between the Aegean islands. It is well-known that it had its genesis in the influential Seljukian art.

Lesbos’s and Akköy’s white slip decoration share similarities, which forms a natural bond between Lesvos and Akköy for Çanakkale. Wars and war-induced migrations caused cultural exchanges, which also affected coastal settlements in Western Anatolia and the Greek islands. Till the productions and widespread use of the plastic materials, the bond between agricultural and commercial activities and ceramic products is important. This bond is an integral part of the ongoing interaction between the two shores. The ceramics of this interaction have survived as witnesses of the similarities till now...|$|E
40|$|Regional {{economies are}} {{continuously}} evolving shifting from more traditional manufacturing toward more service-oriented production systems. Despite the increasing relevance of services, however, {{the analysis of}} innovation at the regional aggregate level has mainly focused on manufacturing, gathering the attention {{on the role of}} R&D expenditure as input in the production process and, in some cases, accounting for research-based knowledge externalities. In this paper the role of Knowledge Intensive Business Services is studied and their contribution to the regional aggregate innovation is evaluated. The aim is twofold. First is to provide insights on the role covered by KIBS as a second knowledge infrastructure. Second is to examine the extent to which KIBS operate as bridges between the general purpose analytical knowledge produced by scientific universities and more specific requirement of innovative firms. A role commonly acknowledged to KIBS is in fact that of knowledge transferors. If on the one side it is however clear to whom they transfer knowledge, their client firms, on the other it is not <b>as</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> whom the knowledge is originally transferred. For this reason a major attention in this work is dedicated to scientific universities considered as a primary source of knowledge. Being this knowledge analytical and highly codified, it probably can be more easily accessed by nearby located firms having higher opportunities of research collaboration and less easily by firms located in different regions. It is argued that KIBS, in transferring knowledge from universities to firms, are therefore specially important in the latter case. To test hese hypothesis a knowledge production function is estimated for a sample of 200 EU NUTS II regions including also information of university research and KIBS concentration. Parameters are estimated using the heteroschedasticity-consistent G 2 SLS estimator for spatial models and the evidence suggests that the contribution of KIBS to regional innovation is considerable. In fact accounting for the knowledge embedded in business services can considerably contribute to explain the cross-regional variation in innovative activities. Furthermore it is find that the KIBS contribution is more sizeable in regions in which there are not scientific universities. The highlighted results have important policy implications asking to rethink to how much effective an R&D-centered innovation strategy could be, at least in some regions...|$|E

50|$|At higher dosages of 100 to 200 mg/day, {{absorption}} of bicalutamide is approximately linear, {{with a small}} but increasing departure from linearity above 150 mg/day. In terms of geometric mean steady-state concentrations of (R)-bicalutamide, the departures from linearity were 4%, 13%, 17%, and 32% with dosages of 100, 150, 200, and 300 mg/day, respectively. There is a plateau in steady-state levels of (R)-bicalutamide with bicalutamide dosages above 300 mg/day, and, accordingly, dosages of bicalutamide of 300 to 600 mg/day result in similar circulating concentrations of (R)-bicalutamide and similar degrees clinically of efficacy, tolerability, and toxicity. Relative to 150 mg/day bicalutamide, levels of (R)-bicalutamide are about 15% higher at a dosage of 200 mg/day and about 50% higher at a dosage of 300 mg/day.
