5|$|After a B cell {{produces}} a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (<b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> allelic exclusion) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only {{one kind of}} variable chain.|$|E
5|$|Forty leagues (120nautical {{miles or}} around 220km) {{to the east}} of Surinam, Low and his fleet of two ships (the Rose Pink and the Fancy, captained by a young Charles Harris) dropped anchor to remove growth such as seaweed and {{barnacles}} from the outside of the boats, in <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> careening, necessary because no dry dock was available to pirates.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being the primary energy source for plants, light functions as a signalling device, providing information to the plant, such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day. This can result in adaptive changes in <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> photomorphogenesis. Phytochromes are the photoreceptors in a plant that are sensitive to light.|$|E
50|$|Cyber threats {{remain a}} major concern for USTRANSCOM. Because of its {{extensive}} use of commercial capabilities, nearly 90 percent of USTRANSCOM missions are executed over unclassified and commercial networks. USTRANSCOM’s Joint Cyber Center (JCC) uses <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>knows</b> <b>as</b> the Cyber Staff Estimate to assess risk, adjust defensive posture, and adopt operational or technical mitigations in performance of key missions. USTRANSCOM integrates cyber security language into a majority of its commercial contracts and co-chairs the National Defense Transportation Association Cybersecurity Committee.|$|R

50|$|Slabs {{constitute}} {{an important part}} of the global plate tectonic system. They drive plate tectonics - both by pulling along the lithosphere to which they are attached in <b>a</b> <b>processes</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> slab pull and by inciting currents in the mantle (slab suction). They cause volcanism due to flux melting of the mantle wedge, and they affect the flow and thermal evolution of the Earth's mantle. Their motion can cause dynamic uplift and subsidence of the Earth's surface, forming shallow seaways and potentially rearranging drainage patterns.|$|R
5|$|This {{section of}} the route was {{constructed}} through <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> twinning in which a second carriageway is built parallel to an existing road. In addition, existing intersections were rebuilt as grade-separated interchanges.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{numerous}} laws that {{form part of}} kashrut are the prohibitions on the consumption of certain animals (such as pork, shellfish (both Mollusca and Crustacea)) and most insects, {{with the exception of}} certain species of kosher locusts), mixtures of meat and milk, and the commandment to slaughter mammals and birds according to <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> shechita. There are also laws regarding agricultural produce that might impact the suitability of food for consumption.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> melting– to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E

5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E
5|$|At first, most of {{the newly}} settled Normans kept {{household}} knights and did not settle their retainers with fiefs of their own, but gradually these household knights came to be granted lands of their own, <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> subinfeudation. William also required his newly created magnates to contribute fixed quotas of knights towards not only military campaigns but also castle garrisons. This method of organising the military forces was {{a departure from the}} pre-Conquest English practice of basing military service on territorial units such as the hide.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E

5|$|Even {{more complex}} {{morphological}} changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, Myxobacteria detect surrounding cells in <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; {{this type of}} cooperation is a simple type of multicellular organisation. For example, about one in ten cells migrate {{to the top of}} a fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|File shells such as Limaria fragilis {{can produce}} a noxious {{secretion}} when stressed. It has numerous tentacles which fringe its mantle and protrude {{some distance from the}} shell when it is feeding. If attacked, it sheds tentacles in <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> autotomy. The toxin released by this is distasteful and the detached tentacles continue to writhe which may also serve to distract potential predators.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s, the District's {{southern}} {{territory of}} Alexandria went into economic decline {{partly due to}} neglect by Congress. The city of Alexandria was a major market in the American slave trade, and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the District, further depressing the economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia {{to take back the}} land it had donated to form the District, through <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> retrocession.|$|E

5|$|Negombo Tamils, or Puttalam Tamils, {{are native}} Sri Lankan Tamils {{who live in}} the western Gampaha and Puttalam districts. The term does not apply to Tamil {{immigrants}} in these areas. They are distinguished from other Tamils by their dialects, one of which is known as the Negombo Tamil dialect, and by aspects of their culture such as customary laws. Most Negombo Tamils have assimilated into the Sinhalese ethnic group through <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Sinhalisation. Sinhalisation has been facilitated by caste myths and legends (see Passing (sociology)).|$|E
5|$|Regional geology accords that Dublin's {{hard water}} is well-suited to making stout, such as Guinness, while the Plzeň Region's soft water {{is ideal for}} brewing Pilsner (pale lager), such as Pilsner Urquell. The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which {{benefits}} making pale ale {{to such a degree}} that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Burtonisation.|$|E
5|$|Salamanders {{use their}} tails in defence {{and some are}} {{prepared}} to jettison them to save their lives in <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> autotomy. Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone {{at the base of}} the tail and use this strategy readily. The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails and limbs can be regenerated. Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.|$|E
