5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} nature <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent {{and can be}} difficult to meet in cultivation. As a result, most species are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made their way into the mainstream nursery business and can often be found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E
5|$|The {{critic and}} screenwriter Saeroen, writing for Pemandangan, praised Kedok Ketawa, {{especially}} its cinematography <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of its scenery; he compared {{the film to}} imported Hollywood films. An anonymous review in Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad found that the film was a mix of native and European sensibilities and lauded its cinematography. According to the review, the film surpassed expectations, but {{it was evident that}} this was a first production. Another review, in Soerabaijasch Handelsblad, considered the film among the best local productions, emphasising the quality of its cinematography and acting.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} soundtrack {{was highly}} praised; reviewers noted {{it as one}} of the best video game soundtracks of the year, praising the originality of the compositions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of Emi Evans' vocal work. The first arranged album, while also warmly received, was perceived by critics to be weaker than the original and not long enough to stand up to the expectations created by the success of the original. The first three albums sold well enough to be recorded on the Japanese Oricon music charts, reaching number 24 for the original soundtrack, 59 for the first arranged album, and position number 77 for the second.|$|E

While <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of mathematics is almost exclusively intelligible, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauties</b> of these arts primarily sensible, it is pointed out that the latter share with mathematics a certain kind of intelligible <b>beauty.</b> <b>The</b> paper also contains reflections on <b>the</b> formal <b>beauty</b> <b>and</b> timelessness of mathematics, beauty as richness flowing from simplicity, form and content in mathematics, and mathematics and fiction. It concludes with some remarks on the question of why mathematical beauty is so little appreciated by non-mathematicians...|$|R

There are plenty of the itacistic faults, especially the exchange of ει for ι and αι for ε. The exchange of ει and ο for ω is less frequent.|$|E

25|$|The Frau Residence {{has been}} classed {{as one of}} Silva's most {{reserved}} houses, architecturally, as it is relatively simple and not as richly detailed as others. Rather, it relies on scale and form, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of the classical elements themselves, more than upon the applied ornamentation to portray the prominence of the original residents. It also remains very faithful to the traditional vernacular house type of the region, in plan and in execution, resulting in a graceful, refined version of the one-storey, full-width front porch house of the southern coast of Puerto Rico. In addition to the local influences, Silva reflects {{the interests of the}} Arts and Crafts movement and the academicism of the Ecole des Beaux Arts in the facade treatment, resulting in an austere and grand, yet lightweight elevation. Thus, Silva, as had other foreign-trained architects, succeeded in integrating classical education with the traditional elements of the Spanish Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Chidambaram begins with Lord Shiva strolling into the Thillai Vanam (vanam meaning forest and thillai trees - botanical name Exocoeria agallocha, {{a species of}} {{mangrove}} trees - which currently grows in the Pichavaram wetlands near Chidambaram). In the Thillai forests resided a group of sages or 'rishis' who believed in the supremacy of magic and that God can be controlled by rituals and mantras or magical words. Lord Shiva strolled in the forest with resplendent beauty and brilliance, assuming the form of Bhikshatana, a simple mendicant seeking alms. He was followed by His consort, Vishnu as Mohini. The sages and their wives were enchanted by the brilliance <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of The handsome mendicant and His consort. On seeing their womenfolk enchanted, the rishis got enraged and invoked scores of serpents (nāgas) by performing magical rituals. Lord Shiva lifted the serpents and donned them as ornaments on His matted locks, neck and waist. Further enraged, the sages invoked a fierce tiger, whose skins and dons were used by Lord Shiva as a shawl around His waist and then followed by a fierce elephant, which was devoured and ripped to death by Lord Shiva (Gajasamharamurthy).|$|E

25|$|Today, {{the role}} of Trần Thủ Độ {{in the history of}} Vietnam is always a matter for debate between modern historians. For this reason, it was not until 2008 that a new street in Hanoi was named in honour of Trần Thủ Độ, a {{decision}} which is still met with some opposition from public opinion. Unlike his relatives Trần Hưng Đạo or Trần Quang Khải, the grand chancellor of the Trần Dynasty is worshipped in only one place in Hanoi which is the Cầu Đông Pagoda. However, {{on the occasion of the}} millenary anniversary of Hanoi, the Feature Film Studio 1 decided to invest 2.66 million USD for a 30-episode television movie named Trần Thủ Độ which will focus on his life and the turbulent period of the Late Lý and Early Trần Dynasty. In theatre, on the contrary, there were several plays which exploited the controversial role of Trần Thủ Độ in history such as Rừng trúc (Bamboo Forest) by the writer Nguyễn Huy Tưởng or Anh hùng và mỹ nhân (The Hero <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beauty)</b> by Chu Thơm. According to the stage director Lê Hùng, the life full of events of Trần Thủ Độ was a good source of inspiration in theatre because the play could focus on his inner feelings when Trần Thủ Độ had to act ruthlessly toward Lý clan for the benefit of his own Trần clan.|$|E
