The party's membership dramatically increased from perhaps a few thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E

25|$|In the {{commercial}} {{rhythm and blues}} music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, and saxophone. Arrangements were rehearsed {{to the point of}} effortlessness and were sometimes accompanied by background vocalists. Simple repetitive parts mesh, creating momentum and rhythmic interplay producing mellow, lilting, and often hypnotic textures while calling attention to no individual sound. While singers are emotionally engaged with the lyrics, often intensely so, they remain cool, relaxed, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>control.</b> The bands dressed in suits, and even uniforms, a practice associated with the modern popular music that rhythm and blues performers aspired to dominate.

40|$|Introduction: Blood vessel {{formation}} by angiogenesis {{is essential}} for goitre development. Angiopoietin 1 (Ang- 1),angiopoietin 2 (Ang- 2) and Tie- 2 receptor (rTie- 2) are involved in part of angiogenesis. Ang- 1 and rTie- 2 expressionincreases in goitre. Aim: To determine serum concentrations (SC) of angiogenic cytokines of patients with goitre treated surgically. Material and mathods: Thirty-six patients with goitre aged 29 - 64 were examined. They were divided into groups: nontoxicnodular goitre (NTNG) and toxic goitre (TG). Each group was divided into subgroups: before and after surgery. The control group comprised 10 healthy subjects. Ang- 1, Ang- 2 and rTie- 2 SC were measured in euthyroid subjects byELISA. Measurements were performed before the procedure and three months after. Results: Before surgery Ang- 1 median (Me) SC in patients with TG was higher than in patients with NTNG (109 368 pg/ml vs. 71 185 pg/ml) <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls</b> (109 368 pg/ml vs. 57 815 pg/ml). Ang- 1 Me in TG patients was higher prior tothan after surgery (109 368 pg/ml vs. 65380 pg/ml). Ang- 2 Me in TG patients was higher after than prior to surgery(4055 pg/ml vs. 3924 pg/ml). Significant correlations were found between Ang- 1 and Tie- 2 Me (r = 0. 53) and Ang- 2 and Tie- 2 (r = 0. 58) in patients with NTNG before surgery and between Me Ang- 2 <b>and</b> Tie- 2 <b>in</b> patients with NTNGafter surgery (r = 0. 89) <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls</b> (r = 0. 77). Conclusions: Before surgery in patients with TG SC of Ang- 1 was higher than in patients with NTNG <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls.</b> After surgery <b>in</b> patients with TG SC of Ang- 1 decreased, and SC of Ang- 2 increased.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the value of Pulsed-wave Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) <b>in</b> {{assessing}} diastolic <b>and</b> systolic function <b>in</b> patients with severe aortic value stenosis. Methods: Thirty-five patients with aortic stenosis (AS) (valve orifice less than or equal to 1 cm(2), mean age 71. 8 +/- 6. 2) and 35 comparable healthy subjects were studied. All subjects performed conventional 2 -dimensional Doppler echocardiography and DTI at mitral annulus level. Patients with AS were divided into 2 groups: 16 patients who presented initial signs of HF and a depressed left ventricular systolic funciton (AS 1) (EF: 35 %- 50 %) and 19 patients were asymptomatic and had normal left ventricular systolic function (EF > 50 %) (ASH). The 16 symptomatic AS patients underwent surgical aortic valve replacement and were examined after 1 year. Results: DTI was able to detect abnormalities of systolic <b>and</b> diastolic function <b>in</b> AS: the significantly lower peak S velocity in AS I than <b>in</b> AS II <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls,</b> both at septum and lateral wall level; the significantly lower peak E velocity in AS I than <b>in</b> AS H <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls</b> both at septum and lateral wall level; the significantly higher peak A velocity in AS I than <b>in</b> AS II <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls</b> both at septum and lateral wall level; the significant lower E/A ratio in AS I than <b>in</b> AS U <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls</b> both at septum and lateral wall level. Conclusion: We found a significant inverse correlation between DTI lateral S velocity, DTI peak E velocity, lateral DTI E/A ratio, and AS peak and mean gradient. According to the results of this study we can affirm that DTI parameters surely had an important physiopathological impact in the knowledge of myocardial function in patients with severe aortic stenosis...|$|R

25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want to say no to sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>control,</b> they are limited in how they feel it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys {{do not know how to}} retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the work}} is often thought of as an unflattering and cold look at an ageing pope besieged by cunning and {{opportunistic}} relatives, the reality is more complex and the artist's intention more subtle.

It is widely accepted as one of the most politically difficult portrait commissions in art history, requiring an understanding of the interplay of relationships with a depth [...] "worthy of Shakespeare", in the opinion of art historians Rodolfo Pallucchini and Harold Wethey.
