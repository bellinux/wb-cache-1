5|$|Fatah {{dedicated}} {{itself to}} the liberation of Palestine by an <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> carried out by Palestinians themselves. This differed from other Palestinian political and guerrilla organizations, most of which firmly believed in a united Arab response. Arafat's organization never embraced the ideologies of the major Arab governments of the time, in contrast to other Palestinian factions, which often became satellites of nations such as Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria and others.|$|E
5|$|The Java War (also {{called the}} China War or Chinese War) of 1741 to 1743 was an <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> by a joint Chinese and Javanese army against the Dutch colonial {{government}} {{that took place}} in central and eastern Java. Ending in victory for the Dutch, the war led to the fall of the Sultanate of Mataram and, indirectly, the founding of both the Sunanate of Surakarta and the Sultanate of Yogyakarta.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduation}} from CCNY, Shakur briefly joined the Black Panther Party (BPP). She soon left the party, disliking the macho {{behavior of the}} men and believing that the BPP lacked knowledge and understanding of United States black history. Shakur then joined the Black Liberation Army (BLA), an offshoot of the BPP whose members, inspired by the Vietcong and the Battle of Algiers, led a campaign of <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> against the U.S. government using tactics such as planting bombs, holding up banks and executing drug dealers and police.|$|E

5|$|The Malayan National Liberation Front (MNLF), an {{organisation}} of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM), {{was formed}} in 1968 to support {{the overthrow of the}} governments of Singapore and Malaysia. The countries had been declared independent in 1965, but the communists rejected their separation. From 1968 to 1974, the <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> included planting booby trap bombs in public places. The MNLF was also involved in collecting supplies such as medicine, explosives and assorted equipment for the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), which was the military arm of the CPM operating in the border area of northern Malaysia and southern Thailand.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{arm of the}} Polish Underground State consisted {{primarily of}} various branches of the Armia Krajowa (AK) and, until 1942, the Union of <b>Armed</b> <b>Struggle.</b> This arm of the state was designed to prepare the Polish society for a future fight for the country's liberation. Apart from armed resistance, sabotage, intelligence, training, and propaganda, the state's military arm was responsible for maintaining communication with the London-based government in exile, and for protecting the civilian arm of the state.|$|E
5|$|After {{attending}} a public celebration of HSS leader Vladko Maček's birthday on 20 June 1935, Blažeković was imprisoned by Yugoslav authorities and tortured for twelve {{days in a}} prison {{on the island of}} Korčula. He was subsequently taken to Dubrovnik and charged with conspiring against the Yugoslav state, but was not convicted. In 1939, he joined the Ustaše, a Croatian fascist organization which advocated <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> in achieving Croatia's independence from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During this period, he came into contact with the fascist leader Slavko Kvaternik. From late 1940 to early 1941, Blažeković was pursued by Yugoslav authorities because of his association with the Ustaše and hid in Zagreb to avoid capture.|$|E
50|$|In India, various Maoist-oriented factions (generally called Naxalites) have waged <b>armed</b> <b>struggles</b> {{since the}} Naxalbari {{rebellion}} of 1967. Today, {{the most prominent}} Naxalite group is the Communist Party of India (Maoist).|$|R
50|$|The area got in {{the centre}} of 2nd world war {{military}} activities from 1944 onward and the fights lasted {{until the end of}} the war. The population was evacuated and the <b>armed</b> <b>struggles</b> came to an end only on March 21, 1945.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} decade of <b>armed</b> <b>struggles,</b> there was some {{coordination}} between factions. However, in most cases, different bands fought independently. Even in 1953, a year when Cambodia gained independence, the anti-French war was still led by disparate leaders, divided geographically and ideologically.|$|R
5|$|Although Hananu's revolt {{was largely}} suppressed, a {{low-level}} insurgency involving small ′iṣābāt persisted in Aleppo's countryside. Al-Sa'dun and Uwaid opted {{to continue the}} <b>armed</b> <b>struggle,</b> fleeing to the coastal mountains {{and from there to}} Turkey in December 1921. From the frontier area with Syria, they staged hit-and-run attacks against French forces. With 100 of his fighters, al-Sa'dun entered Jabal Zawiya in the summer of 1922 to punish those who defected from the rebels or residents who switched allegiance. On 26 August, al-Sa'dun's ′iṣābā assaulted a postal convoy in al-Darakiya, a village between Darkush and Antioch. In 1923, rebel commander Aqil al-Saqati and ten of his fighters launched numerous attacks against the French, including an assault against a government building in al-Safira, southeast of Aleppo, and Jisr al-Hadid near Antakya.|$|E
5|$|As prosperous as {{the region}} was, {{it was not}} unharmed by the {{constant}} Ottoman–Habsburg wars and was often the target of Turkish, Tatar and Hungarian rebel raids. By the 1630s, {{the idea of an}} organized anti-Ottoman revolt had reached the town of Chiprovtsi. In his 1650 account to the senate of the Republic of Venice Petar Parchevich described the long preparations for an <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> and the support-seeking visits of his fellow townsmen to the kings of Poland and Austria. Since then, the inhabitants of Chiprovtsi waited for the suitable moment when {{they would be able to}} instigate an effective uprising and continued to co-operate with the leaders of the European realms.|$|E
5|$|Cracks in the {{cooperation}} between Poland and Lithuania {{after the death}} of Vytautas in 1430 had offered the Knights a revived opportunity for interference in Poland. Władysław supported his brother Švitrigaila as grand duke of Lithuania, but when Švitrigaila, {{with the support of the}} Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus' nobles, rebelled against Polish overlordship in Lithuania, the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki of Kraków, occupied Podolia, which Władysław had awarded to Lithuania in 1411, and Volhynia. In 1432, a pro-Polish party in Lithuania elected Vytautas's brother Žygimantas as grand duke, leading to an <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> over the Lithuanian succession which stuttered on for years after Władysław's death.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{districts of}} Balochistan {{are no longer}} {{considered}} safe for journalists, and are becoming dangerous places to report from.

5000|$|In the Bangladesh Liberation War, Bengali-speaking police {{officers}} participated with the citizens, leading to deaths from most ranks, fighting with [...]303 rifles against the Pakistani. The resistance by the Bengali members of police at Rajarbagh {{is considered the}} first chapter of <b>armed</b> <b>struggles</b> during the War of Independence.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{observers}} {{believed that}} this new revolutionary struggle was initiated with {{the influence of the}} Socialist Republic of Vietnam. They believed that the Vietnam Communist Party, backed by the Soviet Union, had agreed to provide logistical and propaganda support to the [...] "new faction" [...] groups, such as Betong West and Sadao Group. Later it was found out that the Betong West and the Sadao Group ceased to exist not long after they broke away from the main groups. These groups realised that their <b>armed</b> <b>struggles</b> could not achieve any success. The West Betong and the Sadao groups then decided to surrender themselves to the Thai Government in early 1987. After that time, the MCP <b>arms</b> <b>struggles</b> and militant activities became weak and disintegrated with no clear political or military objective.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{political}} differences among factions in the Polish exile government, and in particular, SZP {{ties to the}} Sanacja regime which dominated the Polish government since mid-1920s, the SZP was reorganized into the Union of <b>Armed</b> <b>Struggle</b> (Związek Walki Zbrojnej, ZWZ) on 13 November 1939. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski supported that move, aiming to include parties marginalized by the Sanacja regime, and supported {{the formation of the}} Main Political Council (Główna Rada Polityczna, GRP). Sikorski named General Kazimierz Sosnkowski the head of the ZWZ and Colonel Stefan Rowecki was appointed the commander of the ZWZ German occupation zone. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski became the commander of the ZWZ Soviet zone, but was arrested in March 1940 by the Soviets when attempting to cross the new German-Soviet border. In June Sikorski appointed Rowecki as the commander of both zones.|$|E
5|$|He became {{active in}} an <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> against the Ottoman {{government}} and Kurdish irregulars {{in the late}} 1880s. Andranik joined the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktustyun) party and, along with other fedayi (militias), sought to defend the Armenian peasantry living in their ancestral homeland, an area known as Western (or Turkish) Armeniaat the time part of the Ottoman Empire. His revolutionary activities ceased and he left the Ottoman Empire after the unsuccessful uprising in Sasun in 1904. In 1907, Andranik left Dashnaktustyun because he disapproved of its cooperation with the Young Turks, a party which years later perpetrated the Armenian Genocide. Between 1912 and 1913, together with Garegin Nzhdeh, Andranik led a few hundred Armenian volunteers within the Bulgarian army against the Ottomans during the First Balkan War.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} begins on November 3, 1966 with Guevara {{arriving}} in Bolivia {{disguised as a}} middle-aged representative of the Organization of American States hailing from Uruguay, who subsequently drives into the mountains to meet his men. The film is organized {{by the number of}} days {{that he was in the}} country. On Day 26, there is solidarity among Guevara's men despite his status as a foreigner. By Day 67, Guevara, however, has been set up for betrayal. He tries to recruit some peasants only to be mistaken for a cocaine smuggler, and the Bolivian Communist Party, led by Mario Monje, refuse to support the <b>armed</b> <b>struggle.</b> On Day 100, there is a shortage of food and Guevara exercises discipline to resolve conflicts between his Cuban and Bolivian followers.|$|E
50|$|He {{participated in}} the {{preparation}} of the Kościuszko Uprising, but did not partake in any <b>armed</b> <b>struggles.</b> He was sent with a secret diplomatic mission to the royal court in Vienna, but was arrested by the Austrian authorities.

50|$|After the {{armistice}} with the Allies, some 650,000 {{members of the}} Italian armed forces who refused {{to side with the}} occupying Germans were interned in concentration and labour camps. Of these, around 50,000 died while imprisoned or while under transportation. A further 29,000 died in <b>armed</b> <b>struggles</b> against the Germans while resisting capture immediately following {{the armistice}}.|$|R
5|$|The year of 1964 {{marked a}} decisive {{turning point in}} the Vietnam War. Following the ousting of President Ngô Đình Diệm in 1963, South Vietnam's top army generals {{continued}} to vie with each other for control of the country’s military-dominated government instead of combating the emerging forces of the National Liberation Front, also known as the Viet Cong. The fragility of the South Vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield, where its military experienced great setbacks against the Viet Cong. Taking advantage of Saigon's political instability, Communist leaders in Hanoi began preparing for war. Even though key members of North Vietnam's Politburo disagreed on the best strategy to reunite their country, they ultimately went ahead to prepare for <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> against South Vietnam and their American supporters.|$|E
5|$|Writing for RT, Afshin Rattansi {{speculated that}} if 14 August protests are met with state violence, then {{it could be}} one of the last times Bahraini activists use {{peaceful}} means to seek democratic change and that other methods could include an <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> in the same way the anti-apartheid movement led by Nelson Mandela deployed armed tactics after peaceful protests failed to bring about change. Jean Shaoul wrote in the World Socialist Web Site that the concurrent timing of crackdown in Bahrain and Egypt was not a coincidence and that evidence showed it was coordinated by the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Van, {{one of the}} largest cities in Turkish (Western) Armenia, Khrimian became a celibate priest (vardapet) in 1854 {{after the death of his}} wife and daughter. In the 1850s and 1860s he served as the abbot of two {{important}} monasteries in Turkish Armenia: Varagavank near Van and Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush. During this period he established schools and journals in both monasteries. He served as Patriarch of Constantinople—the most influential figure within the Ottoman Armenian community—from 1869 to 1873 and resigned due to pressure from the Ottoman government which saw him as a threat. He was the head of the Armenian delegation at the 1878 Congress of Berlin. Returning from Europe, he encouraged Armenian peasants to follow the example of Christian Balkan peoples by launching an <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> for autonomy or independence from the Ottoman Turks.|$|E
50|$|On February 16, 1831, in the State of San Salvador, {{the title}} of “villa” was conferred to Chalatenango, in {{recognition}} of the important services given by this area in the process of independence and the <b>armed</b> <b>struggles</b> of 1827 and 1829 that ended in the reestablishment of constitutional order in Central America (Plan Estratégico de Desarrollo Municipal de Chalatenango).|$|R
50|$|The Thousand Days' War (1899-1902) {{was one of}} {{the many}} <b>armed</b> <b>struggles</b> between the Liberal and Conservative Parties which devastated Colombia, {{including}} Panama, during the 19th century. This last civil war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Wisconsin. However, the Liberal leader Victoriano Lorenzo refused to accept the terms of the agreement and was executed on May 15, 1903.|$|R
50|$|Soon afterwards, the Vietnamese guided-Issaraks {{formed the}} Khmer Issarak Association, {{continuing}} <b>armed</b> <b>struggles</b> against the Khmer authorities. In the 1950s, the Viet Minh controlled-Issarak groups eventually transformed into communist organizations, for instance, the Khmer People’s Revolution Party (KPRP). Several significant {{figures in the}} Democratic Kampuchea {{who participated in the}} Cambodian Civil War, were closely related to the Viet Minh influenced-Issaraks.|$|R
5|$|Bulgarian {{nationalism}} gradually {{emerged during}} the mid-19th century with the economic upsurge of Bulgarian merchants and craftsmen, the development of Bulgarian-funded popular education, the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian Church and political actions towards {{the formation of a}} separate Bulgarian state. The First and Second Serbian Uprisings had laid the foundation of an autonomous Serbia during the late 1810s, and Greece had been established as an independent state in 1832, {{in the wake of the}} Greek War of Independence. However, support for gaining independence through an <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> against the Ottomans was not universal. Revolutionary sentiment was concentrated largely among the more educated and urban sectors of the populace. There was less support for an organized revolt among the peasantry and the wealthier merchants and traders, who feared that Ottoman reprisals would jeopardize economic stability and widespread rural land ownership.|$|E
5|$|Farnese besieged Maastricht {{in command}} of 15,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry, 20 cannons and 4,000 sappers, joined later by 5,000 {{additional}} troops. In May, while the siege developed, peace talks were held at Cologne under the mediation of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf to preserve {{the unity of the}} Netherlands. However, divisions become more serious during the process. In Brussels, fight erupted in early June between Catholics headed by Philip of Egmont, son of Lamoral of Egmont, whom the Royalist authorities had executed in 1568 and Calvinists under Olivier van den Tympel, resulting in the expulsion of Egmont and his supporters. At Mechelen, the Catholic inhabitants forced the Dutch garrison to leave, while in 's-Hertogenbosch an <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> resulted in the magistrates declaring support to the Royalist side. The revolt took a character of civil war, {{and as a result of}} the religious problem, the peace conference at Cologne failed. Henceforth, Farnese reconquered Flanders and the Brabant town after town, even forcing Antwerp to surrender after a long and exhausting siege in 1585.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{his wife}} Badia'a died and al-Hajj Muhammad {{was left with}} his four sons. With the killing of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim revivalist preacher and anti-colonial militant by British forces, {{tensions}} between the Palestinian Arab population, among whom al-Qassam was popular, and the authorities rose significantly. His sympathizers grew in number {{and the notion of}} <b>armed</b> <b>struggle</b> against British rule and British sponsorship of Zionism became increasingly popular {{as an alternative to the}} diplomatic negotiations between the Palestinian leadership and the British government. The negotiations were ultimately seen by the local population as a futile effort that bore no tangible results. When al-Hajj Muhammad actively took part in the upcoming revolt, he entrusted his children with his sister Halima, a widow. According to his eldest son Kamal, she too was a grain merchant, who later traded in textiles. She also financially supported the children's education. Al-Hajj Muhammad would normally meet with his sons for one or two days in different villages. His children would be escorted to his location by one of al-Hajj Muhammad's rebels.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} the financial {{implication of the}} <b>Arms</b> <b>struggle</b> in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria, using a sample of oil revenue accruable from daily crude production between 2006 and 2012. The study made use of both primary and secondary data. The data were analyzed and results estimated using the paired sample “t “ – Test statistic Model. The study reveals that there were significant losses in the oil revenue earnings aside from the numerous loss of life and properties {{as a result of}} <b>Arms</b> <b>struggle</b> in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The study consequently recommends that the federal Government should do more than empowering the youths of that region, and extend adequate and commensurate palliative measures to the elders whose lands have been destroyed by the activities of the oil companies, and most of whom are illiterates and above the trainable age unlike their youths, if it will completely discourage militancy in the Niger Delta region...|$|R
