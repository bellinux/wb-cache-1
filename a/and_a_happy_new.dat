60|$|The Christmas family-party that we mean, {{is not a}} mere {{assemblage}} of relations, got up at a week or two’s notice, originating this year, having no family precedent in the last, and {{not likely to be}} repeated in the next. No. It is an annual gathering of all the accessible members of the family, young or old, rich or poor; and all the children look forward to it, for two months beforehand, in a fever of anticipation. Formerly, it was held at grandpapa’s; but grandpapa getting old, and grandmamma getting old too, and rather infirm, they have given up house-keeping, and domesticated themselves with uncle George; so, the party always takes place at uncle George’s house, but grandmamma sends in most of the good things, and grandpapa always will toddle down, all the way to Newgate-market, to buy the turkey, which he engages a porter to bring home behind him in triumph, always insisting on the man’s being rewarded with a glass of spirits, over and above his hire, to drink ‘a merry Christmas <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> <b>new</b> year’ to aunt George. As to grandmamma, she is very secret and mysterious {{for two or three days}} beforehand, but not sufficiently so, to prevent rumours getting afloat that she has purchased a beautiful new cap with pink ribbons for each of the servants, together with sundry books, and pen-knives, and pencil-cases, for the younger branches; to say nothing of divers secret additions to the order originally given by aunt George at the pastry-cook’s, such as another dozen of mince-pies for the dinner, and a large plum-cake for the children.|$|E

After the toast has been drunk, and when the ladies have retired, Mr. Tupple requests that every gentleman will do him the favour of filling his glass, for he has a toast to propose: on which all the gentlemen cry ‘Hear! hear!’ and pass the decanters accordingly: and Mr. Tupple being informed by the master of the house that they are all charged, and waiting for his toast, rises, and begs to remind the gentlemen present, how much they have been delighted by the dazzling array of elegance and beauty which the drawing-room has exhibited that night, and how their senses have been charmed, and their hearts captivated, by the bewitching concentration of female loveliness which that very room has so recently displayed. (Loud cries of ‘Hear!’) Much as he (Tupple) would be disposed to deplore the absence of the ladies, on other grounds, he cannot but derive some consolation from the reflection that the very circumstance of their not being present, enables him to propose a toast, which he would have otherwise been prevented from giving—that toast he begs to say is—‘The Ladies!’ (Great applause.) The Ladies! among whom the fascinating daughters of their excellent host, are alike conspicuous for their beauty, their accomplishments, and their elegance. He begs them to drain a bumper to ‘The Ladies, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> <b>new</b> year to them!’ (Prolonged approbation; above which the noise of the ladies dancing the Spanish dance among themselves, overhead, is distinctly audible.) ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{described}} by the book jacket, [...] "Once Upon a Secret offers <b>a</b> new <b>and</b> personal depiction {{of one of our}} most iconic leaders <b>and</b> <b>a</b> powerful, moving story of a woman coming to terms with her past and moving out of the shadows to reclaim the truth." [...] Alford describes how she was completely swept away by Kennedy, losing her virginity to him during the fourth day of her service as an intern in the White House Press Office. But she also describes her struggles to overcome the occasional disingenuous nature of her treatment by the president, as well as the progression of her own dawning realization and guilt she later felt about the inescapable part she played in his life, and he in hers. Besides the relationship with the president, she also describes her unhappy first marriage and the emptiness of it. According to the New York Times, [...] "Ms. Alford claims to be completely purged of guilt, grief and baggage by the cleansing process of acknowledging past mistakes. <b>And</b> she describes <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> <b>new</b> marriage." [...] In terms of her defining such 'mistakes', however, the author's stated willingness to do again what she did, in the same circumstances, puts into perspective the genre of literature that her work represents, somewhat reminiscent of the media and publishing bonanza which followed reports of the relationship between US President Bill Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky.|$|R
