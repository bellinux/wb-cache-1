25|$|Articles 29 to 32 {{guarantee}} essential {{aspects of}} due process. Article 29 covers {{the rights to}} fair trial and to an effective remedy as provided for in articles six and thirteen of the ECHR. Specifically, it guarantees {{the right to be}} treated equally and fairly within a reasonable time in legal or <b>administrative</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the right to be heard, and the right of indigents to free legal representation (generally realised through appointed private counsel). The right to be heard notably covers the right to be informed about and to participate in all proceedings concerning oneself, the right to offer and to examine evidence (such as to call and question witnesses) and the right to a well-reasoned decision. Article 29 also prohibits the delay or denial of justice, or excessive formalism in its administration.|$|E
25|$|Articles 19 and 32-36 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child {{prohibits the}} {{exploitation}} of children in any form and in any context. Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse {{can be considered a}} victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, access to justice, with due procedural safeguards in any related legal or <b>administrative</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Children at risk of exploitation have to be identified and recognised as being at risk. This implies that {{they have a right to}} assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm resulting from the risks. Considering the difficulties of identifying children who have been trafficked and the broad protection against all forms and contexts of exploitation afforded under the Convention, a child rights-based approach prioritises the identification of child victims of exploitation or other crime and children at risk. Whether or not exploitation takes place in a context of trafficking is of subordinate relevance for the child rights and protection context. It may interest primarily the law enforcement investigations and the prosecution.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss recent {{developments}} in <b>administrative</b> court <b>proceedings</b> in the Netherlands, called the New Approach. Along with developments leading to the New Approach, {{it became clear that}} the insights from research on procedural justice deserve particular attention. The goals of the judge's actions in this respect are both that the proceedings are fair and just and that parties perceive the way they are being treated during proceedings as fair and just. Within the New Approach we discern five procedural justice elements: (1) respect, (2) voice and due consideration, (3) some influence on how proceedings will continue, (4) an explanation of how the proceedings will continue and (5) direct interpersonal contact. The introduction of the New Approach shows two important bottlenecks in Dutch <b>administrative</b> court <b>proceedings,</b> which are (i) the possible or supposed collision between legally right outcomes and procedural justice and (ii) the lack of uniformity and predictability. Although what we describe and discuss in this paper focuses on the Dutch situation, many of these considerations apply to <b>administrative</b> court <b>proceedings</b> in other countries. The themes and difficulties that face the administrative law judge seem to be common to many countries...|$|R

Afroyim's initial challenge was rejected in <b>administrative</b> <b>proceedings</b> in 1965. He then sued in federal district court, with his lawyer agreeing to a stipulation that Afroyim had in fact voted in Israel, but arguing that the statute under which this action had resulted in his losing his citizenship was unconstitutional. A federal judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected Afroyim's claim on February 25, 1966, concluding that [...] "in the opinion of Congress voting in a foreign political election could import 'allegiance to another country' in some measure 'inconsistent with American citizenship'" [...] and that the question of this law's validity had been settled by the Supreme Court's 1958 Perez decision.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this thesis is the first {{instance}} hearing of administrative delicts, where the main {{focus is on the}} legal status of the accused. Since the adjudgement on guilt of the accused is the fundamental objective of the <b>administrative</b> infraction <b>proceedings,</b> it is not conceivable that such proceedings would be conducted in his/her absence. The accused is the essential subject whose rights and obligations are mandatorily adjudicated. Part 3 of the Act No. 200 / 1990 Coll., on Transgressions, is the main source of legal regulation of <b>administrative</b> infraction <b>proceedings,</b> while the Act No. 500 / 2004 Coll., Administrative Procedure Code, shall be used subsidiarily. These laws represent the basic legal framework for a proper conduction of <b>administrative</b> infraction <b>proceedings.</b> However it is also necessary to apply a wide range of legal principles arising out of the constitutional law and the international law. The European Convention on Human Rights plays a pivotal role since it guarantees the right to a fair trial, together with the presumption of innocence and the right of self-defense, as two integral parts of the right to a fair trial. This thesis analyses the individual procedural rights of the accused in detail, along with their classification into appropriate stages of the [...] ...|$|R

The thesis handles this issue in its entirety, that is form its origins up to considerations on the future legal regulation, and, furthermore, analyses the issue into more depth. The thesis relies mainly on legal regulation and relevant literature as its primary sources and is divided into three chapters. The first chapter, firstly, deals with the development of subject matter and territorial jurisdiction in the 18 th and 19 th century and focuses on the formation of the concept of infraction itself, its division into the categories of administrative and judicial infraction and the gradual obsolescence of the phenomenon of judicial infraction. Secondly, it handles the transfer of subject matter jurisdiction in "judicial" infraction <b>proceedings</b> from <b>administrative</b> authorities to courts and, thirdly, defines the three bodies authorized to conduct <b>administrative</b> infraction <b>proceedings.</b> In the second chapter, the issue of subject matter and territorial jurisdiction in the 20 th century is dealt with.
