5|$|Final Fantasy XI has {{a largely}} player-based economy, {{with a heavy}} {{reliance}} on <b>auction</b> <b>houses</b> {{in each of the}} major cities of Vana'diel.

Beyoğlu has been transformed into the artistic center of the city, with young artists and older Turkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there. Modern art museums, including İstanbul Modern, the Pera Museum, Sakıp Sabancı Museum and SantralIstanbul, opened in the 2000s to complement the exhibition spaces and <b>auction</b> <b>houses</b> that have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the city.

25|$|The in-game {{world of}} The Lord of the Rings Online is {{currently}} divided into 25 distinct regions with individual dynamic content and storyline. Three main world areas include Eriador, Rhovanion and Gondor. Turbine has not added new areas (unlike in Tolkien's original world, Enedwaith appears under Eriador and Rohan {{is considered to}} be a part of Rhovanion). Each region in the game contains NPCs and quests within an established player character level range. Level ranges are broad and the regions' main quest lines will guide players through deeds and quests in the region in progression from lowest level to highest level. Every region contains Player vs. Environment, or PvE content. The only in-game region that player's can participate in Player vs. Player, or PvP action is the Ettenmoors (see above). Each region also has a 'capital', the largest settlement, such as 'Bree' in Bree-land or the village of 'Aughaire' in Angmar. The capitals serve as 'quest hubs' (bases to accept or finish quests from friendly NPCs) and contain in-game services for player characters, such as vendors, <b>auction</b> <b>houses,</b> crafting halls, etc. Every region is sub-divided into distinct areas, with individual landscape aesthetic and NPCs that spawn only in that area.
