40|$|The {{suspended}} particle assemblage in complex coastal waters {{is a mixture}} of living phytoplankton, other <b>autochthonous</b> <b>matter,</b> and materials of terrestrial origin. The characterization of {{suspended particle}}s is important for understanding regional primary productivity and rates of carbon sequestration, the fate of anthropogenic materials released to the coastal environment, as well as its effects on bulk optical proper-ties, which influence the passive optical remote sensing of the coastal ocean. Here, the extensive bio-optical Plumes and Blooms data set is used to characterize the surface particle assemblage in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, a highly productive, upwelling-dominated, coastal site affected by episodic sediment inputs. Available variables sensitive to characteristics of the particle assemblage include particle beam attenuation and backscattering coefficients, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) pigment concentration observations, chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon concentration, particulate and phytoplankton absorption coefficients, and Laser In-situ Scattering and Transmissome-try (LISST) 100 -X particle sizer observations. Comparisons among these particle assemblage proxy vari-ables indicate good agreement and internal consistency among the data set. Correlations among chlorophyll concentration, particulate organic carbon concentration (POC), HPLC pigments, and proxies sensitive to the entire particle assemblage such as backscattering and LISST data strongly indicate tha...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe 2009 – 2010 {{period was}} marked by an episode of intense drought known as the El Niño Modoki event. Sampling of the Términos Lagoon (Mexico) {{was carried out in}} November 2009 in order to {{understand}} the influence of these particular environmental conditions on organic matter fluxes within the lagoon's pelagic ecosystem and, more specifically, on the relationship between phyto- and bacterioplankton communities. The measurements presented here concern biogeochemical parameters (nutrients, dissolved and particulate organic matter [POM], and dissolved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]), phytoplankton (biomass and photosynthesis), and bacteria (diversity and abundance, including PAH degradation bacteria and ectoenzymatic activities). During the studied period, the water column of the Términos Lagoon functioned globally as a sink and, more precisely, as a "nitrogen assimilator". This was due to the high production of particulate and dissolved organic matter (DOM), even though exportation of <b>autochthonous</b> <b>matter</b> to the Gulf of Mexico was weak. We found that "bottom-up" control accounted for a large portion of the variability of phytoplankton productivity. Nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry mostly accounted for the heterogeneity in phytoplankton and free-living prokaryote distribution in the lagoon. In the eastern part, we found a clear decoupling between areas enriched in dissolved inorganic nitrogen near the Puerto Real coastal inlet and areas enriched in phosphate (PO 4) near the Candelaria estuary. Such a decoupling limited the potential for primary production, resulting in an accumulation of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON, respectively) near the river mouths. In the western part of the lagoon, maximal phytoplankton development resulted from bacterial activity transforming particulate organic phosphorus (PP) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) to available PO 4 and the coupling between Palizada River inputs of nitrate (NO 3) and PP. The Chumpan River contributed only marginally to PO 4 inputs due to its very low contribution to overall river inputs. The highest dissolved total PAH concentrations were measured in the El Carmen Inlet, suggesting that the anthropogenic pollution of the zone is probably related to the oil-platform exploitation activities in the shallow waters of the southern of the Gulf of Mexico. We also found that a complex array of biogeochemical and phytoplanktonic parameters were the driving force behind the geographical distribution of bacterial community structure and activities. Finally, we showed that nutrients brought by the Palizada River supported an abundant bacterial community of PAH degraders, which are of significance in this important oil-production zone...|$|E
40|$|Sterols were {{analyzed}} in suspended particles collected in January 1991 in the Solo River system {{and in the}} Serayu River, Java, Indonesia. Free sterols were extracted from particles larger than 0. 7 mu m and analyzed, after derivatization into their trimethylsilyl esters, by GC and GC/MS. Concentrations of total sterols ranged from 438 to 7922 ng/l, or from 2. 4 to 183. 8 ng/mg of total suspended matter, which varied from 3. 3 to 400 and 471 mg/l, respectively in the Serayu River and at the downstream station in the Solo River. POC concentrations also varied in a wide range, from 0. 91 to 4. 72 and 6. 13 % of TSM, respectively at the above stations, and were associated with sterol/POC values ranging from 0. 15 to 1. 75 mu g/mg. Eleven structures of C- 27, C- 28 and C- 29 stenols and associated stanols were identified. 28 Delta(5, 22) was only found at downstream stations in the Solo River and in the Serayu River. This unique distribution, {{different from that of}} other C- 27, C- 28 and C- 29 sterols, suggests a predominantly autochthonous origin for these compounds associated with an increased planktonic biosynthesis near the estuary. Concentrations of 28 Delta(5), 29 Delta(5, 22) and 29 Delta(5) showed similar spatial distributions and increased downstream, reflecting the significant accumulation of organic matter originating from the vegetation of the various drainage basins. Values of the autochthonous versus terrigenous sterol index, defined as 27 Delta(5) / 29 Delta(5, 22) + 29 Delta(5) were in the 1. 4 - 1. 9 range at upstream stations, whereas at downstream stations lower values were found, 0. 4 - 0. 6, which also corresponded to higher concentrations of TSM and lower POC values. Insofar as the stanol/stenol values can be used to estimate the bacterial activity of oxic waters, simultaneous variations of C- 27 and C- 29 stenol/stanol pairs suggest rather different bacterial degradation capacities of autochthonous versus allochthonous organic matter. The wide differencies between the values of the stenol/stanol pairs observed in one of the main tributaries and in downstream stations of the Solo River is evidence that allochthonous organic matter is much more resistant than <b>autochthonous</b> <b>matter.</b> The low index value observed in the Serayu River indicates the highly refractory nature of both autochthonous and allochthonous organic material...|$|E

This study addresses the composition of carbon, nitrogen and molecular steroid markers of surface sediments (n = 24) and a short core (L = 47 cm), in order to evaluate the impact by sewage, the contribution between allochthonous and <b>autochthonous</b> derived organic <b>matter</b> and eutrophication of the embayments. Coprostanol concentrations revealed, when compared to other regions in Guanabara Bay, high contamination by sewage close to the point of sewage discharge in Icaraí embayment. In contrast, the more enclosed and eutrophic Jurujuba embayment exhibited a larger contribution of <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter,</b> as shown by the combination of cholesterol, dinosterol and, partially, also brassicasterol. The presence of stigmasterol and b-sitosterol also indicated a minor contribution of organic matter from terrestrial plants, as revealed by principal component analysis. The sedimentary record of the Jurujuba embayment exhibited highest concentrations of all sterol markers in the top layer, corroborating the recent increase in the accumulation of sewage, plankton derived organic carbon and also eutrophication. Trend in degradation of organic matter was evidenced by sterol/stanol ratios and the behavior of dinosterol indicated that the embayment has been dominated by the accumulation of phytoplankton derived organic matter since earlier times...|$|R

Increasing δ 15 N values after c. 4000 cal.

A dilution of Hg concentrations by <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> explained this observation, as revealed by carbon stable isotopes signatures (d 13 C). Mercury dilution by the predominant mangrove-derived organic matter counterbalanced the positive influences of algal-derived organic matter and clay contents on Hg levels, suggesting that deleterious effects of Hg may be attenuated.

40|$|Aquatic macrophytes {{in shallow}} lakes emit {{high levels of}} methane. We hypothesize that the pres-ence of {{emergent}} aquatic macrophytes in an artificial shallow lake promotes important input of <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> (OM) in sediment {{and higher levels of}} methane emission via bub-bles. Samplings were performed at three sites in a small, shallow subtropical lake: (1) one station in the limnetic region and (2) - (3) two stations in the littoral region ((2) inside and (3) outside aquatic macrophyte stands). A higher concentration of OM was observed at the macrophyte sta-tion, and within this site, a higher methane concentration was observed in the sediment. These results could explain the methane ebullition values at macrophyte sites. At the macrophyte station, methane emission via bubbles contributed 17 % to 56 % of the total methane emission; however, at the other stations, its contribution via bubbles, was lower than 1 %.

40|$|Petrographical and geochemical {{studies of}} Neogene marine sediments from the Oman Sea (Leg 117, Sites 720, 724, 726 and 730), show a close {{relationship}} between the nature and amount of the organic matter, {{and the degree of}} degradation of organic matter by sulfate reduction, i. e. pyritization. Petrographically, three major pyritization types were observed: (1) Finely dispersed pyrite framboids in sediments from Oman Margin and Indus Fan, enriched in <b>autochthonous</b> marine organic <b>matter.</b> (2) Infilling of pores by massive pyrite crystals in Oman Margin sediments with a low TOC and a high microfossil content. (3) Pyrite mineralization of lignaceous fragments in organic-depleted sediments from the Indus Fan leading to more massive pyrite. Geochemically, we can define a sulfate reduction index (SRI) as the percentage of initial organic carbon versus that of residual organic carbon. Finely laminated Pliocene-Pleistocene sediments from the Oman Margin exclusively contain organic matter deriving from organic phytoplankton, for which the quantity (TOC) positively correlates with the geochemical quality (Hydrogen Index). We think that the occurrence of this residual organic matter is linked mainly to a high primary paleo-productivity. The intensity of sulfate reduction is constant for sediments with TOC up to 2 % and becomes more important when organic input decreases. This degradation process can destroy up to 50 % of the initial organic matter, but is not sufficient to explain some of the encountered very low TOC values. It can be seen that sharp increases of certain plankton species (with mineral skeletons) are responsible for a pronounced degradation of organic matter, due to increased sulfate reduction. In that case, the organic matter may be strongly degraded (high SRI), although deposited in an oxygen-depleted environment. Conversely, Miocene-Pliocene sediments contain an <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> that is typical of both low productivity and oxic processes; their very low sulfate reduction index indicates that very little metabolizable organic matter was initially present...|$|R

However, the impact of land management intensity on soil microbial diversity (i. e. richness and evenness) and consequences for functioning is still poorly understood. Here, we addressed this question by coupling molecular characterization of microbial diversity with measurements of carbon (C) mineralization in soils obtained from three locations across Europe, each representing a gradient of land management intensity under different soil and environmental conditions. Bacterial and fungal diversity were characterized by high throughput sequencing of ribosomal genes. Carbon cycling activities (i. e., mineralization of <b>autochthonous</b> soil organic <b>matter,</b> mineralization of allochthonous plant residues) were measured by quantifying 12 C- and 13 C-CO 2 release after soils had been amended, or not, with 13 C-labelled wheat residues.

40|$|Heterotrophic {{bacteria}} play a {{key role}} in the degradation of organic matter and carbon cycling in river sediments. These bacterial communities are directly influenced by environmental variables that differ spatially and temporally in rivers. Here, we studied the longitudinal patterns of sediment bacterial community composition and dissolved organic matter utilization under base flow and drought conditions in a Mediterranean river. Our results indicated that sediment microbial communities were affected by dissolved organic matter quality and origin along the river continuum. In headwaters the potential degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose was greater (i. e., higher β-glucosidase and β-xylosidase activities), suggesting higher microbial utilization of allochthonous detritus from terrestrial origin. Conversely, the accumulation and transport of more recalcitrant compounds (i. e., decrease in the recalcitrant index) became potentially relevant downstream. Furthermore, discharge fluctuations had clear effects on bacterial community composition and dissolved organic matter use. The hydrological fragmentation of the river continuum during drought period generated sediment microhabitats dominated by gamma and delta-Proteobacteria, with a greater potential capacity to degrade a wide range of compounds, particularly nitrogen containing moieties. During base flow conditions, we observed a higher occurrence of alpha-Proteobacteria and a greater potential use of more recalcitrant carbon compounds, mostly of terrestrial origin. Overall, our findings suggest an upstream-downstream longitudinal transition of sediment microbial communities that rely on allochthonous to <b>autochthonous</b> dissolved organic <b>matter,</b> and a shift toward <b>autochthonous</b> dissolved organic <b>matter</b> reliance during droughtThis study was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through projects FLUMED-HOTSPOTS (CGL 2011 - 30151 -C 02) and FUNSTREAM (CGL 2014 - 58760 -C 3 -R...|$|R

We used the natural abundance of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen isotopes to determine the sources of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), and dissolved organic matter (DOM), as well as excitation emission matrices (EEMs) to characterize sources of DOM. Organic matter was sampled at 32 sites, in 4 watersheds that encompass a range of urban, suburban, range, and agricultural land uses in north east Utah.

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all 68 amplicons belonged to the Labyrinthulea. Only 15 of the 68 amplicons belonged to the thraustochytrid phylogenetic group (Thraustochytriidae). None of these 15 were similar to cultivated strains, and 11 formed a novel group.

Fatty acid signature and stable isotope data have revealed that terrestrial organic matter (including terrestrial vascular plants), bacteria, phytoplankton produced within the estuary and coastal sea, green macroalgae and mixed planktonic-sources predominantly contributed to the organic matter pool in the estuary. The combined approach has also allowed for the prediction of the following mixing regime and distribution of organic matter sources along the estuarine salinity gradient; Allochthonous, both terrestrial and river-borne organic matter which dominate the riverine section of the estuary seem to be slightly diluted with <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> in the middle estuary (site M) and thereafter, in the lower reaches of the estuary (Site SW 2) are measurably admixed with tidally introduced marine organic <b>matter.</b> However, the <b>autochthonous</b> primary production within the estuary seems to be highly dependent on the discharges of terrestrial organic matter and nutrients as depicted in fatty acid signatures and isotopic composition of residential and agricultural wastewater runoff.

Using this correction factor, it was found that sediment bacterial biomass in 22 lakes was positively related to an indicator of the rate of allochthonous organic matter input to lakes. However, the total hypolimnetic carbon mineralization rate of lakes, which integrates both sediment and hypolimnetic water column mineralization, was found to be driven mainly by phytoplankton carbon and to occur mainly in the hypolimnetic water column.

In order to determine the role of micromycetes-migrants in the mineralization of organic substrates, as an active participant of self-purification process, we used water samples from the bottom sediments as well as decaying and skeletonized stalks of cane, reeds, algae, macrophytes, exuvia of insects and fish remains submerged in water. Findings. For the first time, we obtained the data on the quality and quantity of microscopic mycelial fungi in freshwater bodies on the example of the Mingachevir water reservoir; we also studied the possibilities for oxygenating the <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> of allochthonous origin with micromycetes-migrants. Conclusions. It was found that the seasonal development of micromycetes-migrants within the Mingachevir reservoir is characterized by an increase in the number of species in the summer and a gradual reduction in species diversity in the fall.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Total {{organic carbon}} (TOC), total sulfur (S) and Rock-Eval {{pyrolysis}} analyzes were performed in 41 samples collected along the SP- 60 -PR core, from the Irati Formation, northwestern of Paraná Basin. This work aims {{to show how}} organic matter content evolved vertically in the Irati Formation and therefore {{to contribute to the}} identification of the most attractive levels to generate hydrocarbons, in thermally immature sediments. The results of these analyses allowed to recognize sharp changes in the types of organic matter and paleoenvironmental conditions, giving rise to eight chemical-stratigraphic units, labeled as A, B and C (Taquaral Member) and D, E, F, G and H (Assistência Member). The units A and C display low organic carbon content and predominance of organic matter type IV, which indicate an oxic environment. The unit B, with higher TOC content, has organic matter predominantly of type II and should be associated to a disoxic environment. The Assistência Member, mainly with organic matter type II, is differentiated from the previous units by their sharply higher TOC content and hydrogen index values, suggesting a more restricted environment, characterized by disoxic to anoxic conditions. The bituminous shale of the units E and H have the highest TOC, sulfur and hydrogen index values, representing the units where conditions of the <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> (type II) preservation was more efficient (anoxic environment). Despite being found organic matter thermally immature in the Assistência Member, the layer with the highest generation potential is the unity H. The comparison with data of other studied wells evidenced a strong reduction in the potential generator of the Irati Formation toward the north of Paraná Basin. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{mesocosm}} experiment investigating the production and utilization of <b>autochthonous</b> dissolved organic <b>matter</b> (DOM) by the plankton community under different inorganic nutrient regimes. Fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis was applied to study the dynamics of autochthonous DOM. Seven independent fluorescent fractions were identified, differing in their spectral characteristics, production rates, and sensitivity to photochemical and microbial degradation processes. Five different humic fractions, a marine protein, and a peptide fluorescence were found. The five humic fractions were produced microbially, with the greatest production occurring under combined Si- and P-limiting conditions. The two proteinaceous fractions were produced during exponential growth of phytoplankton, irrespective of biomass composition. Photodegradation was an important sink for the microbially derived humic material, and the marine protein material was susceptible to both photoand microbial degradation. The amount of carbon bound in dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the world’s oceans is similar to that bound as atmospheric carbon dioxide (Siegenthaler and Sarmiento 1993). As a result of increasing interest in the global carbo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{localized}} {{impact of}} blooms of the mixo-trophic ciliate Myrionecta rubra in the Columbia River estuary during 2007 – 2010 was evaluated with biogeo-chemical, light microscopy, physiological, and molecular data. M. rubra affected surrounding estuarine nutrient cycles, {{as indicated by}} high and low concentrations of organic nutrients and inorganic nitrogen, respectively, associated with red waters. M. rubra blooms also altered the energy transfer pattern in patches of the estuarine water that contain the ciliate by creating areas characterized by high primary production and elevated levels of fresh <b>autochthonous</b> particulate organic <b>matter,</b> therefore shift-ing the trophic status in emergent red water areas of the estuary from net heterotrophy towards autotrophy. The pelagic estuarine bacterial community structure was unaf-fected byM. rubra abundance, but red waters of the ciliate do offer a possible link between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes since they were associated with elevated dissolved organic matter and showed a tendency for enhanced microbial secondary production. Taken together, {{these findings suggest that}} M. rubra red waters are biogeochemical hotspots of the Columbia River estuary...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{perturbations}} in wetlands {{affect the}} integrated plant-microbial-soil system, causing biogeochemical responses that can manifest at local to global scales. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine how saltwater intrusion affects carbon mineralization and greenhouse gas production in coastal wetlands. Working with tidal freshwater marsh soils that had experienced ~ 3. 5 yr of in situ saltwater additions, we quantified changes in soil properties, measured extracellular enzyme activity associated with organic matter breakdown, and determined potential rates of anaerobic carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) production. Soils from the field plots treated with brackish water had lower carbon content and higher C : N ratios than soils from freshwater plots, indicating that saltwater intrusion reduced carbon availability and increased organic matter recalcitrance. This was reflected in reduced activities of enzymes associated with the hydrolysis of cellulose and the oxidation of lignin, leading to reduced rates of soil CO 2 and CH 4 production. The effects of long-term saltwater additions contrasted with the effects of short-term exposure to brackish water during three-day laboratory incubations, which increased rates of CO 2 production but lowered rates of CH 4 production. Collectively, our data suggest that the long-term effect of saltwater intrusion on soil CO 2 production is indirect, mediated through the effects of elevated salinity on the quantity and quality of <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> inputs to the soil. In contrast, salinity, organic matter content, and enzyme activities directly influence CH 4 production. Our analyses demonstrate that saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater marshes affects the entire process of carbon mineralization, from the availability of organic carbon through its terminal metabolism to CO 2 and/or CH 4, and illustrate that long-term shifts in biogeochemical functioning are not necessarily consistent with short-term disturbance-type responses...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{and oxygen}} isotope ratios {{of the common}} {{structural}} biopolymer chitin are a potential recorder of ecological and environmental information, but {{our understanding of the}} mechanisms of incorporation of H and O from environmental substrates into chitin is limited. We report the results of a set of experiments in which the isotopic compositions of environmental water and diet were varied independently in order to assess the contribution of these variables to the H and O isotopic composition of Artemia franciscana chitin. Hydrogen isotope ratios of chitin were strongly linearly correlated with both food and water, with approximately 26 % of the hydrogen signal reflecting food and approximately 38 % reflecting water. Oxygen isotopes were also strongly correlated with the isotopic composition of water and food, but whereas 69 % of oxygen in chitin exchanged with environmental water, only 10 % was derived from food. We propose that these observations reflect the position-specific, partial exchange of H and O atoms with brine shrimp body water during the processes of digestion and chitin biosynthesis. Comparison of culture experiments with a set of natural samples collected from the Great Salt Lake, UT in 2006 shows that, with some exceptions, oxygen isotope compositions of chitin track those of water, whereas hydrogen isotopes vary inversely with those of lake water. The different behavior of the two isotopic systems can be explained in terms of a dietary shift from allochthonous particulate matter with relatively higher δ 2 H values in the early spring to <b>autochthonous</b> particulate <b>matter</b> with significantly lower δ 2 H values in the late summer to autumn. These results suggest oxygen in chitin may be a valuable proxy for the oxygen isotopic composition of environmental water, whereas hydrogen isotope values from the same molecule may reveal ecological and biogeochemical changes within lakes...|$|R
40|$|Extensive fish {{production}} systems in continental areas are often created by damming headwater streams. However, these lentic systems favour <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> production. As headwater stream functioning is essentially based on {{allochthonous organic matter}} (OM) supply, the presence of barrage fishponds on headwater streams might change the main food source for benthic communities. The goal {{of this study was}} thus to identify the effects of barrage fishponds on the functioning of headwater streams. To this end, we compared leaf litter breakdown (a key ecosystem function in headwater streams), their associated invertebrate communities and fungal biomass at sites upstream and downstream of five barrage fishponds in two dominant land use systems (three in forested catchments and two in agricultural catchments). We observed significant structural and functional differences between headwater stream ecosystems in agricultural catchments and those in forested catchments. Leaf litter decay was more rapid in forest streams, with a moderate, but not significant, increase in breakdown rate downstream from the barrage fishponds. In agricultural catchments, the trend was opposite with a 2 -fold lower leaf litter breakdown rate at downstream sites compared to upstream sites. Breakdown rates observed at all sites were closely correlated with fungal biomass and shredder biomass. No effect of barrage fishponds were observed in this study concerning invertebrate community structure or functional feeding groups especially in agricultural landscapes. In forest streams, we observed a decrease in organic pollution (OP) -intolerant taxa at downstream sites that was correlated with an increase in OP-tolerant taxa. These results highlighted that the influence of barrage fishponds on headwater stream functioning is complex and land use dependent. It is therefore necessary to clearly understand the various mechanisms (competition for food resources, complementarities between autochthonous and allochthonous OM) that control ecosystem functioning in different contexts in order to optimize barrage fishpond management...|$|R
40|$|Total {{organic carbon}} (TOC) and total {{nitrogen}} (TN) concentrations and C and N stable isotope compositions in 64 surface sediment {{samples from the}} mouth of the Yellow River (YR) and from the Bohai Sea (BS) outline the distribution and sources (terrestrial and marine) of sediment organic matter. Comparatively high TOC (0. 5 - 0. 9 %) and TN (0. 07 - 0. 11 %) concentrations in the Central BS correlate with fine-grained sediments that contain high concentrations of algal-derived organic carbon (AOC) and biogenic silica (BSi). Together, they indicate a dominant contribution of <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> from marine primary production. Low TOC (< 0. 2 %) and TN (< 0. 03 %) contents characterize surface sediments in the Bohai Strait and are typically associated with coarse-grained sediments of low AOC and BSi contents. (delta C- 13 values (- 21 to 22 parts per thousand) are characteristic of marine-derived organic carbon in the Central BS and the Bohai Strait, whereas a significant terrigenous contribution of 40 - 50 % is indicated by lower values (<- 23 parts per thousand) near the YR mouth. The spatial pattern of rising (delta C- 13 from the YR mouth to offshore areas indicates rapid sedimentation of fluvial suspensions within the vicinity of the river mouth and in Laizhou Bay, so that only approximately 10 - 20 % of YR-derived sediments are transported to and deposited in the Central BS and/or the Bohai Strait. At most sites, delta N- 15 values are in the typical range of marine organic matter produced from assimilation of marine nitrate by phytoplankton (5 - 5. 5 parts per thousand), but some relatively high values (6 - 7. 28 parts per thousand) mark the southern area of the Laizhou Bay as a significant sink of anthropogenic nitrogen.

40|$|The {{multidisciplinary}} research cruise 64 PE 350 {{was conducted in}} {{the central part of}} the Red Sea to strengthen our understanding of volcanism and tectonics and related hydrothermal processes in this young rifting system. Therefore we extended our intense multibeam mapping campaign, which had started during the PO 408 cruise in 2011, by mainly focusing on the hydrothermally active “Multi Deep” area. Detailed geological mapping was performed by selective rock sampling (dredging, coring) in areas of special interest (i. e. fresh basalt flows, or zones with signals of recent volcanic activities). Moreover, a geochemical sampling campaign (i. e. gravity coring, Niskin water sampling) was conducted in brine-filled Red Sea deeps where variable hydrothermal activity is expected. The geochemical characteristics of sediment (pore water and mineral composition) and brine will help to identify sources and sinks relative to hydrothermal activity (e. g. hydrocarbon inflow, heavy metal concentrations in brine and sediment, etc.). Transport and degradation processes (biogeochemical cycles) at the brine- seawater interfaces were investigated by high-resolution water sampling and subsequent onboard membrane inlet mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, and major and trace element sampling. Biomarker studies are being performed by sampling/ filtering water column and brine to decipher allochthonous from <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> input to the Red Sea Deeps. Moreover, microbiological studies will be performed on selected brine and sediment samples. Hydrocarbon seepage at the pockmark area was investigated by hydroacoustic and geophysical methods (water column imaging, sparker reflection seismics). Additionally, sediment cores were retrieved from selected pockmark structures to investigate gas/ fluid seepage activities during Holocene. The recently described subsea salt glacier phenomenon was investigated by seismic reflection studies and comparative multibeam profiling (salt glacier flow velocities will be calculated). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{mesohaline}} {{portion of}} the Chesapeake Bay is subject to annual summertime hypoxia and anoxia in waters beneath the pycnocline. This dissolved oxygen deficit {{is directly related to}} salinity-based stratification of the water column in combination with high levels of autochthonously produced organic matter and a very high abundance of metabolically active bacteria. Throughout the water column in the lower, mesohaline part of the bay, between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, near the southern limit of the mainstem anoxia, bacterial abundance often exceeded 10 × 106 cells per ml and bacterial production exceeded 7 × 109 cells per liter per day during summer. Bacterial biomass averaged 34 % (range, 16 to 126 %) of the phytoplankton biomass in summer. These values are equal to or greater than those found farther north in the bay, where the oxygen deficit is more severe. Seasonal variations in bacterial abundance and production were correlated with phytoplankton biomass (lag time, 7 to 14 days), particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, and particulate biochemical oxygen demand in spring; but during summer, they were significantly correlated only with dissolved biochemical oxygen demand. During summer, dissolved biochemical oxygen demand can account for 50 to 60 % of the total biochemical oxygen demand throughout the water column and 80 % in the bottom waters. There is a clear spring-summer seasonal shift in the production of organic matter and in the coupling of bacteria and <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter.</b> The measurement of dissolved, microbially labile organic matter concentrations is crucial in understanding the trophic dynamics of the lower mesohaline part of the bay. The absolute levels of organic matter in the water column and the bacterial-organic carbon relationships suggest that a lower bay source of organic matter fuels the upper mesohaline bay oxygen deficits...|$|R
40|$|A {{synthesis}} of paleoclimate responses from Lake Baikal during the MIS 11 interglacial is presented based on proxy records from two drill sites 245 km apart. BDP- 99 {{is located in}} vicinity of the delta of the major Baikal tributary, whereas the BDP- 96 site represents hemipelagic setting distant from riverine influence. The comparison of thicknesses of interglacial intervals in these contrasting depositional settings confirm the extended ca. 33 -kyr duration of the MIS 11 interglacial. The new BDP- 99 diatom biostratigraphic record matches that of the BDP- 96 - 2 holostratotype and thus establishes robust correlation between the records on the same orbitally-tuned timescale. The first detailed MIS 11 palynological record from the BDP- 99 drill core indicates the dominance of temperate boreal (taiga) forest vegetation in the Baikal region throughout the MIS 11 interglacial, since at least 424 ka till ca. 396 ka. The interval ca. 420 – 405 ka stands out as a "conifer optimum" with abundant Abies sibirica, indicative of climate significantly warmer and less continental than today. The closest Baikal analog {{to this type of}} vegetation in the current interglacial is at ca. 8 – 6 ka in the mid-Holocene. The warm conifer phase lasted for ca. 15 ka during MIS 11 interrupted by two millennial-scale cooling episodes. At both drill sites, the two-peak structure of the MIS 11 diatom abundance profiles reflects the orbital signature of precession in the interglacial paleoclimate record of continental Eurasia. MIS 11 interglacial was characterized by the sustained high level of primary production and accumulation of <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> at both study sites. The responses of paleoclimate-sensitive indices in the mineralogy of the MIS 11 sediments in BDP- 96 - 2 are consistent with those during the Holocene. Illitization of secondary clay minerals in the Baikal watershed was an important process, but it appears to have been subdued {{during the first half of}} the MIS 11, possibly due to elevated humidity and muted seasonality of regional climate...|$|R
40|$|First Published on April 20, 2016 The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum was {{a period}} of abrupt, {{transient}} global warming, fueled by a large release of ¹³C-depleted carbon and marked globally by a negative carbon isotope excursion. While the carbon isotope excursion is often identified in the carbon isotope ratios of bulk soil organic matter (δ¹³Corg), these records can be biased by factors associated with production, degradation, and sources of sedimentary carbon input. To better understand these factors, we compared δ¹³Corg values from Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum rocks in the southeastern Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, with those derived from leaf wax n-alkanes (δ¹³Cn-alk). While both δ¹³Cn-alk and δ¹³Corg records indicate an abrupt, negative shift in δ¹³C values, the carbon isotope excursions observed in bulk organic matter are smaller in magnitude and shorter in duration than those in n-alkanes. To explore these discrepancies, we modeled predicted total plant tissue carbon isotope (δ¹³CTT) curves from the δ¹³Cn-alk record using enrichment factors determined in modern C₃ plants. Measured δ¹³Corg values are enriched in ¹³C relative to predicted δ¹³CTT, with greater enrichment during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum than before or after. The greater ¹³C enrichment could reflect increased degradation of <b>autochthonous</b> organic <b>matter,</b> increased input of allochthonous fossil carbon enriched in ¹³C, or both. By comparing samples from organic-rich and organic-poor depositional environments, we infer that microbial degradation rates doubled during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum, and we calculate that fossil carbon input increased ∼ 28 %− 63 %. This approach to untangling the controls on the isotopic composition of bulk soil carbon is an important development that will inform not only future studies of global carbon cycle dynamics during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum hyperthermal event, but also any study that seeks to correlate or estimate duration and magnitude of past events using soil organic carbon.
