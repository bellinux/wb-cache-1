5|$|As they {{attempted}} to continue up the hill, several Chinese soldiers from a nearby trench opened fire, injuring another soldier. According to witness reports, Bleak rushed the trench and dove into it, tackling one Chinese soldier <b>and,</b> <b>with</b> <b>only</b> his hands, broke the soldier's neck, killing him. Bleak was then confronted by a second soldier, whom he reportedly grabbed by the neck, fatally crushing his windpipe. A third Chinese soldier then approached, and in the ensuing scuffle, Bleak used his combat knife to stab and kill the soldier.|$|E
5|$|Between 950,000–1,000,000 of all {{described}} {{species are}} insects, so over 50% of all described eukaryotes (1.8 million) are insects (see illustration). With only 950,000 known non-insects, if {{the actual number}} of insects is 5.5 million, they may represent over 80% of the total, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>only</b> about 20,000 new species of all organisms being described each year, most insect species likely will remain undescribed, unless species descriptions greatly increase in rate. Of the 24 orders of insects, four dominate in terms of numbers of described species, with at least 670,000 species included in Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{the assault}} were formed, {{and the task}} {{was given to the}} 1st (Canterbury Yeomanry Cavalry) Squadron of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, {{commanded}} by Major Percy Acton-Adams. On 28 May, the squadron was concentrated at No.2 Post and at 22:00 left the post to capture the Turkish position. By 23:30, after advancing along the ridge, they arrived <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>only</b> slight opposition drove off the twenty Turkish defenders at a cost of one dead and five wounded. They were followed up by the 6th (Manawatu) Squadron from the Wellington Mounted Rifles, who carried entrenching tools to improve the defences and would then garrison the position, now named No.3 Post.|$|E

5|$|Against the Baltimore Ravens in {{the preseason}} opener on August 11, Kafka {{replaced}} Young at quarterback during the second quarter and played into the fourth quarter. He went 13-of-19 for 132yards with one interception thrown to Ravens safety Bernard Pollard in the game. In {{the second week of}} the preseason on August 18 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kafka entered the game in the fourth quarter and led the Eagles to two scoring drives in a 24–14 loss. With less than four minutes remaining in the game, he threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Gerald Jones, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>only</b> 19 seconds left on the following drive, threw a second touchdown pass to Jones for sevenyards. He finished the game going 14-for-19 for 160yards along with the two scores. Kafka played in garbage time in the next preseason game against the Cleveland Browns, handing the ball off twice and kneeling down twice. Against the New York Jets {{in the preseason}} finale, he filled in for the injured Young, who started the game, to start the third quarter. Kafka had the wind knocked out of him on a sack, but was able to play the rest of the game despite a rib contusion. He finished the game 7-for-11 for 76yards and one interception. He went 34-for-49 for 369yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the preseason overall.|$|E

5|$|If was a digest-sized {{magazine}} {{throughout its}} life. It began at 164 pages <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>only</b> the fifth issue, November 1952, dropped to 124 pages. The page count increased again to 134 pages with the July 1959 issue, and to 164 pages with the September 1965 issue; it stayed at this length until the September–October 1970 issue. The page count was then increased to 180 with the June 1971 issue, and to 164 {{for the very}} last issue, December 1974. It was priced at 35 cents to begin with, and increased to 40 cents with the March 1963 issue, to 50 cents with the December 1964 issue, to 60 cents with the August 1967 issue, and finally to 75 cents with the September–October 1970 issue. With the April 1972 issue, UPD began using card stock for the covers, rather than paper, and continued to do so until the magazine ceased publication.|$|E
5|$|The Kraut Line earned {{full-time}} {{spots in}} Boston beginning in 1937–38; Bauer recorded a team-leading 20 goals in {{his rookie season}} as the trio led the Bruins to the team's first of four consecutive Prince of Wales Trophy wins as the NHL's {{best team in the}} regular season. Following a 31-point regular season in 1938–39, Bauer added five points in 12 playoff games and was named to the NHL's second All-Star Team. The Bruins eliminated the New York Rangers, then defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs four games to one to capture Boston's first Stanley Cup championship in ten years. In 1939–40, Schmidt led the NHL in points with 52 while Dumart and Bauer finished second and third respectively with 43 each. It {{was the first time in}} league history that three linemates finished in the top three spots in NHL scoring. Bauer was again named a second team All-Star, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>only</b> two penalties in minutes (PIM), won the Lady Byng Trophy for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} opened on 10 June 1908, {{along with the}} rest of the central portion of the Bergen Line. The station {{building}} was of the Mountain Station Variant 1 type, designed by Paul Due. This made it identical to Mjølfjell Station, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>only</b> slight variations to Haugastøl Station, Finse Station and Myrdal Station. During construction, NSB built several buildings for their staff. Two of the houses and an assembly building have been preserved. They were built in 1900 and represent an example of buildings from the construction time. One is partially built in stone, partially in wood, while the other two are entirely in wood. All are now used as cabins. The sick ward for the navvys was bought by Kari Maristuen in 1909 converted to a hotel, named Fjellstova.|$|E

5|$|Troika {{wanted to}} make a 3D game, but was {{uncertain}} whether to build a new game engine or license an existing one and whether to use first- or third-person. At that time, the Source game engine was being built by Valve Corporation. Valve employee Scott Lynch approached Troika about using the engine, {{and it was the first}} external team to use it. Troika chose Source for its facial animation and lip-synching system, since it wanted players to speak to the characters face-to-face. Since the engine was in development with Bloodlines and Valve's own Half-Life 2, Troika was working with unfamiliar code and tools, forcing it to write its own code to compensate for the unfinished engine, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>only</b> a single source for technical support. Troika developed a lighting system to create distinctive, moody illumination for the nighttime setting, a particle system for the special effects accompanying the vampire Disciplines, and a cloth system for clothing flow. Source lacked its later artificial intelligence (AI) coding, and Troika's code worked poorly with the Source engine.|$|E
