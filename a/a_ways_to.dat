2500|$|Lucky and Luke start a {{slow process}} of {{reconciling}} when Luke kidnaps Lucky to an abandoned cabin and Lucky watches Luke distressfully dream of the rape while suffering from a delirious fever following a wolf trap accident. Lucky's relationship with his mother becomes further strained in December 1998 when he and Nikolas are told that Stefan Cassadine (Nichols) is Nikolas's father, not the presumed-dead Stavros Cassadine, and Laura had kept the secret. Lucky and Nikolas begin to bond over the betrayal of their respective families. Lucky's estrangement with his parents adds to his newfound open-mindedness about Nikolas, as Jackson told Soap Opera Magazine: [...] "Lucky's been {{trying to change the}} way he looks at things, to not become Luke. That's part of the process – not having the same relationship with Nikolas that Luke has with Stefan. (...) He's trying to find his own Spencer." [...] The former enemies become friends, a sign of Lucky's growth of character. Actress Genie Francis (Laura) explained to Soap Opera Digest in April 1999: [...] "It's huge, absolutely huge. (It's) something that really seemed impossible, but Lucky surprises [...] with his big heart and his maturity." [...] In the same interview, Guza described the acceptance Lucky had come to have about his parents, recounting scenes where Lucky bonds with each. Guza explained: [...] "They still have <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> go, {{but the important thing is}} they're making the inroads now. (...) I wouldn't say it's the final resolution between them, but they're well on their way toward it." ...|$|E
