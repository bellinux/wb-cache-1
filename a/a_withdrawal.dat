5|$|Negotiations {{to merge}} with Union Temple (the {{successor}} to Temple Israel) were started in 1925. A confirmation vote eventually passed, and the impending merger was announced in the Brooklyn Eagle. However, younger congregants feared a loss of identity, and forced <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The assault, however, was {{a costly}} failure. After twenty-two days of {{prolonged}} action, {{during which the}} defenders, led by the Marquis of Lanzarote, virtually wiped out Almado's regiment with musketry fire and firebombs, Mendes de Vasconcelos ordered <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for what he}} hoped would be the final attack on The Gully, Vokes shifted the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade to occupy positions formerly belonging to the 1st Brigade. Vokes planned for an attack by The Carleton and York Regiment {{to be the last}} of the frontal assaults against The Gully. Should this attack fail, the 1st Brigade's Seaforth Highlanders and the Royal Canadian Regiment would move through Casa Berardi and outflank German defences, forcing <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from The Gully.|$|E

5|$|On the far right, Duke {{was pressed}} hard by columns of attacking Union soldiers. Seeing this, Col. Giltner sent his {{regiment}} to reinforce Duke. Before Giltner's reinforcements arrived, Duke {{and his men}} counterattacked the Union linerouting it and forcing <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> Duke and Witcher then combined forces and charged the Union's extreme left flank, inflicting significant damage on a Union colored regiment.|$|E
5|$|The British {{attacked}} {{the position of}} the 3rd Continentals, and an engagement ensued. Both sides kept up constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times. However, after 17 volleys, the British numbers began to overwhelm the Americans, and Glover ordered <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal</b> to another stone wall on the crest of a hill while the next regiment in line, the 26th Continentals, engaged the British.|$|E
5|$|The battle he is {{best known}} for was the defense of Lunga Ridge on Guadalcanal September 13–14, 1942. His Raider Battalion, with two {{companies}} of the 1st Parachute Battalion attached, were sent to a ridge line a short distance south of Henderson Field. Here, they were supposed to get a short rest but Japanese forces unexpectedly attacked the position on the first evening, penetrating the left center of his line of resistance, forcing <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal</b> to a reserve position.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{decision-making}} process of international market withdrawal {{within the scope of}} international market portfolio management. A comparative study of eight withdrawal cases in four multinational firms results in a six-phased decision-making model that is driven by threat-rigidity behavior, failure-induced learning and political dynamics. Two types of international market withdrawal are identified. On the one hand, <b>a</b> tactical <b>withdrawal</b> is the outcome of threat-rigidity and exploitative learning at the level of executive management. <b>A</b> strategic <b>withdrawal,</b> on the other hand, is characterized by a process of failure-induced exploratory learning initiated by middle level challengers. In contrast to <b>a</b> tactical <b>withdrawal,</b> which remains <b>an</b> isolated decision and does not interfere with other international ventures of the business unit, <b>a</b> strategic <b>withdrawal</b> {{turns out to be a}} germ of strategic (re) orientation of the business unit’s entire international market portfolio. Whether <b>a</b> market <b>withdrawal</b> turns out to be tactical or strategic ultimately depends on the autonomy, the amount and the relevance of challengers’ market and business knowledge.

5|$|The {{triangle}} {{was already}} {{under attack from}} two sides by Lieutenant General George Patton's Third Army and Lieutenant General Alexander Patch's Seventh Army. The German position soon crumbled and Hitler reluctantly sanctioned <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> The First and Seventh Armies suffered heavy losses: around 113,000 Germans casualties {{at the cost of}} 17,000 on the Allied side. Nonetheless, they had avoided encirclement and managed to conduct a skilful delaying action, evacuating the last troops to the east bank of the Rhine on 25 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|Their goal in Laos {{seemingly}} achieved, President Thieu and General Lãm ordered <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of ARVN forces {{beginning on}} 9 March {{that was to}} continue {{through the rest of}} the month, destroying Base Area 604 and any supplies discovered in their path. General Abrams implored Thieu to reinforce the troops in Laos and that they keep disrupting the area until the beginning of the rainy season. The battle was shifting to Hanoi's advantage. Anti-aircraft fire remained devastating and the PAVN had no trouble resupplying or reinforcing their troops in the battle area. As soon as it became evident that ARVN forces had begun <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> the PAVN increased its efforts to destroy these force before they could reach South Vietnam. Anti-aircraft fire was increased to halt or slow helicopter resupply or evacuation efforts, the undermanned firebases were attacked, and ARVN ground forces had to run a gauntlet of ambushes along Route 9.|$|E
5|$|While Latour {{battered}} against Ney, Riesch launched {{attacks against}} the 4,100 foot soldiers, 2,000 horsemen, and 16 guns belonging to Jean Hardy's division. A brigade belonging to Claude Legrand's division marched up and helped block Riesch's attempt to turn Hardy's flank. During the fighting, a shellburst wounded Hardy and caused him to hand over command to BG Bastoul. With both French divisions being slowly pressed back by superior numbers, Grenier gave orders for <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Al-Kamil proclaimed himself sultan in Cairo, {{while his}} brother al-Mu'azzam claimed the throne in Damascus. Al-Kamil {{attempted}} to retake Damietta, but was forced back by John of Brienne. After learning {{of a conspiracy}} against him, he fled, leaving the Egyptian army leaderless. Panic ensued, but {{with the help of}} al-Mu'azzam, al-Kamil regrouped his forces. By then, however, the Crusaders had seized his camp. The Ayyubids offered to negotiate for <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from Damietta, offering the restoration of Palestine to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, {{with the exception of the}} forts of Mont Real and Karak. This was refused by the leader of the Fifth Crusade, Pelagius of Albano, and in 1221, the Crusaders were driven out of the Nile Delta after the Ayyubid victory at Mansura.|$|E
5|$|Although Timoshenko's forces {{successfully}} regrouped on 21 May, {{he ordered}} <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of Army Group Kotenko {{by the end}} of 22 May, while he prepared an attack for 23 May, to be orchestrated by the 9th and 57th Armies. Although the Red Army desperately attempted to fend off advancing Wehrmacht and launched local counterattacks to relieve several surrounded units, they generally failed. By the end of May 24, Soviet forces opposite Kharkov had been surrounded by German formations, which had been able to transfer several more divisions to the front, increasing the pressure on the Soviet flanks and finally forcing them to collapse.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal</b> period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
2500|$|Benzodiazepine {{withdrawal}} can {{be severe}} and can provoke life-threatening withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures, particularly with abrupt or overly rapid dosage reduction from high doses or long time users. [...] <b>A</b> severe <b>withdrawal</b> response can nevertheless occur despite gradual dose reduction, or from relatively low doses in short time users, {{even after a}} single large dose in animal models. A minority of individuals will experience <b>a</b> protracted <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome whose symptoms may persist at a sub-acute level for months, or years after cessation of benzodiazepines. The likelihood of developing <b>a</b> protracted <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome can be minimized by a slow, gradual reduction in dosage.|$|R

5|$|Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal began {{a process}} of decolonisation and began <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from Portuguese Timor (later East Timor). Australians had long taken an {{interest}} in the colony; the nation had sent troops to the region during World War II, and many East Timorese had fought the Japanese as guerrillas. In September 1974, Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia and indicated that he would support Indonesia if it annexed East Timor. At the height of the Cold War, and {{in the context of the}} American retreat from Indo-China, he felt that incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region, and reduce the risk of the East Timorese FRETILIN movement, which many feared was communist, coming to power.|$|E
5|$|For {{three hours}} the {{battalion}} fought, pinned in a crossfire by North Korean soldiers on higher ground. North Korean forces {{were able to}} divide the American force and kill most of its commanders, further disorganizing the men. Following the failed operation, the wounded US commander ordered <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> which quickly became disorganized, resulting in hundreds of casualties. Destroyed after its first engagement, the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment was disbanded and merged with other units as the North Korean forces advanced through the pass and attacked US positions to the east.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 and 1976 a {{large number}} of African {{countries}} threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia, because of their segregationist regimes. New Zealand {{was also one of the}} African boycott targets, because its national rugby union team had toured apartheid-ruled South Africa. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport. Fulfilling their threat, twenty African countries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in <b>a</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from the Montreal Games, after a few of their athletes had already competed.|$|E
