40|$|<b>Aerosols</b> in the {{atmosphere}} alter the radiative balance of the Earth by reflecting or absorbing solar radiation. Spaceborne measurements of clouds and <b>aerosols</b> advected over the southeastern Atlantic Ocean indicate that the greater the cloud cover below the <b>aerosols,</b> the more likely the <b>aerosols</b> are to heat the planet...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} quantitatively how {{radiative}} climatic forcing by <b>aerosols</b> {{depends on the}} physical properties of the <b>aerosols.</b> The special case of atmospheric <b>aerosols</b> produced by volcanic explosions is considered, and evidence is presented which indicates that even the simple climate models available today {{may be able to}} capture some of the basic effects of <b>aerosols</b> on global climate. Possible effects of anthropogenic <b>aerosols</b> are briefly examined. It is noted that additional evidence for the significant influence of <b>aerosols</b> on climate may be found in data obtained from recent spacecraft missions to Venus and Mars...|$|R
25|$|Because {{sulfuric acid}} reaches {{supersaturation}} in the stratosphere, it can nucleate <b>aerosol</b> particles {{and provide a}} surface for <b>aerosol</b> growth via condensation and coagulation with other water-sulfuric acid aerosols. This results in the stratospheric <b>aerosol</b> layer.|$|E
25|$|The direct <b>aerosol</b> effect {{consists}} of any direct interaction of radiation with atmospheric <b>aerosol,</b> such as absorption or scattering. It affects both short and longwave radiation {{to produce a}} net negative radiative forcing. The magnitude of the resultant radiative forcing due to the direct effect of an <b>aerosol</b> {{is dependent on the}} albedo of the underlying surface, as this affects the net amount of radiation absorbed or scattered to space. e.g. if a highly scattering <b>aerosol</b> is above a surface of low albedo it has a greater radiative forcing than if it was above a surface of high albedo. The converse is true of absorbing <b>aerosol,</b> with the greatest radiative forcing arising from a highly absorbing <b>aerosol</b> over a surface of high albedo. The direct <b>aerosol</b> effect is a first order effect and is therefore classified as a radiative forcing by the IPCC. The interaction of an <b>aerosol</b> with radiation is quantified by the single-scattering albedo (SSA), the ratio of scattering alone to scattering plus absorption (extinction) of radiation by a particle. The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption. For example, sea-salt <b>aerosol</b> has an SSA of 1, as a sea-salt particle only scatters, whereas soot has an SSA of 0.23, showing that it is a major atmospheric <b>aerosol</b> absorber.|$|E

40|$|The {{fractional}} penetrations of <b>aerosols</b> between 10 and 100 nm through nuclepore {{filters are}} measured for four different <b>aerosols.</b> Nuclepore filter pore diameters varied from 2 to 12 μm while superficial facial velocities ranged from 0. 8 to 6. 6 cm s− 1. Qualitatively, differences were observed between <b>aerosols</b> greater than 40 nm and the condensation <b>aerosols</b> with diameters less than 30 nm. For the smaller particles, the <b>aerosols</b> were widely distributed over the filter face while the larger <b>aerosols</b> were concentrated near the rims of the pore.

A form of spray painting, <b>aerosol</b> paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface, unlike many rolled or brushed paints. In 1949, Ed Seymour of Sycamore, Illinois invented <b>aerosol</b> paint, which he based on the same principle as spray deodorizers and insecticides.

40|$|<b>Aerosols</b> {{have been}} {{suspected}} to transport food pathogens and contaminate {{fruits and vegetables}} grown {{in close proximity to}} concentrated animal feeding operations, but studies are lacking that substantiate such transport. To monitor the potential transport of bacteria originated from fresh or dry manure through <b>aerosols</b> on a dairy, we identified by 16 S rRNA sequencing, bacteria in <b>aerosols</b> collected within 2 to 3 meters from dairy cows at two dairies. Gram-positive Firmicutes were predominant in <b>aerosols</b> from a dairy in Sonoma, California, and surrounded by vineyards, in contrast to sequences of Gram-negative Proteobacteria predominant in <b>aerosols</b> from a dairy in Modesto, California, also surrounded by other dairies. Although Firmicutes represented approximately 50 % of the 10 most abundant sequences, <b>aerosols</b> from the Sonoma dairy also contained sequences of Bacteriodetes and Actinobacteria, identified previously with animal feces. While none of the top 10 sequences from fresh or dry manure from Modesto dairy were detected in <b>aerosols,</b> two of the sequences from the phylum Bacteriodetes and one from class Clostridia from fresh manure were detected in <b>aerosols</b> from Sonoma. Interestingly, none of the sequences from dry manure were in the top 10 sequences in <b>aerosols</b> from both dairies. The 10 most abundant sequences in <b>aerosols</b> from the Modesto dairy were all from Proteobacteria and nearly half of them were from genus Massilia, which have been isolated previously from immune-compromised people and <b>aerosols.</b> We conclude that the predominant bacteria in <b>aerosols</b> are diverse among locations and that they do not reflect the predominant species o...|$|R

50|$|High oil {{compressed}} air coalescing filters remove water and oil <b>aerosols</b> by coalescing the <b>aerosols</b> into droplets.

25|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Johnson {{encouraged}} his scientists to develop the company’s many non-CFC <b>aerosol</b> propellants and pulled his <b>aerosol</b> business out of several countries in which CFCs were mandated in <b>aerosol</b> production.

30|$|Compared {{with the}} global-mean and zonal-mean impacts of <b>aerosols,</b> the {{regional}} impacts of <b>aerosols</b> on a climatological timescale {{are not well}} understood (e.g., Shindell et al. 2012). There are two major sources of anthropogenic <b>aerosols</b> over the Asian monsoon region, i.e., China and India. It is therefore possible that there are clear effects of <b>aerosols.</b> In addition, most studies have investigated the annual mean impact of <b>aerosols.</b> However, seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation can modify the spatial distribution of <b>aerosols</b> and their effects, particularly over the Asian monsoon region, which can have distinct seasonality. Thus, {{we focus on the}} tropical Asian monsoon region (South Asian, Southeast Asian, and western North Pacific monsoons).|$|R

Worldwide CFC production fell sharply after the U.S. <b>aerosol</b> ban, but by 1986 had returned nearly to its 1976 level. In 1993, DuPont shut down its CFC facility.|$|E

Precursors to organic <b>aerosols</b> include vegetation, the ocean surface, and various combustion processes. Ozone is an important oxidant in the troposphere, often in concentrations sufficient to cause adverse effects on human health and vegetation 2.

25|$|<b>Aerosol</b> {{particles}} in the atmosphere impact the health of humans and influence monsoon and global atmospheric circulation systems. Some aerosols produce clouds which cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight back to space, while others, like soot, produce thin clouds in the upper stratosphere which behave like a greenhouse, warming the Earth. On balance, anthropogenic aerosols probably produce a net negative radiative forcing (cooling influence).

Monosaccharide anhydrides (emissions from biomass combustion) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (emissions from traffic and incomplete combustion) were observed especially. Hopanes and steranes (traffic, coal combustion) and fatty acids (cooking) were next groups of monitored organic markers. Markers were studied mainly in size fraction PM 1 because this fraction of <b>aerosols</b> is the most harmful to human health. <b>Aerosols</b> were sampled in two seasons (winter and summer) in two towns in 2009.
