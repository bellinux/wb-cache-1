50|$|When {{a penalty}} corner is awarded, {{a maximum of}} five {{defending}} players (including the goalkeeper) line up behind the <b>back</b> <b>line</b> either in the goal or within 5 metres of the nearest goal post. All other players on the defending team must be behind the centre line. One attacking player places themselves on the <b>back</b> <b>line</b> with the ball, 10 metres from the nearest goal post {{on either side of}} the goal. The remainder of the attacking team players place themselves on the field outside of the shooting circle. All players other than the attacking player on the <b>back</b> <b>line</b> must not have any part of their body or stick touch the ground inside the circle or over the centre line until the ball is in play. The attacking player on the <b>back</b> <b>line</b> is allowed one foot within the circle, but the other foot must remain behind the <b>back</b> <b>line.</b> If any player enters the circle or crosses the centre line prematurely, or the attacking player on the <b>back</b> <b>line</b> does not have one foot outside the circle, the penalty corner is reset and taken again.|$|R

30|$|The front-only lining {{patterns}} that were manufactured for suit pants were for 100 % {{of the companies}} participating (13 out of 13), while the casual pants response for front-only lining patterns was 38.5 % (5 brands out of 13). The reason that the front-only lining was used for menswear pants, was that if the <b>back</b> <b>lining</b> existed, it would disturb {{the movement of the}} wearer. The fit of the pant would not be as comfortable as possible and could cause the lining to become twisted. Thus, it is the general case that all suit pants do not have a <b>back</b> <b>lining</b> piece. There are some exceptions to this guideline, however. If the outer shell fabric of the pant is too rough or too sheer, then a <b>back</b> <b>lining</b> piece is used to for comfort and modesty.|$|R

2500|$|Full-backs usually {{position}} themselves several metres behind the <b>back</b> <b>line.</b> They field any deep opposition kicks {{and are often}} {{the last line of}} defence should an opponent break through the <b>back</b> <b>line.</b> On attack, they can enter the <b>back</b> <b>line,</b> usually near the centres or wings, with the aim of providing an extra person and overlapping the defending players. Three of the most important attributes of a good full-back are good catching ability under a high kick, the ability to punt the ball a long distance with accuracy and the speed and skill to join in <b>back</b> <b>line</b> attacking moves, especially counter-attacks. The full-back is the player most likely to field the high ball or [...] "up and unders" [...] kicked by the opposition. Good hands are needed to ensure the ball is caught cleanly to deny the opposition the chance to regain possession. As the full-back will inevitably catch the ball deep in their own territory with little support from their own players, they should either kick the ball downfield or run forward to link up with their backs to start a counter-attack. If the full-back kicks the ball out, the opposition have the line-out whereas if they start a counter-attack they have a number of options.|$|R
