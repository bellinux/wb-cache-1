In the closing stages, Guinness' stock rose 25 percent — which was unusual, since the stock of the <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> usually falls in a {{takeover}} situation. Guinness paid several people and institutions, most notably American arbitrageur Ivan Boesky, about $38million USD to buy $300USD million worth of Guinness stock. The effect was to increase the value of its offer for Distillers, whose management favored merging with Guinness.|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the financial characteristics of companies involved in merger activity. More specifically, the study aims to determine: (a) whether <b>acquired</b> <b>companies</b> possessed financial characteristics similar to previous failed companies (the 'failing-company' hypothesis); (b) whether <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies</b> possessed financial characteristics similar to previous failed companies and (c) the impact of acquisition on the post-acquisition performance of <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies,</b> and particularly to consider whether their performance differs according to the financial characteristics of the <b>companies</b> they <b>acquired.</b> A new "bankruptcy prediction" model, contemporary with the acquisition data, was derived, tested for robustness, and applied to samples of <b>acquired</b> and <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies.</b> An indirect test of the 'failing-company' hypothesis was carried out by comparison with the results obtained on application of the model to control groups of non-acquired and non-acquiring companies. The test indicated that a higher proportion of <b>acquired</b> <b>companies</b> possessed financial characteristics similar to failed companies than the control group of non-acquired companies. This evidence tends to support the 'failing-company' hypothesis as a motive for mergers for <b>acquired</b> <b>companies.</b> Conversely, there was no such evidence in support of the hypothesis for <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies.</b> The approach adopted also allowed the dichotomy of <b>acquired</b> <b>companies</b> (failing vs. non-failing) which made it possible to test for differential post-acquisition performance of the <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies.</b> In order to evaluate the post-acquisition performance of <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies,</b> three different measurement criteria were adopted. They were: (a) accounting-based profitability and gearing ratios (b) industry-standardardised profitability measure (Meeks (1977)) and (c) performance analysis-scores (PAS-score) (Taffler (1983)). The results indicated that the <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies</b> generally incurred a decline in their post-acquisition profitability measures, while they increased their gearing ratios. Generally, the group <b>acquiring</b> potentially failing <b>companies</b> exhibited 'superior' post-acquisition performance compared with the group <b>acquiring</b> "non-failing" <b>companies.</b> These findings support the managerial motives for mergers since there appears to be little evidence that mergers are undertaken to increase profitability as implied in neoclassical motives. They also suggest the possible need for a review of public policy towards mergers; perhaps mergers ought to be encouraged only if they prevent impending bankruptcy by the acquisition of failing companies...|$|R

50|$|Other takeovers are {{strategic}} in {{that they}} are thought to have secondary effects beyond the simple effect of the profitability of the target company being added to the acquiring company's profitability. For example, an <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> may decide to purchase a company that is profitable and has good distribution capabilities in new areas which the <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> can use for its own products as well. A target company might be attractive because it allows the <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> to enter a new market without having to take on the risk, time and expense of starting a new division. An <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> could decide to take over a competitor not only because the competitor is profitable, but in order to eliminate competition in its field and make it easier, in the long term, to raise prices. Also a takeover could fulfill the belief that the combined company can be more profitable than the two companies would be separately due to a reduction of redundant functions.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of reasons why an <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> may wish to {{purchase}} another company.
