5|$|After the Taft-Díaz summit, Burnham led {{a team of}} 500 men in {{guarding}} mining properties {{owned by}} Hammond, J. P. Morgan, and the Guggenheims in the Mexican state of Sonora. Just as the irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912, <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>series</b> of Mexican revolutions began. The final blow to these efforts came in 1917 when Mexico passed laws prohibiting the sale of land to foreigners. Burnham and Hammond carried their properties until 1930 and then sold them to the Mexican government.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{for many}} Italians the name of Kesselring, whose {{signature}} appeared on posters and printed orders announcing draconian measures adopted by the German occupation, had become synonymous with the oppression and terror that had characterised the German occupation.

The good relations with Poland were reestablished under the reign of Stephen IV the Younger (15171527). His successor, Peter IV Rareş (15271538, 15411546) intervened {{in the struggle for}} the crown of the Kingdom of Hungary: on the order of the sultan, in 1529 he invaded the Székely Land and defeated the army of Ferdinand I's partisans.|$|E

5|$|The Crawford {{expedition}}, {{also known}} as the Sandusky expedition and Crawford's Defeat, was a 1782 campaign on the western front of the American Revolutionary War, and one of the final operations of the conflict. Led by Colonel William Crawford, the campaign's goal was to destroy enemy American Indian towns along the Sandusky River in the Ohio Country, with the hope of ending Indian attacks on American settlers. The expedition was one in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>series</b> of raids against enemy settlements which both sides had conducted throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|The Villalba attack inaugurated <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>series</b> of Mafia {{attacks in}} Sicily on {{political}} activists, trade union leaders and ordinary peasants resisting Mafia rule. In {{the following years}} many left-wing leaders were killed or otherwise attacked, culminating {{in the killing of}} 11 people and the wounding of over thirty at a May 1 labour parade in Portella della Ginestra. The Portella della Ginestra massacre was attributed to the bandit and separatist leader Salvatore Giuliano. Nevertheless, the Mafia was suspected of involvement in the bloodbath and many other attacks on left-wing organisations and leaders.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} ended soon after, in {{an effective}} stalemate and a formal compromise: a Parthian prince of the Arsacid line would henceforth {{sit on the}} Armenian throne, but his nomination had {{to be approved by}} the Roman emperor. This conflict was the first direct confrontation between Parthia and the Romans since Crassus' disastrous expedition and Mark Antony's campaigns a century earlier, and would be the first of <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>series</b> of wars between Rome and Iranian powers over Armenia (see Roman–Persian Wars).|$|E
5|$|Americans' {{eagerness to}} expand westward {{prompted}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>series</b> of American Indian Wars. The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's area. The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism. A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which were connected by new canals, {{such as the}} Erie and the I; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.|$|E

5|$|By many general {{criteria}} of mutual intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian languages {{could very well}} be considered dialects of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden, including <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>series</b> of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Scania, could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>series</b> of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E
5|$|During {{the latter}} half of the eighth century, the Northumbrian {{succession}} included <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>series</b> of murdered and deposed kings, as several royal lines contended for the throne. The main lines were those of Eadberht, Æthelwald Moll and Alhred. In the eight years before Eardwulf's accession, all three of these dynastic lines were involved in the struggle for kingship: on 23 September 788, King Ælfwald I, grandson of Eadberht, was murdered by the patricius Sicga near Hexham, and Ælfwald's cousin Osred became king. Osred, who was of Alhred's line, was deposed after a year, and Æthelred, son of Æthelwald Moll, who had been deposed in 778 at a young age, was restored to the kingship, resuming the title Æthelred I.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, Bell Labs {{formulated}} {{their own}} set of requirements for radar work in relation to Nike-X.

Additionally, a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star aircraft was refit with optical and infrared telescopes for optical tracking tests. The first series of tests, RMP-A, focused on modern conical reentry vehicles. It concluded on 30 June 1966. These demonstrated that these vehicles were difficult to discriminate because of their low drag. RMP-B ran between 1967 and 1970, supported by 17 launches from Vandenberg, {{with a wide variety}} of vehicle shapes and penetration aids.|$|E
5|$|Lilly van Java (Lily of Java), {{also known}} as Melatie van Java (Jasmine of Java), is a 1928 film from the Dutch East Indies {{directed}} by Nelson Wong. Initially meant to be produced by South Sea Film and shot by an American director, the film– which follows a woman told to marry a man she does not love– was ultimately completed by Wong's Halimoen Film. Details on its cast and performance are contradictory, although the film is recognised as the first of <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>series</b> of ethnic Chinese-produced films in the country.

5|$|On 20 August 1919 at the Chalmers Church, North Terrace, Adelaide, Rowell married Blanche May Murison, the {{daughter}} of a Scottish engineer. Blanche had served in the Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps in Australia during the war. Due to his brief overseas service, {{the end of the war}} found Rowell still a lieutenant and thus junior in rank to his contemporaries but the snail-like pace of promotions between the wars allowed him to gradually catch up. He was promoted to captain on 1 January 1920, major on 1 January 1926, and the brevet rank lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1935, with substantive rank on 1 January 1936. His inter-war career consisted of <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>series</b> of staff postings, interspersed with training courses.|$|E
