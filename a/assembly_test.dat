This paper reviews optimal <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> literature and introduces the contributions to this Special Issue. Four approaches to computerized <b>test</b> <b>assembly</b> are discussed: heuristic-based <b>test</b> <b>assembly,</b> 0 - 1 linear programming, network-flow programming, and an optimal design approach. Ap-plications of these methods to a variety of problems are examined, including IRT-based <b>test</b> <b>assembly,</b> classical <b>test</b> <b>assembly,</b> assembling multiple <b>test</b> forms, item matching, observed-score equating, constrained adaptive testing, assembling tests with item sets, item bank design, and assembling tests with multiple traits.
