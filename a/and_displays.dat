40|$|Increasing storage <b>and</b> <b>display</b> {{temperature}} <b>and</b> time {{of ground}} beef significantly increased microbial counts but lean level had no effect. Prolonged storage at abusive temperatures (48 °F) caused up to 90 % unacceptable chubs and aerobic bacteria counts {{as high as}} 7. 7 log 10 CFU/g, which would render chubs unsatisfactory for further processing, packaging and sale. Thus, ground beef chubs should be stored at 32 °F. and as briefly as possible to minimize pre- and post-display microbial counts. Maintaining both optimal storage <b>and</b> <b>display</b> temperatures is critical because combining abusive storage <b>and</b> <b>display</b> conditions resulted in the greatest microbial growth.
