40|$|Owing to {{low cost}} and {{relatively}} accurate range measurement, ultrasonic sensors {{are widely used}} in various simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) applications. In spite of the abundance of ultrasonic sensor based SLAM applications, a simple and efficient algorithm for an ultrasonic sensor based positioning system with good <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> low computational <b>complexity</b> has not yet emerged. The major difficulty is the trade-off between localisation <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> computational <b>complexity</b> in most SLAM algorithms, such as extended Kalman filter (EKF) and particle filter. Typically, they improve localisation accuracy by increasing {{the density of the}} landmarks, as a result leading to high computational <b>complexity</b> of algorithms <b>and</b> limiting the utilisation of algorithms into online SLAM systems. This study addresses an improved particle filter algorithm to solve ultrasonic sensor based 2 D range-only SLAM problem with relatively good <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> low computational <b>complexity.</b> This algorithm uses a simple four fixed features based system model to limit the density of the landmarks. A technique called map adjustment is proposed to increase the <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> efficiency of the algorithm.

It is designed for finding the best tradeoff between <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> (compression) when summarizing (e.g. clustering) a random variable X, given a joint probability distribution p(X,Y) between X and an observed relevant variable Y. Other applications include distributional clustering, and dimension reduction. In a well defined sense it generalized the classical notion of minimal sufficient statistics from parametric statistics to arbitrary distributions, not necessarily of exponential form. It does so by relaxing the sufficiency condition to capture some fraction of the mutual information with the relevant variable Y.|$|E

50|$|As production-based {{emissions}} accounting is currently favoured in policy terms, its methodology is well established. Emissions are calculated not directly but indirectly from fossil fuel usage and other relevant {{processes such as}} industry and agriculture according to 2006 guidelines issued by the IPCC for GHG reporting. The guidelines span numerous methodologies dependent {{on the level of}} sophistication (Tiers 1-3 in Table 2). The simplest methodology combines the extent of a human activity with a coefficient quantifying the emissions from that activity, known as an âemission factorâ. For example to estimate emissions from the energy sector (typically contributing over 90% of CO2 emissions and 75% of all GHG emissions in developed countries) the quantity of fuels combusted is combined with an emission factor - the level of sophistication increasing with the <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> of the emission factor. Table 2 outlines how the UK implements these guidelines to estimate some of its emissions-producing activities.|$|E

Researchers have found that giving planning time to learners can improve their L 2 development (Foster & Skehan, 1996, Wendel, 1997). However, a few current findings about task planning are non comprehensive and nonsystematic. To fill this gap, this study examined the effects of both planning conditions and gender on learnersâ oral performance in terms of <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> among 40 Iranian students at an intermediate level. A total number of 40 participants based on an interview were selected for this study. Based on planning conditions, the participants were assigned to planning and non planning groups.

The findings revealed that 10 -minute planning, in comparison with no planning time, improved the <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b> of participantsâ oral performance. Also, results regarding the effects of gender clarified that gender did not have any effect on the participantsâ oral performance in terms of <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>complexity...</b>|$|E

The two main objectives in {{decision tree}} induction are accurate predictions for unseen instances and human comprehensibility. In this paper, we use multiobjective optimization {{for the evolution of}} decision tree classifiers that are efficient both with respect to classification <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> classifier <b>complexity.</b> Simpler decision trees are generally more comprehensible to humans at the expense of accuracy. We employ the Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization using Crowding Distance (MOPSO-CD) algorithm to evolve a population of decision trees that are optimal on two objectives: classification <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> classifier <b>complexity</b> based on the Minimum Description Length Principle. The validity and performance of this approach is evaluated on several commonly-used benchmark datasets. The results show that our approach is indeed effective in inducing multiple decision trees that are accurate and simple. ...|$|R
