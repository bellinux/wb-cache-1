500|$|In {{the first}} years after its foundation, Israel met a problem with social {{integration}} of new immigrants who had arrived after the war, who had received much trauma from their exodus from Arab lands or from the death camps, and had suffered six years of war.

[...] His speeches at the Union had more humour in them; the atmosphere was entirely different. But his speeches at the Labour Club were deadly serious... His influence at the Labour Club, more than anyone else's, I think, explains {{the failure of the}} Communists to make headway there.

500|$|When {{football}} season {{arrived in the}} fall, Chappuis {{was one of many}} veterans who returned to college and the gridiron after serving in the war. Many of the returning veterans were not in prime football condition {{at the start of the}} 1946 season, and Coach Fritz Crisler [...] "predicted it might be November before ex-servicemen were adjusted physically and mentally to play their top game." [...] Chappuis later recalled that he was 23years old when he returned to school, and some of the returning veterans [...] "didn't know if they could get back into the rah-rah of college football, but Fritz took care of that. He really whipped us into shape." [...] Despite any difficulties in re-adjusting to civilian life and football, Chappuis broke Otto Graham's Big Nine Conference record for total offensive yards during the 1946 {{football season}}. Though reports differ as to Chappuis' total yards gained, University of Michigan records show that Chappuis gained 1,284yards in 1946—734yards passing, 501yards rushing and 49yards receiving. Chappuis set the new offensive mark in 1946 with a fractured bone in his wrist that he did not report until after the season had ended, at which time an operation was performed. Chappuis later said he knew the x-ray would reveal a fracture, and he would be benched before he even began. He delayed the examination until the season was over because [...] "the time to break into the lineup is prior to the first game. If I hadn't, there were so many capable candidates <b>around</b> <b>who</b> could have made good behind our front wall that I'd never have become a first-stringer by returning in the middle of the season." [...] Accordingly, Chappuis played the 1946 season with a fractured wrist and without even bothering to tape the wrist.|$|E

Having joined the Federation of Conservative Students, he described his politics as [...] "Thatcher on drugs".

Her mother was apparently physically abusive, and Kusama remembers her father as [...] "...the type who would play <b>around,</b> <b>who</b> would womanize a lot". Kusama says that her mother would often send her to spy on her father's extra-marital affairs, which instilled within her a lifelong contempt for sexuality, particularly the male body and the phallus: [...] "I don’t like sex. I had an obsession with sex. When I was a child, my father had lovers and I experienced seeing him. My mother sent me to spy on him. I didn’t want to have sex with anyone for years [...] The sexual obsession and fear of sex sit side by side in me." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} major issues were {{discussed}} in the opening round of talks. One major point of discussion revolved <b>around</b> <b>who</b> would lead any reunited federation. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney was widely expected to retire at the trade union center's August 2009 convention, and Laborer's president Terence O'Sullivan and AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka had been discussed as his successors. The nature of the AFL-CIO presidency {{was part of the}} leadership talks, with some unions suggesting that the presidency rotate among member unions while others hoped for a strong and vocal [...] "executive director" [...] position. The two sides agreed that any reunited labor federation should have a stronger voice in national politics as well as have a greater say in helping member unions engage in more new member organizing. The two sides also discussed whether to change the name of the AFL-CIO, or whether to adopt an entirely new organizational structure. Among other issues discussed were: How the AFL-CIO/new organization would encourage new member organizing and at what level (national or local), what a reunited labor movement's political priorities should be, what sort of relationship a reunited labor movement will have with the Democratic and Republican parties, the level of member union dues, and globalization issues. Although one news outlet reported that the 12 unions hoped to settle on a reunification agreement by April 15, 2009, no issues were resolved {{in the first round of}} talks.|$|E
