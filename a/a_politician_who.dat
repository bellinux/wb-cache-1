5|$|Modern {{interpretations of}} Constantine's rule begin with Jacob Burckhardt's The Age of Constantine the Great (1853, rev. 1880). Burckhardt's Constantine is a scheming secularist, <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> <b>who</b> manipulates all parties in {{a quest to}} secure his own power. Henri Grégoire, writing in the 1930s, {{followed}} Burckhardt's evaluation of Constantine. For Grégoire, Constantine developed an interest in Christianity only after witnessing its political usefulness. Grégoire was skeptical of the authenticity of Eusebius' Vita, and postulated a pseudo-Eusebius to assume responsibility for the vision and conversion narratives of that work. Otto Seeck, in Geschichte des Untergangs der antiken Welt (1920–23), and André Piganiol, in L'empereur Constantin (1932), wrote against this historiographic tradition. Seeck presented Constantine as a sincere war hero, whose ambiguities were the product of his own naïve inconsistency. Piganiol's Constantine is a philosophical monotheist, a child of his era's religious syncretism. Related histories by A.H.M. Jones (Constantine and the Conversion of Europe, 1949) and Ramsay MacMullen (Constantine, 1969) gave portraits of a less visionary, and more impulsive, Constantine.|$|E
5|$|William Howe {{was born}} in England, the third son of Emanuel Howe, 2nd Viscount Howe and Charlotte, the {{daughter}} of Sophia von Kielmansegg, Countess of Leinster and Darlington, an acknowledged illegitimate half-sister of King George I. His mother was a regular in the courts of George II and George III. This connection with the crown may have improved the careers of all four sons, but all were also very capable officers. His father was <b>a</b> <b>politician,</b> <b>who</b> served as Governor of Barbados where he died in 1735. William's eldest brother, General George Howe, was killed just before the 1758 Battle of Carillon at Fort Ticonderoga. Another brother, Admiral Richard Howe, rose {{to become one of}} Britain's leading naval commanders. A third brother, Thomas, commanded ships for the East India Company, Winchelsea in 1762–4 and Nottingham in 1766, and made observations on Madeira and on the Comoro Islands.|$|E

25|$|Smuts {{is often}} {{accused of being}} <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> <b>who</b> extolled the virtues of humanitarianism and {{liberalism}} abroad while failing to practice what he preached at home in South Africa. This was most clearly illustrated when India, in 1946, made a formal complaint in the UN concerning the legalised racial discrimination against Indians in South Africa. Appearing personally before the United Nations General Assembly, Smuts defended the policies of his government by fervently pleading that India's complaint {{was a matter of}} domestic jurisdiction. However, the General Assembly censured South Africa for its racial policies and called upon the Smuts government to bring its treatment of the South African Indians in conformity with the basic principles of the United Nations Charter.|$|E

25|$|Due to the region's {{relatively}} sparse population, {{federal and}} provincial electoral {{districts in the}} region are almost all extremely large geographically. The federal electoral district of Sudbury and the provincial electoral districts of Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie are the only ones that are comparable in size to an electoral district in Southern Ontario, while at the other extreme the districts of Kenora and Timmins—James Bay are both geographically larger than the entire United Kingdom. One consequence of this, for example, is that <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> <b>who</b> represents a Northern Ontario riding in the Canadian House of Commons or the Legislative Assembly of Ontario must typically maintain a much higher budget for travel and office expenses than one who represents a small urban district does.|$|E
25|$|The term carpet bag, which {{literally}} {{refers to}} a suitcase made from a piece of carpet, is used in several figurative contexts. The term gained a popular usage after the American Civil War to refer to carpetbaggers, Northerners {{who moved to the}} South after the war, especially during the Reconstruction era (1865–1877). Carpetbaggers allegedly politically manipulated and controlled former Confederate states for financial and power gains. In modern usage in the U.S., the term is sometimes used derisively to refer to <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> <b>who</b> runs for public office in an area where he or she does not have deep community ties, or has lived only for a short time. In the United Kingdom, the term was adopted to refer informally to those who join a mutual organization, such as a building society, in order to force it to demutualize, that is, to convert into a joint stock company, solely for personal financial gain.|$|E
25|$|Havens {{was born}} in the Bronx on March 31, 1920, the son of William Havens Sr., a civil engineer, and Elsie S. Nedle, a schoolteacher. He had an older sister, Marjorie, who became a lawyer. He was a {{descendant}} of Jonathan Nicoll Havens, <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> <b>who</b> served in the United States Congress from 1795 to 1799. He was educated at Evander Childs High School, from which he graduated in 1935 at the age of 15. His father wanted him to enter Columbia University, his own alma mater, but Columbia would not accept his on account of his age. He therefore entered the City College of New York, which he attended on a scholarship. While there he was on the swimming team, and served in the ROTC, reaching the rank of cadet captain. During the summer of 1938 he was a lifeguard at the ROTC camp. The following year he worked as a lifeguard at Jones Beach Island. He graduated with his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1939, majoring in mathematics and chemistry.|$|E
