40|$|Atmospheric {{channels}} are a promising candidate to establish secure quantum communication {{on a global}} scale. However, due to their turbulent nature, {{it is crucial to}} understand the impact of the atmosphere on the quantum properties of light and examine it experimentally. In this paper, we introduce a method to probe atmospheric free-space links with quantum light on a laboratory scale. In contrast to previous works, our method models arbitrary intensity losses caused by turbulence to emulate general atmospheric conditions. This allows us to characterize turbulent quantum channels in a well-controlled manner. To implement this technique, we perform a series of measurements with different constant attenuations and simulate the fluctuating losses by combining the obtained data. We directly test the proposed method with an on-chip source of nonclassical light and a time-bin-multiplexed detection system. With the obtained data, we characterize the nonclassicality of the generated states for different atmospheric noise models and analyze a post-selection protocol. This general technique in <b>atmospheric</b> quantum <b>optics</b> allows for studying turbulent quantum channels and predicting their properties for future applications...|$|R

In addition to the nonlinear Schroedinger equation, important examples include the derivative nonlinear Schroedinger equation, the quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, and the Gerdjikov-Ivanov equation. This approach provides a mathematical description of nonstationary media supporting unidimensional signal propagation and/or total field trapping. In particular, we study self-similar and nonspreading wave packets for Schroedinger equations. Some other important coherent structures are also analyzed and applications to nonlinear waves in inhomogeneous media such as <b>atmospheric</b> plasma, fiber <b>optics,</b> hydrodynamics, and Bose-Einstein condensation are discussed.

40|$|Current {{projects}} for large telescopes demand a proper knowledge of atmospheric turbulence to design efficient adaptive optics systems {{in order to}} reach large Strehl ratios. However, the proper characterization of the turbulence above a particular site requires long-term monitoring. Due to the lack of long-term information on turbulence, high-altitude winds (in particular winds at the 200 mbar pressure level) were proposed as a parameter for estimating the total turbulence at a particular site, with the advantage of records of winds going back several decades. We present the first complete study of <b>atmospheric</b> adaptive <b>optics</b> parameters above the Teide Observatory (Canary Islands, Spain) in relation to wind speed. On-site measurements of CN 2 (h) profiles (more than 20200 turbulence profiles) from G-SCIDAR observations and wind vertical profiles from balloons have been used to calculate the seeing, the isoplanatic angle and the coherence time. The connection of these parameters to wind speeds at ground and 200 mbar pressure level are shown and discussed. Our results confirm the well-known high quality of the Canary Islands astronomical observatories. Comment: 25 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables with daily AO parameters (100 nights).

40|$|This book {{outlines}} the basic physical principles and practical methods of polarimetric remote sensing of Solar System objects and summarizes numerous advanced applications of polarimetry in geophysics and planetary astrophysics. In {{the first chapter}} we present a complete and rigorous theory of electromagnetic scattering by disperse media directly based on the Maxwell equations and describe advanced physically based modeling tools. This is followed, in Chapter 2, by a theoretical analysis of polarimetry as a remote-sensing tool and an outline of basic principles of polarimetric measurements and their practical implementations. In Chapters 3 and 4, we describe the results of extensive ground-based, aircraft, and spacecraft observations of numerous Solar System objects (the Earth and other planets, planetary satellites, Saturn's rings, asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects, and comets). Theoretical analyses of these data are used to retrieve optical and physical characteristics of planetary surfaces and atmospheres {{as well as to}} identify a number of new phenomena and effects.

40|$|Shack Hartmann {{wavefront}} sensor is a {{two dimensional}} array of lenslets {{which is used}} to detect the incoming phase distorted wavefront through local tilt measurements made by recording the spot pattern near the focal plane. Wavefront reconstruction is performed in two stages - (a) image centroiding to calculate local slopes, (b) formation of the wavefront shape from local slope measurement. Centroiding accuracy contributes to most of the wavefront reconstruction error in Shack Hartmann sensor based adaptive optics system with readout and background noise. It becomes even more difficult in <b>atmospheric</b> adaptive <b>optics</b> case, where scintillation effects may also occur. In this paper we used a denoising technique based on thresholded Zernike reconstructor to minimize the effects due to readout and background noise. At low signal to noise ratio, this denoising technique can be improved further by taking the advantage of the shape of the spot. Assuming a Gaussian pattern for individual spots, it is shown that the centroiding accuracy can be improved in the presence of strong scintillations and background.

40|$|Abstract—Turbulences in the Earths {{atmosphere}} lead to {{the loss}} in spatial resolution power of ground based telescopes. The common mechanism used {{to deal with this}} phenomenon is Adaptive Optics (AO), which compensates for the loss in resolution power, in real time, by means of a servo-control loop. In this paper, we propose a new approach to phase reconstruction of astronomical images using Microcanonical Multiscale Formalism (herein referred to as MMF) and also check the performance of the reconstruction under noise. In fact, turbulent flows, although chaotic in nature, possess a complex arrangement of geometrical structures related to the cascading properties of physical variables; the properties of these variables reflect the transfer of energy taking place from large scales to smaller ones. The geometrical representation of the cascade process can be exploited by the use of an appropriate wavelet (here Battle-Lemarié of order 3) decomposition which leads to a proper reconstruction of the turbulent phase.
