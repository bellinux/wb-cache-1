5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Others, the Simpson family find unexplained frosty {{chocolate}} milkshakes and that their TV only shows Married... with Children. After a ghost attacks him in his sleep, Homer summons the ghosts, who are the family's former selves from The Tracey Ullman Show. Homer is attracted to the ghost Marge who prefers him to the former grumpy Homer, so the jealous living Marge kills herself to become a ghost.

Bart fakes suicide to join the ghosts, tricking Lisa into actually killing herself, her ghost then murders Bart as revenge. Groundskeeper Willie takes the children's corpses to make stew and it is implied that he murdered Maggie. Homer chooses his modern-day wife over the older ghost.

25|$|In 1960, Gardner's {{official}} biography, entitled Gerald Gardner: Witch, was published. It {{was written}} by a friend of his, the Sufi mystic Idries Shah, but used {{the name of one}} of Gardner's High Priests, Jack L. Bracelin, because Shah was wary about being associated with Witchcraft. In May of that year, Gardner travelled to Buckingham Palace, where he enjoyed a garden party in recognition of his years of service to the Empire in the Far East. Soon after his trip, Gardner's wife Donna died, and Gardner himself once again began to suffer badly from asthma. The following year he, along with Shah and Lois Bourne, travelled to the island of Majorca to holiday with the poet Robert Graves, whose The White Goddess would play a significant part in the burgeoning Wiccan religion. In 1963, Gardner decided to go to Lebanon over the winter. Whilst returning home on the ship, The Scottish Prince on 12 February 1964, he suffered a fatal heart attack <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> table. He was buried in Tunisia, the ship's next port of call, and his funeral was attended only by the ship's captain. He was 79 years old.|$|E

He had met his second wife, Carol Held Knight (b. 1945), in 1992 at a golf tournament, where they were seated together <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> table. She said little to Armstrong, but two weeks later she {{received a call from}} him asking what she was doingâ€”she replied she was cutting down a cherry tree; 35 minutes later Armstrong was at her house to help out. They were married on June 12, 1994, in Ohio, and then had a second ceremony, at San Ysidro Ranch, in California. He lived in Indian Hill, Ohio.|$|E
500|$|Seeking {{to spend}} time with her family, Lois decides to take them out to the ballet Swan Lake, on a late school night. The next morning, Chris is seen {{studying}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> table for an upcoming exam at school. After first being told not to study at the table by Lois, Brian notices that Chris's history textbook is hopelessly out of date. Upset by this, Lois goes to a PTA meeting to complain about the textbook. Responding to her grievances, Principal Shepherd explains that the school cannot afford new textbooks due to the school's loss of federal funding under the No Child Left Behind Act {{as a result of their}} low test scores. Forced to make a decision on how to improve the scores and the school's overall performance, Principal Shepherd decides to expel the school's [...] "dumbest" [...] student, who is revealed to be Chris Griffin.|$|E

He allegedly called Obama the [...] "Antichrist" [...] <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast,</b> and made similar threats against Obama later at a hotel. Blanchard {{was placed in}} custody {{despite the fact that}} no evidence surfaced that he planned to go through with an assassination attempt. Later that same month in Florida, Raymond H. Geisel was charged with making threatening statements against Obama during a bail-bonds training class on July 31. Geisel also threatened to put a bullet in the head of then-President Bush, although Geisel later claimed he was joking. He was found to be in possession of ammunition, body armor, a combat-style hatchet, tear gas, a loaded 9mm handgun and four loaded magazines. Geisel said he collected firearms, and was only using the gun for his bail-bonds course. Geisel remained in custody for a month.|$|E
500|$|Paul Knauls, a local {{resident}} and entrepreneur who {{was described as}} the [...] "unofficial mayor" [...] of Northeast Portland, was [...] "instrumental" [...] in securing funding for the sculpture's design. Cheryl Perrin and Betsy Brumm coordinated fundraising, with assistance from Charles Lewis; before Lewis invited U.S. Senator Mark Hatfield, for whom he had worked as an intern, to speak at a breakfast fundraiser, fundraising efforts had stalled for eight years. Oregon's Congressional delegation wrote appeals to large companies, requesting their support <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast.</b> Within {{six months of the}} campaign's re-launch, $300,000 was raised, enough to create the sculpture.

500|$|When Homer is mowing {{his lawn}} with obvious frustration, his next-door {{neighbor}} Ned Flanders invites {{him into his}} basement rumpus room for a beer. Upon seeing Ned's house and observing his exaggeratedly perfect relationships {{with his wife and}} son, Homer erupts at Ned, accusing him of showing off. Ned angrily asks Homer to leave in response. Later, however, he feels guilty and writes a letter to Homer saying that he is really sorry and that he loves him as a brother. [...] Homer is amused by Ned's sentimentality and reads the letter to the family <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> table. Marge is not happy with the family's reaction, despite being unable to control her laughter, and chastises Homer for making light of Ned's sincere apology. Afterward, Homer takes Bart and Maggie to Sir Putt-A-Lot's Merrie Olde Fun Centre for a round of miniature golf. They unexpectedly run into Ned and his son Todd and end up going golfing together.|$|E

500|$|In the {{following}} verse, Lewis and Haynes are seen having several embraces, some joyful {{while others are}} more tense as Lewis is sad. The couple are then seen leaving the party; Haynes walks over to Lewis and attempts to kiss, but she proceeds to push him away. During the second airing of the chorus, more images of happy scenes between the couple are spliced with Lewis waking up in bed to find Haynes has slept on the sofa. More passionate embraces between the couple are seen before Lewis is seen breaking down in tears. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> that follows, the couple break {{into a series of}} arguments. Lewis shoves Haynes onto the sofa, and Haynes grabs Lewis as she turns away. Lewis then slaps Hayne around the face. During the middle eight breakdown in the song, [...] Haynes throws books from a shelf, and Lewis throws objects at Haynes including a cushion, as well as pushing over a lamp. Haynes subsequently leaves, driving away into the distance, and Lewis falls to the wall and breaks down in tears.|$|E
500|$|... "Peterotica" [...] {{was written}} by Patrick Meighan and {{directed}} by Kurt Dumas. The episode ran into multiple objections from broadcasting standards and the show's producers. For instance, the original title of the episode was [...] "A Connecticut Yankee and King Arthur's Butt", but broadcasting standards objected. A sequence showing all of the different erotic novels written by Peter was edited for the television version; one entitled Catcher in the Eye {{was removed from the}} television version as broadcasting standards disliked the cover, which implied her eye was a target for semen during ejaculation. The scene of Peter reading his new erotic novel to Lois was never cut from airing, although the producers of Family Guy had some trouble with it, as it is the second semen joke of the episode. When Lois' father, Carter, sits down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> table, Lois states: [...] "Daddy, did you remember to clean up?" [...] Originally, she was meant to say, [...] "Daddy, did you remember to wipe yourself?", but broadcasting standards objected, so it was modified to [...] "Daddy, did you remember to clean yourself?" [...] However, standards still objected, so it was changed to its current version.|$|E
500|$|Anne Bower {{writes about}} Jewish {{characters}} at mealtime {{as part of}} the broader movement she believes started in the 1960s where filmmakers started producing work that explored the [...] "Jewish self-definition." [...] She postulates that the dinner table becomes an arena where Jewish characters are often and most pointedly put into [...] "conflicts with their ethnic and sexual selves." [...] She describes the example of Greg sitting down for dinner with the Byrnes family and being asked to bless the food. In this scene, Greg attempts to recite a prayer by improvising and, in doing so, launches into a recital of the song [...] "Day by Day" [...] from Act I of Godspell. Bower notes this scene as [...] "particularly important for establishing the cultural distance" [...] between the Jewish Greg and the Christian Byrnes. She noted that the social gap is further widened next morning when Greg is the last person to arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> table; he shows up wearing pajamas while everyone else is fully clothed. Here Greg is shown eating a bagel, which Bower argues as being a clear signifier of Jewishness.|$|E
