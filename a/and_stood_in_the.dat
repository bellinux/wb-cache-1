5|$|Two {{statues of}} Riel {{are located in}} Winnipeg. One of the Winnipeg statues, the work of {{architect}} Étienne Gaboury and sculptor Marcien Lemay, depicts Riel as a naked and tortured figure. It was unveiled in 1970 <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grounds of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for 23 years. After much outcry (especially from the Métis community) that the statue was an undignified misrepresentation, the statue was removed and placed at the Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface. It was replaced in 1994 with a statue designed by Miguel Joyal depicting Riel as a dignified statesman. The unveiling ceremony was on 16 May 1996, in Winnipeg.|$|E

25|$|In April 1970, {{a general}} {{election}} was held with the Rhodesian Front easily winning. Ian Smith portrayed his government as not being racialist, and sought to postpone {{the question of what}} to do about the problems in the farming industry until after the election. Indeed, he was able to do so because more radical and more racist parties had at that time been formed <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> election.|$|E

25|$|Darrell Bruce Hair (born 30 September 1952) is an Australian former Test match cricket umpire, from New South Wales. He {{stood on}} the International panel of umpires from 2002 to 2003, before he, along with fellow Australian Simon Taufel, and New Zealander Billy Bowden, was {{appointed}} to the ICC Elite umpire panel. After an ICC board meeting discussed his actions in a Test match between Pakistan and England in 2006 it was decided he should not umpire matches involving the test playing nations. He was restored to the Elite Panel by the ICC on 12 March 2008 <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> England v New Zealand tests at Old Trafford in May and Trent Bridge in June 2008.|$|E
25|$|The Bernward Doors depict {{scenes from}} the Book of Genesis (left door) {{arranged}} in parallel to {{scenes from the}} Gospels (right door). The scenes are organized {{based on the principle}} that Adam and Christ mirror each other - with Christ's sacrificial death redeeming Adam's sin. The left door depicts the increasing estrangement of humanity from God from top to bottom: the Creation, the Fall, Cain's murder of Abel. The right door shows the redemptive work of Christ from bottom to top: the Annunciation and Nativity, the Passion, the Resurrection). The depictions of the right door, in which the birth and childhood of Jesus are followed immediately by his passion and resurrection, are complemented thematically by the depiction of his life and ministry on the Bernward Column, which was probably also donated by Bernward, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east choir of St. Michael's until the eighteenth century.|$|E
25|$|On 18 January 1973, the {{enacting}} of {{an emergency}} law saw Kekkonen's presidency extended by four years. By this time, Kekkonen had secured the backing of most political parties, but the major right-wing National Coalition Party, which Kekkonen had opposed, was still sceptical, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of the required 5/6 majority. Concurrently, Finland was negotiating a free-trade agreement with the EEC, and as the EEC agreement promoted economic integration with the West, it was supported by National Coalition Party. Kekkonen had implied {{that if he did}} not remain president, the Soviets would not accept Finland's free trade agreement with the EEC. The tactic secured National Coalition support and the subsequent passing {{of an emergency}} law. The elimination of any significant opposition and competition meant he became Finland's de facto political autocrat. His power reached its zenith in 1975 when he dissolved parliament and hosted the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki with the assistance of a caretaker government.|$|E

That year, he returned to Cambodia and acquired a broadcasting license for a new station which he named Beehive Radio. He used the station to advertise a new political party, the Beehive Democratic Society Party, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1998 parliamentary election. According to the Asia Times, his campaign only won him [...] "a reputation as an eccentric, spouting Buddhist philosophy, pleas for democracy and a personal campaign for attention."

500|$|The {{funeral was}} {{arranged}} for November 1, {{with the public}} invited to the memorial service at the Hall of Liberty, within the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Hollywood Hills. It was a secular service; Roddenberry had been cremated before the event. More than 300 Star Trek fans attended, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> balcony section of the hall, while the invited guests were on the floor level. Nichols sang twice during the ceremony, first [...] "Yesterday" [...] and then a song she wrote herself titled [...] "Gene". Both songs had been requested by Barrett. Several people spoke at the memorial, including Ray Bradbury, Whoopi Goldberg, Christopher Knopf, E. Jack Newman, and Patrick Stewart. The ceremony was closed by two kilted pipers playing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] as a recorded message by Roddenberry was broadcast. A four-plane flypast, in the missing man formation, followed some 30 minutes later. After his death, Star Trek: The Next Generation aired a two-part episode of season five, called [...] "", which featured a dedication to Roddenberry.|$|E

500|$|The {{church was}} found to have been free-standing, so any other monastic {{buildings}} must have stood apart. In 1966, archaeologists discovered the foundations of what they identified as probably a medieval building, rectangular and on an east-west axis, with its eastern wall aligned with that of the church precinct, which it pre-dated. Extending over and in contact with the western end of a Roman bath house, it stood a few yards east of the south-eastern corner of the 13th-century chancel. This building was not recorded by William Boys, who drew a plan of the Roman fort and the church in 1781. Otherwise no such buildings have been found, but they may all have been in the area {{to the north of the}} church, which has been lost to the sea. In this connection Peers noted that the cloisters of the early Canterbury churches of St Augustine's and Christ Church were both on their northern sides, and that St Augustine's had also been free-standing in the 7th century. A building that stood west-northwest of the church may have had an Anglo-Saxon doorway and the dimensions of an Anglo-Saxon church, and had [...] "the appearance of having been part of some monastic erection". It was demolished after the sea weakened its foundations during storms in the winter of 1782. Leland reported another building outside the churchyard, where it was believed that a parish church had stood while the main church at Reculver was still a monastery: this building, formerly a chapel dedicated to St James, was later known as the [...] "chapel-house", <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north-eastern corner of the fort until it collapsed into the sea on 13October 1802. Peers noted further that it seems to have had brick arches.|$|E
2500|$|Trying {{to inspire}} {{his men to}} attack, Bonaparte grabbed a flag <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open on the dike [...] "about 55 paces" [...] from the bridge. He {{remained}} miraculously untouched, but several members of his staff were hit by the intense fire and his aide-de-camp, Jean-Baptiste Muiron, was killed. An unknown officer dragged Bonaparte {{out of the line}} of fire and the commanding general ended up in the muddy ditch.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} election, Miller led {{the council to}} reverse its support for the Toronto City Centre Airport Bridge. He argued that the bridge was {{detrimental}} to the regional environment, was unwanted by most local residents, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of a more comprehensive renewal of the waterfront economy. Supporters of the bridge argued {{that it would make}} airline service more efficient, and provide a financial benefit. [...] The vote, held on December 3, 2003, was 32-12 in favour of withdrawal. [...] Afterwards, the federal government announced that it would withdraw its support for the project. [...] There were subsequent threats of legal action against the City by the Toronto Port Authority (TPA) and developer Robert Deluce, but these were settled in 2005 when the federal government agreed to pay $35 million in compensation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{station was}} {{initially}} named Holton-le-Clay and Tetney to reflect its location one {{mile to the}} south of the Lincolnshire village of Holton-le-Clay and slightly closer to Tetney to the east. It consisted of staggered platforms either side of the level crossing over the Tetney road; the down platform to the north and the up to the south. A signal box constructed in the standard East Lincolnshire Railway pattern stood {{on the north side of}} the crossing. It controlled the crossing and a small goods yard situated {{to the south of}} the crossing on the down side. The yard was served by a single siding which trailed off the down line to end in cattle dock. The station house, built in the same style as those provided at [...] <b>and</b> , <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north-eastern corner of the yard.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1995, {{there was}} a {{leadership}} election for the Conservative Party, in which Major resigned {{as leader of the}} party <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> election. Powell wrote, [...] "He says to the Sovereign: I no longer am leader of the majority party in the House of Commons; but I am carrying on as your Prime Minister. Now I don't think anybody can say that—at least without inflicting damage on the constitution". To seek to offer advice to the Queen whilst unable to feel they could command a majority in the Commons was [...] "tantamount to treating the monarch herself with disrespect and denying the very principle in which our parliamentary democracy is founded". After Major's challenger, John Redwood, was defeated, Powell wrote to him, [...] "Dear Redwood, you will never regret {{the events of the last}} week or two. Patience will evidently have to be exercised—and patience is the greatest of the political virtues—by those of us who want to keep Britain independent and self-governed".|$|E
2500|$|Mark {{played a}} key role in the {{development}} of thermonuclear weapons in the early 1950s. A crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb was approved by President Harry S. Truman in January 1950 at Edward Teller's urging before the laboratory had a workable design. This put the laboratory under great pressure. Hans Bethe recalled that [...] "There was a lot of controversy in Los Alamos in those days, and Carson always was imperturbable <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of it and had a balanced judgment." [...] When Stanislaw Ulam finally came up with a workable design, it was Mark that he approached first. Mark took the Ulam design to Bradbury, and they put the idea to Teller. [...] "Teller then completed and extended the invention," [...] Bethe noted, [...] "so, in this case, Carson was the mediator between two people who really didn't like each other." [...] "Within an hour of Carson's ... remarks," [...] Teller recalled, [...] "I knew how to move ahead". The Teller-Ulam design would become that of all thermonuclear weapons.|$|E

2500|$|After Burns was released, she {{was quickly}} rearrested for {{continuing}} protests, picketing, and marching at the White House. Upon her third arrest in 1917, the judge aimed {{to make an}} example of Burns, and she was given the maximum sentence. [...] Once again a prisoner at Occoquan Workhouse, Lucy Burns endured what is remembered as the “Night of Terror.” The women were treated brutally and were refused medical attention. To unite the women, Burns tried to call roll and refused to stop despite numerous threats by the guards. When they realized Lucy Burns's spirit {{was not going to}} be easily broken, they handcuffed her hands above her head to her cell door and left her that way for the entire night. Burns was so loved and respected by her fellow suffragists that the women in the cell across from her held their hands above their head <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same position. Despite her courage and extraordinary leadership skills, the burden of working so diligently did bother Burns at times; she once told Alice Paul, “I am so nervous I cannot eat or sleep. I am such a coward I ought to be a village seamstress, instead of a Woman’s Party organizer.” ...|$|E
