500|$|Texans {{knew of the}} {{oil that}} lay beneath {{the ground in the}} state for decades, but this was often seen more as a problem than a benefit because it {{hindered}} the digging of water wells. Rancher William Thomas Waggoner (1852–1934), who later became an influential oil businessman in Fort Worth, struck oil while drilling for water in 1902. He was quoted as having said, [...] "I wanted water, and they got me oil. I tell you I was mad, mad clean through.

500|$|The {{performance}} {{ends with}} continuous clicking of the camera. Gaga {{comes to the}} top of the pillar and sings a combination of [...] "Starstruck" [...] and [...] "LoveGame" [...] as she is joined by her dancers in tracks and jackets and hands Gaga her trademark disco stick. After [...] "LoveGame", she talks a monologue about the year [...] "3009". And says that [...] "The kids came out of New York and shot the paparazzi." [...] followed by saying [...] "It was a thousand years before when the monster first entered the city, vanished for our hearts <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> brains <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> faces (referencing to the three video interludes of the tour)" [...] and [...] "we knew we could co-exist with this monster with our MUSIC!!! With our art and with our fashion. My name is Lady Gaga." [...] and tells the crowd she feels [...] "beautiful and dirty rich" [...] and sang [...] "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich". This leads to the end of the first part wherein a video introduction called [...] "The Brain" [...] starts with Gaga appearing again as Candy Warhol and brushing her hair. After the video ends, Gaga appears on the stage in a black and white leotard with high-pointed [...] "puff" [...] shoulders and lightning shaped symbols, while riding on a similarly colored vespa. She then starts singing [...] "The Fame". This is followed by a speech. Gaga said she's been [...] "travelling the whole world, but when I get back, I can still smell the stench of greed." [...] And then she performs [...] "Money Honey" [...] with the dancers who are wearing backpacks. [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] starts immediately, accompanied by hand-waving and Gaga wore a hat made of toppled dominoes.|$|E

Because then {{it would just be}} like composing something that would be just like every other sort of orgasm that I've ever had. And because its really the center of the record, I really wanted there to be a more infinite tone, to this concept of Art+Pop, that we can put art in the front and not have the corporate world to control in art anymore. How can we the artist back our ideas <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> visions {{to be the most important}} thing. The thing that's driving culture, driving these corporations. I didn't wanted [...] to grow too much, I wanted it to kind of hypnotize people and become like a mantra.|$|E

2500|$|Taunton {{was founded}} by {{settlers}} from England and officially incorporated as a town on September 3, 1639. Most of the town's settlers were originally from Taunton in Somerset, England, which led early settlers to name the settlement after that town. At the time of Taunton's incorporation, they explained their choice of name as being, [...] "in honour and love to our dear native country... and owning it a great mercy of God to bring us to this place, and settling of us, on lands of our own bought with our money in peace, {{in the midst of}} the heathen, for a possession for ourselves <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> posterity after us." [...] Prior to 1640, the Taunton area was called Cohannet, Tetiquet or Titiquet.|$|E

I am convinced that strict control must continue {{if we are to}} avoid the evils of a [...] "colour question" [...] in this country, for ourselves <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> children". Norman Fowler, then a reporter for The Times, interviewed Powell during the election and asked him what the biggest issue was: [...] "I expected to be told something about the cost of living but not a bit of it. [...] "Immigration," [...] replied Powell. I duly phoned in my piece but it was never used. After all, who in 1964 had ever heard of a former Conservative cabinet minister thinking that immigration was an important political issue?" ...|$|E

2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later {{went on to say}} before the 2017 UK general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than a bad deal. We {{have to be prepared to}} walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government's negotiating position." ...|$|E
