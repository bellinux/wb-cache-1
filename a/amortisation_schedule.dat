Corporate {{enterprise}} development initiatives {{have emerged as}} a response to government policy that has enabled the core competencies and the business efficiency of the private sector to drive sustainable Small, Medium, Micro Enterprises (SMME) and local economic development (LED). This report describes the impact of a corporate {{enterprise development}} initiative that provides microfinance on SMME growth and LED. The secondary data utilised in this study was obtained from the Anglo American Zimele Community Fund database of 270 SMMEs that received unsecured enterprise development finance between 2007 and 2009 with an <b>amortisation</b> <b>schedule</b> longer than 12 months in various communities throughout South Africa. The study made use of quantitative research and in line with the primary objective to quantify the impact of microfinance on employment and turnover at the firm level and its subsequent impact on employment and turnover at the regional level; the research strategy used was quasi-experimental. It suggests that microfinance has had a positive influence on the entrepreneurial performance measured in terms of employment and turnover growth of SMMEs which results in LED in the communities where these businesses operate. Results also allude to the fact that this initiative could be the solution that facilitates the increase in economic growth and employment creation in South Africa...|$|E

V prvem delu so podane splošne lastnosti zaporedij, aritmetično in geometrijsko zaporedje. Nadalje so predstavljene lastnosti vrst. V drugem delu sledi opredelitev pojmov, povezanih z računanjem kreditov (obresti, obrestna mera, obrestni račun). Poudarek je na izdelavi amortizacijskih oziroma odplačilnih načrtov. Upoštevali smo obe možnosti odplačevanja kredita: anuitetni in obročni način. V zadnjem delu smo predstavili praktični primer računanja kreditov. Izdelali smo odplačilni načrt za najeti kredit: izbrali smo vrsto kredita in znesek kredita, določili mesečno anuiteto in izbrali ustrezno obrestno mero. Za posamezno kapitalizacijsko obdobje smo nato izračunali obresti, razdolžnine in ostanke dolgov. Izračune smo primerjali z informativnim izračunom odplačilnega načrta, ki smo ga naredili na spletnih staneh NKBM. Za konec smo na primeru dveh izbranih bank (NLB in NKBM) naredili primerjavo informativnih izračunov za stanovanjski kredit. Določili smo znesek kredita in odplačilno dobo. Zanimala nas je mesečna anuiteta, ki bi jo morali plačevati ob najemu izbranega kredita. The {{purpose of}} this diploma work was to {{research}} the calculation of credits and {{the applicability of the}} mathematical instruments at calculating credits. The diploma work consists of three parts. In the first part the general properties of progressions, arithmetic progression and geometric progression are presented. Furthermore we have presented the characteristics of the sequences. In the second part there are definitions of conceptions, connected with calculating credits (interests, rate of interest, interest account). We wanted to emphasise the composition of <b>amortisation</b> <b>schedules.</b> We have considered both possibilities of repayment of the credit: the annuity and the instalment’s way of payment. In the last part the practical example of calculating the credits is presented. We have made a payment plan for the engaged credit: we have chosen the type and the amount of the credit, defined the month annuity and chosen the rate of interest. Then we have calculated the interests, redemption of debts and the rest of debts for every capitalization period. Our calculations were compared with the informative plan, which we have made on the NKBM 2 ̆ 7 s internet web page. At the end we have chosen two banks (NLB and NKBM) and made informative calculations for a residential credit. Then we have presented a few practical examples of credits calculations. We have defined the amount of the credit and the period of paying by installments. We were interested in the month annuity, which we should pay at the credit loan...|$|R
