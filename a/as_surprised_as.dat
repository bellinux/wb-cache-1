500|$|Steven Moffat {{confirmed}} that the cliffhanger, the return of Moriarty, had been planned {{as far back as}} series two, when he discussed the plan for Moriarty's character with actor Andrew Scott. However, he joked that he was <b>as</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> the viewers to see Moriarty return, noting {{that it is impossible to}} fake shooting oneself in the head. Scott appeared in a short post-credits scene talking to the camera, both firsts for the show. Moffat has commented that viewers will have to wait [...] "years" [...] to see the resolution of the cliffhanger.|$|E
500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a flash in the pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was <b>as</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thereafter Saint Lucia's Prime Minister Dr. Kenny Anthony also {{issued a}} series of well wishes for his Cuban counterpart. Dr. Anthony said he was just <b>as</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> the Cuban people {{and the rest of}} the world by the sudden news of President Castro's illness. But, he added, he was [...] "also {{confident}} that he is receiving the best medical care in the world, because the quality of health care in Cuba is exceedingly good and I'm sure he is being given the very best medical care. In his press release the Saint Lucian Prime Minister also said, [...] "The Cabinet of Ministers, and indeed the people of Saint Lucia, have much admiration for the Cuban President and his personal interest in making humanitarian and social assistance available to Saint Lucia {{and the rest of the}} Caribbean, especially in the fields of health and education." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{skirmish}} {{that followed}} between Gage's soldiers and the French, the French commander, Beaujeu, {{was killed by}} the first volley of musket fire by the grenadiers. Although some 100 French Canadians fled back to the fort and {{the noise of the}} cannon held the Indians off, Beaujeu's death did not {{have a negative effect on}} French morale; Dumas rallied the rest of the French and their Indian allies. The battle, known as the Battle of the Monongahela, or the Battle of the Wilderness, or just Braddock's Defeat, was officially begun. Braddock's force was approximately 1,400 men. The British faced a French and Indian force estimated to number between 300 and 900. The battle, frequently described as an ambush, was actually a meeting engagement, where two forces clash at an unexpected time and place. The quick and effective response of the French and Indians [...] despite the early loss of their commander [...] led many of Braddock's men to believe they had been ambushed. However, French documents reveal that the French and Indian force was too late to prepare an ambush, and had been just <b>as</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> the British.|$|E
2500|$|Vamp Willow {{appears in}} the third season episodes [...] "The Wish" [...] and [...] "Doppelgangland". She is [...] and aggressive, the {{opposite}} of Willow's usual nature; her bad behavior so exaggerated {{that it does not}} instill fear into the viewer like other female vampires in the series, but indicates more about Willow's personality. Shocked upon seeing her alter ego in [...] "Doppelgangland", Willow states [...] "That's me as a vampire? I'm so evil and [...] And I think I'm kinda gay!" [...] Angel is stopped by Buffy in telling the Scoobies that the vampire self carries many of the same attributes as the human self, at which Willow says that is nothing like her. Many Buffy fans saw this as a funny Easter egg when Willow revealed herself to actually be a lesbian in later seasons. <b>As</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> Willow is with Vamp Willow, she feels bound to her, and does not have the heart to allow Buffy to kill her. Both Willows make the observation that [...] "this world's no fun", before they send Vamp Willow back into the alternate dimension from which she came, whereupon she is staked and dies immediately.|$|E

2500|$|Russian policy {{during the}} final battle for Sukhumi in September 1993, immediately, after the breach of the ceasefire by the Abkhaz forces, {{appeared}} to follow several lines. Russian officials condemned the attack, issued calls to Abkhaz forces to cease the offensive and its accompanying human rights violations and reportedly cut off electricity and telephone service to parts of Abkhazia from September to December 1993. Russia also supported resolutions in the Security Council condemning Abkhaz forces for breaching the ceasefire. At the same time, the Russian government criticized the Georgian government for refusing, once the attack was underway, to negotiate. As the Human Rights Watch report notes [...] "it is doubtful, however that Russian forces in or near Abkhazia were <b>as</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> the Russian government seemed to be. Initiating an offensive {{as large as the}} one undertaken, in three different directions at once, must have required extensive movement of forces and resupply during {{the days leading up to}} it." [...] Russian forces on the Georgian-Abkhaz border, who were supposed to police the ceasefire made no attempt to forestall the attack. The Abkhaz weapons were stored near the front and were returned to the Abkhaz by Russian military mission when hostilities restarted. Ataman Nikolay Pusko, a notable commander of some 1,500 Cossack volunteers fighting against Georgians in Abkhazia, later claimed that his sotnia was the first to enter Sukhumi. Pusko and two other Cossack atamans in Abkhazia, Mikhail Vasiliyev and Valery Goloborodko, all died in unclear circumstances from 1993 to 1994.|$|E
