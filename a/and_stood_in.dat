5|$|The {{following}} season, Harvey {{presided over}} {{four of the}} five home Shield matches, a tour match by India, and a domestic one-dayer, but was overlooked for an international fixture. Harvey’s final fixtures were during the 198182 season. He officiated in two matches hosted by Queensland in November, a Shield match and a one-dayer, both against Queensland.

5|$|A further £8,000, {{raised with}} the help of the society's members, was set aside for the {{construction}} and stocking of the park. Initially the zoo occupied only the southernmost , while the land to the north was used as a golf course. The park was designed by town planner Patrick Geddes and his son-in-law Frank Mears. Following Gillespie's vision, they modeled the park after the open designs of zoos like the New York Zoological Park and Hagenbeck's zoo in Hamburg. These modern zoological parks promoted a more spacious and natural environment for the animals, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> stark contrast to the steel cages typical of the menageries built during the Victorian era. The Scottish National Zoological Park, as it was initially called, opened to the public with a large collection of donated and borrowed animals on 22 July 1913, after only 15 weeks of work. The zoo still occupies very much the same area of land today, though the park is being extensively redeveloped.|$|E

5|$|Before {{establishing}} the party, Mike Nattrass {{had long been}} involved with Britain's Eurosceptic movement. In 1994, Nattrass joined the New Britain Party and unsuccessfully stood for the group in the Dudley West by-election of the same year. Alike most New Britain candidates, Nattrass was absorbed into <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> Solihull for the single-issue Referendum Party at the 1997 general election. Led by James Goldsmith, this party's policy was for a referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU), specifically {{as to whether the}} British population {{wanted to be part of}} a federal European state or whether they wanted the EU to revert to being a free-trade bloc without wider political functions. Nattrass subsequently joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and eventually rose to the positions of Party Chairman and Deputy Leader. As the UKIP candidate, he was elected as a representative for the West Midlands constituency in the 2004 European Parliament election, and was re-elected in 2009.|$|E
5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were {{trained on the}} job. Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses, operating-room nurses, and midwives in the hospital, teaching the former {{how to make a}} hospital bed and the latter how to diaper newborns and swaddle infants. Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> for him as hospital director when he was away. From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) {{was founded}} as a {{registered}} charity in 1909 by an Edinburgh lawyer, Thomas Hailing Gillespie. The Corstorphine Hill site {{was purchased by}} the Society {{with help from the}} Edinburgh Town Council in early 1913. Gillespie's vision of what a zoological park should be was modelled after the 'open design' of Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, a zoo which promoted a more spacious and natural environment for the animals, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> stark contrast to the steel cages typical of the menageries built during the Victorian era. The Scottish National Zoological Park was opened to the public in 1913 and was incorporated by Royal Charter later that year. In 1948, following a visit by His Majesty King George VI, the Society was granted the privilege of adding the prefix 'Royal' to its name. It remains the only zoo with a Royal Charter in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Two {{statues of}} Riel {{are located in}} Winnipeg.

It was unveiled in 1970 <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> {{the grounds of the}} Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for 23 years. After much outcry (especially from the Métis community) that the statue was an undignified misrepresentation, the statue was removed and placed at the Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface. It was replaced in 1994 with a statue designed by Miguel Joyal depicting Riel as a dignified statesman. The unveiling ceremony was on 16 May 1996, in Winnipeg.|$|E
