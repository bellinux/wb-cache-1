We designed a type of assistant positioning device for parallel <b>machine</b> <b>vice</b> to ensure complete positioning of work piece. The device can be easily and conveniently installed on the guide rail of <b>a</b> parallel <b>machine</b> <b>vice,</b> which keeps the generality of the <b>machine</b> <b>vice</b> and improves its performance. It features new structural design, easy to be processed, easy for use and optimized working efficiency and can be classified {{as a type of}} assistant positioning device of machine fixture with integral advantages economical efficiency and practicability...|$|R

5000|$|EIAJ-1 was a {{standard}} for video tape recorders (VTRs) developed by the Electronic Industries Association of Japan with the cooperation and assistance of several Japanese electronics manufacturers in 1969. It was the first standardized format for industrial/non-broadcast VTRs using a Helical scan system employing open reel tape. Previously, each manufacturer of machines in this market used a different proprietary format, with differing tape speeds, scanner drum diameters, bias frequencies, tracking head placement, and so on, although most used 1/2" [...] wide tape. As a result, video tapes recorded on one make and/or model of VTR could only be interchanged with other machines using that specific format, hampering compatibility. For example, a reel of tape recorded on <b>a</b> Panasonic <b>machine</b> would not play on <b>a</b> Sony <b>machine,</b> and <b>vice</b> versa. The EIAJ-1 standard ended this incompatibility, giving those manufacturers {{a standard}}ized format, interchangeable with almost all VTRs subsequently brought to market around that time. The format offered black-and-white (and later colour) video recording and playback on 1/2" [...] magnetic tape on a 7" [...] diameter open reel, with portable units using smaller 5" [...] diameter reels.|$|R

The 1650 square meters productionhall was {{constructed}} in 2007 and contains two turning and milling machines, which are adapted to RÖHM’s special requirements. The machines enabled the processing of parts of up to four meters in diameter and 25 tons in weight. Due to a net weight of 108 tons the <b>machine</b> required <b>a</b> foundation of 180 tons of iron and steel.

40|$|The {{additive}} manufacturing of metal parts represents a promising process {{that could be}} used alongside traditional manufacturing methods. The research scenario in this field is still largely unexplored, as far as the technological solutions adopted to integrate different processes are concerned and in terms of environmental and economic impact assessment. In this article, an electron beam melting (EBM) process and <b>a</b> <b>machining</b> process have been analyzed and compared using a cradle-to-grave life cycle-based approach. The production of components made of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy has been assumed as a case study. The proposed methodology is able to account for all of the main factors of influence on energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions when the component shape is varied. The results prove that, besides the direct energy intensity of the manufacturing processes, the impacts related to material usage are usually dominant. Therefore, when complex geometries have to be manufactured, the {{additive manufacturing}} approach could be the best strategy, if it enables a larger amount of material savings than conventional <b>machining.</b> <b>Vice</b> versa, when <b>a</b> small amount of material has to be machined off, the high energy intensity of an EBM process has a negative effect on the performance of the process...|$|R

30|$|The {{transferring}} cost of each machine type {{between two}} periods is known. All machine types {{can be moved}} to the machine depot or any location in the cells. Even if <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> is removed from or returned to the cells, this transferring cost is incurred. This cost is paid for several situations: (1) to install <b>a</b> new purchased <b>machine</b> or <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> returned from the machine depot; (2) to uninstall <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> removed from <b>a</b> cell and kept in the machine depot; and (3) to transfer <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> between two different locations. Transferring machine contains uninstallation of <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> from <b>a</b> location and installation of that machine in another location. Installing and uninstalling costs {{are considered to be}} the same. Actually, if <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> is added to a cell, only the installing cost will be imposed. In the same way, if <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> is removed from a cell, only the uninstalling cost will be incurred. Then, if <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> is transferred between two different locations in the cells, both uninstalling and installing costs will be imposed. Thus, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the unit cost of adding or removing <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> to/from the cells is half of the transferring machine cost.|$|R

40|$|William C. Hawkins, Sami Shalhoub, Phillip Gallagher, Phillip Vardiman. University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas; e-mail: wchawkins@ku. edu Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) is {{a popular}} {{treatment}} technique to reduce pain, help improve functional range of motion and corresponding functional task completion. IASTM is widely used not only in sports medicine and physical therapy contexts but also in occupational therapy {{in an effort to}} expedite return to work. Irrespective of IASTM’s popularity there are few controlled, clinical research studies that have demonstrated its efficacy and even fewer that have demonstrated the underlying mechanism of improvement. PURPOSE The purpose of this project was to develop novel tooling that will allow our laboratory to quantify and potentially control pressure administered during IASTM treatment. The other purpose of this project was to develop tooling and methodology to calibrate our tooling and test its validity. METHODS In order to capture the full range of pressure administered during an IASTM treatment a two-dimensional load cell with a dynamic range of 0 - 100 lbs was utilized (Omegadyne Inc, Ohio, USA). The load cell was attached to a steal handlebar that was machined at the University of Kansas by a bolt that was also machined in-house. Once the load cell was reversibly mounted to the handlebar {{the other end of the}} load cell was reversibly mounted to the IASTM tool using <b>a</b> custom <b>machined</b> instrument <b>vice</b> (Figure 1). Once our final product was built we calibrated and tested the reliability by mounting the handlebar in a vice and loading the leading edge of the IASTM tool with standardized brass weights (Figure 2). Voltage data were collected using a National Instruments Data Acquisition Unit (Texas, USA). RESULTS The three point calibration used to calibrate the tooling and convert voltage readings into Newton’s of force yielded an of (0. 999). CONCLUSION Our results indicate that the tooling designed during this project is valid for quantifying pressure administered during an IASTM treatment. The development of this tooling will allow our laboratory and others to quantify pressure during future controlled research of IASTM...|$|R
