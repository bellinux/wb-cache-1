5|$|Guinea pigs {{benefit from}} feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in {{addition}} to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though some controversy exists over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa {{as a source for}} replenishment of protein, amino acids, <b>and</b> <b>fiber.</b>|$|E

Owing to its tunable and broadband near-infrared (NIR) emission by controlling the size and distribution of QDs, QD-doped glasses <b>and</b> <b>fibers</b> are potentially applied in photoelectric devices. In this review, we mainly introduce the preparation, tunable emission, and multi-wavelength optical amplification of QD-doped glasses. Due to their excellent optical performances, the fabrication of QD-doped glass fibers is also presented, containing the successful fabrication of QD-doped glass fibers with tunable NIR emission. Furthermore, the achievements and existing problems about QD-doped glasses <b>and</b> <b>fibers</b> are also proposed with several prospects. These QD-doped glasses <b>and</b> <b>fibers</b> show promising applications as the gain medium of NIR broadband <b>fiber</b> amplifiers <b>and</b> tunable <b>fiber</b> lasers...|$|R

40|$|A {{combined}} immunoperoxidase/immunofluorescence {{procedure was}} used to examine potential sites of overlap between catecholamine and LHRH systems in the brains of ewes sacrificed during either anestrous or the breeding season. Cells <b>and</b> <b>fibers</b> immunoreactive for either tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) were visualized in the same sections as immunopositive LHRH perikarya <b>and</b> <b>fibers.</b> TH- <b>and</b> DBH-positive varicosities in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus appeared to contact both LHRH cell bodies and their dendrites. Clusters of TH-positive cells <b>and</b> <b>fibers</b> were found in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, and partially overlapped the location of immunoreactive LHRH fibers in that structure. Immunoreactive TH <b>and</b> LHRH <b>fibers</b> were densely interspersed within the zona externa of the median eminence, particularly within its lateral portion. No obvious qualitative differences were apparent in either the distribution of catecholamine cells <b>and</b> <b>fibers</b> or their overlap with LHRH elements between the brains of anestrous and breeding season ewes. These observations suggest the possibility of catecholaminergic synaptic inputs onto LHRH neurons in the ewe, as well as the potential for interaction between catecholamines and LHRH {{at the level of the}} median eminence. p]LHRH Sheep Immunocytochemistry Tyrosine hydroxylase Dopamine-beta-hydroxylas...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Patients {{undergoing}} pancreas resection carry several {{risk factors}} for nosocomial bacterial infections. Synbiotics are potentially useful for prevention of these infections. First trails in patients following major abdominal surgery including liver transplantation using one Lactobacillus (LAB) <b>and</b> one <b>fiber</b> showed significant reduction of infection rates and reduced length of antibiotic therapy compared to a control group. The present {{study was designed to}} analyse if a combination of different LAB <b>and</b> <b>fibers</b> would further improve outcome. A prospective randomized double-blind trail was undertaken in 80 patients following pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD). All patients received enteral nutrition immediately postoperatively. One group (A) received a composition of four LAB <b>and</b> four <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> another group (B) received the fibers only starting the day before surgery and continuing for eight days. 30 -day infection rate, length of hospital stay, duration of antibiotic therapy, non-infectious complications and side effects of enteral nutrition were recorded. The incidence of postoperative bacterial infections was significantly lower with LAB <b>and</b> <b>fibers</b> (12, 5 %) than with only fibers (40 %). In addition, the duration of antibiotic therapy was significantly shorter in the LAB group. <b>Fibers</b> <b>and</b> LAB were well tolerated.
