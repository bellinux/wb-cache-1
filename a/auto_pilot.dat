500|$|In {{addition}} to shielding, each ship has air brakes {{which can be}} utilised for navigating through difficult corners at high speed. The game also features several weapons {{which can be used}} against opponents, although some weapons have defensive purposes. For example, an <b>auto</b> <b>pilot</b> will give control of the player's ship over to the computer {{for a short period of}} time, and shields can be used to protect the player's ship from all damage, albeit temporarily. Offensive weapons include rockets, missiles, plasma bolts and mines. Game modes include a single race, tournament, time trial and an exclusive [...] "Zone" [...] mode, which revolves around survival as the player's ship increasingly accelerates to extreme speeds. The game also features an online multiplayer in {{addition to}} downloadable content, which features new ships, tracks and music.|$|E
500|$|The Anchorage VOR beacon was not {{operational}} because of maintenance. The crew received a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) of this fact, {{which was not}} seen as a problem, as the captain could still check his position at the next VORTAC beacon at Bethel, [...] away. The aircraft was required to maintain the assigned heading of 220 degrees, until it could receive the signals from Bethel, then it could fly direct to Bethel, as instructed by ATC, by centering the VOR [...] "to" [...] course deviation indicator (CDI) and then engaging the <b>auto</b> <b>pilot</b> in the VOR/LOC mode. Then, when over the Bethel beacon, the flight could start using INS mode to follow the waypoints that make up route Romeo-20 around {{the coast of the}} U.S.S.R. to Seoul. The INS mode was necessary for this route, since after Bethel the plane would be mostly out of range from VOR stations.|$|E

2500|$|In {{late 1990s}} the Hellenic Air Force (HAF) issued {{a request for}} {{acquiring}} more modern and capable SAR helicopters [...] in order to replace its ageing fleet of Agusta Bell AB-205 SAR helicopters, which were in use since 1975. The need for an all-weather, day and night, long range SAR helicopter for operations throughout the Athens FIR came up after the Imia/Kardak incident of 1996 and the growing tension between Greece and Turkey over territorial water disputes on the Aegean Sea. The Greek government, signed a deal with Eurocopter in 1998 [...] for purchasing initially 4 AS-332 C1 Super Pumas. H.A.F. acquired 2 more Super Pumas for air support operations of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games and 6 more helicopters followed up in the period 2007–2011 for the new CSAR role of the 384 SAR/CSAR Sq.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a fuzzy guidance system for unmanned aircraft based on waypoints described in a 5 -D space: position in 3 -dimensions, desired crossing heading, and speed. The aircraft is assumed to be <b>auto</b> <b>piloted</b> in speed, heading, and flight path angle. The proposed system uses standard Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controllers that provide speed, heading, and flight path angle references for the autopilots. In particular, the heading guidance law results in a pipeline of two fuzzy controllers depending on the relative distance between aircraft and waypoint. A trajectory optimization algorithm is used to yield a long-distance guidance law blended with a short-distance guidance law as the waypoint approaches. The system handles sets of not directly flyable waypoints, driving the aircraft on flyable trajectories that try to cross the waypoints at a prescribed altitude and heading...|$|R
5|$|The Wipeout {{games are}} {{a series of}} futuristic racers which involve players {{piloting}} anti-gravity ships through various forms of races. The series is known for its extreme speed, range of electronic dance music soundtracks, and consequential difficulty. Power-ups {{come in the form of}} offensive or defensive weaponry, ranging from machine guns, missiles, rockets, to energy shields, <b>auto</b> <b>pilots,</b> and mines. Power-ups are usually collected by flying over different coloured pads on race tracks. Speed boost pads also feature prominently on race tracks: once flown over, the player receives a short momentous boost. Every ship featured in a game is owned by a different racing corporation (collectively referred to as 'teams' in-game) although the number of teams and ships will vary throughout the games. Every ship has different characteristics, for example each ship will vary in handling, thrust, maximum speed and shield strength. Each ship is equipped with a compulsory shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race; energy is lost whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapons fire. If the shield runs out, the ship in question will explode and the player is consequently eliminated from the race.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Simulation {{has proved}} to be an {{effective}} tool in a wide spectrum of disciplines. Some activities involve dangerous and hazardous for users and/or special and expensive equipments; in these cases, simulation can be a value added allowing users to perform training sessions in a safety way. An innovative tool for simulating piloting sessions of Uninhabited Air Vehicles (UAVs) is presented in this paper. UAVs allow to perform a lot of tasks such as surveillance, environmental monitoring, traffic control, and so on. A flight simulator for mini UAVs is proposed and issues related to the design and implementation of innovative human-machine interfaces are investigated. In particular, the control by means of joystick and data glove, beyond the traditional RC transmitter, is proposed. This work is part of a wider project that aims to design and develop an integrated system including: a mini UAV able to take on board cameras and sensors, a system for <b>auto</b> <b>piloting</b> in order to perform autonomous flights, and a ground control station where just one operator is able to accomplish the mission.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} modeling of sway, roll and yaw motions of a floating body in time domain and investigates motion instability primarily due to nonlinear roll restoring characteristics {{in the absence of}} <b>auto</b> <b>piloting</b> mechanism. To compute hydrodynamic forces, we consider nonlinear roll restoring characteristics and speed dependent strip theory that are obtained from the Frank’s close-fit method. The governing equations are solved numerically by using Runge-Kutta-Gill method with adaptive step size adjustment algorithm. In order to illustrate nonlinear roll restoring effect in sway, roll and yaw, numerical experiments have been carried out for a panamax container ship under the action of sinusoidal wave of periodicity 11. 2 sec with varying wave height and speed. To emulate the soft spring behavior in roll, the expression for nonlinear restoring moment is represented by an odd order polynomial of roll angle. Further, in the absence of zero restoring mechanism in sway and yaw, the effect of initial condition, wave height and ship’s speed is examined in terms of ship’s stability. This approach provides an important guideline to model nonlinear roll restoring moment for a coupled system in three degrees of freedom...|$|R

50|$|The {{operator}} {{tracks the}} target using the sight mechanism, then launches the missile using the front trigger. Once the missile is in flight, he steers the missile into {{his line of}} sight using the thumb joystick. The missile's <b>auto</b> <b>pilot</b> uses a gyroscope to maintain a straight flightpath directly away from the launch point, compensating for any wind buffeting.
