60|$|Pigling Bland, on tip-toe, {{covered her}} up with an <b>antimacassar.</b>|$|E
60|$|He darted {{round the}} table, {{pursued by the}} {{maligned}} Mrs. White armed with an <b>antimacassar.</b>|$|E
60|$|David, with a sigh, {{returned}} the crochet <b>antimacassar</b> carefully to its {{place on the}} chair back.|$|E
50|$|Annie Chapman, {{the second}} {{canonical}} victim of Jack the Ripper, {{was said to}} have made <b>antimacassars</b> for a living shortly before she was murdered.|$|R
50|$|<b>Antimacassars</b> {{are also}} used on the seat {{headrests}} of commercial passenger transport vehicles, such as trains, buses and especially aircraft to {{extend the life of}} fabrics.|$|R
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, <b>antimacassars</b> had become so associated in people's minds with the Victorian period that the word briefly became a figurative term for it.|$|R
60|$|Beetle {{snatched}} a crochet-work <b>antimacassar</b> {{from the}} shiny horsehair sofa, stuffed {{it into his}} mouth, and rolled out of sight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Basil, {{will you}} mount guard over the captive of your bow and spear and <b>antimacassar?</b> Swinburne and I will clear out the prison downstairs." ...|$|E
60|$|David {{took from}} the back of his chair a crochet <b>antimacassar</b> with a lion rampant in the center and spread it over his knee.|$|E
60|$|Ginger Dick looked {{round the}} room. It was a {{comfortable}} little place, with {{pictures on the}} walls and <b>antimacassars</b> on all the chairs, and a row of pink vases on the mantelpiece. Then 'e looked at Mrs. Finch, and thought wot a nice-looking woman she was.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to their decorative function doilies have the practical role of protecting fine-wood furniture from the scratches caused by crockery or decorative objects, or from spilled tea when used on tea trays or with cups and saucers. When used to protect the backs and arms of chairs, they are serving as <b>antimacassars.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{was another}} {{knock at the}} door, and through the {{curtains}} they saw Miss Reed's eyes looking towards them, trying to pierce the muslin. Mrs Griffith motioned the two men out of the room, and hurriedly put <b>antimacassars</b> on the chairs. The knock was repeated, and Mrs Griffith, catching hold of a duster, went to the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "How MUCH?" [...] demanded Joe, banging {{the little}} {{triangular}} {{table with his}} fist, and thereby causing {{the man with the}} <b>antimacassar</b> to drop a couple of stitches.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe {{covered them}} over with an <b>antimacassar.</b> We left Lord Porthoning {{sitting there and}} {{went out into the}} hall, where Eve was already waiting. Mr. Bundercombe was a little unnerved, but he pulled himself together.|$|E
60|$|Then {{curiosity and}} perhaps {{the fear of being}} laughed at overcame me. I took the bowl and held it under my nose, while Harût threw over my head the <b>antimacassar</b> which he had used in the mango trick, to keep in the fumes I suppose.|$|E
25|$|In December 2014, the Premier Service {{was renamed}} {{to be the}} Business Class Service in an attempt by Arriva Trains Wales to make the service more {{appealing}} to those travelling to and from Cardiff to work. Ticket prices remain the same and are still sold as first class, and the restaurant service remains although tablecloths and <b>antimacassars</b> have been removed to promote a more work-like environment.|$|R
5000|$|By 1888 Chapman {{was living}} in common lodging houses in Whitechapel, {{occasionally}} {{in the company of}} Edward [...] "the Pensioner" [...] Stanley, a bricklayer's labourer. She earned some income from crochet work, making <b>antimacassars</b> and selling flowers, supplemented by casual prostitution. An acquaintance described her as [...] "very civil and industrious when sober", but noted [...] "I have often seen her the worse for drink." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ethel submitted, {{and only}} laughed with Norman at {{the display of}} treasures, which the girls went over daily, like the [...] "House that Jack built," [...] always {{starting}} from [...] "the box that Mary made." [...] Come when Dr. May would into the drawing-room, {{there was always a}} line of penwipers laid out on the floor, bags pendent to all the table-drawers, <b>antimacassars</b> laid out everywhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is a match," [...] said Miss Holmes to Harût who {{was engaged}} in putting more tobacco into the bowl, the {{suspicion}} of a smile upon his grave and statuesque countenance. Harût received the match with a low bow and fired the stuff as before. Then he handed the bowl, from which once again the blue smoke curled upwards, to Miss Holmes, and gently and gracefully let the <b>antimacassar</b> fall over it and her head, which it draped as a wedding veil might do. A few seconds later she threw off the <b>antimacassar</b> and cast the bowl, in which the fire was now out, on to the floor. Then she stood up with wide eyes, looking wondrous lovely and, notwithstanding her lack of height, majestic.|$|E
60|$|A {{small but}} strong lamp was {{burning in the}} fo’c’sle of the {{schooner}} Greyhound, {{by the light of}} which a middle-aged seaman of sedate appearance sat crocheting an <b>antimacassar.</b> Two other men were snoring with deep content in their bunks, while a small, bright-eyed boy sat up in his, reading adventurous fiction.|$|E
6000|$|... "... wholly, I must confess, unintelligible to me, my dear sir, and I {{need not}} say unpleasant. Still one must side with one's old friends against the most {{fascinating}} new ones. Permit me, therefore, in tying you up in this <b>antimacassar,</b> {{to make it as}} commodious as handcuffs can reasonably be while..." ...|$|E
50|$|They came to have {{elaborate}} patterns, {{often in}} matching sets {{for the various}} items of parlour furniture; they were either made at home {{using a variety of}} techniques such as crochet or tatting, or purchased. The original <b>antimacassars</b> were usually made of stiff white crochet-work, but {{in the third quarter of}} the 19th century they became simpler and softer, usually fabric embroidered with a simple pattern in wool or silk.|$|R
60|$|Under the wreathed {{canopies}} {{were the}} stalls, piled up with bright colours, most artistically arranged. Ethel, with her over-minute knowledge of every article, {{could hardly believe}} that yonder glowing Eastern pattern of scarlet, black, and blue, was, in fact, a judicious mosaic of penwipers that she remembered, as shreds begged from the tailor, that the delicate lace-work consisted of Miss Bracy's perpetual <b>antimacassars,</b> and that the potichomanie could look so dignified and Etruscan.|$|R
60|$|That is {{my opinion}} of tow-lines in general. Of course, {{there may be}} honourable exceptions; I do not {{say that there are}} not. There may be tow-lines that are a credit to their profession—conscientious, respectable tow-lines—tow-lines that do not imagine they are crochet-work, and try to knit {{themselves}} up into <b>antimacassars</b> the instant they are left to themselves. I say there may be such tow-lines; I sincerely hope there are. But I have not met with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall {{look in on}} our way to the train," [...] {{answered}} Holmes. A {{moment later}} he and I were back in the front room, where the impassive lady was still quietly working away at her <b>antimacassar.</b> She put it down on her lap as we entered and looked at us with her frank, searching blue eyes.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Olivia's parlour {{was much}} like herself--painfully neat. Every article of {{furniture}} stood {{in exactly the same}} place it had always stood. Nothing was ever suffered to be disturbed. The tassels of the crazy cushion lay just so over the arm of the sofa, and the crochet <b>antimacassar</b> was always spread at precisely the same angel over the horsehair rocking chair. No speck of dust was ever visible; no fly ever invaded that sacred apartment.|$|E
60|$|She {{had a big}} doll {{of which}} she was fearfully proud, though not so fond. So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with an <b>antimacassar,</b> to sleep. Then she forgot it. Meantime Paul must {{practise}} jumping off the sofa arm. So he jumped crash {{into the face of}} the hidden doll. Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail, and sat down to weep a dirge. Paul remained quite still.|$|E
60|$|The {{four young}} men had risen, and {{stood looking at}} Alvina and Madame. The room was small, rather bare, with horse-hair and white-crochet <b>antimacassars</b> and a {{linoleum}} floor. The table also {{was covered with a}} brightly-patterned American oil-cloth, shiny but clean. A naked gas-jet hung over it. For furniture, there were just chairs, arm-chairs, table, and a horse-hair antimacassar-ed sofa. Yet the little room seemed very full--full of people, young men with smart waistcoats and ties, but without coats.|$|R
5000|$|Macassar oil was an unguent for {{the hair}} {{commonly}} used by {{men in the}} early 19th century. The poet Byron called it [...] "thine incomparable oil, Macassar". The fashion for oiled hair became so widespread in the Victorian and the Edwardian period that housewives began to cover the arms and backs of their chairs with washable cloths to preserve the fabric coverings from being soiled. Around 1850, these started {{to be known as}} <b>antimacassars.</b> They were also installed in theatres, from 1865.|$|R
60|$|The parlor at Green Gables was {{a rather}} severe and gloomy apartment, with rigid {{horsehair}} furniture, stiff lace curtains, and white <b>antimacassars</b> that were always laid at a perfectly correct angle, except at such times as they clung to unfortunate people's buttons. Even Anne {{had never been able}} to infuse much grace into it, for Marilla would not permit any alterations. But it is wonderful what flowers can accomplish if you give them a fair chance; when Anne and Diana finished with the room you would not have recognized it.|$|R
60|$|She started suddenly. There {{was a loud}} tapping at the door. Bernadine {{threw an}} <b>antimacassar</b> half over the box, {{but he was too}} late. De Grost and Hagon had crossed the threshold. The woman stood like some dumb creature. Hagon, transfixed, stood with his eyes riveted upon Bernadine. His face was {{distorted}} with passion, he seemed like a man beside himself with fury. De Grost came slowly forward {{into the middle of the}} room.|$|E
60|$|Then the {{performance}} began. The tree grew admirably upon the china plate {{under the cover}} of an <b>antimacassar.</b> A number of bits of stick danced together on the said plate, apparently without being touched. At a whistle from Marût a second snake crawled out of the pocket of the horrified Mr. Savage, who stood observing these proceedings at a respectful distance, erected itself on its tail upon the plate and took fire till it was consumed to ashes, and so forth.|$|E
6000|$|The {{old lady}} in the <b>antimacassar</b> said, abruptly, [...] "Ah! you young people, you young people, if you only knew!" [...] and then laughed and then mused in a marked manner; {{and the young man}} with the narrow {{forehead}} and glasses cleared his throat and asked the young man in the orange tie whether he believed that Platonic love was possible. Mrs. Goopes said she believed in nothing else, and with that she glanced at Ann Veronica, rose a little abruptly, and directed Goopes and the shy young man in the handing of refreshments.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, unfortunately, of a {{great many}} other things. Hashed mutton is simply symbolical. Under the head of hashed mutton I include poor lodgings, growlers when we get {{ourselves}} asked to eat a dinner at somebody's table, limited washing-bills, table-napkins rolled up in their dirt {{every day for a}} week, <b>antimacassars</b> to save the backs of the chairs, a picture of you darning my socks while I am reading a newspaper hired at a halfpenny from the public-house round the corner, a pint of beer in the pewter between us,--and perhaps two babies in one cradle because we can't afford to buy a second." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{went to bed}} {{after our}} wash. To the blase English bed-goer, {{accustomed}} all his life to the same old hackneyed style of bed night after night, there is something very pleasantly piquant about the experience of trying {{to sleep in a}} German bed. He does not know it is a bed at first. He thinks that someone has been going round the room, collecting all the sacks and cushions and <b>antimacassars</b> and such articles that he has happened to find about, and has piled them up on a wooden tray ready for moving. He rings for the chambermaid, and explains to her that she has shown him into the wrong room. He wanted a bedroom.|$|R
500|$|In the 1930s, {{a number}} of the New Critics– among them R. P. Blackmur, Allen Tate, Cleanth Brooks and Yvor Winters– {{appraised}} the significance of Dickinson's poetry. As critic Roland Hagenbüchle pointed out, their [...] "affirmative and prohibitive tenets turned out to be of special relevance to Dickinson scholarship". Blackmur, in an attempt to focus and clarify the major claims for and against the poet's greatness, wrote in a landmark 1937 critical essay: [...] "... she was a private poet who wrote as indefatigably as some women cook or knit. Her gift for words and the cultural predicament of her time drove her to poetry instead of <b>antimacassars</b> ... She came... at the right time for one kind of poetry: the poetry of sophisticated, eccentric vision." ...|$|R
