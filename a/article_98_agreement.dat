50|$|Romania {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{countries}} to sign an <b>Article</b> <b>98</b> <b>agreement</b> with the United States. In response to Romania's action, the European Union requested that candidate countries not sign Article 98 agreements with the United States until the E.U. ministers had met to agree upon a common position. In September 2002, the Council of the European Union adopted a common position, permitting member states to enter into Article 98 agreements with the United States, but only concerning U.S. military personnel, U.S. diplomatic or consular officials, and persons extradited, sent to their territories by the United States with their permission; not the general protection of U.S. nationals that the United States sought. Furthermore, the common position provided that any person protected from ICC prosecution by such agreements would have to be prosecuted by the United States. This was in agreement with the original position of the E.U., that Article 98 agreements were allowed to cover these restricted classes of persons but could not cover all the citizens of a state.|$|E

40|$|This report {{discusses}} the so-called “Article <b>98</b> agreements”. The <b>article</b> contains {{a provision that}} the Bush Administration has sought bilateral agreements worldwide to exempt U. S. citizens from ICC prosecution. In 2002, Congress passed the American Servicemembers’ Protection Act or ASPA (P. L. 107 - 206, title II), which prohibits military assistance to countries that are party to the ICC and {{that do not have}} <b>Article</b> <b>98</b> <b>agreements.</b> Some Members of Congress and Bush Administration officials have expressed concerns about the unintended effects of these sanctions on U. S. relations with Latin America. Policymakers are considering some options to mitigate these effects without undermining ASPA or diplomatic efforts to secure <b>Article</b> <b>98</b> <b>agreements...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Bush {{administration}} has adopted the American Servicemembers' Protection Act and entered in <b>Article</b> <b>98</b> <b>agreements</b> {{in an attempt}} to protect any US citizen from appearing before this court. As such it interferes with implementing the command responsibility principle when applicable to US citizens.|$|R
50|$|In October 2006 the Barbadian {{government}} {{found itself}} sanctioned by U.S. President George W. Bush for not signing an <b>Article</b> <b>98</b> <b>Agreements</b> with the United States military to exempt U.S. personnel from the International Criminal Court (ICC). Following the sanctions on Barbados {{and several other}} Caribbean nations by the United States the Chinese Government provided Barbados with the financial assistance in-lieu of the situation.|$|R
5000|$|Bolton {{also led}} the Bush administration's {{opposition}} on constitutional grounds to the International Criminal Court, negotiating with many countries to sign <b>agreements,</b> called <b>Article</b> <b>98</b> <b>agreements,</b> with the U.S. to exempt Americans from prosecution by the court, {{which is not}} recognized by the U.S.; more than 100 countries have signed such agreements. Bolton said the decision {{to pull out of}} the ICC was the [...] "happiest moment" [...] of his political career to date.|$|R
50|$|The {{appropriations}} bill containing the controversial amendments were adopted for FY 2005, FY 2006, and FY 2008. Congress {{did not pass}} a foreign operations {{appropriations bill}} or any other bill containing the Nethercutt provision for FY 2007. On December 17, 2007 the U.S. Congress approved HR 2764, a comprehensive Consolidated Appropriations Act which reinstates the so-called Nethercutt provision cutting off Economic Support Funds (ESF) to nations unwilling to enter into BIAs or so-called <b>Article</b> <b>98</b> <b>Agreements</b> shielding U.S. nationals from {{the jurisdiction of the}} ICC.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Article</b> <b>98</b> of the Rome Statute {{prohibits the}} ICC from {{requesting}} assistance or {{the surrender of}} a person to the ICC if {{to do so would}} require the state to [...] "act inconsistently" [...] with its obligations under international law or international agreements unless the state or the third-party state waives the immunity or grants cooperation. The U.S. has interpreted this article to mean that its citizens cannot be transferred to the ICC by any state that has signed a bilateral agreement with the U.S. prohibiting such a transfer, even if the state {{is a member of the}} Rome Statute. The U.S. actively pressured states to conclude such so-called <b>Article</b> <b>98</b> <b>agreements,</b> otherwise known as bilateral immunity agreements (BIAs). The Bush Administration claimed that the BIAs were drafted out of concern that existing agreements—particularly the status of forces agreements or status of mission agreements (SOFAs or SOMAs)—did not sufficiently protect Americans from the jurisdiction of the ICC.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} some of {{the inherent}} bottlenecks {{in the exercise of}} ICC jurisdiction that may diminish the Court 2 ̆ 7 s ability to uphold the principle of individual criminal liability. In particular, this paper will analyze the principle of complementarity between the ICC and States Parties to the ICC Statute. Additionally, the legality of the so called <b>Article</b> <b>98</b> Immunity <b>Agreement</b> will be discussed. This paper without equivocation contends that the conclusion of <b>Article</b> <b>98</b> immunity <b>agreement</b> by ICC States Parties is a clear violation of their obligation to cooperate with the Court and to arrest and surrender suspects to the Court. Preceding the discussion on the bottlenecks in Court jurisdiction is a brief discussion of the provisions of the ICC Statute regarding individual criminal responsibility. In conclusion, this paper will argue that while the establishment of the ICC is one of the remarkable events of the twentieth century, the highlighted obstacles are capable of restricting the reach and effectiveness of the ICC as an institution designed {{to bring an end to}} the culture of impunity. Consequently, this paper advocates the elimination of said bottlenecks...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of the Rome Treaty establishing the permanent International Criminal Court is to advance the unification of international criminal law. Whilst it may be contended that this body of law is acquiring a great degree of specificity and uniformity in content through the ICC Statute, both its development and importantly its scope are fundamentally reliant on its interpretation and application at national level; {{it is here that}} the enforcement of complementarity measures are fragmented. In this piece, the validation of the ICC surrender and deferral rationale and mechanisms are analysed against the ICC Statute’s procedural safeguards vis-à-vis national ones. Problems of ICC Treaty implementation go beyond the mere Treaty language; notwithstanding the principle of pacta sunt servanda, these lie in the contradiction between the legal principle in question (complementarity) and interpretation and reconciliation with constitutionalism. Whereas the ICC Treaty arguably erodes national sovereignty, varying implementation methods will define, broaden or limit the scope and the jurisdictional reach of the ICC. This may be illustrated for instance, from observing the extent to which traditional extradition defences have survived the ICC surrender model, regional amnesties and ICC <b>Article</b> <b>98</b> non-surrender <b>agreements.</b> The Court’s jurisdiction may not be triggered automatically nor be imposed on states through the mere accession to the Rome Treaty. The fragmented application of the ICC Statute, which may be evidenced also through the multiplicity of Rome Treaty implementation methods, reflects the jurisdictionally imbalanced ICC legal regime...|$|R
