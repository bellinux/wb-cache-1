5|$|A {{cattle egret}} will weakly defend {{the area around}} a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest <b>and</b> <b>Cape</b> buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E
5|$|Acadia's border was not {{formally}} demarcated by the Treaty of Utrecht, {{which became a}} cause of ongoing friction between the British and French, especially on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which both sides eventually fortified. The French interpreted the phrase ancient boundaries to imply only the peninsula of present-day Nova Scotia, thereby excluding the mainland between New England and the St. Lawrence, ÎLe St. Jean, <b>and</b> <b>Cape</b> Breton. This helped the Amerindians of Abenaquis, Malecites, and MicMacs to retain their sovereignty over their old hunting grounds.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{are popular}} birds for birdwatchers and their colonies are popular {{destinations}} for ecotourists. Regular birdwatching trips are {{taken out of}} many coastal towns and cities, like Monterey, Dunedin, Kaikoura, Wollongong, Sydney, Port Fairy, Hobart <b>and</b> <b>Cape</b> Town, to see pelagic seabirds. Albatrosses are easily attracted to these sightseeing boats by the deployment of fish oil and burley into the sea. Visits to colonies can be very popular: the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in Dunedin, New Zealand, attracts 40,000 visitors a year, and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands.|$|E
50|$|American minks are {{primarily}} used in manufacturing fur coats, jackets, <b>and</b> <b>capes.</b> Pelts {{which are not}} able to be converted into these items are made into trimming for cloth and fur coats. Mink scarves and stoles are also manufactured. Jackets <b>and</b> <b>capes</b> are mostly made from small to medium-sized specimens, usually females and young males, while trimming, scarves and stoles are made from adult males. The most valuable peltries come from eastern Canada which, although the smallest, are the silkiest and darkest.|$|R

5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks <b>and</b> <b>Cape</b> Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|E

The city commissioned and began a long-term project, the Iway, to move I-195 in 2007 not only for safety reasons, but also to free up land and to reunify the Jewelry District with Downcity Providence, which had been split from one another by the highway.
