The Copperheads had told Hines {{to wait until}} that time, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> that 50,000 Copperheads would {{be there for the}} event. However, encountering Copperhead {{hesitation}} to assist Hines and his force, and with Federal authorities apparently knowledgeable of the plot, Hines and his men were forced to flee Chicago on August 30, 1864. Many of the men thought Anderson may have been a double agent, forcing him to leave the group. A second attempt to free the Camp Douglas Confederate prisoners occurred during the United States Presidential Election of 1864, but that plan was also foiled.|$|E

Minister of External Affairs Lester Pearson {{played a major}} part in the settlement of that dispute, and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role. Diefenbaker, as the Tories' foreign policy critic and as the favourite in the leadership race, gained considerable attention for his speeches on Suez. The Tories attacked Pearson for, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> being an errand boy for the United States government; he responded {{that it was better}} to be such a lackey than to be an obedient colonial doing Britain's will unquestioningly. While Suez would come to be regarded by many as one of the finest moments in Canadian foreign policy, at the time it cost the Liberals support outside of Quebec.|$|E

They said that he was accompanied by two other men who looked like beatniks. In an October 5 report, Cobb informed the CIA of the conversation. Cobb wanted the women to tell American authorities what they knew, but advised them against going to the American embassy, instead suggesting that they go to Texas. Cobb was asked to leave Garro's home after their cat's back legs were found broken.|$|E

For several months after Cobain's death, Yankovic would first perform a somber tribute to Cobain prior to playing the song itself. Shortly after Cobain's death, Yankovic was scheduled to play a show in Seattle, where Nirvana first became famous. Due to this connection, Yankovic was hesitant to perform the spoof, as he worried about how the audience might react to the parody. However, Yankovic was urged by journalists {{to go through with}} the performance, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> that the song would be [...] "cathartic" [...] for the area.

Before he was cast as Ramsay, Rheon auditioned {{for the role of}} Jon Snow.

[...] In that interview, Kit Harington talked about Rheon: [...] "I love Iwan's work. He's an incredibly detailed actor who's created a character who's remarkable and despicable." ...|$|E
500|$|Jean Holm (The Times Higher Education Supplement) too {{noted the}} fast growth of {{conservative}} Christian schools {{but added that}} the book was also relevant in Britain, which was experiencing similar growth. She found the first few chapters somewhat repetitive as it expressed the uniformity of the school's practices. Richard V. Pierard (Christian Century) felt that Peshkin wrote with [...] "deeply respect" [...] for the school and its community, but Pierard, himself an evangelical, was [...] "disturbed" [...] by the community's [...] "indoctrinated" [...] values—"biblical absolutes" [...] that are [...] "part of a conservative program that has been read into Scripture". Paul F. Parsons (Christianity Today) noted that Peshkin found the school successful by traditional terms, with standardized tests, orderly climate, and [...] "fun-loving" [...] students, but lacking free exchange of ideas, as education is seen more as a transfer than a quest, and students do not learn [...] "choice, doubt, suspended judgment, [...] dissent". Parsons affirmed Peshkin's findings as [...] "remarkably representative" [...] based on his own visits to [...] "Christian schools in 60 cities", though others are less absolutist. And while Julian McAllister Groves (Journal of Contemporary Ethnography) described the text as [...] "beautifully written" [...] and [...] "poetic", he doubted whether the school's students were as converted <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> and felt that Peshkin might have seen more [...] "role distance" [...] and examples of playing along simply for community acceptance had he stayed for lunch and other informal observations.|$|E

500|$|The {{phrase is}} likely to have {{originated}} in the Kingdom of Israel following the Law of Moses in beth din courts as a way of giving credence to the authority of God as the author of all law. It {{is likely to}} have come from Deuteronomy 16:18 where it stated: [...] "Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, tribe by tribe; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment". This gave rise to the theory that judges had been given authority from God to exercise judgment on matters of the law and would use the phrase to attribute this fact to God. The phrase continued to be used in courts, passing from Jewish to Christian context as a way to continue to affirm God as the highest authority in law. Clarence Darrow, Oliver O'Donovan and the Chicago Law Journal have stated that the phrase's continual usage may have come about as a result of judges feeling that while they could pass a sentence of death upon a person, they personally did not have the authority to destroy souls and that only God had the authority to do that. As a result, some judges would cross their fingers whenever they said the phrase as a result of concern for the criminal's soul <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> it as a prayer. While the phrase is intended to be said by judges with conviction, it is also said because of legal tradition and not necessarily due to belief in its meaning. During the 17th century in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Puritan majority of judges at the time did not believe that stating [...] "may God have mercy on your soul" [...] had any meaning unless the accused had made a confession of the crime in open court. They, and other Puritan office holders, would also regularly press the condemned up until the point of execution to make a confession of the crime they had been convicted of to ensure that the phrase satisfactorily had meaning according to their views.|$|E

2500|$|The Zulu army, while {{a product}} of a warrior culture, was {{essentially}} a militia force which could be called out in time of national danger. It had a very limited logistical capacity and could only stay in the field {{a few weeks before the}} troops would be obliged to return to their civilian duties. Zulu warriors were armed primarily with assegai thrusting spears, known in Zulu as iklwa, knobkierrie clubs, some throwing spears and shields made of cowhide. The Zulu warrior, his regiment and the army drilled in the personal and tactical use and coordination of this weapons system. Some Zulus also had old muskets and antiquated rifles stockpiled, a relatively few of which were carried by Zulu impi. However, their marksmanship was very poor, quality and supply of powder and shot dreadful, maintenance non-existent and attitude towards firearms summed up in the observation that: [...] "The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms – the arms of a coward, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> for they enable the poltroon to kill the brave without awaiting his attack." [...] The British had timed the invasion to coincide with the harvest, intending to catch the Zulu warrior-farmers dispersed.

And similarly, [...] reports, “And the Lord changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends” (after they had slandered him).

For in [...] Samuel told the Israelites, “As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you,” and Samuel told them this after they came and said, “We have sinned,” as [...] indicates when it reports that the people said, “Pray for your servants [...] [...] [...] for we have added to all our sins this evil.” ...|$|E
