5|$|Mutual {{intelligibility}} {{among these}} ASL varieties is high, and the variation is primarily lexical. For example, {{there are three}} different words for English about in Canadian ASL; the standard way, and two regional variations (Atlantic and Ontario), {{as shown in the}} videos on the right. Variation may also be phonological, meaning that the same sign may be signed in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> depending on the region. For example, an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.|$|E

5|$|Other more rare {{types of}} {{radioactive}} decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus, {{or more than}} one beta particle. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way,</b> is internal conversionâ€” a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission.|$|E
5|$|The epistolary form unites The History of Sir Charles Grandison with Richardson's Pamela and Clarissa, but Richardson {{uses the}} form in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> for his final work. In Clarissa, the letters emphasise the plot's drama, {{especially}} when Lovelace alters Clarissa's letters. However, the dramatic mood is replaced in Grandison with {{a celebration of}} Grandison's moral character. In addition to this lack of dramatic emphasis, the letters of Grandison do not serve to develop character, as the moral core of each character is already complete at the outset.|$|E
5|$|Wine critics {{considered}} white Zinfandel to be insipid and uninteresting in the 1970s and 1980s, although modern white Zinfandels {{have more}} fruit and less cloying sweetness. Nevertheless, {{the success of}} this blush wine saved many old vines in premium areas, which came into their own {{at the end of the}} 20th century as red Zinfandel wines came back into fashion. Although the two wines taste dramatically different, both are made from the same (red) grapes, processed in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way.</b> It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E
5|$|In February 1981, {{the long-standing}} {{operator}} Orpington & District collapsed due to financial difficulties, so Tillingbourne decided {{to launch a}} test operation of three former O services. These proved successful, so more services were added and two new AEC Reliance coaches purchased for the operation. In July 1981, the Orpington operation was given a separate licence, under the name Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) Limited, with six vehicles allocated to it. By 1983, however, {{it became clear that}} the local area management of Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) wanted to develop the business in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> from that of the main company. On 24 September 1983, the Orpington operation's directors, Gary Wood and Peter Larking, bought out the subsidiary to form Metrobus Limited.|$|E
5|$|McLamore and Edgerton {{acquired}} {{a license to}} operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' heating elements were prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> inside the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame broiler, moved the patties over the flame vertically on a chain link conveyor over the heating elements, a design that imparted grill lines on the patties similar to those made on a charcoal grill. The new unit worked so well that they {{made the decision to}} replace all of their Insta-Broilers with the newly designed unit.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bivalves}} are filter feeders, {{using their}} gills to capture particulate food such as phytoplankton from the water. The protobranchs feed in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way,</b> scraping detritus from the seabed, {{and this may}} be the original mode of feeding used by all bivalves before the gills became adapted for filter feeding. These primitive bivalves hold on to the substratum with a pair of tentacles {{at the edge of the}} mouth, each of which has a single palp, or flap. The tentacles are covered in mucus, which traps the food, and cilia, which transport the particles back to the palps. These then sort the particles, rejecting those that are unsuitable or too large to digest, and conveying others to the mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} a {{planetary}} system {{adjacent to the}} giant planets will be influenced in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way.</b> In such a region, eccentricities of embryos may become so large that the embryos pass close to a giant planet, which may cause them to be ejected from the system. If all embryos are removed, then no planets will form in this region. An additional consequence is that {{a huge number of}} small planetesimals will remain, because giant planets are incapable of clearing them all out without the help of embryos. The total mass of remaining planetesimals will be small, because cumulative action of the embryos before their ejection and giant planets is still strong enough to remove 99% of the small bodies. Such a region will eventually evolve into an asteroid belt, which is a full analog of the asteroid belt in the Solar System, located from 2 to 4AU from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Dor began when Nagesh Kukunoor was {{attending}} the International Film Festival of India in November 2005.

He confirmed this in another interview that after watching Perumazhakkalam (2005), whose story {{is based on a}} newspaper article, at the Film Festival, he decided to make his own version of the film. After purchasing the story rights from Kamal, director of Perumazhakkalam, he wanted to remake it in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way.</b> Through his story, he wanted to emphasize the protagonists' ordeal while in isolation {{in the form of a}} visual drama.

5|$|Leslie is {{convinced}} she can reason with Andy {{if they can}} talk without their lawyers, but Andy will not return her calls. Finally, Ann calls Andy and asks {{him to come to}} her house. Later that day, he arrives completely naked, having assumed Ann wanted to take him back. A disgusted Ann leaves the house, leaving Leslie and Andy to talk. Andy admits he is suing the town in an attempt to win Ann back, and she thinks of <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> he can impress her. The next day at city hall, Andy tells Leslie and Scott he will drop the lawsuit if they agree to fill in the pit right away. Scott agrees, unaware it was a trick between Andy and Leslie. The next day the pit is filled in and turned into a lot, and an impressed Ann waves at Andy while the construction work is going on. The episode ends with Keef riding a motorboat, revealing his role in KaBOOM! was an elaborate prank to get the playground built, and announcing he is going to build a hospital in a poor part of China.|$|E
5|$|The goal of Lost Coast was to {{demonstrate}} the new high-dynamic-range rendering implemented into the Source game engine. Valve first attempted to implement high-dynamic-range rendering in Source in late 2003. The first method stored textures in RGBA color space, allowing for multisample anti-aliasing and pixel shaders to be used, but this prevented alpha mapping and fog effects from working properly, as well as making textures appear sharp and jagged. The second method involved saving two versions of a texture: one with regular data, {{and the other with}} overbrightening data. However, this technique did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing and consumed twice as much video card memory, making it infeasible. The third method, shown at the E3 convention in 2005, used floating point data to define the RGB color space, allowing for reasonably efficient storage of the high-dynamic-range data. However, this method also did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing, and was only compatible with Nvidia video cards, leaving ATI cards unable to run high dynamic range. The fourth and final method compromised between the second and third methods, using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ATI cards to render HDR in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> to the Nvidia ones while nearly producing the same end result.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated {{due to their}} extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. From their silicate ores, all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way: sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium(III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide. The remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated. Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way,</b> where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes fractional distillation for purification.|$|E
