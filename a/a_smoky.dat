5|$|A large {{variety of}} {{eggplant}} salads and dips {{are made with}} roasted eggplants. Baba ghanoush, called salat ḥatzilim in Israel, is made with tahina and other seasonings such as garlic, lemon juice, onions, herbs and spices. The eggplant is sometimes grilled over an open flame so that the pulp has <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> taste. A particularly Israeli variation of the salad is made with mayonnaise called salat ḥatzilim b'mayonnaise. Eggplant salads are also made with yogurt, or with feta cheese, chopped onion and tomato, or {{in the style of}} Romanian Jews, with roasted red pepper.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E
5|$|This {{extremely}} rare mushroom is notable for its unusual appearance and disjunct distribution: {{it is found}} only in select locales in Texas and Japan. The fruit body, which grows on the stumps or dead roots of cedar elms (in Texas) or dead oaks (in Japan), somewhat resembles a dark brown or black cigar before it splits open radially into a starlike arrangement of four to seven leathery rays. The interior surface of the fruit body bears the spore-bearing tissue known as the hymenium, and is colored white to brown, depending on its age. The fruit body opening can {{be accompanied by a}} distinct hissing sound and the release of <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> cloud of spores.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} was filmed and {{directed}} by Howard Greenhalgh on 10 November 1997 in a studio located in London. The video features each Spice Girl in their own individual scene, inspired by their own movie fantasies. Melanie Brown is shown singing {{on top of a}} tank strapped with ammunition in an industrial post-apocalyptic war scene in a segment based on the film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Emma Bunton is shown in a bedroom dressed in white pyjamas while objects float around her on their own; her scene is based on Poltergeist. Melanie Chisholm is shown in a Chinatown, dressed in a red cheongsam and black pants with her hair in a long ponytail with red streaks; her scene is based upon Year of the Dragon. Geri Halliwell is featured in a black-and-white scene based on Rita Hayworth's performance in Gilda. She is shown performing on <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> stage in a long, white sequined gown with a group of sailors dancing around her. Victoria Beckham is shown in a missile silo next to a smoking rocket, clad in a black catsuit and with a long ponytail; she is portraying Catwoman from Batman Returns.|$|E
5|$|The video shifts {{again to}} Björk {{buried in the}} sand under the rain of ashes. The two pieces of rock appear again, this time each one with a Björk-shaped strata. The strata also sing parts of the song, and two arms come out from the {{floating}} rocks and their hands barely brush against each other. The rocks unite once again as the chorus begins for the second time. During {{this part of the}} video, images of Björk singing in <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> setting alternate with more rocks uniting to the main two, while their Björk-shaped strata secrete a substance similar to lava from their mouth. All the rocks are now united, forming a big volcano, whose crater is shaped like two opposite Björk-shaped rocks. The volcano finally erupts in an explosion of magma, while a thunderstorm occurs in the background. The video ends as the volcano fades out and all that remains visible is ash and smoke.|$|E

50|$|The {{taste of}} the {{sausages}} depends on the region, but generally they are {{similar to that of}} a frankfurter, but with <b>a</b> <b>smokier</b> flavour and <b>a</b> texture brought about by its fat shape and the tightly wrapped natural casing. Various European semi-dry cervelat are similar to summer sausage in the U.S., and Thuringian sausage can be considered a type of cervelat.|$|R
25|$|In most cases, {{some level}} of smoke from a peat-heated fire is {{introduced}} to the kiln to add phenols, <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> aroma and flavour to the whisky. Some of the more intensely smoky malts have phenol levels between 25 and 50 parts per million (ppm).|$|E
25|$|In general, none {{of these}} early malts would have been well {{shielded}} from the smoke involved in the kilning process, and consequently, early beers would have had <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> component to their flavors; evidence indicates that maltsters and brewers constantly tried to minimize the smokiness of the finished beer.|$|E
25|$|For most foods, such as rice, {{the typical}} {{person would be}} unable to tell how it was cooked from looking at the final product. There are some differences, however: Bread and cakes brown on their tops instead of on the bottom. Compared to cooking over a fire, the food does not have <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> flavor.|$|E

25|$|Aniline is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C6H5NH2. Consisting of a phenyl group attached to an amino group, aniline is the prototypical aromatic amine. Its main use {{is in the}} manufacture of precursors to polyurethane and other industrial chemicals. Like most volatile amines, it possesses the odour of rotten fish. It ignites readily, burning with <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> flame characteristic of aromatic compounds.|$|E
25|$|Although “coal oil” {{was well}} known by {{industrial}} chemists at least {{as early as the}} 1700s as a byproduct of making coal gas and coal tar, it burned with <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> flame that prevented its use for indoor illumination. In cities, much indoor illumination was provided by piped-in coal gas, but outside the cities, and for spot lighting within the cities, the lucrative market for fueling indoor lamps was supplied by whale oil, specifically that from sperm whales, which burned brighter and cleaner.|$|E
25|$|Heavy use of {{cigarettes}} {{by the mother}} (more than 20 per day) {{has been shown to}} reduce the mother's milk supply and cause vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid heart rate, and restlessness in breastfed infants. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is more common in babies exposed to <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> environment. Breastfeeding mothers who smoke are counseled not to do so during or immediately before feeding their child, and are encouraged to seek advice to help them reduce their nicotine intake or quit.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, she {{returned}} to film acting in Steel Magnolias (1989), based on the play {{of the same name}} by Robert Harling. The film was popular with critics and audiences, grossing over $95 million inside the U.S. She starred in the television movies <b>A</b> <b>Smoky</b> Mountain Christmas (1986); Wild Texas Wind (1991); Unlikely Angel (1996), portraying an angel sent back to earth following a deadly car crash; and Blue Valley Songbird (1999), where her character lives through her music. Parton starred along with James Woods in Straight Talk (1992), which received mixed reviews, and grossed a mild $21 million at the box office.|$|E
25|$|Wood-tar {{creosote}} is a colourless to yellowish greasy liquid with <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> odor, {{produces a}} sooty flame when burned, {{and has a}} burned taste. It is non-buoyant in water, with a specific gravity of 1.037 to 1.087, retains fluidity at a very low temperature, and boils at 205-225°C. When transparent, it is in its purest form. Dissolution in water requires up to 200 {{times the amount of}} water as the base creosote. The creosote is a combination of natural phenols: primarily guaiacol and creosol (4-methylguaiacol), which will typically constitute 50% of the oil; second in prevalence, cresol and xylenol; the rest being a combination of monophenols and polyphenols.|$|E
25|$|Pottery remains {{from this}} early period are very rarely discovered; the remains {{that have been}} found {{indicate}} that the ceramics were used after being fired in a kiln. The outer colour of the pottery is <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> grey, with raised and sunken relief decorations. Toward the end of this early Cucuteni-Trypillia period, the pottery begins to be painted before firing. The white-painting technique found on some of the pottery from this period was imported from the earlier and contemporary (5th millennium) Gumelniţa-Karanovo culture. Historians point to this transition to kiln-fired, white-painted pottery as the turning point for when the Pre-Cucuteni culture ended and Cucuteni Phase (or Cucuteni-Trypillia Culture) began.|$|E

25|$|When the casks used to age Pedro Ximenez Sherry are retired, {{they are}} often sent to Scotland and Ireland, where {{they are used to}} age fine whisky. Single malt whisky aged in sherry casks is {{regarded}} by some as a special category with its own aficionados. The sweet Pedro Ximenez wine infused in the wood of the casks imparts some of the flavor and aroma of the wine to the whisky during the ageing process. In the whisky industry the taste of the Pedro Ximenez is very sweet. Most of the whiskies are just finished after maturation in other casks. The Pedro Ximenez sweetness is often combined with <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> peat flavor.|$|E
25|$|On 30 December 1971, Communist forces {{attacked}} Sala Phou Khoun, {{a strategic}} intersection in the Royalist rear; the counter for this would become Operation Maharat. The next day, the first Communist 130mm shells fell on Long Tieng. They {{blew up the}} main ammo dump, including its RLAF facilities. Vang Pao unexpectedly left his headquarters at the vital guerrilla base. His CIA advisers followed him to <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> hut in Ban Song Sai, 21 kilometers to the southwest. There they found him ill, depressed, weeping, and cursing the lack of air support. He returned to Long Tieng with them. They took him to hospital on 4 January, to be admitted for treatment of viral pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Creosote {{was first}} {{discovered}} in its wood-tar form in 1832, by Carl Reichenbach, {{when he found}} it both in the tar and in pyroligneous acids obtained by a dry distillation of beechwood. Because pyroligneous acid was known as an antiseptic and meat preservative, Reichenbach conducted experiments by dipping meat in a diluted solution of distilled creosote. He found that the meat was dried without undergoing putrefaction and had attained <b>a</b> <b>smoky</b> flavor. This led him to reason that creosote was the antiseptic component contained in smoke, and he further argued that the creosote he had found in wood tar was also in coal tar, as well as amber tar and animal tar, in the same abundance as in wood tar.|$|E
