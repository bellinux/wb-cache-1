40|$|The {{effects of}} oral {{administration}} of <b>azepexole</b> 10 mg, clonidine 300 micrograms and placebo on baroreceptor mediated reflex bradycardia and physiological tremor were investigated in six healthy volunteers. Both <b>azepexole</b> and clonidine reduced (P less than 0. 05) systolic (120. 5 +/- 2. 5 to 105. 0 +/- 3. 3 mm Hg; 115. 8 +/- 2. 6 to 104. 7 +/- 2. 8 mm Hg respectively) and diastolic (52. 5 +/- 2. 6 to 47. 2 +/- 1. 4 mmHg; 53. 7 +/- 1. 6 to 49. 0 +/- 1. 5 mmHg respectively) pressure {{when compared to}} placebo and to pre-treatment values. This reduction in pressure was not accompanied by a change in heart rate. Both <b>azepexole</b> and clonidine enhanced (P less than 0. 05) baroreflex sensitivity to increases in systolic arterial pressure with phenylephrine. Clonidine facilitated (P less than 0. 05) baroreflex sensitivity during the strain phase of the Valsalva manoeuvre, whereas <b>azepexole</b> reduced it (P less than 0. 05). Neither clonidine nor <b>azepexole</b> altered finger tremor when compared to placebo or pre-treatment values. <b>Azepexole</b> produced (P less than 0. 05) sedation compared to placebo but not when compared to pre-treatment values. Clonidine caused significant increases in sedation when compared to both placebo and to pre-treatment values. The differences between <b>azepexole</b> and clonidine {{may be due to}} the greater specificity of <b>azepexole</b> for the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor than clonidine...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pertussis}} toxin on {{the interaction of}} <b>azepexole</b> and halothane was determined on the guinea pig ileum. Both aze-pexole and halothane inhibited electrically induced contractions with IC 50 values of 3. 3 x 1 O M and 1. 5 V/V%, respectively. The two drugs interacted synergistically at concentrations pro-ducing inhibition greater than 50 %. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin reduced the potency of each agent individually and abol-ished the synergistic interaction. The results demonstrate that the eftects of halothane and <b>azepexole</b> involve a pertussis-sensitive G protein, thus suggesting {{that the effects of}} volatile anesthetics are mediated in part by this group of membrane associated proteins. <b>Azepexole</b> is a highly selective atpha- 2 adrenergic agonist (Timmermans and van Zwieten, 1982).

40|$|Most alpha 2 -adrenoceptor {{agonists}} developed so far will penetrate {{into the}} brain, thus causing central hypotensive activity, {{mediated by the}} stimulation of alpha 2 adrenoceptors {{in the region of}} the nucleus tractus solitarii, the vasomotor center and the nucleus of the vagus nerve. The central alpha 2 adrenoceptors are probably located at postjunctional (postsynaptic) sites. Their stimulation causes sympathoinhibition and thus a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. The central hypotensive effect is the dominating activity of all alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists developed so far, of which clonidine, guanfacine and alpha-methyl-DOPA (which is converted into alpha-methyl-noradrenaline) are the prototypes. Peripheral postsynaptic effects probably do not greatly contribute to the hypotensive activity of these drugs. Sedation, also mediated by central alpha 2 adrenoceptors is the major adverse reaction to these antihypertensive agents. More selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists (B-HT 920, <b>azepexole,</b> UK 14, 304) appear to display the same pattern of hypotensive and sedative activities as the nonselective compounds like clonidine. After the general survey on centrally acting alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonistic drugs, the pharmacologic profile of the new oxazoline derivative, rilmenidine, (S 3341) was compared with that of the classic compound, clonidine. In all current animal and in vitro models, rilmenidine was characterized as a clonidine-like, centrally acting antihypertensive drug. Thus, its central hypotensive activity proved mediated by the stimulation of central alpha 2 adrenoceptors. In radioligand binding studies, rilmenidine proved somewhat more selective for alpha 2 adrenoceptors, but this selectivity was not reflected by a clearly different pharmacologic profile of the drug.

40|$|Nifedipine {{was tested}} against pressor {{responses}} in the pithed rat to ten agonists with varying selectivity for alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptors, injected as a bolus or infused intravenously: i. e. amidephrine, <b>azepexole,</b> cirazoline, indanidine, M 7, methoxamine, noradrenaline (NA), oxymetazoline, phenylephrine and xylazine. Nifedipine, administered before the agonists, inhibited responses initiated by all agonists, usually for both the bolus and infusion responses. With a bolus, blockade was significantly greater against the more prolonged, secondary components of the pressor responses. This demonstrates that calcium-entry occurs during the secondary component of the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated response and can be initiated by either alpha 1 - or alpha 2 -adrenoceptor subtypes. The time courses of responses to infusion varied. Selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists, {{with the exception of}} indanidine, did not produce a stable pressor response during the 20 min infusion time but alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists did. Nifedipine reduced responses to infusion with no preference for alpha 1 - or alpha 2 -agonists. Phenylephrine and NA produced pressor responses which reached a peak and then declined during the remainder of the infusion. The levels of NA in arterial and venous plasma were measured by h. p. l. c. during the infusion of NA. Arterial NA levels rose throughout the infusion whereas venous levels remained relatively unaffected. The absolute levels of plasma NA suggest that a large proportion of intravenously administered NA is removed in the pulmonary circulation and the remainder is removed in the systemic circulation with negligible recirculation. The consequences of these results, for assessment of the mechanisms of action of adrenoceptor agonists and calcium entry blockers, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{proposal}} {{is that the}} alpha₁-adrenoceptor may mediate the arrhythmogenic effect of catecholamines during acute myocardial ischaernia. The purpose of this thesis was to explore the role of alpha₁ and alpha₂-adrenoceptor stimulation on vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation in the norrnoxic rat ventricular myocardium and further to evaluate the possible underlying cellular mechanism. The model used was the isolated perfused rat heart (Langendorff technique) in which ventricular fibrillation was electrically induced. The amount of current required to produce ventricular fibrillation was measured as the ventricular fibrillation threshold. Alpha₁-adrenoceptor stirnμlation with methoxamine to 10 ⁻⁶M to 10 ⁻⁵M increased the vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation. The arrhythmogenic effect of methoxamine could not be attributed to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation as it occurred {{in the setting of}} the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist agent, atenolol; furthermore no accumulation of cyclic AMP, the proposed arrhythmogenic second messenger of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, occurred. Similarly no alteration in heart rate, coronary flow rate or myocardial high energy phosphate content accompanied the arrhythrnogenic effect of methoxamine. The QT interval increased with alpha₁-adrenoceptor stimulation, this being an indirect index of prolongation of the action potential duration. The arrhythmogenic action of methoxamine was associated with a positive inotropic effect. Prazosin 10 ⁻⁸M (an alpha₁-adrenoceptor antagonist agent) produced a tenfold displacement {{to the right of the}} log concentration response curve of the positive inotropic effect of methoxamine. Prazosin 10 ⁻⁸M prevented the methoxamine induced fall in ventricular fibrillation threshold. Alpha₂-adrenoceptor stimulation with B-HT 920 and B-HT 933 (<b>azepexole),</b> in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist agent atenolol, did not alter the vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation. Alpha₂-adrenoceptor stimulation produced no alteration in heart rate, coronary flow rate or metabolic status. We next explored the possible mechanism underlying the arrhythmogenic effect of methoxamine. Alpha₁-adrenoceptor stimulation enhances transsarcolemmal calcium ion influx and may induce sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release. To assess the role of transsarcolemmal calcium movement in alpha₁-adrenoceptor mediated effects experiments were undertaken with nisoldipine and low extracellular calcium. To evaluate the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, experiments were undertaken with ryanodine (an agent reputed to inhibit sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release without effecting the slow inward current). Nisoldipine 10 ⁻⁸M, reducing extracellular calcium (2. 5 mM to 1. 25 mM) and ryanodine 10 ⁻⁹M to 10 ⁻⁸M, prevented the arrhythmogenic and positive inotropic effect of methoxamine. Heart rate, metabolic status and cyclic AMP levels we're unchanged with these procedures. The mechanism underlying the arrhythmogenic action of alpha₁-adrenoceptor stimulation might be an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration. This increase may be secondary to (i) an enhanced transsarcolemmal calcium influx or (ii) an increase in the phasic release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum...|$|E
