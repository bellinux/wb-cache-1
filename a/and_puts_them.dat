5|$|The next day, Fung {{is having}} tea {{in a public}} square {{surrounded}} by his subordinates. He sees a beautiful woman (Kwai's pregnant friend) having tea in the same square. As {{he tries to get}} her attention, a large group of children come asking him to buy charity stickers. The children place stickers on Fung and his men. The pregnant woman leaves the square and meets up with Costello, then tells him that the man back in the square with the most number of stickers is Fung. Costello thanks her, makes his way to the square and begins to shoot a great many of the guards as well as Fung as chaos ensues. However, Fung turns out to be wearing a bulletproof vest. His subordinates help him run away from Costello, who gives chase on foot. As Costello walks, he checks the bystanders for stickers, which tips Fung off to the fact that Costello does not actually recognize him, apart from the stickers he is wearing. Fung removes the stickers from his coat, <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>them</b> on the jacket of a subordinate instead. This causes Costello to shoot Fung's subordinate. Fung then removes his coat with all the stickers and runs off.|$|E

GV1001 is a peptide from the active site of hTERT and is recognized by the immune system that reacts by killing the telomerase-active cells.|$|E

These barriers prevent large numbers of women and ethnic minorities from obtaining and securing the most powerful, prestigious and highest-grossing jobs in the workforce. Moreover, this effect prevents women from filling high-ranking positions <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>them</b> at a disadvantage as potential candidates for advancement.|$|E

25|$|The {{format of}} Afghan Star {{is similar to}} the British Pop Idol or the French Nouvelle Star and their many spinoffs, though it is {{independently}} produced and not a licensed adaptation. The program starts with auditions from aspiring singers in their late teens and early 20s. A panel of judges choose the best auditionees <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>them</b> through to the public voting round of the contest. At this stage, each week every singer performs and the viewers vote for which singer they prefer using their cell phones. In every round, whoever gets the lowest amount of votes leaves the competition until just one is left, who is declared the winner.|$|E
25|$|Bank vaults {{are built}} as custom orders. The vault {{is usually the}} first aspect of a new bank {{building}} to be designed and built. The manufacturing process begins with {{the design of the}} vault, {{and the rest of the}} bank is built around it. The vault manufacturer consults with the customer to determine factors such as the total vault size, desired shape, and location of the door. After the customer signs off on the design, the manufacturer configures the equipment to make the vault panels and door. The customer usually orders the vault to be delivered and installed.

He ties Elle's hands to a chair and ties her bare feet together <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>them</b> in a metal dog bath which is full with water. Elle tries to use her abilities while in the dog bath, but she shocks herself. During this time, Noah tells Elle that Bob allowed the Company to perform tests on her which had begun as early as the age of seven. This included subjecting her to high doses of electricity, which scarred her emotionally for life. Elle has no recollection of the tests, and Noah suggests the Haitian had a role in causing Elle to forget her experiences. After an agreement is made, she is reunited with Bob and Claire momentarily reunited with Noah. However, Elle attacks Claire and West as they leave. She tries to attack Noah, but he shoots Elle in the arm before she can hurt him or anyone else. As it seems Noah is going to kill Bob, Mohinder Suresh, a scientist working with Noah and the Company, shoots and kills Noah. Elle leaves with Bob and Mohinder, giving Bob a look of distrust.|$|E
500|$|According to Patti Bellantoni, {{colors are}} used symbolically {{throughout}} the film, none {{more so than}} red, which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and [...] " [...] Lester's arc". First seen in drab colors that reflect his passivity, Lester surrounds himself with red as he regains his individuality. The American Beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol; when Lester fantasizes about Angela, she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals. In these scenes, the rose symbolizes Lester's desire for her. When associated with Carolyn, the rose represents a [...] "façade for suburban success". Roses are included in almost every shot inside the Burnhams' home, where they signify [...] "a mask covering a bleak, unbeautiful reality". Carolyn feels that [...] "as long as there can be roses, all is well". She cuts the roses <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>them</b> in vases, where they adorn her [...] "meretricious vision of what makes for beauty" [...] and begin to die. The roses in the vase in the Angela–Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester's previous life and Carolyn; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer, finally taking the roses—and thus Carolyn—out of the shot. Lester's epiphany {{at the end of}} the film is expressed by rain and the use of red, building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester feels. The constant use of red [...] "lulls [...] subliminally" [...] into becoming used to it; consequently, it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his blood spatters on the wall.|$|E
500|$|Jason Lipshutz from Billboard {{described}} it as a [...] "motorcycle mayhem meets biblical betrayal." [...] MTV News' James Montogomery called the video as a pure pop clip, [...] "albeit one that looks great and is sure to earn the ire of a few folks on the religious right." [...] He added that [...] "Judas" [...] is, at its sacred heart, an artistic explosion contained within the confines of a traditional pop clip. Christian Blauvelt from Entertainment Weekly did not like the video at first, calling it her weakest effort to date and attributing it to Gibson's choreography and the literal storyline. However, he admitted that after watching the video a few times, he became fond of it. Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger felt that there was neither anything blasphemous about the video, nor anything too daring about it. McCall explained that the dancing in the video is a [...] "pleasure to watch", but would have been better if the camera work was more professional. According to him, the only eye-catching prop in the video was the gun that turned into a lipstick. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone was certain that the video would offend some Christians for its irreverent and highly sexualized take on Jesus Christ; he also said that Gaga interpreted the Biblical story in her own style. Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine complimented the production of the video by calling it [...] "visually stunning", while adding that [...] "'Judas' is the work of a repertory, not a revolutionary. It takes familiar swatches from Gaga's palette (the leather-and-chain aesthetic of [...] "Telephone"; the plaintive, tear-stained camera stare of [...] "Bad Romance") <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>them</b> all together for a competently executed work." [...] Phil Fox Rose, while reviewing the video for The Washington Post, gave it a positive review stating that he found it [...] "moving, both artistically and spiritually." [...] He then went on to explain how the religion related accusations against Gaga were completely biased. VH1 found that the video was inspired by Madonna's [...] "Like a Prayer", the films Our Lady of the Assassins, The Wild Angels and Romeo + Juliet, and the American television series Lost. NME named 'Judas' the fourth worst music video ever, describing it as [...] "an attempt to jump on the Madonna/Catholicism bandwagon that so incredibly misjudged it's quite comical." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Roman mythology, Jupiter (the {{king of the}} gods) lusts after a {{young woman}} named Callisto, a nymph of Diana.

Arcas almost shoots the bear, but to avert the tragedy, Jupiter turns Arcas into a bear too <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>them</b> both in the sky, forming Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. [...] Callisto is Ursa Major and her son, Arcas, is Ursa Minor. [...] In ancient times {{the name of the}} constellation was Helike, ("turning"), because it turns around the Pole. In Book Two of Lucan it is called Parrhasian Helice, since Callisto came from Parrhasia in Arcadia, where the story is set. The Odyssey notes that it is the sole constellation that never sinks below the horizon and [...] "bathes in the Ocean's waves", so it is used as a celestial reference point for navigation.
