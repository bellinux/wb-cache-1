50|$|<b>Azinphos-methyl</b> (Guthion) (also spelled azinophos-methyl) {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} organophosphate insecticide manufactured by Bayer CropScience, Gowan Co., and Makhteshim Agan. Like other pesticides in this class, it owes its insecticidal properties (and human toxicity) {{to the fact that}} it is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (the same mechanism is responsible for the toxic effects of the V-series nerve agent chemical weapons). It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>azinphos-methyl</b> {{is absorbed}} {{it can cause}} {{neurotoxic}} effects, like other organophosphate insecticides. At high concentrations AzM itself can be toxic because it can function as a acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. But its toxicity is mainly due to the bioactivation by a cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated desulfuration to its phosphate triester or oxon(gutoxon) (see figure 2). Gutoxon can react with a serine hydroxyl group at the active site of the AChE. The active site is then blocked and AChE is inactivated. Under normal circumstances acetylcholinesterase rapidly and efficiently degrades the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and thereby terminates the biological activity of acetylcholine. Inhibition of AChE results in an immediate accumulation of free unbound ACh at the ending of all cholinergic nerves, which leads to overstimulation of the nervous system.|$|E

50|$|The {{synthesis}} (in this case, of carbon-14-labelled material) {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} 1. In the first step, o-nitroaniline (compound 1) is purified through dissolution in hot water-ethanol mixture in relation 2:1. carbon is added and the result is filtrated for clarifying. The filtrate is chilled while kept in movement to generate crystals, usually at 4 °C, but if needed it can also be cooled to -10 °C. The crystals are then collected, washed and dried. If it is pure enough it is used for the following steps, which take place at 0 till 5 °C. To produce o-Nitrobenzonitrile-14C (compound 2), the first component o-nitroaniline and (concentrated reagent grade) hydrochloric acid are put together with ice and water. Sodium nitride, dissolved in water, is added to this thin slurry. After the formation of a pale-yellow solution, which indicates the completion of the diazotization reaction, the pH should be adjusted to 6. After this, the solution is introduced to a mixture of cuprous cyanide and toluene. At room temperature the toluene layer is removed. The aqueous layer is washed and dried and the purified product is isolated by crystallization. The third product is Anthranilamide-14C (compound 3). It is formed out of o-Nitrobenzonitrile-14C, which is first solved in ethanol and hydrazine hydrate. The solvent is heated subsequently, treated in a well-ventilated hood with small periodic charges, smaller than 10 mg, of Raney nickel. Under nitrogen atmosphere the ethanolic solution is clarified and dried. The next step is to form 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C (compound 4). In water dissolved sodium nitrite is added to anthranilamide and hydrochloric acid in ice water. Because this is a diazotization reaction, the product is pale-yellow again. After this the pH is adjusted to 8,5. This causes the ring closure to form 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C. This results in a sodium salt slurry that can be treated with hydrochloric acid, what lowers the pH down to 2 till 4. The 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C is collected, washed and dried. In the following step 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4-(3-chloromethyl)-one-14C has to be formed. Therefore, 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C and paraformaldehyde are added to ethylene dichloride and heated to 40 °C. Then thionyl chloride is added and the whole solvent is further heated to 65 °C. After four hours of heating the solution is cooled down to room temperature. Water is added and the solution is neutralized. The ethylene dichloride layer is removed and put together with the result of the washed aqueous layer. The solvent was filtered and dried. The last step is the actual synthesis of Azinphos methyl. Ethylene dichloride is added to the compound resulting from the fifth step, 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4-(3-chloromethyl)-one-14C. This mixture is heated to 50 °C and sodium bicarbonate and O,O-dimethyl phosphorodithioate sodium salt in water are added. The ethylene dichloride layer is removed, reextracted with ethylene dichloride and purified by filtration. The pure filtrate is dried. This product is once again purified by recrystallization from methanol. What is left is pure <b>azinphos-methyl</b> in form of white crystals.|$|E

Organophosphates are {{the most widely used}} insecticides, and <b>azinphos-methyl</b> is an important element in spray programs. In particular, we evaluated diagnostic doses of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> on neonate and postdiapausing larvae from seven apple (Malus spp.) orchards. We also evaluated the activity of detoxifying enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), cytochrome P 450 polysubstrate monooxygenases (PSMOs), and esterases, which are likely to be involved in resistance to insecticides. Such responses were compared with an insecticide-susceptible strain that has been maintained in the laboratory for several years. Neonate larval mortality of field populations to <b>azinphos-methyl</b> was not significantly different from of the susceptible strain. In contrast, postdiapause larval mortality was significantly lower in the six analyzed populations than in the susceptible strain. The C. pomonella populations with reduced postdiapause mortality to <b>azinphos-methyl</b> also showed statistically higher GST activity. Finally, {{no significant differences were found}} in total esterase or PSMO activity between C. pomonella populations.

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 In an {{agricultural}} community cohort, we investigated agricultural pesticide exposure associated {{changes in the}} oral buccal microbiota. We found a seasonally persistent association between blood detection of the insecticide <b>Azinphos-methyl</b> and the taxonomic composition of the buccal swab oral microbiome. Blood and buccal samples were collected concurrently from individual subjects across two seasons, spring-summer 2005 and winter 2006. Mass spectrometry quantified blood concentrations of the organophosphate insecticide <b>Azinphos-methyl.</b> Buccal microbiome samples were 16 S rRNA gene DNA sequenced and assigned to the bacterial taxonomy. Non-parametric analysis of the transformed microbiome data for individuals with and without <b>Azinphos-methyl</b> blood detection showed significant perturbations in seven common bacterial genera (> 0. 5 % of sample mean read depth), including significant reductions in the common oral bacteria, Streptococcus. Diversity in composition between individuals’ microbiomes was also investigated using principal components analysis to reveal two primary clusters of microbiome types. The spring-summer ‘exposed’ cluster with significantly less bacterial diversity was enriched for farmworkers and contained 27 of the 30 adult individuals who also had <b>Azinphos-methyl</b> agricultural pesticide exposure detected in the blood.

40|$|Resistance to the {{organophosphate}} insecticide <b>azinphos-methyl</b> {{has been}} previously identified in two species of leafroller (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in New Zealand.

40|$|Two {{strains of}} Cydia pomonella (L.)

Insecticide bioassays showed that the adults of the Rdfb strain exhibited a 2. 6 -fold and a 7. 7 -fold resistance ratio to <b>azinphos-methyl</b> and carbaryl, respectively compared to a susceptible strain (S) whereas the adults of the Raz strain exhibited a 6. 7 -fold resistance ratio to <b>azinphos-methyl</b> and a 130 -fold resistance ratio to carbaryl. In the Raz strain, a target site resistance mechanism was suggested by the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. In fact the ki values did not discriminate the S and Rdfb strains, while the Raz strain exhibited a 1. 7 -fold and a 14 -fold increase in ki value compared to the S strain for <b>azinphos-methyl</b> oxon and carbaryl, respectively. To verify this hypothesis, two cloned AChE cDNAs sequences (named cydpom-ace 2 e cydpom-ace 1) were compared between the susceptible and the resistant strains. No difference in the deduced amino acid sequence was found in cydpom-ace 2 (orthologous to the Drosophila melanogaster AChE). In the putative eydpom-ace 1 (paralogous to the Drosophila AChE), a single amino acid substitution F 399 V was exclusively present in the Raz strain.

40|$|International audienceAzinphos-methyl and {{chlorpyrifos}} are the organophosphorous pesticides which pose serious {{threats to}} the environment including their detrimental effect on humans and, therefore, their removal from the environment is a must. Hence, in the present paper the ultrasound technique was applied to remove the above-mentioned hazardous compounds. For this, the effect of influential parameters such as pH, initial pesticide concentration, frequency, electric power and treatment time on the ultrasound degradation of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> and chlorpyrifos was well investigated and elucidated. The results obtained showed that <b>azinphos-methyl</b> and chlorpyrifos were effectively and rapidly degraded by the ultrasound technique. Thus, the operating optimal conditions (initial pH 9, initial pesticide concentration 1 mg/L, frequency 130 kHz, electric power 500 W and treatment time 20 min) lead to a degradation of 78. 50 % for <b>azinphos-methyl</b> and of 98. 96 % for chlorpyrifos with in 20 min of contact time.

40|$|Various {{methods for}} the {{enhancement}} of the fluorescence of the pesticide <b>azinphos-methyl</b> are reported. The addition of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin was found to moderately enhance the fluorescence {{by a factor of}} three, presumably via inclusion of the pesticide into the cyclodextrin cavity. This complexation was found to occur with an association constant of 690 +/- 140 M- 1. This enhancement was found to be too low to be useful in a fluorescence-based analytical method for this pesticide. Exposure of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> to UV light was also found to result in enhanced fluorescence, with much larger enhancement than in the case of addition of cyclodextrins. This enhancement was presumed to occur via photolysis of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> to a more fluorescent photoproduct. However, the difficulty of providing a constant UV dosage prevents its useful application as a fluorescence-based analytical method. Finally, it was found that base hydrolysis of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> resulted in a very large fluorescence enhancement. Although this enhancement was previously reported in the literature, it was found that contrary to the published reports, the hydrolysis occurred rapidly at room temperature, with no need for carrying out the reaction at increased temperature. Fluorescence enhancements of a factor of 300 were obtained by simply adding the appropriate amount of an aqueous NaOH solution to the aqueous <b>azinphos-methyl</b> sample. This procedure was used as the basis of a simple fluorescence-based analytical method for <b>azinphos-methyl</b> in water, with excellent linear calibration curves obtained down to concentrations of 5 ppb.

We hypothesized that AZM, or a metabolite of AZM, binds to hemoglobin in erythrocytes forming an adducted protein. We administered radiolabled AZM to rats and found a stable, dose-dependent association of radioactivity with hemoglobin. The decline in hemoglobin-associated radioactivity followed the expected kinetics of erythrocyte turnover in rats. We examined hemoglobin isolated from these rats by high-pressure liquid chromatography, liquid scintillation counting, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. These analyses provided evidence of AZM or an AZM metabolite binding to one of the beta proteins of hemoglobin. In vitro incubation of AZM with hemoglobin in a liver microsome system indicated an AZM adduct to heme.

Alfalfa in 12 enclosures was mowed on 22 June to reduce vegetation height. Small mammal populations were monitored by live trapping from May through August 1993. On 14 July, an organophosphorus insecticide, <b>azinphos-methyl,</b> was applied at 0, 0. 88, and 3. 61 kg/ha. Insecticide residues were measured on canopy-level spray cards, soil samples, and alfalfa. I compared the observed residue concentrations with predictions based on the nomogram used to estimate exposure for QM {{risk assessment}}s. I also compared QM predictions of risk with observed effects on population size and growth, survival, reproductive activity, recruitment, body growth, movements, and diet of the small mammals. Much of the insecticide reached ground level in mowed enclosures, but dense alfalfa intercepted most of the spray in unmowed enclosures. The mean half-life of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> on alfalfa was 3. 4 days and was not affected by mowing. Mean residue concentrations on mowed alfalfa and the top 15 cm of unmowed alfalfa were underestimated by the QM exposure nomogram. Therefore, pesticides may pose greater risk to organisms inhabiting sparse vegetation or the tops of plants than predicted by the QM. Treatment with <b>azinphos-methyl</b> at 3. 61 kg/ha caused severe effects in both mowed and unmowed enclosures on population size and growth, survival, recruitment, and body growth of voles. Effects of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> on vole recruitment and body growth and on survival of female voles were greater in mowed than in unmowed enclosures. However, I did not find that population-level responses of voles to the chemical differed between mowing treatments. Most effects on voles were of short duration (6 weeks after spraying. The 3. 61 kg/ha application rate resulted in a 42...|$|E
40|$|Organophosphate (OP) {{pesticides}} {{are commonly}} used in the United States, and farmworkers {{are at risk for}} chronic exposure. Using a sample of 218 farmworkers in 24 communities and labor camps in eastern Washington State, we examined the association between agricultural crop and OP pesticide metabolite concentrations in urine samples of adult farmworkers and their children and OP pesticide residues in house and vehicle dust samples. Commonly reported crops were apples (71. 6 %), cherries (59. 6 %), pears (37. 2 %), grapes (27. 1 %), hops (22. 9 %), and peaches (12. 4 %). Crops were grouped into two main categories: pome fruits (apples and pears) and non-pome fruits. Farmworkers who worked in the pome fruits had significantly higher concentrations of dimethyl pesticide metabolites in their urine and elevated <b>azinphos-methyl</b> concentrations in their homes and vehicles than workers who did not work in these crops. Among pome-fruit workers, those who worked in both apples and pears had higher urinary metabolites concentrations and pesticide residue concentrations in dust than did those who worked in a single pome fruit. Children living in households with pome-fruit workers were found to have higher concentrations of urinary dimethyl metabolites than did children of non-pome-fruit workers. Adult urinary concentrations showed significant correlations with both the vehicle and house-dust <b>azinphos-methyl</b> concentrations, and child urinary concentrations were correlated significantly with adult urinary concentrations and with the house-dust <b>azinphos-methyl</b> concentration. The results provide support for the take-home pathway of pesticide exposure and show an association between measures of pesticide exposure and the number of pome-fruit crops worked by farmworkers.

40|$|Topical {{application}} of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> and fenvalerate to lightbrown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana) and greenheaded leafroller larvae (Planotortrix excessana) showed the latter species {{to be more}} susceptible to both insecticides on a mass basis. The intrinsic toxicities of 12 insecticides to 1 st instar lightbrown apple moth larvae were compared using the Potter tower direct spray method, with acetone solutions of technical grade insecticides. Pyrethroids were the most toxic group, followed by organophosphorus insecticides, a carbamate (carbaryl), and an organochlorine (DDD). The relative toxicities of six of these insecticides were similar for greenheaded leafroller larvae when compared with <b>azinphos-methyl,</b> although this species was again relatively more susceptible to fenvalerate than lightbrown apple moth. Insecticide deposits were applied in a calibrated Potter tower on to apple and other leaf surfaces. The residual toxicities {{of a range of}} formulated insecticides were, by comparison to <b>azinphos-methyl,</b> generally similar to the relative toxicities measured by direct spray for both species, except that greenheaded leafroller larvae were more susceptible to fenvalerate deposits than lightbrown apple moth larvae. The larger size of 1 st instar greenheaded leafroller larvae generally accounted for their higher lethal residue values. The median lethal residue of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> deposits on apple leaves increased with successive instars, with an approximately 15 X difference between 1 st and final instar larvae. <b>Azinphos-methyl</b> resistance in lightbrown apple moth was determined by five methods, by comparison of a susceptible strain from Lincoln (Canterbury) with a strain from Mariri (Nelson). Resistance ratios were 5 - 6 X for topical {{application of}} adults, 14 X for residue exposure of 3 rd- 4 th instar larvae, 5 X for residue exposure of 1 st instar larvae, 20 X for direct spray of 1 st instar larvae, and 133 X for topical application of 3 rd- 4 th instar larvae. The geographic distribution of resistant individuals was surveyed using two methods. Direct spray of larvae reared from light trapped female moths indicated that resistance was largely confined to the area around Mariri (near Motueka, South Island) in March-April 1982. Survey 2 used a novel method to survey resistance, using topical application of pheromone attracted males in April 1983. The middle of 125 ha of apple orchards at Mariri contained a central zone of resistant individuals, with a mixture of phenotypes near the edges, and susceptible males in the surrounding vegetation (i. e. gorse, broom, blackberry, etc.). Resistant individuals were also present at Moutere Bluffs (> 10 km south of Mariri). Cross resistance was greater to methyl than to ethyl organophosphorus insecticides and carbaryl. No cross resistance to pyrethroids was detected. The fecundity of resistant females was significantly lower than that of susceptible females. Monitoring of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> residues by gas chromatography on ‘Red Delicious’ and ‘Sturmer’ foliage showed faster decay of residues in spring, compared with late summer, principally due to leaf growth. Two components of leaf growth, expansion of existing leaves and the appearance of new leaves were considered to be important. Lightbrown apple moth larval mortality followed the chemical decay curves, using contemporaneous bioassays of field sprayed apple leaves, and a 16 hr exposure interval. Residues caused over 50 % mortality of 1 st instar larvae for three weeks in spring, and six weeks in late summer. These residues caused more than 50 % mortality of 3 rd- 4 th instar larvae for two weeks in spring, and almost five weeks in late summer. The minimum effective level of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> estimated to be for lightbrown apple moth control was estimated to be between 0. 2 - 0. 4 µ/cm² on apple foliage, regard less of season. Longer intervals between sprays would be possible following the cessation of leaf growth in January, due to the slower rate of residue decay in the absence of growth. The use of chemical assays and bioassays could optimize spray recommendations with pest phenology, degradation rates, and dosage-mortality responses, particularly with new insecticides or in new horticultural crops where spray programmes are more likely to benefit from this approach due to less field testing of alternatives...|$|E
40|$|One {{proposed}} {{mechanism for}} protecting both bystanders {{as well as}} water bodies from direct exposure to sprays {{is the use of}} no-spray buffer zones. Depending on the non-target receptor requiring protection, no-spray zones can encompass an area adjacent to the last tree row or one or more unsprayed tree rows within a field or orchard. The interests of efficient farming and environmental protection must be balanced, so the size of the no-spray zone needs to be protective enough without being so large that farming operations are hindered. One way to achieve this balance is to use drift modeling and integrate the results with toxicologically relevant benchmarks. The model AgDRIFT was used to model downwind deposition of an organophosphorus (OP) insecticide (<b>azinphos-methyl)</b> during an orchard application. Deposition on a surface area basis was changed to a whole body dose, assuming a 10 -kg child as the receptor. The EPA-defined acute Reference Dose (RfD) for <b>azinphos-methyl</b> was used as the toxicologically relevant benchmark for defining a very conservative no-spray buffer zone to protect bystanders from an acutely hazardous exposure...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate {{the effects of the}} organophosphorus insecticide, azinphosmethyl, on bird populations and into the possibility of assessing toxic hazard by a non-destructive biomarker such as BChE inhibition. Japanese quail were treated with increasing doses of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> (0. 5, 5, and 50 mg/kg) and sacrificed 7 and 24 h later. Serum BChE and CbE, brain AChE, and liver microsomal CbE activities showed different patterns of inhibition. The maximum inhibition of BChE and CbE usually occurred 7 h after treatment, whereas the effect on AChE was greater at 24 h. A positive correlation was found between BChE and AChE, 7 and 24 h after treatment. This correlation could serve as the foundation for a theoretical model for assessing toxic hazard through non-destructive biomarkers. The only effect on brain AChE was detected in the group treated with the highest concentrations of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> (50 mg/kg). Fugacity model calculations showed that such massive concentrations are very unlikely to occur under natural conditions after agricultural use of the compound...|$|E
40|$|Two {{agricultural}} runoff events {{involving the}} pesticide <b>azinphos-methyl</b> occurred in July 2002 on the Wilmot River, Prince Edward Island, Canada, {{resulting in the}} death of thousands of fish. The fish communities from three sites on this river had been sampled in 2001, permitting comparisons of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations before and after the events. Samples taken immediately after the runoff events suggested that brook trout suffered higher mortality than rainbow trout. Young-of-the-year fish were more affected than older age classes for both species. Sampling in 2003, a year after the pesticide runoff events, revealed salmonid communities that were still skewed towards rainbow trout, and a decrease in the 1 + age class density (2002 &# 39;s young of the year) at affected sites. These results suggest a differential effect of the pesticide <b>azinphos-methyl</b> on salmonid species and age classes under natural conditions, and a subsequent change in population and community structure. The possibility of these pesticide runoff events selecting for rainbow trout, an exotic species, is a consideration in management of agriculturally impacted rivers...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{organophosphate}} pesticides is {{an integral}} part of commercial farming activities and these substances have been implicated as a major source of environmental contamination and may impact on a range of non-target fauna. The extent to which soil dwelling non-target organisms are affected by exposure to the organophosphate <b>azinphos-methyl</b> was investigated through monitoring selected biomarker responses and life cycle effects under laboratory conditions in the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Standard acute toxicity tests were conducted followed by a sequential exposure regime experiment, in order to assess the effects of multiple pesticide applications on biomarker (cholinesterase activity and neutral red retention time), life-cycle (growth and reproduction) and behaviour (avoidance and burrowing activity) responses. The present study indicates that the time between exposure events was a more important variable than concentration and that a longer interval between exposures may mitigate the effects of pesticide exposure provided that the exposure concentration is low. Additionally, it was shown that E. andrei was unable to avoid the presence of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> in soil, even at concentrations as high as 50 % of the LC 50 value, indicating that the presence of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> in the soil pose a realistic threat to earthworms and other soil dwelling organisms. The ChE inhibition test showed a high percentage inhibition of the enzyme in all exposure groups that survived and NRR times of exposed organisms were lower than that of the controls. The present study yielded important results that contribute to the understanding of biological impacts of pesticide pollution on the environment. Extrapolating these results can aid in optimising pesticide application regimes to mitigate the environmental effects thereof and thus ensuring sustained soil biodiversity in agricultural areas. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|E
40|$|Aedes aegypti {{mosquitoes}} are {{the primary}} vectors of Zika virus and Dengue virus and represent a massive threat to public health worldwide. There are between 50 - 100 million cases of Dengue fever every year, and the geographical distribution of the Zika virus continues to increase rapidly. Extensive use of insecticides for mosquito-borne disease control {{led to the development}} of insecticide-resistant mosquito populations, and there is need for the development of new insecticidal formulations. For this investigation, we measured the relative toxicities of commercial insecticides <b>azinphos-methyl</b> and chlorfenapyr via topical applications. After determining the relative toxicities, we screened mixtures of each compound with various natural plant oils in order to assess their ability to enhance insecticidal effectiveness. We previously demonstrated plant oils possess promising enhancement features when combined with various types of pesticides against Aedes aegypti. Through this study, we found a significant increase on toxic activity in the natural plant oil mixtures. Hence, the increased efficacy of <b>azinphos-methyl</b> and chlorfenapyr when combined with plant oils may contribute to the development of environmentally favorable formulations. Ultimately, plant oil mixtures may be used as part of global efforts toward controlling Aedes aegypti populations, and the spread of Dengue virus and Zika virus...|$|E
40|$|Current {{pesticide}} {{health risk}} assessments in the United States require {{the characterization of}} aggregate exposure and cumulative risk {{in the setting of}} food tolerances. Biologic monitoring can aggregate exposures from all sources and routes, and can integrate eposures for chemicals with a common mechanism of action. Its value was demonstrated in a recent study of organophosphorus (OP) pesticide exposure among 109 children in an agricultural community in Washington State; 91 of the children had parents working in agriculture. We estimated individual OP pesticide doses from urinary metabolite concentrations with a eteristic steady state model, and compared them to toxicologic reference values. We evaluated doses by assuming that metabolites were attributable entirely to either <b>azinphos-methyl</b> or phosmet, the two OP pesticides used most frequently in the region. Creatinine-adjusted average dose estimates during the 6 - to 8 -week spraying season ranged from 0 to 36 pgkg/day. For children whose parents worked in agriculture as either orchard applicators or as fieldworkers, 56 % of the doses estimated for the spray season xceeded the U. S.

Tribufos, 0. 47 kg ha− 1 and tribufos, 0. 235 kg ha− 1 + thidiazuron, 0. 125 kg ha− 1 exhibited a slightly toxic effect to boll weevil, while tribufos, 0. 47 kg ha− 1 + lambda − cyhalothrin, 0. 019 kg ha− 1, tribufos, 0. 47 kg ha− 1 + azinphos − methyl, 0. 14 kg ha− 1, and tribufos, 0. 235 kg ha− 1 + thidiazuron, 0. 125 kg ha− 1 + azinphos − methyl, 0. 14 kg ha− 1, provided control of boll weevil as good as or better than full-rate <b>azinphos-methyl</b> or lambda-cyhalothrin alone owing to synergistic effects.
