The Burmese would not, however, take the Siamese capital so easily.|$|E

5|$|A Bosman {{transfer}} to Portsmouth followed after three successful seasons at the Berkshire-based club. Initially, Primus struggled {{to break into}} the team <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> progress hindered by injuries. But the 2002–03 season signaled a change in direction as Primus broke into the first team and won Portsmouth fan's player of the season as well as the PFA Fans' Player of the Year for his division. For the next three seasons Primus {{was in and out of}} the first team and worked under three managers: Harry Redknapp, Velimir Zajec and Alain Perrin. The 2006–07 season was the last injury-free season for Primus as a career-threatening knee injury meant he would not make an appearance the following season. Primus went out on loan to former club Charlton and made 10 appearances and one further appearance for Portsmouth before retiring through injury in December 2009. The Milton End stand at Fratton Park was renamed the 'Linvoy Primus Community Stand' because of his outstanding services to the club.|$|E

When Drew Bledsoe was drafted in 1993, Zolak became his backup {{for the next six}} seasons. He appeared as a replacement for Bledsoe when he was hurt, but only started three games during this time. He was released {{at the end of the}} 1998 season, and signed with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins in 1999, playing in one game for Miami before retiring. After his retirement, he became a sportscaster and football analyst in the New England area.|$|E
5|$|A {{score of}} veteran {{officers}} became teachers at his military school. Luna devised two courses of instruction, planned the reorganization, with {{a battalion of}} tiradores and a cavalry squadron, set up an inventory of guns and ammunition, arsenals, using convents and town halls, quartermasters, lookouts and communication systems. He built trenches {{with the help of}} his chief engineer, General Jose Alejandrino, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> brother Juan design the school's uniforms (the Filipino rayadillo). He also insisted on strict discipline over and above clan armies and regional loyalties, which prevented coordination between various military units. Envisioning one united army for the Republic, clan armies and regional loyalties presented a lack of national consciousness. It was also a condition that the Spanish utilized to keep the native contingent of their armed forces within check. Soldiers of one region were used to fight revolts in other regions.|$|E

5|$|After leaving politics, Hastings {{returned}} to {{his work as a}} barrister, and eventually surpassed even his previous reputation and success as an advocate. His first major case after returning was representing F. A. Mitchell-Hedges, a noted professional explorer, in his libel action against London Express Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Express. The Daily Express had published two articles saying that he was a liar, and had planned out a bogus robbery to advertise a device known as the Monomark. The case opened on 9 February 1928 in front of Lord Hewart, with Hastings and Norman Birkett representing Mitchell-Hedges and William Jowitt and J.B. Melville representing London Express Newspapers. Despite the skills of both Hastings and Birkett, who later became a much-lauded barrister in his own right, Mitchell-Hedges lost his case <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> reputation destroyed as a result.|$|E

5|$|Among the bishops, {{only two}} stood out as {{significant}} political figures, the more prominent {{of whom was}} Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury. Long a formidable presence in English public life, Winchelsey had led the struggle against Edward I to uphold {{the autonomy of the}} church, and for this he had paid with suspension and exile. One of Edward II’s first acts as king had been to reinstate Winchelsey, but rather than responding with grateful loyalty, the archbishop soon reassumed a leadership role in the fight against the king. Although he was trying to appease Winchelsey, the king carried an old grudge against another prelate, Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield. Edward had Langton dismissed from his position as treasurer of the Exchequer <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> temporal possessions confiscated. Langton had been an opponent of Winchelsey during the previous reign, but Edward II’s move against Langton drew the two Ordainers together.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of commissioning, Douglas Henshall and Daniel Craig were {{considered}} for the parts of Brown and Blair respectively, though David Morrissey and Michael Sheen were eventually announced as the leads in March 2003. Morrissey gained two stone for his role <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> hair permed and dyed. He researched Brown's background by travelling to Kirkcaldy—where Brown grew up—and reviewing numerous biographies and information about the Treasury. In comparison to his preparation for the BBC thriller State of Play, Morrissey discovered that no politicians wanted {{to help him with}} his research, so he turned to journalists Jon Snow and Simon Hoggart. Director Stephen Frears was unfamiliar with his previous work and had to be convinced by other production staff to cast him.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1590s, Lopez was wealthy and {{generally}} respected. He owned a comfortable house in Holborn <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> youngest son Anthony enrolled at Winchester College. He incurred {{the fury of}} one of his former patients, Queen Elizabeth's favourite Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, when he described to Dom António and the Spanish statesman Antonio Pérez occasions on which he had treated Essex for venereal diseases. Learning of this from Pérez, Essex began to assemble evidence implicating Lopez as some sort of fifth columnist in the pay of King Philip II of Spain. The Lord High Treasurer Lord Burghley initially thought Essex's allegations against Lopez absurd; the Queen herself also rebuked Essex.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{wanted his}} pitch for Daly to {{finalize}} the deal <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> friend Lance Henriksen {{show up to}} the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator.

Cameron arrived shortly after which relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film. In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion. The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million. Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.|$|E
