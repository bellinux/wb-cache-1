5|$|The Act {{continues}} {{to have a significant}} impact in English law, as its precedents serve to provide a definition of obscenity that is used in other legal contexts. For instance, anything deemed likely to contravene the <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> prohibited from videos awarded an R18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification. A list of the categories of material most commonly prosecuted under the <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> published by the Crown Prosecution Service.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Transportation Act, {{passed on}} October 15, 1966, {{the same day}} as the National Historic Preservation Act, {{included}} provisions that addressed historic preservation.

5|$|The Svalbard Environmental Protection Act {{was passed}} on 15 June 2001 and took effect on 1 July 2002, {{replacing}} various regulations. The act {{was created to}} secure a continuous, nearly untouched natural environment on Svalbard, particularly regarding wilderness, landscape, flora, fauna and cultural heritage. The <b>act</b> <b>is</b> enacted by the Ministry of the Environment, the Climate and Pollution Agency, the governor, the Directorate for Cultural Heritage and the Directorate for Nature Management. The <b>act</b> <b>is</b> supplemented by various regulations. Specific issues addressed in the act include the protection of plants and all remains of all human activity up to 1945. It imposes limitations on traffic in permitted areas, particularly motorized vehicles, but allows locals to operate snowscooters in more areas than tourists. Two-thirds of Svalbard is protected through national parks and nature reserves.|$|E

50|$|The whole <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> {{repealed}} by section 83(1) of, and Schedule 7 to, the Land Drainage Act 1930, although any Commissioners acting under {{the powers of}} the 1708 <b>Act</b> <b>were</b> deemed to be a properly-constituted drainage board {{under the terms of the}} new <b>Act.</b> There <b>were</b> 49 Commissions of Sewers still operative when the 1930 <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> passed.|$|R
5|$|The act was {{originally}} intended to discourage the handling of stolen property but several courts have judged that the National Stolen Property <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently broad in scope to apply to goods crossing into the United States from a foreign nation, and is therefore applicable {{in the case of}} stolen cultural property.|$|E
5|$|The {{few other}} areas that operate the special {{legislative}} procedures are justice & home affairs, budget and taxation and {{certain aspects of}} other policy areas: such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone. The procedure used also depends upon which type of institutional <b>act</b> <b>is</b> being used. The strongest <b>act</b> <b>is</b> a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve, but they do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding declarations.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislative}} power conferred by section 2(1) of the 1911 <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> not unlimited {{in scope and}} must be read according to established principles of statutory interpretation.|$|E

NCMPs enjoy most of the privileges of ordinary Members of Parliament. They are, however, not allowed to vote on several types of bills such as bills to amend the Constitution and motions of no confidence in the Government. An election candidate who has been offered an NCMP seat may decline to take it up.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} <b>act</b> <b>is</b> inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they are young and healthy.|$|E

50|$|Griffith CJ {{held that}} the entire <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> valid and so upheld the {{validity}} of the award. His Honour however agreed with Barton J that the <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> not severable and that if the enforcement powers were invalid, as found by the majority, then the entire <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> invalid.|$|R
5000|$|The initial <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> {{accepted}} by the House of Representatives, but opposed in the senate by one senator who claimed that the <b>Act</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "unworthy of the age in which they live". This opposition caused the <b>Act</b> to <b>be</b> rewritten and re-submitted for consideration. The <b>act</b> <b>was</b> then rewritten, and it was passed in both the House and Senate in the year 1883.|$|R
5|$|A reptile {{becomes the}} {{official}} state symbol {{after it is}} voted in by the state legislature. Although many states require the bill to be signed by the governor, in some the enabling <b>act</b> <b>is</b> a resolution (legislature vote only). In 2004, Illinois held a popular vote to pick the painted turtle, but legislation was still required in 2005 to make the choice official.|$|E
5|$|A {{third major}} {{criticism}} of the <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> that it was poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure of leadership and confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing {{to the collapse of}} almost all industry codes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the case}} has not been {{formally}} overruled, two Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s have undone its effect by ruling that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for a federal common law cause of action for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine of aboriginal title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse <b>Act</b> <b>is</b> no longer good law. Modern federal courts hold that only Congress can ratify a conveyance of aboriginal title, and only with a clear statement, rather than implicitly.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> {{rejected}} by the House of Lords, {{and so it was}} passed with the authority of only the House of Commons, under the provisions of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. The Parliament <b>Acts</b> <b>are</b> rarely invoked: the War Crimes <b>Act</b> <b>was</b> only the fourth statute since 1911 enacted under their provisions, and the first since the Parliament Act 1949.

5|$|Development in Canberra {{has been}} closely {{regulated}} by government, both through planning processes {{and the use}} of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. Land in the <b>ACT</b> <b>is</b> held on 99-year crown leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government. There have been persistent calls for constraints on development to be liberalised.|$|E
