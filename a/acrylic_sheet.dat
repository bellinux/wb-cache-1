Masonite was used in place of sheet metal to line the cab interior, and <b>acrylic</b> <b>sheet</b> was used in place of glass on some of the cab windows.|$|E
2500|$|The reptile {{house or}} the serpentarium is built, {{at the cost of}} [...] 0.4 million, in a twining snake-like model with {{entrance}} and exit points in the snake's mouth and tail, respectively. The house was opened to public in the year 1989 and has 24 enclosures exhibiting 4 species of poisonous and 10 species of non-poisonous snakes. It contains a total of 104 snakes, including 41 Indian pythons, 21 Burmese pythons and four cobras. The park has initiated controlled breeding programme for Indian rock python. Each vivarium has been renovated by changing substratum and providing perch and hide outs. The top of the opening in RCC roof is closed with transparent <b>acrylic</b> <b>sheet</b> to avoid rain and the walled enclosure enables the snake to exhibit all natural behaviours. The king cobra is scientifically kept and maintained in constant temperature by providing air conditioning and hot spot.|$|E

The edges of the <b>acrylic</b> <b>sheet</b> are illuminated by infrared LEDs, and infrared cameras are focused {{on the back of the}} sheet.

When the sheet is touched by the user the deformation results in leakage of infrared light, which peaks at the points of maximum pressure indicating the user's touch location. Microsoft's PixelSense tables use this technology.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} response surface method (RSM) and neural network to study surface roughness for laser beam cutting on <b>acrylic</b> <b>sheets.</b> Box-Behnken design based on response surface method and multilayer perceptions neural network were used to predict the effect of laser cutting parameters. These parameters include power requirement, cutting speed and tips distance on surface roughness during the machining of <b>acrylic</b> <b>sheets.</b> It is {{found out that the}} predictive models are able to predict the longitudinal component of the surface roughness close to those readings recorded experimentally with a 95 % confident interval. The result obtained from the predictive model was also compared using multilayer perceptions with back–propagation learning rule artificial neural network. The first order equation revealed that power requirement was the dominant factor which was followed by tip distance, and cutting speed. The cutting parameter predicted by using neural network was in good agreement with that obtained by RSM. This observation indicates the potential of using response surface method in predicting cutting parameters thus eliminating the need for exhaustive cutting experiments to obtain the optimum cutting condition to enhance the surface roughness...|$|R

50|$|Some {{types of}} acrylic glass {{can have the}} high light {{transmission}} and optical quality of glass. Acrylic is also light weight, compared to glass, and is shatter-resistant, making acrylic an attractive choice for framing large, oversized works of art. In general, <b>acrylic</b> <b>sheet</b> scratches easily and retains a static charge, which can be problematic when framing pastels or charcoals. Some manufacturers, add dyes to acrylic glass to filter the UV light transmittance, and its surface can also be treated with both anti-static and anti-reflective coatings.|$|E

Some of the sheets weighed over one tonne. Because of the refraction caused by light traveling through water, and the <b>acrylic</b> <b>sheets</b> used {{in the creation of the}} tunnel, the fish appear to be one third smaller than they are.|$|R

Using acrylics, she paints mostly in reverse {{on the back of}} 2 to 5 conservation grade <b>acrylic</b> <b>sheets.</b> The images then show through the front. Some of the surfaces are then scraped, burnt, scored, or sanded, depending on the effect needed. When assembled with space between, all sheets are visible from the front. This gives the viewer the opportunity to look into the piece, like into the looking glass. Most of her subjects depict ice or water. The result is engaging and different.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for {{the measurement of}} thickness of dielectric material using microwave. The measurements are carried out for the dielectric backed by metal reflector. The reflection coefficients at X-band frequencies are measured using a focussed microwave system so that a plane wave approximation can be applied. The results are presented for seven different samples of <b>acrylic</b> <b>sheets</b> backed by metal reflector. It is found that the microwave measurement done at a single frequency generates a number of solutions for the thickness. Hence measurements {{must be carried out}} at more than one frequency to get the correct answer for the thickness of the dielectric...|$|R
50|$|These {{types of}} unit are principally {{fabricated}} from printed corrugated board, <b>acrylic,</b> <b>sheet</b> metal, steel wire, vacuum formed plastic and wood or indeed {{a combination of}} more than one of these materials. Choice of material is often dictated by the length of time the display unit will be in store. Printed corrugated board is more suited to short-term promotional CDU's due to its relatively low cost and durability of the material, whereas acrylic, metal, wood, etc. are more suitable for longer-term CDU's due to greater durability of those materials.|$|E

A more {{expensive}} scratch-resistant or AR (abrasion-resistant) acrylic is also sometimes used for rugged use and touring applications. While plastic drum screens perform fairly well as sound barriers, they reflect most sound that impacts them and so very little sound is actually absorbed. Therefore, it is usually recommended that some type of acoustic absorption product, such as acoustic foam, heavy curtains, acoustic panels, or absorption baffles be used on {{a significant percentage of}} the screen surface and opposite the screen in order to soak up and dissipate as much of the direct and reflected sound energy as possible.|$|E
50|$|Lila Katzen was {{discouraged}} from continuing {{her study of}} sculpture by her professor at Cooper Union, who {{told her that she}} must be a painter because she “wanted things to happen too quickly” Katzen’s paintings were abstract, semi-figurative works, in which she took certain aspects from the figure and related them to a spatial concept. As she developed her skills in painting, Katzen began to look for a challenge by experimenting with different, more sculptural kinds of painting. She progressed from collages on canvas, to staining nylon canvases. Eventually, feeling restricted by even the semi-transparent nylon, Katzen started to paint on <b>acrylic</b> <b>sheets</b> in the late 1950s.|$|R
25|$|Pairs of <b>acrylic</b> <b>sheets</b> with a {{layer of}} microreplicated prisms between the sheets can have {{reflective}} and refractive properties that let them redirect part of incoming sunlight in dependence on its angle of incidence. Such panels act as miniature light shelves. Such panels have been commercialized for purposes of daylighting, {{to be used as a}} window or a canopy such that sunlight descending from the sky is directed to the ceiling or into the room rather than to the floor. This can lead to a higher illumination of the back part of a room, in particular when combined with a white ceiling, while having a slight impact on the view to the outside compared to normal glazing.|$|R
