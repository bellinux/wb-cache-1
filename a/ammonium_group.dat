40|$|To obtain {{polymers}} {{with improved}} hemocompatibility properties, commercial ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymers (EVAL) were chemically modified, by {{the introduction of}} stearoyl groups to bind albumin and quaternary <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups</b> to bind heparin. These novel polymer composites were characterized by FT-IR and H- 1 -NMR spectroscopy. The amount of heparin and albumin bonded by these polymers were determined and the influence of the adsorption sequence (heparin + albumin or vice versa) was evaluated. The amount of adsorbed albumin was proportional to the stearoyl content of the polymer. When heparin was exposed to polymer surfaces containing quaternary <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups,</b> the amount of bonded heparin was proportional to the content of positively charged groups. An in vitro evaluation of the anti-clotting properties and of the adhesion characteristics of the polymer surfaces containing both stearoyl <b>groups</b> and quaternary <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups</b> exhibited, after heparinization, good anticoagulant activity.

40|$|A {{variety of}} drugs inhibit {{biological}} key processes by binding to a speci®c RNA component. We focus {{here on the}} well-analysed hammer-head ribozyme RNA that is inhibited by aminoglycoside antibiotics, a process considered as a paradigm for studying drug/RNA interactions. With insight gained from molecular dynamics simulations of the ribo-zyme {{in the presence of}} Mg 2 identi®ed by crystallography and of ami-noglycosides in solution, a general model for aminoglycoside binding to RNA is proposed. A striking structurally based complementarity between the charged <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups</b> of the aminoglycosides and the metal binding sites in the hammerhead was uncovered. Despite dynamical ¯exibility of the aminoglycosides, several of the intramolecular distances between the charged <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups</b> of the drugs were found to be rather constant. Intramolecular ammonium distances of the aminoglyco-sides span ranges similar to the interionic distances between Mg 2 in the hammerhead. Successful docking of aminoglycosides to the hammerhead ribozyme could be achieved by positioning the <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups</b> at the sites occupied by Mg 2. The covalently linked <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups</b> of the aminoglycosides are thus able to complement in space the negative elec-trostatic potential created by a three-dimensional RNA fold. Conse-quently, it is suggested that aminoglycoside-derived sugars could constitute a basic set of yardstick synthons ideal for rational and combi-natorial synthesis of drugs targeted at biologically relevant RNA folds...|$|R
40|$|Halide-anion binding to 1, 12 -dodecanediammonium, tetramethyl- 1, 12 -dodecanediammmonium, and tetramethyl- 1, 7 -heptanediammonium {{has been}} {{investigated}} with infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy in the 1000 - 2250 cm(- 1) spectral region and with theory. Both charged <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups</b> in these diammonium compounds interact with the halide anion resulting in an ionic hydrogen bond (IHB) stretching frequency outside of the spectral frequency range that can be measured with the free-electron laser (FEL). This frequency is shifted into the spectral range upon exchanging all of the labile hydrogen atoms with deuterium atoms, thus making measurement of the ionic deuterium bond (IDB) stretching frequency possible. The IDB stretching frequency shifts to higher values with increasing halide-anion size, methylation of the <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups,</b> and alkane chain length, consistent with the halide-anion-deuterium bond strength decreasing with decreasing gas-phase basicity of the halide anion and the increasing gas-phase basicity of the <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups.</b> The IDB stretching frequency also depends on the alkane chain length owing to constraints on {{the angle of the}} bonds between the halide anion and the two <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups.</b> There are additional bands in the IDB stretching feature in the IRMPD spectra, which are attributed to Fermi resonances and arise from coupling with overtone or combination bands that can be identified from theory and depend on the halide-anion identity and alkane chain length...|$|R

40|$|Phospholipase C (heat-labile hemolysin) was {{purified}} from Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture supernatants to near homogeneity by {{ammonium sulfate}} precipitation {{followed by a}} novel application of DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. Enzymatic activity remained associated with DEAE-Sephacel even {{in the presence of}} 1 M NaCl, but was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 5 % tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide. Elution from DEAE-Sephacel was also obtained with 2 % lysophosphatidylcholine, {{and to a lesser extent}} with 2 % phosphorylcholine, but not at all with choline. The enzyme was highly active toward phospholipids possessing substituted <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups</b> (e. g., phosphatidycholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin); however, it had little if any activity toward phospholipids lacking substituted <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups</b> (e. g., phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphaditylglycerol). Collectively, these data suggest that phospholipase C from P. aeruginosa exhibits high affinity for substituted <b>ammonium</b> <b>groups,</b> but requires an additional hydrophobic moiety for optimum binding. The specific activity of the purified enzyme preparation increased 1, 900 -fold compared with that of culture supernatants. The molecular weight of the phospholipase C was estimated to be 78, 000 by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Sephacryl S- 200 column chromatography and was 76, 000 by high-performance size exclusion chromatography.

50|$|In the Hofmann elimination, {{the least}} {{substituted}} alkene is typically favored due to intramolecular steric interactions.

It also favors the formation of the Hofmann product, and for the same reasons.|$|E
