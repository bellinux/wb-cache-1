50|$|To collocate {{measurements}} of a medium- to long-lived <b>atmospheric</b> <b>tracer</b> {{with a second}} instrument, running trajectories can considerably improve the accuracy. It also simplifies the analysis somewhat: a trajectory is run both forwards and backwards from the measurement location and between the desired time window. Note that the acceptable time window has now become longer because the error from transport induced changes in the tracer is removed: the tracer lifetime {{would be a good}} window to use. Since the trajectories provide a location for every point in time within the time window, {{there is no need to}} check multiple measurements from the second instrument. Every time within the trajectory is checked for the distance criterion but within a very narrow window. Alternatively, the exact times of the measurements for the second instrument are interpolated within the trajectory.

Variance-covariance matrices, from model calibration and calculation of sensitivities, were used to generate parameter sets that account for parameter correlation and uncertainty. Constraining parameter sets to those that met acceptance criteria, which included a standard error criterion, {{did not appear to}} bias model results. Although the addition of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>tracer</b> observations and prior information produced similar changes in the extent of predicted recharge areas, prior information had the effect of increasing probabilities within the recharge area {{to a greater extent than}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>tracer</b> observations. Uncertainty in the recharge area propagates into predictions that directly affect water quality, such as land cover in the recharge area associated with a well and the residence time associated with the well. Assessments of well vulnerability that depend on these factors should include an assessment of model parameter uncertainty. A formal simulation of parameter uncertainty can be used to delineate probabilistic recharge areas, and the results can be expressed in ways that can be useful to water-resource managers. Although no one model is the correct model, the results of multiple models can be evaluated in terms of the decision being made and the probability of a given outcome from each model...|$|E

The lack of such measurements taken automatically on a routine basis in southwestern European regions, specifically in Portugal, motivated the effort for its installation and constitutes a major driving force for the present work. For continuous NO 2 monitoring the 425 – 455 nm spectral range is investigated. For O 3 retrieval the spectral interval 320 – 340 nm is chosen. The measurements are in good agreement with the photochemical theory of NO 2 (O 3), showing maximum values during the summer (spring) and minimum values during the winter (autumn) seasons. Moreover, the application of sophisticated inversion schemes to the output of the DOAS program, using the Air Mass Factor (AMF) matrix as the kernel of the inversion algorithm, allowed for the determination of the vertical distribution of NO 2 and O 3 atmospheric compounds.

Both approaches do not disturb the prevailing environmental and physical conditions nor the existing biogenic processes. An analytical solution to the advection-diffusion equation was used to back-calculate the source strength from the downwind concentration measurements of (i) single and multipoint (4 and 16 points) trace gas (sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) and methane (CH 4)) release experiments conducted over microplots over an open field, and (ii) single point source SF 6 release experiments conducted over a forested terrain. Best predictions of the source strength (to within +/- 20 %) were obtained from concentration observations made along the centreline of the diffusing plumes with the predictions improving when observations at the mean plume height were used. The diffusion model was then used to compute footprint estimates for neutral and unstable conditions, for tower and aircraft based observation platforms above the forest. They showed spatially constrained footprints in the surface layer, due to effective vertical coupling, so that observations from towers and low flying aircraft must {{be expected to be}} very site specific, and scaling up to larger areas will have to be done with careful consideration of surface mosaics. Above-canopy sampling of trace gases to determine volatile organic compound emissions were then interpreted in terms of footprint considerations. This was accomplished by defining the upwind canopy areas effectively sampled under the given wind and stability conditions.

The model was also applied in efforts to study the evolution of volcanic clouds in the Earth's stratosphere. In particular this was used to model the dispersion of sulfuric acid particles in the atmosphere. A brief study of the application of the tidal theory to the planet Jupiter has been undertaken. The goal of the study is to deduce the source of the tidal dissipation which is thought to have led to the orbital resonances amongst the Galilean satellites and considerable heating of the interiors of Io, Europa, and Ganymede...|$|R
40|$|Thanks {{to the new}} {{satellite}} technology, we have global {{scenes of}} the dynamical and chemical processes of the atmospheric compounds. Ground-based equipments have {{to be used for}} the validation of the satellite retrievals, particularly when there are clouds in the observed pixels. The SPATRAM (SPectrometer for <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>TRacers</b> and Aerosol Measurement) is a UV-Vis spectrometer allowing for the measurements of spectral sky radiance along the zenith direction, in its standard configuration. This equipment is installed at the CGE observatory at Évora, in south of Portugal. The application of Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy methodology to the measured raw data, allows for the retrieval of the total column content of several traces gases. The mid-latitudes atmosphere is a complex region of our planet, where air masses coming from lower and higher latitudes meet, essentially, to balance the temperature gradient. The study {{of the relationship between the}} Polar Regions and the mid-latitudes is well developed nowadays, due to the polar ozone loss. On the other hand the interaction between tropics and mid-latitude regions still remains insufficiently understood. Stratospheric ozone is continuously subordinated to chemical processes of creation and destruction by chemically active compounds as chlorofluorocarbons, and also from othe...|$|R
