50|$|Crown Princess until November 2012 was sailing the Mediterranean. In November 2012 {{the ship}} sailed to Galveston, Texas {{for the first}} time; marking the return of Princess to Galveston, where she sailed 7-Day western Caribbean cruises. In April 2013 she sailed to Southampton, where she sailed to {{northern}} Europe/the Mediterranean & the Canary Islands. Following that stint, Crown Princess will returned to the United States to Fort Lauderdale, Florida sailing alternating 7-Day eastern/southern Caribbean cruises to February 2014. On January 18, 2013 {{it was announced that}} Crown Princess will sail around South America. During that cruise Princess Cruises marked the first ever call in Ilhabela, Brazil. The southern Caribbean cruises from February 15, 2014 through April 26, 2014 were cancelled to allow for the South America cruise. Passengers who booked the cancelled voyages were notified and were assisted with finding <b>alternate</b> <b>cruise</b> options. After the South America cruise, she has been sailing to Mexico, Hawaii, and Pacific coastal cruises from Los Angeles, as well as Northbound and Southbound cruises from Vancouver and Whittier or Roundtrip Alaskan cruises from Seattle replacing the Sapphire Princess.|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of the propfan {{relative to the}} turbofan is summarized, using the Douglas DC- 9 Super 80 (DS- 8000) as the actual operational base aircraft. The 155 passenger economy class aircraft (31, 775 lb 14, 413 kg payload), cruise Mach at 0. 80 at 31, 000 ft (8, 450 m) initial altitude, and an operational capability in 1985 was considered. Three propfan arrangements, wing mounted, conventional horizontal tail aft mounted, and aft fuselage pylon mounted are selected for comparison with the DC- 9 Super 80 P&WA JT 8 D- 209 turbofan powered aircraft. The configuration feasibility, aerodynamics, propulsion, structural loads, structural dynamics, sonic fatigue, acoustics, weight maintainability, performance, rough order of magnitude economics, and airline coordination are examined. The effects of <b>alternate</b> <b>cruise</b> Mach number, mission stage lengths, and propfan design characteristics are considered. Recommendations for further study, ground testing, and flight testing are included...|$|E
50|$|During summer months, Coral Princesss main {{itinerary}} {{consists of}} 7-day Alaskan cruises from Vancouver, Canada to Whittier, Alaska, USA. During fall, winter and spring, the Coral Princess runs 11-day Panama Canal partial-transit cruises with stops in Cartagena, Colombia, Colon, Panama, either Ocho Rios, Jamaica or Grand Cayman (<b>alternating</b> <b>cruises),</b> Limon, Costa Rica and Oranjestad, Aruba, with Fort Lauderdale, Florida as its turnaround port.|$|R
5000|$|Since March 2013, Carnival Miracle {{sailed through}} the Panama Canal {{repositioning}} to the West Coast sailing <b>alternating</b> <b>cruises</b> from Long Beach, California & Seattle, Washington [...] Currently, she sails from Long Beach to Hawaii and Mexican Riviera. Since October 2014, the Miracle {{is based in}} Long Beach year round. Carnival Legend replaced the Miracle in its summertime Alaska cruises in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Although the Korean War {{was at an}} end, Twining {{continued}} to <b>alternate</b> <b>cruises</b> in the Far East with operations {{on the west coast}} until June 1963 when she returned to San Diego from exercises with the British, New Zealand, and Australian navies. In May 1964, the destroyer was transferred from Destroyer Squadron 5 to Reserve Destroyer Squadron 27 and began conducting training cruises for reserves.|$|R
50|$|On 13 November, Ossipee {{left for}} Gibraltar with another convoy {{acting as the}} ocean escort, and arrived at her {{destination}} on 27 November. She continued to make <b>alternate</b> <b>cruises</b> from Gibraltar to British waters and from British ports to Gibraltar until the war came to an end. There were two exceptions, however, when she was the ocean escort for convoys between Gibraltar and Bizerte, Tunisia.|$|R
50|$|During the {{following}} nine years, Vogelgesang continue her schedule of <b>alternating</b> Mediterranean <b>cruises</b> and Sixth Fleet operations.|$|R
50|$|Telfairs new seven-year {{lease on}} life took her to new oceans and new ports of call for, {{immediately}} following training off San Diego, she headed for duty with the Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet. She transited the Panama Canal on 1 February 1962, and arrived in her new home port, Norfolk, Virginia, on 6 February. From then until final decommissioning in 1968, she <b>alternated</b> <b>cruises</b> to the Mediterranean as {{a unit of the}} 6th Fleet with operations in the western Atlantic as a unit of the 2nd Fleet.|$|R
50|$|The {{destroyer}} continued {{this pattern}} {{of operations for the}} years that followed. In June-July 1949 Holder took part in a Midshipman training cruise to northern Europe and upon her return moved her home port from Newport to Norfolk. Her classification was changed to DDE-819 on 4 March 1950, but she continued to <b>alternate</b> <b>cruises</b> to Europe and the Mediterranean with periods of training and upkeep out of Norfolk and the Caribbean. When the Suez Crisis flared in the Middle East over Egypt's seizure of the Suez Canal in 1956, Holder steamed to join the 6th Fleet in operations. Again in 1958 Holder sailed to the Mediterranean in March and in July took part in the landings at Beirut, Lebanon.|$|R
25|$|Diablo {{arrived at}} Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia, {{her new home}} port, on 5 June 1949, and participated in Operation Convex in 1951, and <b>alternated</b> {{training}} <b>cruises</b> with duty at the Sonar School at Key West. Her homeport became New London in 1952 and she arrived there 17 September to provide training facilities for the Submarine School.|$|R
25|$|From late 1953 to late 1959 Kidd <b>alternated</b> West Pacific <b>cruises</b> with {{operations}} on the West Coast making stops at Pearl Harbor and various ports in Japan, Okinawa, Hong Kong, and the Philippines.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship has}} been <b>alternating</b> fall/winter <b>cruises</b> along the Mexican Riviera and summer in Alaska. In fall 2011 she visited Hawaii {{for the first}} time. However, after January 2012 Holland America dropped Mexicos west coast, {{in part due to}} safety {{concerns}} there in connection to the Mexican Drug War and in part due to the depressed cruise market in Southern California; the Oosterdam will shift to Hawaii, Australia, and the South Pacific.|$|R
50|$|The climb phase, {{also known}} as climb out, of a typical flight of an {{aircraft}} is the period during which the aircraft climbs to a predetermined cruising altitude after take-off. The climb phase immediately follows take-off and precedes the cruise phase of the flight. Although a single climb phase is typical, multiple climb phases may <b>alternate</b> with <b>cruise</b> phases, particularly for very long flights in which altitude is increased as the weight of fuel aboard decreases (see step climb).|$|R
5000|$|In November 2016 the Norwegian Epic {{returned}} to the Caribbean, this time based out of Port Canaveral (Orlando), mostly with 7 days <b>cruises</b> <b>alternating</b> between the eastern and western Caribbean. Then Barcelona for April to November 2017, and back to Port Canaveral for winter 2017/18.|$|R
50|$|On 8 February 1973, {{she entered}} port at Subic Bay and, on the 16th, sailed for Yokosuka, Japan, en route {{back to the}} United States. Following stops there and at Pearl Harbor, Suribachi re-transited the Panama Canal in mid-March and rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. After {{returning}} to the east coast, Suribachi resumed her old schedule of operations in the western Atlantic-Caribbean area <b>alternating</b> with <b>cruises</b> with the 6th Fleet. She made one Mediterranean deployment, from January to June 1974, and was operating with the 2nd Fleet as of March 1975.|$|R
50|$|Local {{operations}} off the Virginia Capes <b>alternated</b> {{with two}} <b>cruises</b> to Key West, Florida, and Havana, Cuba, and United States Marine Corps amphibious {{exercises in the}} Caribbean until 17 June 1955, when she steamed to the Azores; Lisbon, Portugal; and Cádiz, Spain on a midshipman cruise, returning to Norfolk on 15 July 1955.|$|R
50|$|After post-deployment standdown, Vogelgesang resumed her {{schedule}} <b>alternating</b> Mediterranean <b>cruises</b> with operations out of Norfolk. She {{spent the first}} 10 months of 1967 engaged in training operations along the east coast and in the West Indies. On 14 November 1967, the warship stood out of Norfolk for her first tour of duty with the Sixth Fleet since 1965. On 24 November, she conducted turnover ceremonies at the Spanish island of Majorca and officially joined the Sixth Fleet. For the next five months, the destroyer ranged the length and breadth of the Mediterranean, conducting training evolutions and making port visits. On 13 April 1968, she departed Málaga, Spain, to return to Norfolk.|$|R
50|$|After {{almost six}} years of {{inactivity}} in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Shasta was recommissioned on 15 July 1953. Under the command of Capt. Peter M. Gaviglio, she departed San Diego on 26 November 1953 and joined the Atlantic Service Fleet at Norfolk on 12 November. At the completion of modernization overhaul at Norfolk and underway replenishment training off Newport, R.I., Shasta sailed on 7 January for her first Mediterranean deployment. For the next eleven years, she <b>alternated</b> between <b>cruises</b> with the 6th Fleet and Atlantic seaboard operations. She provided ammunition supply support to the 6th Fleet during the Jordanian crisis of May 1957 and the Lebanese crisis of August 1958.|$|R
50|$|As the {{aircraft}} fuselage and control surfaces will also add drag and possibly some lift, {{it is fair}} to consider the L/D of {{the aircraft}} as a whole. As it turns out, the glide ratio, which is the ratio of an (unpowered) aircraft's forward motion to its descent, is (when flown at constant speed) numerically equal to the aircraft's L/D. This is especially of interest in the design and operation of high performance sailplanes, which can have glide ratios approaching 60 to 1 (60 units of distance forward for each unit of descent) in the best cases, but with 30:1 being considered good performance for general recreational use. Achieving a glider's best L/D in practice requires precise control of airspeed and smooth and restrained operation of the controls to reduce drag from deflected control surfaces. In zero wind conditions, L/D will equal distance traveled divided by altitude lost. Achieving the maximum distance for altitude lost in wind conditions requires further modification of the best airspeed, as does <b>alternating</b> <b>cruising</b> and thermaling. To achieve high speed across country, glider pilots anticipating strong thermals often load their gliders (sailplanes) with water ballast: the increased wing loading means optimum glide ratio at higher airspeed, but at the cost of climbing more slowly in thermals. As noted below, the maximum L/D is not dependent on weight or wing loading, but with higher wing loading the maximum L/D occurs at a faster airspeed. Also, the faster airspeed means the aircraft will fly at higher Reynolds number and this will usually bring about a lower zero-lift drag coefficient.|$|R
5000|$|In {{company with}} Destroyer Division 221, Henley {{departed}} Norfolk on 25 September 1953 {{for a world}} cruise which was to take her 44,000 miles in 218 days. During this period, Henley sailed through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, participated in the filming of [...] "The Bridges of Toko-Ri" [...] off the Korean and Japanese coasts, operated with the 7th Fleet in Asian waters, {{and returned to the}} States via the Panama Canal and the Caribbean. Following years fell into a pattern for Henley as she <b>alternated</b> Mediterranean <b>cruises</b> with anti-submarine warfare and other tactical exercises off the East Coast and in the Caribbean. In 1959 she joined Task Force 47 for the Inland Seas Cruise to the Great Lakes through the newly completed St. Lawrence Seaway. Nearly 75,000 mid-westerners visited this representative of the [...] "salt-water navy" [...] in her two-month cruise.|$|R
50|$|Truxtun {{served with}} the Asiatic Fleet for the next 10 years. During that decade, she <b>alternated</b> summer <b>cruises</b> in Chinese waters with winter {{maneuvers}} in the Philippines. This routine was punctuated by special unusual assignments. For instance, in June 1924, she and the other five destroyers of Division 43 helped to form a chain of picket ships across the Yellow Sea for the Army's global flight. More often, however, internecine warfare in China brought Truxtun to the coast of that troubled nation to protect American lives and property. She spent a total of eight out of the 13 months between September 1926 and October 1927 patrolling the Yangtze River while competing factions in China fought one another - and occasionally otherwise neutral third parties. The destroyer returned to the Yangtze River Patrol twice more - from 1 March to 14 April 1930 and from January through March 1932 - when internal political convulsions in China threatened foreign lives and property.|$|R
50|$|After {{shakedown}} {{along the}} West Coast, Gurke sailed for the Western Pacific on 27 August 1945, reaching Pearl Harbor on 2 September. From there she continued west {{to participate in}} the occupation of Japan and former Japanese possessions. Returning to her home port, San Diego, California, in February 1946, Gurke participated in training operations until 4 September 1947 when she sailed for another WesPac cruise. Two further WesPac <b>cruises,</b> <b>alternating</b> with operations out of San Diego and a cruise to Alaska in 1948 to aid in the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Yukon gold rush, filled Gurkes schedule until the outbreak of the Korean War.|$|R
25|$|In 1959, {{she shifted}} homeport to Mayport, Florida, and {{continued}} to pursue the same duties. At the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in 1960, she underwent a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul which improved her radar and sonar capabilities in anti-aircraft and anti-submarine warfare. In 1961, the Charleston Naval Shipyard installed a new variable-depth sonar, adding to Turners submarine detection equipment. Into the 1960s, she <b>alternated</b> frequent Mediterranean <b>cruises</b> with routine Atlantic training exercises, Atlantic picket duty, and special assignments. In 1960, she joined Task Force 140, the Project Mercury Recovery Force; and, in 1964, she added a Red Sea and Persian Gulf deployment to a Mediterranean voyage. In November and December of that year, she remained on station in the Caribbean {{in support of the}} Gemini II space shot.|$|R
50|$|After shakedown, Henry W. Tucker was {{converted}} to a radar picket destroyer and participated in radar and antiaircraft exercises off the Maine coast until sailing for Pearl Harbor 4 November. From the Hawaiian islands she continued to Yokosuka, arriving 22 December, {{to aid in the}} occupation of Japan and repatriation of Japanese nationals. Her first tour of duty in the Far East ended 25 March 1946 as she set course for her new homeport, San Diego. In the next 3 years Henry W. Tucker made two more such <b>cruises,</b> <b>alternating</b> them with tactical exercises and operations along the east coast. In March and April 1948 the destroyer patrolled off Eniwetok in connection with United States atomic tests in the Pacific islands. She was reclassified DDR-875 18 March 1949.|$|R

5|$|After the war, Hiei <b>alternated</b> her {{training}} <b>cruises</b> with Kongō, making the 1897 cruise to the West Coast of North America and Hawaii from 13 April to 20 September and {{repeating the same}} cruise from 14 December 1898 to 28 August 1899. During that cruise, on 21 March 1898, the ship was re-designated as a 3rd-class coast defense ship, although she retained {{her training}} duties. Both ships made the 1902 cruise, their last, to Manila and Australia from 19 February to 25 August. Hiei played a minor role in the Russo-Japanese War before she was reclassified as a survey ship in 1906. Hiei was stricken from the Navy List on 1 April 1911 and ordered to be sold on 21 December. The exact date of her sale is not known, although Maizuru Naval District reported her sale on 25 March 1912.|$|R
50|$|From 1959 through 1968 Leader <b>alternated</b> six WestPac <b>cruises</b> with U.S. West Coast {{mine warfare}} and mine {{countermeasure}} exercises. During her 1961 cruise. Leader {{became the first}} warship ever to visit the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh when she completed the 180-mile transit up the Mekong River on 27 August, {{under the command of}} Lt. Commander Frank Kauzlarich. On this same cruise she directed South Vietnamese units in minesweep training operations. During her tour with the U.S. 7th Fleet in 1965, Leader again operated off South Vietnam, this time under more serious circumstances. From June to August she performed special minesweeping operations and {{played a major role in}} the expanded American effort to assist the courageous people of Vietnam in their fight against Communist aggressors. Her tour completed, Leader returned to Long Beach 14 December to resume training operations.|$|R
50|$|The {{radar picket}} destroyer's peacetime duty then {{fell into a}} pattern of six-month WestPac <b>cruises</b> <b>alternating</b> with upkeep and {{training}} out of San Diego. Operating with the 7th Fleet on her WestPac cruises, Higbee visited Australian and South Pacific ports frequently as well as engaging in fleet maneuvers with units of SEATO navies. Her home port was changed to Yokosuka, Japan, on 21 May 1960. From there Higbee continued to cruise in the Pacific and along the China coast to strengthen American force in Asia. After two years duty in Japan, Higbee returned to her new home port, San Francisco, on 4 September 1962. On 1 April 1963 the destroyer entered the shipyard there for a fleet rehabilitation and modernization (FRAM) overhaul designed to improve her fighting capabilities and lengthen her life span as {{an active member of}} the fleet. Higbee was redesignated DD-806 on 1 June 1963.|$|R
25|$|Shangri-La recommissioned on 10 May 1951, Captain Francis L. Busey in command. For {{the next}} year, she {{conducted}} training and readiness operations out of Boston, Massachusetts. Reclassified {{as an attack}} carrier (CVA-38) in 1952, she returned to Puget Sound that fall and decommissioned again on 14 November, this time for modernization at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. During the next two years, she received an angled flight deck, twin steam catapults, and her aircraft elevators and arresting gear were overhauled. At a cost of approximately $7 million, she was virtually a new ship when she commissioned {{for the third time}} on 10 January 1955, Captain Roscoe L. Newman commanding; she was the second (after CV-A 36 Antietam)operational US carrier with an angled flight deck. She conducted intensive fleet training for the remainder of 1955, then deployed to the Far East on 5 January 1956. Until 1960, she <b>alternated</b> western Pacific <b>cruises</b> with operations out of San Diego. On 16 March 1960, she put to sea from San Diego en route to her new home port, Mayport, Florida. She entered Mayport after visits to Callao, Peru; Valparaíso, Chile; Port of Spain, Trinidad; Bayonne, New Jersey; and Norfolk, Virginia.|$|R
5000|$|Allen M. Sumner {{completed}} her overhaul on 2 January 1962 and resumed her schedule of east coast operations <b>alternated</b> with Mediterranean <b>cruises.</b> Between March and September 1962, she {{served with the}} 6th Fleet. Soon after her return to American waters, President John F. Kennedy declared a [...] "quarantine" [...] of Cuba {{in response to the}} siting of offensive Soviet missiles on that island. Allen M. Sumner {{was one of the first}} warships to take up station off Cuba in October 1962. At the successful conclusion of that operation, she resumed normal duty out of Mayport, Florida. That employment—including frequent duty as school ship for the Fleet Sonar School—continued through 1963 and into 1964. In June and July 1964, the destroyer made a brief deployment to the Mediterranean for a midshipman cruise. Upon her return to the western hemisphere, she resumed normal duty out of Mayport. In the spring of 1965, political unrest in the Dominican Republic took her to the waters around that troubled island. Upon concluding that assignment, the destroyer returned to Mayport and resumed operations out of that port. In October, she embarked upon another deployment in the Mediterranean. After a routine tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the [...] "middle sea," [...] Allen M. Sumner returned to Mayport on 8 March 1966 and began 11 months of operations out of her home port which included duty as a support ship for the Gemini 10 space shot in July.|$|R
