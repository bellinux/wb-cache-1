The model is rooted in popular Data Envelopment Analysis models, but allows for both outlying observations and heterogeneity (i. e., a conditional efficiency model).

Release notes, twiki pages and news’ broadcasts are not efficient enough. The interest of using GGUS as an efficient and effective intra-project communication tool is {{the message to the}} user community presented here. The purpose of GGUS is to bring together End Users and Supporters in the Regions where the Grid is deployed and in operation. Today’s Grid usage is still very far from the simplicity and functionality of the web. While pressing for middleware usability, we try to turn the Global Grid User Support (GGUS) into the central tool for identifying areas in the support environment that need <b>attention.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> this, we exploit GGUS' capacity to expand, by including new Support Units that follow the project's operational structure. Using tailored GGUS database searches we obtain concrete results that prove where we need to improve procedures, Service Level Agreements and deployment methods. These are reliable indicators of the health status of all Grid services. They are also useful to anticipate and plan changes of direction in the required strategy and procedures. It is via regular reporting to the ROCs and the users within the VOs that we show the value of using GGUS. It is also by using user input for GGUS improvement that we try to make this a truly useful tool. The expansion of VOs, sites, users and applications is unavoidable as well as the passage to new middleware releases. This rapidly changing environment leaves holes in the way it tries to pave. Ensuring the necesssary centralised (or coordinated) effort for supporting these candidate areas efficiently, will increase the popularity of the Grid. GGUS contributes in this effort by: offering the users a uniform and simple way to submit problems, using supporters from the Regions on shift as Ticket Process Managers (TPMs) to dispatch problems to the appropriate supporters, addressing all Grid services when a problem is in their area of expertise and responsibility, cross-referencing other web-based tools for monitoring Grid deployment progress, e. g. the savannah trackets for registering bugs and patches, offering documentation links, including FAQs to save supporters' time in reoccurring problems. Publishing escallation reports for the ROCs, TPMs and experts. From Grid users to application developers, a whole chain of people who need information and help is often left frustrated. Solid middleware is, of course, the indispensable basis of any successful operation. Nevertheless, the use of GGUS is in the users' interest because, it is the central point of recording 'evidence', so it helps spotting areas for improvement in the products and the processes. This approach proved useful for VOs and should expand further in usage and functionality...|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} neural {{mechanisms}} supporting working memory (WM) guidance of visual attention, {{focusing on the}} role of the thalamus. Chapter 1 is a review of the relevant literature and sets-up the specific research aims. Chapters 2 and 3 explore the role of the thalamus on guidance of attention by WM contents. Stroke patients with focal-brain lesions performed a WM-guided search task. In valid conditions, the colour of the search target was pre-cued by the WM cue while on neutral conditions there was no cue prior to search. In invalid conditions, the WM cue specified the colour of a search distracter and the target appeared elsewhere. First, it was hypothesized that lesions to the thalamus could lead to deficits in attentional control (e. g. failing to separate irrelevant memory contents with relevant target information and leading to increased capture from WM-like distracters during invalid search conditions). An alternative hypothesis was that the thalamus may support the capture of attention by WM contents, hence thalamic patients would display little bias of attention from the WM contents, despite those contents are being maintained in memory. It was found that patients with focal-thalamic lesions especially in the ventrolateral nucleus, showed no search benefit from the valid cues on search as opposed to a control group of patients with lesions outside the thalamus and non-stroke patients. In the invalid condition, thalamic patients showed no capture by the irrelevant search item that matched the WM cue, whereas a group of healthy age-match controls exhibited the normal effect of capture by irrelevant contents held in WM. These observations suggest that lesions to the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus impair the capture of attention from WM contents. In Chapter 4, I aimed to establish the role of cortical structures that are known to be structurally connected with the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus (i. e. superior frontal gyrus) in WM guidance of <b>attention.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> this, I investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsal frontal cortex in WM guidance of attention under distinct WM loads. I found that despite the effect of WM guidance of attention decreasing as WM load increased, frontal-tDCS modulated WM guidance in these conditions. We suggest that the dorsal frontal cortex forms part of a network alongside the thalamus in supporting WM guidance of attention. Finally, I conducted a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiment (Chapter 5) with healthy volunteers to test the hypothesis that the thalamus plays a role in WM guidance when learning of abstract cue-target feature associations needs to take place for guidance of behaviour to emerge. I used four Japanese ideograms as WM cues, each associated with the colour surrounding the sought after target in the subsequent search display (valid trials). In the neutral condition, four different Japanese ideograms were presented that did not predict the colour of the target. Hence, for WM to guide attention the association between the abstract cue and the colour that surrounded the search target needed to be learned. I found that responses in the thalamus and the frontoparietal cortex displayed sensitivity to the predictiveness of the ideogram cues as WM guidance of attention emerged during learning. The findings reported in this thesis demonstrate the pivotal role of the thalamus in WM guidance of attention. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Human Resource Management in the Faculty of Commerce at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2013 The researcher decided to replicate an existing study by Rahman, Naqvi and Ramay (2008) titled “Measuring Turnover Intention: A Study of IT Professionals in Pakistan”. The study was applied to new situations {{in order to determine}} generalisability to different subjects, age groups, races, locations, cultures or any such variables. The replicated study builds on the original study, by making it relevant today and applying it to a large business within the South African Telecommunications industry. Reducing employee turnover is both strategic and very important in ensuring that an organisation remains profitable. Therefore the main objective {{of this study is to}} analyse and verify whether job satisfaction, organisational commitment and perceived alternative job opportunities are correlated with turnover intention. Employee turnover has become a serious management problem for the participating company due to the financial and moral impact on its degree of competitiveness and sustainability prospects. Today, organisations are finding it difficult to retain employees. Many skilled professionals are leaving, which results in the loss of knowledge systems and discontinuity for the Telecommunications industry. Thus, employee turnover demands management’s <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whatever it can to retain skilled employees. A quantitative research design using a survey was employed in the study. A survey is defined as “a method for gathering information from a sample of individuals” (Scheuren, 2004 : 9). A sample was chosen from a population of employees who are working for the participating company, within the Telecommunications industry. The population is N = 401 (unit of analysis), which is the number of people employed at the participating company, where the researcher is currently employed. The General Job Satisfaction Survey (JDS) developed by Hackman and Oldman (Cook & Rice, 2003 : 37) was used to measure both JS and PAJO. Hypothesis 1 addressed the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intention. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) between job satisfaction and turnover intention was r = 0. 812 with a p-value = 0. 714 *, indicating that the correlation is positive but not significant. The Organisational Commitment Questionnaire (revised) (OCQ) developed by Meyer and Allen (2005 : 73) was used to measure employee commitment. Hypothesis 2 addressed the relationship between organisational commitment and turnover intention. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between organisational commitment and turnover intention was r = 0. 572 with a p-value = 0. 065 *, indicating a positive but not significant correlation. Hypothesis 3 addressed the relationship between perceived alternative job opportunities and turnover intentions. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between perceived alternative employment opportunities and turnover intention was r = 0. 953 with a p-value = 0. 081 *, indicating a positive but not significant correlation. It can be concluded that the correlation between the dependent variable and independent variables in the replicated study was positive but not significant which is consistent with the original study conducted by Rahman et al. (2008). The results reveal that in order for the participating organisation to be competitive in the 21 st century a firm grip needs to be taken on reducing turnover intentions. Even though the correlation between the variables was not significant it supports previous studies that have found a significant correlation between job satisfaction, organisational commitment, perceived alternative job opportunity and its association with turnover intention. The replicated study will be presented to the participating organisation in an attempt to add value. The audience are managing executives and heads of departments, who are people that can make a difference within their respective divisions. When there is buy-in from top management, this will ensure that the need and urgency for retaining critical skills is filtered down to the lower levels. It will benefit the participating organisation that has a philosophy of wanting to continuously improve. It is recommended to the management of the participating company to pursue a retention strategy highlighting commitment and job satisfaction to obtain a committed and satisfied workforce through application of suitable human resource policies. These include training, career planning and advancement opportunities, employee participation and compensation plans to reduce employee turnover intention (Rahman et al., 2008 : 79). By building a company’s business model around job satisfaction, organisational commitment and perceived alternative job opportunities, morale can be increased and commitment can be strengthened. When employees are satisfied they do not have the need to look for work elsewhere, which will contribute to a successful and competitive organisation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{management}} of intellectual capital (IC) as {{a mean of}} generating and sustaining companies' success is increasingly important in today's knowledge-based economy. Previous research which look into large (listed) companies as well as small and medium sized enterprises (SME) generally confirm this. However, relatively {{little is known about}} the actual impact of IC on the performance of German SME which highly differ from other nations' SME. Furthermore, the interaction of IC facets - i. e. human capital (HC), structural capital (SC) and relationship capital (RC) - as well as its comparison among different age segments are still to be explored in the German SME context. Consequently, it is the purpose of this doctoral thesis to report on and discuss the results of an empirical study which investigates German SME's IC as well as the latter's interaction among differently aged firms. Drawing on the theoretical foundations of the resource based view, its outgrowth known as the knowledge based view, IC literature and research on German SME's (sources of) success, a novel conceptual framework with second-order constructs is developed. This new model is validated in a qualitative study with German SME experts as well as German SME and transferred into a higher-order structural equation model (PLS) in order to test relationships as well as to identify key indicators/dimensions which call for management actions. A survey with predominantly hard-fact-orientated questions is distributed among German SME from diverse regions, industry sectors and age classes between end of 2013 and beginning of 2014. Based on about 150 valid responses, interesting insights on German SME¿s IC are gained. Objective: To explore the actual impact of German SME¿ intellectual capital (IC) on their lasting performance. Moreover, this doctoral thesis aims to discover the influence of company age on SME¿ IC and its strength to drive competitive success. Prior work: Previous research generally confirms that IC is an important mean to generate and sustain corporate success. However, the majority of these findings rests on international data and may not be applicable to German SME which differ from other nations' enterprises. Furthermore, it can be noticed that the literature on German SME¿ IC is not precise because it evaluates perceptions instead of real conduct, is based on case studies rather than large empirical data and does not statistically analyze the relation between IC and performance. Besides, there is hardly any literature on young German SME¿ IC and its impact on success. Approach: Drawing on the knowledge-based view, (inter) national IC-literature/-reporting, investigations of German SME¿ (sources of) success and studies on young German firms, a new conceptual framework is developed. This IC-model and its measurement are validated via qualitative interviews with five German SME experts and 16 SME. Subsequently, the framework is transferred into a second-order structural equation model (PLS) in order to test relationships and identify key IC-dimensions which call for management <b>attention.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> so, a questionnaire with hard-fact-orientated questions is distributed among German SME in late 2013 and early 2014. Results: The findings indicate that IC is a driver of German SME¿ performance. More specifically, it is discovered that stakeholder relationships (RC) are the most important element of German SME¿ IC-mix since they directly influence competitive advantages manifested in above-average performances. Moreover, it is noted that the force, with which RC impacts lasting competitive business performance, increases when RC interacts with HC. This implies that intangible resources related to organizational members (HC) are the origin of IC. Likewise, it is shown that HC only influences success in an indirect manner via RC. Furthermore, the results imply that internal, structural matters deserve attention because the IC-category SC drives competitive performance in both models, too. More to it, it can be seen that SC is independent of HC and RC. Lastly, this doctoral thesis points to the fact that six IC-dimensions are of particular importance: employees¿ attitude (HC), employees' intellectual agility (HC), organizational capital (SC), technological capital (SC), supplier relationships (RC), and informal network relationships (RC). Paying attention to these six issues is shown to positively drive the respective IC-category which, in turn, influence above-average corporate performance. Implications: This research is intended to improve German SME¿ performance by pointing to relevant IC-based success drivers. Additionally, the findings are expected to inspire future research on individual aspects of German SME¿ IC ¿ potentially in differing industries and age segments. Lastly, the result may guild policy-makers in advancing their IC reporting guidelines. Values: Since the doctoral thesis is the first to look into the real impact of IC on German SME¿ performance, it contributes to validating prior findings. Furthermore, the tested model is not only aimed at German SME in general, but especially enlarged to include IC-aspect of young firms. Thus, it extends former research and helps to better understand the development of IC along a company¿s life cycle. Administración y Dirección de Empresa...|$|E
