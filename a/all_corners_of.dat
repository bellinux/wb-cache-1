With <b>all</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a tetrahedra shared, the silicon:oxygen ratio becomes 1:2. Examples are quartz, the feldspars, feldspathoids, and the zeolites. Framework silicates tend to be particularly chemically stable {{as a result of}} strong covalent bonds.|$|E
25|$|The {{grandeur}} of Persepolis {{is in its}} architectural details, its impressive, tall, and upright columns, in its skilfully crafted reliefs depicting {{people from all walks}} of life, and from <b>all</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the empire, and most importantly in its historical importance as both a political and a social center of Achaemenid royal life.|$|E
50|$|Modifications of the Klee-Minty {{construction}} showed similar {{exponential time}} complexity for other pivoting rules of simplex type, which maintain primal feasibility, such as Bland's rule. Another modification {{showed that the}} criss-cross algorithm, which does not maintain primal feasibility, also visits <b>all</b> the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a modified Klee-Minty cube. Like the simplex algorithm, the criss-cross algorithm visits <b>all</b> 8 <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the three-dimensional cube in the worst case.|$|R

25|$|Constantine IV was {{determined}} {{to solve the problem}} of the monotheletism/chalcedon controversy once and for all. Calling forth representatives from <b>all</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> Christendom to discuss the matter at hand, they debated until in 681 when Constantine IV, who had presided over much of the meetings, endorsed the virtually unanimous findings. Four years later in 685, Constantine IV died. His death at thirty three years robbed Byzantium of a good Emperor who had defeated her enemies from within as well as without.|$|E

25|$|Although Singaporean {{culture is}} diverse in nature, Singapore {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} outside Greater China with a vibrant Chinese cultural presence. On one glance, Singapore's infrastructure and environment might seem Western, but on closer observation, Chinese culture is generally present across <b>all</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> Singapore. This includes the widespread use of different Chinese varieties, various Chinese writings across Singapore, various Chinese press and entertainment media, a thriving Chinese pop culture, various Chinese organisations, Chinese cultural festivals, Chinese opera, Chinese religious activities, Chinese bookshops etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{islands are}} famous among birdwatchers {{for their ability}} to attract rare birds from <b>all</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the globe. The peak time of year for this is {{generally}} in October when {{it is not unusual for}} several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far flung islands first.|$|E
25|$|The day was {{accompanied}} by a spate of violence in which at least 66 people were killed in gunbattles, suicide strikes, and roadside bombs. The dead included 24 civilians, 5 foreign soldiers, 7 Afghan soldiers, 12 Afghan policemen, 7 security firm guards, and at least 11 militants. Attacks occurred in <b>all</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the country – not only in the south and east, but also in the west and north that had been comparatively quiet until recent weeks around the election – signalling an expanding insurgency despite record numbers of U.S. and coalition troops in the eight-year war since the 2001 U.S. invasion.|$|E

25|$|Early on, Andronikos ruled wisely – {{he began}} by attacking the {{corruption}} within the taxation and administration of the empire. Before long his heavy-handed ruling of the Empire gave rise to enemies in <b>all</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> the Empire; the aristocrats in Anatolia were conspiring against his rule, Isaac Komnenos declared Cyprus an independent kingdom and Béla III of Hungary, formerly engaged to Maria Komnene, began sacking towns along Dalmatia and Croatia. However, these calamities were nothing {{in comparison to the}} storm that had lain dormant, that some would argue was worse than the Turks of Manzikert – the Normans of the Kingdom of Sicily.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 Ole Kassow, a {{resident}} of Copenhagen, wanted to help the elderly get back on their bicycles, {{but he had to}} find a solution to their limited mobility. The answer was a cycle rickshaw, and he started offering free cycle rickshaw rides to residents of a nearby nursing home. He then got in touch with a civil society consultant at the City of Copenhagen, Dorthe Pedersen, who was intrigued by the idea, and together they bought five cycle rickshaws and launched an organization called Cycling Without Age, which has now spread to <b>all</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> Denmark, and since 2015 to another 28 countries around the world.|$|E

Terlaky's criss-cross algorithm visits <b>all</b> the 2D <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> a (perturbed) cube in dimension D, according to a paper of Roos; Roos's paper modifies the Klee-Minty construction of a cube on which the simplex algorithm takes 2D steps.
