40|$|Voice {{disorders}} are medical conditions that often result from vocal abuse/misuse which {{is referred to}} generically as vocal hyperfunction. Standard voice assessment approaches cannot accurately determine the actual nature, prevalence, and pathological impact of hyperfunctional vocal behaviors because such behaviors can vary greatly across {{the course of an}} individual's typical day and may not be clearly demonstrated during a brief clinical encounter. Thus, it would be clinically valuable to develop noninvasive ambulatory measures that can reliably differentiate vocal hyperfunction from normal patterns of vocal behavior. As an initial step toward this goal we used an accelerometer taped to the neck surface to provide a continuous, noninvasive <b>acceleration</b> <b>signal</b> designed to capture some aspects of vocal behavior related to vocal cord nodules, a common manifestation of vocal hyperfunction. We gathered data from 12 female adult patients diagnosed with vocal fold nodules and 12 control speakers matched for age and occupation. We derived features from weeklong neck-surface acceleration recordings by using distributions of sound pressure level and fundamental frequency over 5 -min windows of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>signal</b> and normalized these features so that intersubject comparisons were meaningful. We then used supervised machine learning to show that the two groups exhibit distinct vocal behaviors that can be detected using the <b>acceleration</b> <b>signal.</b> We were able to correctly classify 22 of the 24 subjects, suggesting that in the future measures of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>signal</b> could be used to detect patients with the types of aberrant vocal behaviors that are associated with hyperfunctional voice disorders.

Individual values of the maximal area of <b>acceleration</b> flow <b>signals</b> obtained from three orthogonal planes in seven patients with mild prosthetic mitral regurgitation by angi ography ranged from 0 to 17 mm 2 (mean 4 ± 6). In 8 patients with moderate prosthetic mitral regurgitation by angiography, the maximal area of <b>acceleration</b> flow <b>signals</b> ranged from 21 to 58 mm 2 (mean 33 ± 15), whereas the maximal area of <b>acceleration</b> flow <b>signals</b> in 16 patients with severe prosthetic regurgitation ranged from 20 to 173 mm 2 (mean 102 ± 41).

40|$|ABSTRACT Development of {{denoising}} algorithm for 3 D <b>acceleration</b> <b>signals</b> {{is essential}} to facilitate accurate assessment of human movement in body sensor networks (BSN). In this study, firstly 3 D <b>acceleration</b> <b>signals</b> were captured by self-developed nine-axis wireless BSN platform during 12 subjects performing regular walking gait. Then, acceleration noise was filtered using four common filters respectively: median filter, Butterworth low-pass filter, discrete wavelet package shrinkage and Kalman filter. Finally, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and correlation coefficient(R) between filtered signal and reference signal were determined. We found that (1) Kalman filter showed the largest SNR and R values, followed by median filter, discrete wavelet package shrinkage and finally Butterworth low-pass filter; (2) Real-time performance of median filter related to its window length; Decomposition level influenced real-time performance of discrete wavelet package shrinkage; Butterworth low-pass filter brought large waveform delay. The algorithms of these filters would be further investigated to achieve best noise reduction of 3 D <b>acceleration</b> <b>signals</b> in future...|$|R

40|$|It {{is found}} that {{ensembles}} of collocated experimental <b>acceleration</b> <b>signals</b> induced by impulses applied sequentially {{over the surface}} of beam-like structures are characterized by fast-decaying POD-modal energy spectra. Governed by a power law, this type of quite fast decay directly reflects high level of spatio-temporal coherence. Collocated ensembles of <b>acceleration</b> <b>signals</b> at various locations are governed by identical POD modes representing normal modes of vibration. Thus, collocated measurements of impulse-induced <b>acceleration</b> <b>signals</b> furnish a physics-carrying spatially distributed sensing of free dynamics. In view of this fact, three accelerometers were placed on strategic locations on an aircraft propeller to acquire collocated databases and thus we obtained an optimal reduced modal characterization of impulse-induced free dynamics. Quite interesting from the standpoint of size of damage detection, it is found that the first POD mode is quite sensitive to a small defect located at one of the propeller tips. Damage size sensitivity is distributed and depends on the sensor-defect relative distance. It is enhanced considerably in regimes of initial wave-vibration transients. Using the POD modal structure, damage indices are introduced and computed at the first-POD energy level.
