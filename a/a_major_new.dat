5|$|In 179 BC Philip died. His {{talented and}} ambitious son, Perseus, took the throne and showed a renewed {{interest}} in conquering Greece. With her Greek allies facing <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>new</b> threat, Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the Third Macedonian War. Perseus initially had some success against the Romans. However, Rome responded by sending a stronger army. This second consular army decisively defeated the Macedonians at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC and the Macedonians duly capitulated, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|In this period, Gaddafi {{expanded}} his control over northern Chad, building new roads and erecting <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>new</b> airbase, Ouadi Doum, meant to better support air and ground operations beyond the Aouzou Strip.

5|$|During the war Vaughan Williams stopped writing music, {{and after}} {{returning}} to civilian life he took some time before feeling ready to compose new works.

5|$|Part of {{this scheme}} was the {{announcement}} of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off a firestorm of protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, {{which led to the}} discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal. <b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>New</b> York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel's charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being. While competitors may have been unhappy, Rockefeller's efforts did bring American consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil by-products. Before 1870, oil light was only for the wealthy, provided by expensive whale oil. But during the next decade, kerosene became commonly available to the working and middle classes.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school in 1934, deHavilland was offered a {{scholarship}} to Mills College in Oakland to pursue her chosen career as an English teacher. She was also offered the role of Puck in the Saratoga Community Theater production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. That summer, Austrian director Max Reinhardt came to California for <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>new</b> production of the same play to premiere at the Hollywood Bowl. After one of Reinhardt's assistants saw her perform in Saratoga, he offered her the second understudy position for the role of Hermia. One week before the premiere, the understudy Jean Rouverol and lead actress Gloria Stuart both left the project, leaving 18-year-old deHavilland to play Hermia. Impressed with her performance, Reinhardt offered her the part in the four-week autumn tour that followed. During that tour, Reinhardt received word that he would direct the Warner Bros. film version of his stage production, and he offered her the film role of Hermia. With her mind still set on becoming a teacher, deHavilland initially wavered, but eventually Reinhardt and executive producer Henry Blanke persuaded her to sign a five-year contract with Warner Bros. on November 12, 1934, with a starting salary of $200 a week.|$|E
5|$|The Preservation Society {{celebrated its}} 50th anniversary in 2001, {{and as part}} of the year of {{celebrations}} <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>new</b> project was launched to once more extend and improve facilities at Tywyn Wharf station. For many years the station had been home to semi-permanent buildings housing the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum, but the new plans for the station included {{the construction of a new}} two-storey building to house the museum and the extension of the existing station building to house a new cafe and booking office. Work began on the first phase of the project in January 2002. In 2003 the railway received a £682,500 Heritage Lottery grant towards the £1,170,000 cost of redeveloping Wharf station, and the new station and museum were officially opened by Prince Charles and The Duchess of Cornwall on 13 July 2005. The railway has seen a steady increase in passengers carried since the turn of the millennium, with nearly 51,000 passenger bookings and 95,500 passenger journeys recorded in 2006, although this figure is still only around half the peak figure carried in 1973. In 2011, the railway celebrated 60 years of preservation, and received an Engineering Heritage Award from the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in recognition of its importance in Welsh industrial heritage.|$|E
