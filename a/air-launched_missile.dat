25|$|The Advanced Strategic <b>Air-Launched</b> <b>Missile</b> (ASALM) was a medium-range {{strategic}} missile program, {{developed in}} the late 1970s for the United States Air Force. Intended for use in both the air-to-surface and anti-AWACS roles, the missile's development reached the stage of propulsion-system tests before being cancelled in 1980.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the USAF {{started a}} new program {{initially}} designated the Prototype Miniature Air-Launched Segment (PMALS) and Air Force Systems Command's Space Division established a system program office.

The requirement was for an <b>air-launched</b> <b>missile</b> {{that could be used}} against satellites in low Earth orbit.|$|E
25|$|The Air Force {{response}} was two-fold. One was WS-199, which explored various options {{to make the}} Air Force's own missiles as immune as the Navy's. The primary method was the <b>air-launched</b> <b>missile,</b> which would be kept on station close to the Soviet Union but outside their defensive range, able to be launched at a moment's notice. They also explored ways to extend the range of ground-launched missiles, so that small mobile missiles {{might be able to}} carry out attacks from the United States without being subject to counterattack. Other options, not part of WS-199, was an active defense using the LIM-49 Nike Zeus and its follow-ons, and rail-based launchers.|$|E

25|$|Bids for the {{contract}} were submitted by Martin Marietta, Ling-Temco-Vought, and Teledyne Ryan, with the Martin Marietta design being judged {{the winner of}} the design competition in September 1984. Derived from the cancelled Advanced Strategic <b>Air-Launched</b> <b>Missile</b> developed by Martin Marietta for the United States Air Force, the missile utilised a Marquardt hybrid rocket-ramjet propulsion system, with a solid rocket booster providing initial thrust, with the rocket's chamber, following burnout, becoming the combustion chamber for a ramjet sustainer. The AQM-127 was designed to fly at speeds of Mach 2.5 at an altitude of , following a pre-programmed course on autopilot. The SLAT was to be fitted with radar signature augmentors and a radar seeker emulator; initial operational capability was projected for 1991.|$|E
2500|$|Development of the Advanced Strategic <b>Air-Launched</b> <b>Missile</b> was {{initiated}} in 1976.

In addition, the requirement specified that the ASALM should be capable of operating in a secondary air-to-air mode against AWACS radar-warning aircraft.

2500|$|LRASM is {{designed}} to be compatible with the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System used on many US Navy ships and to be fired from aircraft, including the B-1 bomber. For surface launches, LRASM will be fitted with a modified Mk 114 jettison-able rocket booster to give it enough power to reach altitude. [...] Although priority development is on air and surface-launched variants, Lockheed is exploring the concept of a submarine-launched variant, and deployment from a topside canister launcher for smaller ships. As part of OASuW Increment 1, the LRASM will be used only as an <b>air-launched</b> <b>missile</b> to be deployed from the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and B-1B Lancer, which has the capacity to carry 24 LRASMs.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis evaluates the Navy's test and evaluation (T&E) process for <b>air-launched</b> guided <b>missiles,</b> identifies T&E management problems, and proposes utilization {{of a particular}} test program strategy. Many changes {{have been made to}} improve the T&E process, but some of these have resulted in costly inefficiencies. Contributing problems include: the operational test agencies do not participate adequately in early test planning, excess duplication exists in testing done by major participants in the Navy <b>air-launched</b> guided <b>missile</b> T&E process, lack of definition of a mission profile leads to improper and inadequate testing of <b>air-launched</b> guided <b>missiles,</b> and numerous other T&E management problems. The utilization of an Integrated Test Program approach for <b>air-launched</b> guided <b>missile</b> T&E is proposed. Test data from contractor demonstration tests, limited TECHEVAL, and OPEVAL would be pooled to confirm compliance with specification requirements and verify operational effectiveness and suitability. Test assets and other resources would be conserved and overall T&E schedule improved. [URL]...|$|R
