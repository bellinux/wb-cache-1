5|$|The first Stuka loss on the Soviet-German front {{occurred}} early at 03:40–03:47 in {{the morning}} of the 22 June. While being escorted by Bf 109s from JG 51 to attack Brest Fortress, Oberleutnant Karl Führing of StG 77 was shot down by an I-153. The dive bomber wing suffered only two losses on the opening day of Barbarossa. As a result of the Luftwaffe's attention, the Soviet Air Force in the western Soviet Union was nearly destroyed. The official report claimed 1,489 Soviet aircraft destroyed. Göring ordered this checked. After picking their way through the wreckage across the front, Luftwaffe officers found that the tally exceeded 2,000. In the next two days, the Soviets reported the loss of another 1,922 aircraft.

40|$|The plant cuticle {{consists}} of aliphatic wax and cutin, and covers all the <b>aerial</b> tissues, conferring <b>resistance</b> to both biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we performed phenotypic characterizations of tomato mutants having both sticky peel (pe) and light green (lg) mutations. Our genetic {{analysis showed that}} these two mutations are tightly linked and behave like a monogenic recessive mutation. The double mutant (pe lg) produced glossy soft fruits with light green leaves, most likely due to defects in cuticle formation. Cytological analysis revealed that {{the thickness of the}} fruit cuticle layer was dramatically reduced in the pe lg mutant. The epidermal cells of the leaves were also deformed in the pe lg mutant, suggesting that leaf cuticle formation was also disrupted in the mutant. Consistent with this, transmission electron microscopic analysis showed that the electron density of the cuticle layer of the adaxial surface of the leaf was reduced in the pe lg mutant compared to WT, suggesting that there are changes in cuticle structure and/or composition in the pe lg mutant. Both physiological analysis to measure the rate of transpiration, and staining of the fruits and leaves with toluidine blue, revealed that water permeability was enhanced in the pe lg mutant, consistent with the reduced thickness of its cuticle layer. Taken together the preliminary analyses of the cuticle components, the PE LG is most likely involved in proper cuticle formation...|$|R
25|$|The Soviets {{were now}} over the most {{critical}} phase. Novikov now drew the conclusion that Soviet air forces could be effective by instituting changes. All bombers were to be escorted, Soviet fighter pilots were encouraged {{to be more aggressive}} and take part in low-level suppression attacks, and more night strikes owing to an absence of German night fighter forces would be less costly. Soviet forces did increase their effectiveness. Despite Loerzer's Corps claiming 487 Soviet aircraft destroyed in the air and 1,211 on the ground between 22 June and 13 July, <b>aerial</b> <b>resistance</b> was clearly mounting. On 13 July Army Group North counted 354 Soviet machines in the skies. All this compelled the Luftwaffe to return to bombing airfields. Of particular concern was the taran tactic.

25|$|The {{mission of}} the fast carrier forces had by this time evolved into sealing off {{designated}} enemy-held atolls and islands which the Allies intended to take and interdicting others to isolate and keep to a minimum Japanese resistance at the target. Now a third mission was to be added, the pounding of major enemy bases {{without the aid of}} land-based aircraft, leaving little or no need for a return visit. Thus, to ease the occupation of Eniwetok and to aid in the encirclement of Rabaul, TF 58 departed Majuro and sailed for the Carolines. On 16–17 February, they devastated Truk, the best fleet anchorage in the Mandated Territories, the base of the Japanese combined fleet and the center for air and sea communications between Japan and the Bismarck Archipelago. The force then sailed northwest to the Mariana Islands for strikes on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, encountering heavy <b>aerial</b> <b>resistance</b> there on 21–22 February. After a brief respite for replenishment at Majuro, Mobile sailed to Espiritu Santo, where the ships of TG 58.1 were reorganized as TG 36.1 on 12 March.

The crippled destroyer, maintaining a speed in excess of 28knots to minimize flooding and bringing the fire under control, remained in the area and continued to ward off enemy planes until relieved shortly before noon.

For almost 3 months she escaped further serious damage. However, on 29 July, while standing by a kamikaze victimshe became the target of a second suicide-minded Japanese pilot. Prichett took him under fire at 5,000 yards, but he bore on. Splashed into the sea approximately 6feet off the destroyer's port side, his mission was partially accomplished as his lethal cargo exploded on impact, bowing in the ship's hull and causing extensive damage to her superstructure, port depth charge racks, and radio and power leads.

Though {{there were more}} than 300 Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) and Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAS) planes present at Truk {{on the first day of}} attacks, only about half of these were operational compared with over 500 operational aircraft between the carriers of TF 58. U.S. Navy fighter pilots in their Grumman F6F Hellcats, with the advantages of speed, altitude and surprise, achieved a one–sided victory against IJNAF pilots flying the inferior Mitsubishi A6M Zero. As many as 30 of the 80 Zeros sent up in response to the fighter sweep were shot down, compared with 4 Hellcats reported lost. Only token <b>aerial</b> <b>resistance</b> was encountered for the rest of the morning; virtually no Japanese aircraft were present by the afternoon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} in the air had also worsened, the Luftwaffe established air supremacy (as opposed to air superiority) as the French air arm {{was on the verge}} of collapse. The French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) had only just begun to make the majority of bomber sorties; between 5 and 9 June (during Operation Paula), over 1,815 missions, of which 518 were by bombers, were flown. The number of sorties flown declined as losses were now becoming impossible to replace. The RAF attempted to divert the attention of the Luftwaffe with 660 sorties flown against targets over the Dunkirk area, but losses were heavy; on 21 June alone, 37 Bristol Blenheims were destroyed. After 9 June, French <b>aerial</b> <b>resistance</b> virtually ceased; some surviving aircraft withdrew to French North Africa. The Luftwaffe now [...] "ran riot". Its attacks were focused on the direct and indirect support of the German Army. The Luftwaffe subjected lines of resistance to ferocious assault, which then quickly collapsed under armoured attack.|$|E

Heading southeast, she steamed to New Guinea, whence she lifted elements of the 11th Airborne Division to Leyte. She then sailed to New Britain, took on units of the 40th Infantry Division and returned to Manus to stage for the assault on Luzon. Departing 31 December, she encountered <b>aerial</b> <b>resistance</b> in Lingayen Gulf, 1945-01-09, and, on the 10th, enabled a Japanese suicide swimmer to join his ancestors before departing for Leyte to take on 1st Cavalry Division troops for transport to the Luzon beaches. Monrovia then returned to the Solomons, took on units of the 6th Marine Division, and, as flagship, TransDiv 36, conducted amphibious exercises in preparation for Operation Iceberg, the invasion of Okinawa. From the Solomons, she proceeded to Ulithi to join other ships assigned to TF 53, the northern attack force, and headed for the Hagushi beaches. By dusk on 1 April, she had landed all her marines, but, because of nightly retirements, did not complete discharging her cargo until the 5th. She then steamed eastward, arriving at Portland, Oregon, on the 28th for overhaul. Monrovia returned to the western Pacific after the Japanese surrender and immediately commenced transporting occupation troops and supplies to China and Japan, returning to the United States with battle weary veterans. She continued to transit the Pacific, between the west coast and Japan, as a cargo and personnel carrier until the spring of 1946, when she was ordered to the east coast for inactivation. On 1946-07-31, she reported to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, at Norfolk, decommissioning there 1947-02-26.|$|E
