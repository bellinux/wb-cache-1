The popularity of the character amongst multiple audiences directly influenced the development of the spin-off series Torchwood.

5|$|Comfort, however, {{asserts that}} McClintock was well {{regarded}} by her professional peers, {{even in the}} early years of her career. Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written about in the context of women's studies. Most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. She is held up as <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist, Deborah Heiligman's Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field and Mary Kittredge's Barbara McClintock. A recent biography for young adults by Naomi Pasachoff, Barbara McClintock, Genius of Genetics, provides a new perspective, based on the current literature.|$|E
5|$|For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool {{controlled}} {{the government as}} Prime Minister, with little help from George. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible. At all times he was much {{under the influence of}} favourites. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending at a time when Britons were fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis, nor act as <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> his people. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. After Liverpool's retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, Princess Charlotte, died before him in 1817 and so he was succeeded by his younger brother, William.|$|E

5|$|Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 is {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Janet Jackson, {{released}} on September 19, 1989, by A Records. Although label executives wanted material similar to her previous album, Control (1986), Jackson insisted on creating a concept album addressing social issues. Collaborating with songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, she drew inspiration from various tragedies reported through news media, exploring racism, poverty, and substance abuse, in addition to themes of romance. Although its primary concept was met with mixed reactions, its composition received critical acclaim. Jackson came to be considered <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> youth because of her socially conscious lyrics.|$|E

5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history. He has invented {{a completely new}} and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only {{be the work of}} such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works.

5|$|As {{his sons}} had desired and planned, Wilberforce {{has long been}} viewed as a Christian hero, a statesman-saint held up as <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> putting his faith into action. More broadly, {{he has also been}} {{described}} as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline. Williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of {{the latter part of the}} 20th century. However, more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of abolition, and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Niels Bohr {{and his son}} Aage, a {{physicist}} who acted as his father's assistant, arrived on 30 December {{on the first of}} several visits as a consultant. Bohr and his family had escaped from occupied Denmark to Sweden. A De Havilland Mosquito bomber brought him to England where he joined Tube Alloys. In America, he was able to visit Oak Ridge and Los Alamos, where he found many of his former students. Bohr acted as a critic, a facilitator and <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> younger scientists. He arrived at a critical time, and several nuclear fission studies and experiments were conducted at his instigation. He {{played an important role in}} the development of the uranium tamper, and in the design and adoption of the modulated neutron initiator. His presence boosted morale, and helped improve the administration of the laboratory to strengthen ties with the Army.|$|E
5|$|Turner marketed Real Adventures {{through a}} {{substantial}} diversity of products, considering its Quest campaign <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> future shows. Galoob acquired figurine licensing rights in 1995 {{and created a}} product line of vehicles, figures, and Micro Machines for fall 1996 release. Turner felt that Galoob's commitment legitimized the Quest marketing plan, and next secured partnership with Pizza Hut and food retailers. Pillsbury included $3mail-in rebates for future Quest videos, display contests, and instant coupon offers on over 20million packages. Campbell Soup Company released six holographic miniature posters on {{the same number of}} SpaghettiOs cans; the posters were awarded in Converting in 1997. General Mills outfitted boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch with offers for T-shirts and other items. Over five thousand Pizza Hut restaurants held a two-month-long give-away of figurines with meals during the show's launch. Galoob failed to build popularity for its toys outside the United States, and discontinued the line in 1997.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe {{is widely}} popular in Asia, {{particularly}} Japan. In 2000, TV Asahi {{identified him as}} the swimmer {{likely to be the}} most successful at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, so they selected him as the event's marketing figurehead. In the lead-up, Thorpe visited Japan to promote Asahi in a series of television events, and upon returning for the competition, he was mobbed at the airport by youthful crowds 25m deep; hundreds camped outside the Australian team's hotel. He was also praised by older sections of Japanese society as <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> youth, due to what they interpreted as his humility and work ethic. It was estimated that more than 80% of the Japanese public watched his races on television. In 2002, {{in the wake of a}} tourism slump after 11 September terrorist attacks, Thorpe agreed to be an ambassador for the Australian Tourism Commission in Japan. The high-profile campaign included a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The marketing drive resulted in an upturn in Japanese tourism to Australia, which was credited to Thorpe. In 2005, Yakult released a 'Thorpedo' energy drink—which featured a picture of the swimmer on the bottle—in Japan. This was part of an equity deal with the So Natural food group, in which Thorpe was given a 5% stake in the company—at the time worth A$1.1m—in return for the use of his name and image on their products. The 15-year deal covers East and Southeast Asia and Thorpe's share in the venture could increase to 50% depending on its success.|$|E
