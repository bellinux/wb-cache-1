Pituitary cell functioning depends on membrane excitability, which induces cytosolic calcium rises. Here, we reported the first identification of small-amplitude voltage fluctuations that controlled spike firing in endocrine cells recorded in situ. Three patterns of voltage fluctuations were distinguishable by their durations (1 – 100 s). These patterns could be ordered {{on top of}} each other, namely in response to secretagogues. Thus, pituitary endocrine cells express in situ <b>a</b> <b>cell</b> <b>code</b> in which small-amplitude voltage fluctuations lead to a multimodal arrangement of spike firing, which may finely tune calcium-dependent functions...|$|E

40|$|Several {{primitive}} colonial organisms distinguish self from nonself {{by means}} of polymorphic compatibility molecules bearing similarity to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The evolution of such polymorphisms is generally {{explained in terms of}} resistance to parasites. Ignoring parasites, I develop two mathematical models. One model is inspired by slime mold aggregation. The other is a caricature. The results show that parasites are not required to explain polymorphisms. The fact that allorecognition allows organisms to maintain their “genetic identity” (e. g., to preserve evolved adaptations) suffices for the evolution of polymorphisms. The degree of polymorphism that ultimately evolves is equal to the diversity of phenotypes in the population. In these models I consider “cells” growing in particular environments. The “genotype” of <b>a</b> <b>cell</b> <b>codes</b> for <b>an</b> “ecological preference,” which determines the growth rate of the cell in the environment, and for a “compatibility molecule. ” Cells expressing the same compatibility molecule form one “colony. ” Thus, colonies may be chime& with respect to the ecological preferences. The reproduction rate of each <b>cell</b> in <b>a</b> colony is weighted by the colony’s composition of ecological preferences. These conditions turn out to be sufficient for the evolution of polymorphic compatibility molecules...|$|R

Although AS {{is common in}} higher plants and animals, its prevalence in other eukaryotes is mostly unknown. In fungi the involvement of AS in gene expression {{and its effect on}} multi-cellularity and virulence is of great medical and economic interest. We present a genome-wide comparative study of AS in 23 inform-ative fungi of different taxa, based on alignments of public transcript sequences. Random sampling of expressed sequence tags allows for robust and comparable estimations of AS rates. We find that a greater frac-tion of fungal genes than previously expected is associated with AS. We estimate that on average, 6. 4 % of the annotated genes are affected by AS, withCryptococcusneoformans showing an extraordinary rate of 18 %. The investigated Basidiomycota show higher average AS rates (8. 6 %) than the Ascomycota (6. 0 %), although not significant. We find that multi-cellular complexity and younger evolutionary age associate with higher AS rates. Furthermore, AS affects genes involved in pathogenic lifestyle, particularly in functions of stress re-sponse and dimorphic switching. Together, our analysis strongly supports the view that AS is a rather common phenomenon in fungi and associates with higher multi-cellular complexity.

Exploring the mental development mechanism in terms of incremental visual context encoding by population <b>cells</b> is <b>an</b> interesting issue. This paper presents a biologically inspired computational model. The visual contextual cues were used in this model for top–down eye-motion control on searching targets in images. We proposed <b>a</b> population <b>cell</b> <b>coding</b> mechanism for visual context encoding and decoding. The model was implemented in a neural network system. A developmental learning mechanism was simulated in this system by dynamically generating new coding neurons to incrementally encode visual context during training. The encoded context was decoded with population neurons in a top–down mode. This allowed the model to control the gaze motion to the centers of the targets. The model was developed with pursuing low encoding quantity and high target locating accuracy. Its performance has been evaluated by a set of experiments to search different facial objects in a human face image set. Theoretical analysis and ex-perimental results show that the proposed visual context encoding algorithm without weight updating is fast, efficient and stable, and the population-cell coding generally performs better than single-cell coding and k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) -based coding.

The enhancement is transient and enhances the acceleration of the electrons in the sheath. A set of modified MHD equations, including those for ion inertia, quasineutrality, and electron drift, is employed to model TSS current closure.

Geometric structures associated with and emergent from HAP formulations are discussed.

Basic ideas of variational integration and Poisson integration, which can preserve noncanonical Hamiltonian structure, are discussed. Metriplectic integration, which preserves the structure of conservative systems with both Hamiltonian and dissipative parts, is proposed. Two kinds of simulated annealing, a relaxation technique for obtaining equilibrium states, are reviewed: one that uses metriplectic dynamics, which maximizes an entropy at fixed energy, the other that uses double bracket dynamics, which preserves Casimir invariants.
