The same year, {{he and his wife}} moved to Hove, following several years of health concerns <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> over his business and children. Ada's health continued to deteriorate, and the couple spent some time in South Africa in an attempt to aid her recuperation.|$|E
5|$|In February 1937, Agnew entered Johns Hopkins University as a {{chemistry}} major. After {{the first few}} months he found the pressure of the academic work increasingly stressful, and was distracted by the family's continuing financial problems <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> about the international situation, in which war seemed likely. In 1939 he decided that his future lay in law rather than chemistry, left Johns Hopkins and began night classes at the University of Baltimore School of Law. To support himself, he took a day job as an insurance clerk with the Maryland Casualty Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} marred by various concerns, notably the safety of Mir {{following}} a fire and a collision, financial issues with the cash-strapped Russian Space Program <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> from astronauts about {{the attitudes of the}} program administrators. Nevertheless, a large amount of science, expertise in space station construction and knowledge in working in a cooperative space venture was gained from the combined operations, allowing the construction of the ISS to proceed much more smoothly than would have otherwise been the case.|$|E

50|$|Measures of {{rumination}} <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> {{have also}} demonstrated high correlations, {{above and beyond}} that of symptom measures of anxiety and depression (r=.66; Beck & Perkins, 2001). Rumination <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> overlap in their relationships to anxiety and depression, although some studies do indicate specificity of rumination to depression <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> to anxiety. Rumination {{has been found to}} predict changes in both depression and anxiety symptoms and individuals with major depression have been reported to engage in levels of worry similar to individuals with GAD. As a whole, these studies suggest that rumination <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> are related not only to each other, but also each is related to symptoms of both depression and anxiety.|$|R

5|$|E.V. Ramasamy also {{blamed the}} capitalists for their control of machineries, {{creating}} difficulties for the workers. According to his philosophy, rationalism, {{which has to}} lead the way for peaceful life to all, had resulted in causing poverty <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> to the people because of dominating forces. He stated that there is no use of simply acquiring titles or amassing wealth if one has no self-respect or scientific knowledge.

5|$|Writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and {{producer}} Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{of the show}} TGS with Tracy Jordan have decided to rig the TGS auditions—in which they are {{in search of a}} new cast member on the show—by planning to add bad actors so that their preferred choice, Jayden Michael Tyler (Nick Fondulis), gets hired by their boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin). TGS cast member Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) learns that the auditions are taking place <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> that her position on the show will be lessened with the arrival of a new actor. Although Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the star of the show, reassures Jenna that the two have nothing to worry about, she remains uneasy. Later, Jenna discovers that Liz and Pete want Jayden to be cast, but she pleads with Liz to pull Jayden out of his audition. Jenna hates him for humiliating her after working together on a play, but Liz does not change her mind about Jayden. Jenna eventually figures out what Liz and Pete are scheming, so she and Tracy go out and find people (Angela Grovey and David Perlman) and bring them to the TGS auditions.|$|E

40|$|This study {{hypothesized}} {{a direct}} relationship among three verbal phenomena: derived relational responding, verbal intelligence, <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> It also hypothesized that experiential avoidance would mediate the relationship between derived relational responding <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> Overall, {{results from this study}} failed to support a relationship between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> the other two verbal phenomena, however, results did support a relationship between derived relational responding and verbal intelligence. Additionally, results indicated a significant relationship between experiential avoidance <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> Future research should clarify the relationship among the three primary variables of interest, improve measurement of these variables, be more sensitive to external validity, and promote the study of acceptance-based treatments that target experiential avoidance...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated the importance of examining the relationships between personality and psychopathology (Krueger 2 ̆ 6 Tackett, 2006). The present investigation sought to further develop this literature. More specifically, the following study examined the links between neuroticism, experiential avoidance, <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> The focus {{of the current study}} was to replicate and extend previous findings on neuroticism, experiential avoidance, <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> In addition, a novel mediational model was tested to determine if experiential avoidance is the pathway through which the relationship between neuroticism <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> is transmitted. Results of the study regarding the primary hypotheses were mixed. While experiential avoidance, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> neuroticism were all positively correlated as predicted, experiential avoidance did not predict worry after controlling for neuroticism. In addition, experiential avoidance was not found to mediate the relationship between neuroticism <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> Supplementary analyses found that anxiety, stress, depression, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> experiential avoidance were all significantly positively correlated with one another. In addition, it was found that experiential avoidance increased the prediction of a worry after controlling for the effects of anxiety, stress, and depression, and experiential avoidance mediated the relationship between anxiety <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> Clinical <b>and</b> theoretical implications, strengths and limitations, and future directions for research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A 5 year, ten wave {{longitudinal}} study of 338 adolescents assessed the association between two forms of cognitive vulnerability (intolerance of uncertainty and fear of anxiety) <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> Multilevel mediational analyses revealed a bidirectional and reciprocal relation between intolerance of uncertainty <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> in which change in one variable partially explained change in the other. Fear of anxiety <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> also showed evidence of a bidirectional relation, although change in fear of anxiety had a much weaker mediational effect on change in worry than vice versa.

25|$|Only {{the third}} {{approach}} promotes well-being. It is employed by resilient people, who become {{upset about the}} disruptive state and thus change their current pattern {{to cope with the}} issue. The first and second approaches lead people to adopt the victim role by blaming others and rejecting any coping methods even after the crisis is over. These people prefer to instinctively react, rather than respond to the situation. Those who respond to the adverse conditions by adapting themselves tend to cope, spring back, and halt the crisis. Negative emotions involve fear, anger, anxiety, distress, helplessness, and hopelessness which decrease a person's ability to solve the problems they face and weaken a person's resiliency. Constant fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> weaken people's immune system and increase their vulnerability to illnesses.|$|E
25|$|Ferdinand's death {{led to the}} {{ascension}} {{of young}} Charles to the throne as Charles I of Castile and Aragon, effectively founding the monarchy of Spain.

In 1519, with the death of his paternal grandfather Maximilian I, Charles inherited the Habsburg territories in Germany, and was duly elected as Holy Roman Emperor that year. His mother Joanna remained titular queen of Castile until her death 1555, but due to her mental health <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> of her being proposed as an alternative monarch by opposition (as happened in the Revolt of the Comuneros), Charles kept her imprisoned.|$|E

In 1943 the German administration forced Ryelandt to resign, but he was reinstated after the liberation of Belgium in 1944. In 1945 he retired. He devoted his retirement to literature, writing poetry (including a number of translations into French of his favorite Dutch-language poet Guido Gezelle) and reading classics, many with strong religious contents: the Bible, the complete works of Shakespeare, Joost van den Vondel and Paul Claudel, as well as Dante, Pascal, and Teresa of Ávila.
