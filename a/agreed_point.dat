You, too, would have {{the burden of the}} child. But let us suppose that I was wounded, but got away and managed to obtain shelter in some Breton cottage. You might be waiting for me, for weeks, at an <b>agreed</b> <b>point.</b> Now, while travelling, you might escape many questions; but were you to stop even for a few days at any town or village, you may {{be sure that}} you would be questioned so closely, by the authorities, that there would be little chance of your getting on. I should know that, and should be fretting my heart out." ...|$|E
6000|$|As to Isabella and Emma, the {{sensation}} {{that they made}} in society was enough to have gratified a dozen ordinary belles. All that they said, and did, and wore, was instant and unquestionable precedent; and young gentlemen, all starch and perfume, twirled their laced pocket handkerchiefs, and declared on their honor that they knew not which was the most overcoming, the genius and wit of Miss Emma, or the bright eyes of Miss Isabella; though it was an <b>agreed</b> <b>point</b> that between them both, not a heart in the gay world remained in its owner's possession--a thing which might have a serious sound to one {{who did not know}} the character of these articles, often the most trifling item in the inventory of worldly possessions. And all this while, all that was said of our heroine was something in this way: [...] "I believe there is another sister--is there not?" ...|$|E
50|$|Cole was no {{destination}} in itself, but was the <b>agreed</b> <b>point</b> of meeting {{up with the}} Dorset Central Railway. The important town of Bruton lay nearby, but its topography made a closer approach difficult. The Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway had been opened in 1856, giving broad gauge access to the Great Western Railway (GWR) system, but the Somerset Central wanted to have through standard gauge access to the Dorset Central Railway and the South Coast. Parliamentary powers were sought and the standard gauge was specified, but pressure from the broad gauge B&ER - who feared loss of the feeder traffic from the line it had supported - led to a requirement to lay broad gauge {{and to make a}} junction with the Wilts Somerset and Weymouth where the lines would cross.|$|E

50|$|Regarding {{the origin}} of the term ‘Halam,’ some suggest that ‘Halam’ means ‘killer of human beings’ (K.S. Singh, People of India, Vol. V, p.1243). Perhaps, the {{neighbouring}} people might name them ‘Halam’ as they were ferocious and used to killed strangers in olden days. The term ‘Halam’ is expected to be coined by others. One interpretation is that, in Tripuri language, ‘Ha’ means ‘earth’ and ‘Lam’ means ‘route’. So it means ‘earth route.’ It is said that when they came in contact with the king of Tripura, the Maharaja had given them the title ‘Halam.’ From this definition it can be presumed that Halams migrated to their present place of settlement through earth route. However, there is no <b>agreed</b> <b>point</b> on {{the origin of}} the term ‘Halam.’ In the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes orders (Amendment) Act. 1976, Halam is placed at serial No. 6 in the list of Scheduled Tribes of Tripura. Due to long lapse of time and years, sometimes it may create confusion in one’s mind that different sub-tribes of Halam community are of different identity. But they are of the same tribe having common origin.|$|E
40|$|India and Pakistan {{have fought}} four wars over Kashmir and have held several rounds of talks {{to resolve the}} 57 -year-old issue, but without any {{tangible}} success. The only progress thus far has been that India has agreed {{to discuss the issue}} as part of the composite dialogue process and Pakistan has shown willingness to explore options other than the UN resolutions on Kashmir. Although both India and Pakistan appear trying to breakaway from the past and think afresh on Kashmir, yet both fail to bring about any significant policy shifts. For Pakistan, it still is the 'problem of Kashmir', i. e., Kashmir a 'disputed territory' and an 'unfinished agenda' of Partition; for India, it is the 'problem in Kashmir', suggesting that the accession of Kashmir to India is final and complete, and the challenge now remains of addressing crossborder terrorism, and development and grievances of the people of Kashmir. Two such divergent definitions leave no scope for a solution, unless India and Pakistan endeavour to merge the two definitions at a mutually <b>agreed</b> <b>point.</b> The paper looks into the policies of India and Pakistan and fathoms the prospects of a rapprochement on Kashmir. The bus service is a significant step towards merging the diverse positions, but more is required of the two enduring rivals. No Full Tex...|$|E

5000|$|Ostensibly a work {{of formal}} {{mathematics}} and philosophy, LoF became something of a cult classic, praised in the Whole Earth Catalog. Those who <b>agree</b> <b>point</b> to LoF as embodying an enigmatic [...] "mathematics of consciousness," [...] its algebraic symbolism capturing an (perhaps even [...] "the") implicit root of cognition: the ability to [...] "distinguish". LoF argues that primary algebra reveals striking connections among logic, Boolean algebra, and arithmetic, and the philosophy of language and mind.|$|R

50|$|Both {{partners}} {{must agree}} to follow the five-card major bidding treatment on their opening bid. Opener must have at least five cards in hearts or spades to start the bidding with that suit.

40|$|This paper elaborates on the {{coordination}} {{and management of}} evolving software product-lines, where development teams work around a shared and reusable domain infrastructure. The trend away from monolithic applications and towards component-based, product-line architectures has enabled the development of complex software to be undertaken by autonomous and often, geographically separated teams. To deliver a complete product or product-line requires significant coordination to bring the separate development streams together, at <b>agreed</b> <b>points</b> in the schedule, for integration and test. In such complex development scenarios a Release Matrix has been proposed as a generalization of release planning and tracking, addressing multiple products, components and their inter-dependencies at an enterprise or marketplace level...|$|R

In early December the state Republican Party announced it would nominate Marino for a second try at the seat. Before his narrow 2014 loss, he had also run a close race in 2010 for a state House seat held at the time by Rebecca Walker. He made his top campaign issue the purportedly stifling effect of one-party rule on Delaware and its citizens.
