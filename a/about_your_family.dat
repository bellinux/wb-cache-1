40|$|The {{health care}} system in the United States is {{changing}} in ways that require consumers to take more responsibility for their health. The preventive philosophy of health care demands that we move from passive recipients to active consumers of health care. A very important part of health care is maintaining accurate medical records for yourself and members of <b>your</b> <b>family.</b> You may say, "My physician keeps that record. " Have you ever seen a copy of that file? Do you have just one health care provider responsible for your care? Does your medical provider pay your bills? How private is your record? Is your record easily accessible for emergencies? The answers to these questions should underscore the importance of maintaining your own record. When treatment is required in today's changing health care climate, knowing your rights and having an accurate medical record can help you secure more efficient and effective care with less confusion or duplication of services. Several studies have found that lifestyle choices affect our health history. However, we also are learning that a predisposition to some health concerns may be a part of our <b>family</b> heritage.

40|$|Purpose People with {{lung cancer}} report a higher burden of unmet needs, {{specifically}} psychological and daily living unmet needs. They experience more psychological distress and more physical hardship than other tumour sites. This {{study examined the}} levels of unmet need and psychological distress in inoperable lung cancer patients {{at the start of}} treatment. Methods A cross-section survey methodology was employed using baseline data from a randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate a supportive care intervention. Eligible lung cancer patients were approached to participate at the start of treatment. Consenting patients completed questionnaires prior to or just after the commencement of treatment. Reliable and valid measures included Needs Assessment for Advanced Lung Cancer Patients, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Brief Distress Thermometer. Results Of the 108 patients participating, the top unmet need was 'Dealing with concerns <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>family's</b> fears and worries' (62 %); with the next four also coming from the psychological/emotional domain, but, on average, most needs related to medical communication. Thirty two percent of patients reported clinical or subclinical anxiety and 19 % reported HADS scores suggestive of clinical or subclinical depression. Moreover, 39. 8 % of the sample reported distress above the cut-off on the distress thermometer and this was associated with higher needs for each need subscale (p< 0. 05). Conclusions People with lung cancer have high levels of unmet needs especially regarding psychological/emotional or medical communication. People with lung cancer who are classified as distressed have more unmet needs...|$|R

The song was written during sessions for The Circle (2009), but it didn't fit that album, so band decided to hold it and finished it for the Greatest Hits (2010). Lyrically, the song is about the esthetic of love. Richie Sambora explained: [...] "It's a worldly thing and it doesn't have to be exactly about romance.

40|$|This {{semester}} {{you signed}} up for this class to learn German and you did so for a very good reason: Within the multi-lingual entity of the European Union, German speakers represent the largest group.

If German speakers from different regions communicate they do so in Standard German, so-called Hochdeutsch (High German). This course will serve as an entryway into the German speaking cultures by providing you with the abilities to listen to, speak, read, and write in basic (High) German. During the semester you will learn and practice how to express yourself in German. At the end of the semester you will be able to talk in German <b>about</b> yourself, <b>your</b> <b>family,</b> <b>your</b> friends, your daily life, your interests, and the university environment, etc. In addition, you will have gained a better understanding of German history and cultures...|$|R
