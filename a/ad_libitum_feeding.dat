50|$|It has {{sometimes}} been suggested that the lives of calorie-restricted animals are only extended relative to control animals whose lives are artificially shortened by weight-gain from unnatural <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> in the laboratory. However, studies designed {{to test this hypothesis}} suggest that reduced fat mass is not a major contributor to the longevity effects of calorie restriction. The strongest evidence comes from a study in which ob/ob mice, which are genetically prone to overeating and obesity, were compared to lean mice of the same genetic background but lacking the ob/ob mutation. When placed on calorie restriction, the ob/ob mice still have over twice the fat mass of ad libitum-fed congenic lean mice, and yet they have double the lifespan. Additionally, many modern calorie restriction studies restrict the control animals by 10-20% below their ad libitum intake in order to avoid confounding by obesity.|$|E
5000|$|Under current practice, normal parent poultry {{breeding}} stock potentially face welfare problems. Intensive selection for production traits, especially growth rate, {{is associated with}} increased nutritious requirement and thus feed consumption, but also reproductive dysfunctions and decreased sexual activity in broiler breeders. A first resulting serious welfare problem is the subsequent severe feed restriction which is applied during rearing, {{in order to prevent}} health problems and to reach better egg production. This severe feed restriction has negative effects on bird welfare as it causes chronic stress resulting from hunger. The use of normal fast growing broiler breeder hens require dedicated programmes of feed restriction, both to maximise egg and chick production and secondly to avoid metabolic disorders and mortality in broiler breeders. The negative correlation between muscle growth and reproduction effectiveness is known as the [...] "broiler breeder paradox". Using dwarf broiler breeder hens is a good alternative, because dwarf hens combine relatively good reproductive fitness with <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} chronic heat {{exposure}} on feed digestibility of broilers was investigated.

50|$|Caloric {{restriction}} substantially affects lifespan in many animals, {{including the}} ability to delay or prevent many age-related diseases. Typically, this involves caloric intake of 60-70% of what an ad libitum animal would consume, while still maintaining proper nutrient intake. In rodents, this {{has been shown to}} increase lifespan by up to 50%; similar effects occur for yeast and Drosophila. No lifespan data exist for humans on a calorie-restricted diet, but several reports support protection from age-related diseases. Two major ongoing studies on rhesus monkeys initially revealed disparate results; while one study, by the University of Wisconsin, showed that caloric restriction does extend lifespan, the second study, by the National Institute on Ageing (NIA), found no effects of caloric restriction on longevity. Both studies nevertheless showed improvement in a number of health parameters. Notwithstanding the similarly low calorie intake, the diet composition differed between the two studies (notably a high sucrose content in the Wisconsin study), and the monkeys have different origins (India, China), initially suggesting that genetics and dietary composition, not merely a decrease in calories, are factors in longevity. However, in a comparative analysis in 2014, the Wisconsin researchers found that the allegedly non-starved NIA control monkeys in fact are moderately underweight when compared with other monkey populations, and argued this was due to the NIA's apportioned feeding protocol in contrast to Wisconsin's truly unrestricted <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> protocol. They conclude that moderate calorie restriction rather than extreme calorie restriction is sufficient to produce the observed health and longevity benefits in the studied rhesus monkeys.|$|E

Crossbred females of the Nebraska Index Line (NIL) with other maternal lines are being used in several herds within Nebraska and the United States. Not only has there been little research conducted investigating the effects of nutritional manipulation during gilt development on future sow productivity of the NIL crosses, but little information is available regarding how gilt development (as affected by nutritional manipulation) influences sow productivity of early-maturing, prolific sows.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine the}} influences of heat stress and temperature-exposed time on liver malonaldehyde (MDA), relative weight of bursa fabricius and heterophil/lymfocite ratio of broilers. The research used 140 male broilers of 2 weeks of age. The treatments consisted of two factors. The first factor was five treatments: S 1 A (28. 55 ? 1. 53 oC) with <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> of <b>feeding,</b> S 1 BT 1 (S 1 with pair feeding as S 2 A), S 1 BT 2 (S 1 with pair feeding as S 3 A), S 2 A (31. 07 ? 1. 29 oC) with <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> of <b>feeding</b> and S 3 A (33. 50 ? 1. 17 oC) with <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> of <b>feeding.</b> The second factor was five of temperature-exposed times (0, 4, 8, 16, and 32 days after treatments). Variables measured were liver MDA, relative weight of bursa fabricius and ratio of heterophil/lymphocite (H/L). The experiment used a completely randomized design in split plot (5 x 5), with 4 replications. The result indicated that liver MDA, relative weight of bursa fabricius and H/L ratio of S 2 and S 3 were higher than those of S 1 A, S 1 BT 1 and S 1 BT 2. H/L ratio of 4, 8, 16, and 32 days of temperature-exposed times were higher than that of 0 day. It was concluded that heat stress increased the liver MDA and H/L ratio, but decreased the relative weight of bursa fabricius. The temperature-exposed time increased the H/L ratio, but it did not affect the liver MDA and relative weight of bursa fabricius of broilers...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of compensatory growth of 50 Bos indicus (25 Arsi & 25 Borana) bulls with age 28 - 36 months following {{different levels of}} feed restriction for 90 days was studied. The bulls were blocked by weight and randomly assigned to five dietary treatments: <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> for the entire period (A), maintenance requirement for 90 days followed by <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> for 104 days B), 15 % weight loss in 90 days followed by <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> for 104 days (C), 20 % weight loss in 90 days followed by <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> for 104 days (D) and 25 % weight loss in 90 days followed by <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> for 104 days (E). The feed restriction imposed for treatments C, D and E during the initial period resulted in weight losses of 16 %, 20 % & 23 % respectively. Both daily dry matter intake (DMI) and metabolizable energy intake (MEI) during the restriction period declined with increasing levels of feed restriction. Consequently average daily weight gain (ADG) and metabolizable energy intake (MJ/day). During compensatory feeding period were significantly different among treatments (P 0. 05) different among treatments, but significantly (P< 0. 05) different between breeds. Arsi bulls had higher (59 %) recovery index than Borana bulls (30 %). Even though the overall TDMI and MEI during compensatory feeding were increased by four folds than during the restriction period, animals under treatments B, C, D and E could not attain complete compensation within 104 days of compensatory feeding. But Arrsi bulls managed under maintenance feeding level recovered 96 % of their weight loss after 104 days of compensatory feeding as compared to Borana bulls (25 %) managed similarly. The overall carcass weight indicated declining trend with increasing levels of feed restriction. The {{results of this study}} indicated that responses to compensatory feeding are influenced by either severity of under nutrition, breed type of cattle or duration of compensatory fending. The optimum time and cost-benefit relationships at which complete recovery can be attained after a period of feed restriction require further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2007 Light is {{the strongest}} timing cue for the {{circadian}} system, but non-photic cues can also entrain the master circadian clock, i. e., suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). In one of our mouse line (ENTR), all mice entrain to scheduled feeding, while in another (NON-ENTR) only 4 % entrain. In order to explore key physiological pathways involved in that process, I quantified the circadian rhythms of plasma leptin and active ghrelin of these two lines of mice under a 12 : 12 hour light-dark cycle with <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> and six hours of food availability during the light period. Plasma active ghrelin induced opposite circadian rhythms compared to leptin, which were most pronounced under scheduled feeding when leptin was highest during and right after the food availability period; active ghrelin was highest at night when food was not available. Compared to <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding,</b> the overall concentration of leptin decreased and active ghrelin concentration increased significantly under scheduled feeding. The plasma active ghrelin circadian rhythms of ENTR mice were more robust with higher amplitude rhythms than the NON-ENTR mice under <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> and scheduled feeding. I hypothesize that the high amplitude plasma active ghrelin circadian rhythm provides a signal for the ENTR mice to entrain to scheduled feedin...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} levels and {{duration}} of quantitative feed restriction on post-restriction egg-laying characteristics and egg quality as well as economics of egg production of pullets were investigated in a 2 x 7 factorial for completely randomized design experiment using 126 point-of-lay (POL) Olympia Brown commercial pullets, which had been subjected to various levels and durations of feed restrictions. The experiment lasted from 20 th to 37 th week of age but the actual period of data collection was from 30 th to 37 th week of age (that is, 8 weeks). The feeding regimens (treatments) were AFAF (<b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> from 20 th week to 34 th week - 14 weeks); AFRF 1 (<b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> from 20 th to 24 th week (POL) – 5 weeks followed by 10 % restriction feeding from POL to 34 th week - 9 weeks); AFRF 2 (<b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> from 20 th to POL – 5 weeks followed by 20 % restriction feeding from POL to 34 th week - 9 weeks); RF 1 RF 1 (10 % restriction feeding from 20 th to 34 th week - 14 weeks); RF 1 AF (10 % restriction feeding from 20 th week to POL – 5 weeks followed by <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> from POL to 34 th week - 9 weeks); RF 2 RF 2 (20 % restriction feeding from 20 th to 34 th week - 14 weeks); and RF 2 AF (20 % restriction feeding from 20 th week to POL – 5 weeks followed by <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> from POL to 34 th week - 9 weeks). From 34 th to 37 th week of age, all the groups were reverted, on treatment basis, to <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> <b>feeding</b> (post-restriction period). Each treatment was replicated into three with six pullets per replicate. During the data collection period (30 th – 37 th week of age) one egg per replicate was collected three times per week for egg quality indices. Birds that were under feed restriction laid heavier first eggs but had lower (P< 0. 05) hen day production (HDP) than their ad libitum counterparts. Ad libitum fed birds transferred to 20 % restricted feeding had the best economic indices. Birds subjected to restriction feeding had higher feed intake, poorer kg feed/dozen eggs, higher cost for dozen eggs (N) and lower gross margin (N) during post-restriction time (P< 0. 05) than when they were under restriction. On egg quality, birds had higher (P< 0. 05) haugh unit and albumen height but lower yolk index during restriction time than during post-restriction time.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of feed {{restriction}} applied to immunocastrated pigs in the period after the second vaccination (V 2) against GnRH on hormonal status, performance, carcass traits, and meat quality. Immunocastrated pigs (IC) were compared with entire males (EM) and surgical castrates fed <b>ad</b> <b>libitum.</b> Pigs (Large White × Landrace) × Pietrain were either left entire or surgically castrated within 1 wk after birth (SC, n = 22). At 83 d of age, the entire males were further allotted to treatment groups (individual housing) of <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> fed EM (n = 24), <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> fed IC (IC-L, n = 21), or restrictively fed IC (IC-R, n = 21).

40|$|The study {{tested the}} {{performance}} of intact male pigs from a selected genetic line subjected to differing feeding regimens and penning conditions. The trial was a 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 factorial design, consisting of winter and summer periods, three sire lines, two diets and three feeding regimens. The pigs were intact males grown over three phases, starter (25 to 50 kg); grower (51 to 80 kg) and finisher (81 to 105 kg). The pigs were randomly allocated to three feeding regimens, a controlled single <b>feeding,</b> <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> single <b>feeding</b> and <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> group <b>feeding,</b> with six animals per <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> group. This resulted in 96 pigs in six treatments with six replicates. The diets were high (HF) and low (LF) nutrient dense feeds, where the LF was 95 % of the HF. Season affected growth; the winter animals had a significantly greater growth response, end-mass and average daily gain (ADG). The HF diet resulted in significant improved ADG, feed conversion ratio and protein deposition rate, especially during summer. However, end-mass, ADG and average protein deposition rates of controlled-fed pigs were significantly lower compared to the <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> group and single-fed animals. The hypothesis was affirmed that high-performing intact male pigs are sensitive to and affected by feeding regimens and penning conditions that will affect their production. [URL]...|$|R
