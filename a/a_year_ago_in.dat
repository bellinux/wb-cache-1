25|$|The news {{were not}} {{picked up by}} the Norwegian media until 14 August, two days after the Norwegian championships where Saidy won the King's Cup. The general {{secretary}} and the sports director of the Norwegian Athletics Association were unaware of the case, as was the Norwegian Anti-Doping Agency (Antidoping Norge). It was later discovered that the case had been sent to the Gambian Athletics Association. Saidy had been listed as a Gambian competitor in Luzern, even though he got Norwegian citizenship half <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>In</b> September the case was transferred to the Norwegian authorities.|$|E
500|$|At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Peirsol won two gold medals. [...] In {{his first}} event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol {{surprised}} many after {{he failed to}} make the final, which he attributed to a miscalculation of his own position in the semi-finals. [...] Peirsol said, [...] "I thought I was going faster. [...] I am very disappointed. I completely misjudged my race. I have to go on, pick myself up and focus on my next events." [...] But Peirsol's world record in the 100-meter backstroke would stay in place after the final. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won the gold in a time of 1:51.92, breaking his own world record of 1:53.08 by more than a second. Peirsol then competed in the 50-meter backstroke but did not advance past the heats. In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Eric Shanteau, Michael Phelps, and David Walters to win gold in a world record time of 3:27.28, lowering the old mark of 3:29.34 set <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> Beijing. While leading off the relay, Peirsol broke the championship record in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 52.19, bettering the previous mark of 52.26 set by Junya Koga.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking on {{national}} television on January 23, 2006, Foreign Minister of Ukraine Borys Tarasyuk [...] "strongly condemned the anti-Semitic actions of MAUP University" [...] and confirmed that [...] "having exhausted all efforts to convince MAUP leaders to drop their unlawful and wrongful actions" [...] he broke off contacts with University <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>In</b> its press release, the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine accused MAUP of breaking Ukrainian law, noting [...] "persistent incompliance with requirements of state licensing rules for universities, failure to abide with legally binding decisions of the State Accreditation Commission", qualifying it as [...] "a general negligence of law {{and a desire to}} pursue activities inconsistent with the status of Higher Education Institute in Ukraine".|$|E

2500|$|Fans began honoring Earnhardt {{by holding}} three fingers aloft {{on the third}} lap of every race, a black screen of No. 3 in the {{beginning}} of NASCAR Thunder 2002 before the EA Sports logo, and the television coverage of NASCAR on Fox and NASCAR on NBC went silent for each third lap from Rockingham to the following year's race there in honor of Earnhardt. On-track incidents brought out the caution flag on the third lap. Three weeks after Earnhardt's death, Harvick, driving a car that had been prepared for Earnhardt, scored his first career Cup win at Atlanta. On the final lap of the 2001 Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500, he beat Jeff Gordon by [...]006 seconds (the margin being 0.004 of a second closer than Earnhardt had won over Bobby Labonte at the same race <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago)</b> <b>in</b> an identical photo finish, and the images of Earnhardt's longtime gas man Danny [...] "Chocolate" [...] Myers crying after the victory, Harvick's tire-smoking burnout on the frontstretch with three fingers held aloft outside the driver's window; and the Fox television call by Mike Joy, Larry McReynolds, and Darrell Waltrip concluding with [...] "Just like a year ago , but he [...] is gonna get him though...Gordon got loose... it's Harvick! Harvick by inches!" [...] are memorable to many NASCAR fans. The win was also considered cathartic for a sport whose epicenter had been ripped away. Harvick would win another race at the inaugural event at Chicagoland en route to a ninth-place finish in the final points, and won Rookie of the Year honors along with the 2001 NASCAR Busch Series Championship.|$|E

6000|$|There was {{something}} unusually {{still in the}} evening ... a stillness as of waiting.

60|$|He was {{beginning}} to torture his mind with conjecture, when the door opened, and to Don Diego's increasing mystification he beheld his best suit of clothes step into the cabin.

It was dated from Paris and dreadfully ill-spelled. It contained a most passionate appeal for pecuniary assistance. She had just had a baby, she was starving and dreadfully neglected by her husband--she cursed the day she had left England. It was a most dismal production. I never heard she found means to return." ...|$|E

60|$|The air of {{the night}} was very still, but dim with a {{peculiar}} mist, which changed the moonlight into a luminous haze. In this air, or this mist, there was some quality--electrical, perhaps--which acted in strange sort upon me. I felt then as I had felt <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> England--on a night when the aurora borealis was streaming and sweeping round heaven, when, belated in lonely fields, I had paused to watch that mustering of an army with banners--that quivering of serried lances--that swift ascent of messengers from below the north star to the dark, high keystone of heaven's arch. I felt, not happy, far otherwise, but strong with reinforced strength.|$|E

[...] Then he fell to {{thinking}} how, whilst lying on such a rug (indeed, although he knew it not, it was the same), looking through the rounded beads of the wooden lattice-work of his window, he had first seen his Eastern wife walking in the orange garden with her father Ayoub. Afterwards, still recalling his youth, he began to talk of Cyprus, and so time went on until the dark was falling.|$|E

I couldn't break her of it, and I couldn't always conceal it from Sir John's knowledge. She broke out, and--and tried his {{patience}} once or twice, when he came to my office on business. Sir John excused it, not very kindly; but still he excused it. I don't complain of Sir John! I don't complain now of my wife."

60|$|I {{have not}} seen Mr. Kenyon since I wrote last. All last week I was not {{permitted}} {{to get out of}} bed, and was haunted with leeches and blisters. And in the course of it, Lady Dacre was so kind as to call here, and to leave a note instead of the personal greeting which I was not able to receive. The honor she did me <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> sending me her book, encouraged me to offer her my poems. I hesitated about doing so at first, lest it should appear as if my vanity were dreaming of a return; but Mr. Kenyon's opinion turned the balance. I was very sorry not to have seen Lady Dacre and have written a reply to her note expressive of this regret. But, after all, this inaudible voice (except in its cough) could have scarcely made her understand that I was obliged by her visit, had I been able to receive it.|$|E

Lord Mowbray's only son, Fitz-Warene, you remember him, a deuced clever fellow, he died about <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> Greece, of a fever. Never was such a blow!
