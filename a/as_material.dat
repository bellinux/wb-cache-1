5|$|Descent 3 (stylized as DescentÂ³) is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Outrage Entertainment {{and published by}} Interplay Productions. It was originally released for Microsoft Windows in North America on June 17, 1999. Descent 3 is the third game in the Descent video game series and a sequel to Descent II. The game {{takes place in a}} science fiction setting of the Solar System where the player is cast <b>as</b> <b>Material</b> Defender, a mercenary who must help an organization known as the Red Acropolis Research Team to stop robots infected by an alien virus.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep {{provide a}} wide array of raw materials. Wool {{was one of the first}} textiles, {{although}} in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies. Fleeces are used <b>as</b> <b>material</b> in making alternative products such as wool insulation. In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.|$|E
5|$|In December 1966, Hanna-Barbera Productions {{was sold}} to Taft Broadcasting (renamed Great American Communications in 1987) for $12million. Barbera and Hanna {{remained}} {{at the head of}} the company until 1991. At that point, the company {{was sold to}} the Turner Broadcasting System for an estimated $320million. Turner began using Hanna-Barbera's television catalog <b>as</b> <b>material</b> for its new Cartoon Network cable channel in 1992, and by the mid-1990s Hanna-Barbera was producing several original series for Cartoon Network, among them Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls. In 1996, Turner merged with Time Warner, owners of Warner Bros., who would eventually absorb Hanna-Barbera into Warner Bros. Animation.|$|E

5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used <b>as</b> <b>material</b> in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E

5|$|The {{manuscript}} is dated palaeographically to the 6th {{century or}} 7th century. According to Tischendorf {{it was written}} in the 6th century. Probably {{it was written in}} Italy. Nothing is known about its early history. In the 12th or 13th century four of its leaves were used <b>as</b> <b>material</b> for another book and they were overwritten by Latin text.

5|$|Traditional hunters {{used all}} parts of the walrus.

5|$|After their {{original}} religious activities ceased, Egyptian temples suffered slow decay. Many were defaced by Christians trying {{to erase the}} remnants of ancient Egyptian religion. Some temple buildings, such as the mammisi at Dendera or the hypostyle hall at Philae, were adapted into churches or other types of buildings. Most commonly the sites were left disused, as at the Temple of Khnum at Elephantine, while locals carried off their stones to serve <b>as</b> <b>material</b> for new buildings. The dismantling of temples for stone continued well into modern times. Limestone was especially useful {{as a source of}} lime, so temples built of limestone were almost all dismantled. Sandstone temples, found mostly in Upper Egypt, were more likely to survive. What humans left intact was still subject to natural weathering. Temples in desert areas could be partly covered by drifts of sand, while those near the Nile, particularly in Lower Egypt, were often buried under layers of river-borne silt. Thus, some major temple sites like Memphis were reduced to ruin, while many temples far from the Nile and centers of population remained mostly intact. With understanding of the hieroglyphic script lost, the information about Egyptian culture that was preserved in the surviving temples lay incomprehensible to the world.|$|E
5|$|Alphonse {{is guided}} by the homunculus Wrath to the {{underground}} city beneath Amestris' Central City to reopen the Gate of Alchemy. There, they are attacked by the homunculus Gluttony, who fights and mortally wounds Wrath. At Wrath's insistence, Alphonse transmutes and sacrifices the two homunculi to use <b>as</b> <b>material</b> to open the Gate. Meanwhile, in Munich, the Thule Society persuades Noah into guiding them on how to correctly open the Gate based on what she had learned from reading Edward's mind. Edward learns from Lang that the Thule Society {{plans to use the}} weapons from his world to help Adolf Hitler in his attempt to start a revolution, and heads to stop them. Hohenheim and Envy are both transmuted {{at the same time that}} Alphonse transmutes Gluttony and Wrath. With the Gate opened, Eckhart leads a fleet into the other world, where she gains the ability to use alchemy. However, she begins to go mad with power and fear of her new surroundings and launches an attack on Central City. Alfons launches Edward in a rocket-powered plane to return him to his world before being gunned down.|$|E
5|$|By 8:30 am {{a request}} went out {{summoning}} all available tugs {{to the site}} of the grounding with the hope that they would be able to free the leviathan before any further damage occurred. An attempt made by Missouris sailors on the day of the grounding met with failure, as did an initial attempt to pull Missouri back into deep water with sixteen tugboats. Before the tugs could lend any further assistance, the naval brass postponed the attempt, pending the outcome of further assessment. Missouri had traversed the shoal nearly 2,500 feet, and to compound her problem she had run aground during an unusually high tide. To add insult to injury, she had become the butt of a number of bad jokes among the American public, the Navy's rival service branches, and the Soviet Union's Atlantic fleet, who were quick to pounce upon the dreadnought's grounding <b>as</b> <b>material</b> for the naval publication Red Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Descent 3 {{takes place}} in a science fiction setting of the Solar System where the player is cast <b>as</b> <b>Material</b> Defender MD1032, a {{mercenary}} working for a corporation called the Post Terran Mining Corporation (PTMC). The game begins moments after the events of Descent II, with the Material Defender escaping the destruction of a planetoid where he was clearing PTMC's robots infected by an alien virus. He was about to return to Earth to collect his reward, but a malfunction occurred with the prototype warp drive in the ship he was piloting, making it drift towards the Sun's atmosphere. At the very last moment, the Material Defender is rescued via a tractor beam by an organization known as the Red Acropolis Research Team.|$|E
5|$|For many {{maritime}} indigenous cultures {{throughout the}} North Pacific, especially the Ainu in the Kuril Islands, the Koryaks and Itelmen of Kamchatka, the Aleut in the Aleutian Islands, the Haida of Haida Gwaii {{and a host}} of tribes on the Pacific coast of North America, the sea otter has played an important role as a cultural, as well <b>as</b> <b>material,</b> resource. In these cultures, many of which have strongly animist traditions full of legends and stories in which many aspects of the natural world are associated with spirits, the sea otter was considered particularly kin to humans. The Nuu-chah-nulth, Haida, and other First Nations of coastal British Columbia used the warm and luxurious pelts as chiefs' regalia. Sea otter pelts were given in potlatches to mark coming-of-age ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. The Aleuts carved sea otter bones for use as ornaments and in games, and used powdered sea otter baculum as a medicine for fever.|$|E
5|$|Jamaicaâ179th Street {{was opened}} on December 11, 1950, {{although}} it had been planned to be built at 178th Street as early as 1928. At the time, the Queens Boulevard Line {{was part of the}} Independent Subway System (IND), but the original IND plans did not provide for constructing the 178th Street station until the line was extended even further to Queens Village. The line opened to 169th Street, the next station south, in 1937. Various changes in plans, as well <b>as</b> <b>material</b> shortages due to the Great Depression and World War II, delayed the project until 1946. Jamaicaâ179th Street became among Queens' busiest upon its 1950 opening. After a period of deterioration, the station was renovated twice, in the 1980s and the 2000s. As a result of planning for a never-built expansion to Queens Village, the station has 8 storage tracks to its east, giving it the highest peak capacity of any New York City Subway station.|$|E

5|$|Townshend came up {{with the}} concept of Tommy after being {{introduced}} to the work of Meher Baba, and attempted to translate Baba's teachings into music. Recording on the album began in September 1968, but took six months to complete <b>as</b> <b>material</b> needed to be arranged and re-recorded in the studio. Tommy was acclaimed upon its release by critics, who hailed it as the Who's breakthrough. Its critical standing diminished slightly in later years; nonetheless, several writers view it as an important and influential album in the history of rock music. The Who promoted the album's release with an extensive tour, including a live version of Tommy, which lasted throughout 1969 and 1970. Key gigs from the tour included appearances at Woodstock, the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival, the University of Leeds, the Metropolitan Opera House and the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. The live performances of Tommy drew critical praise and rejuvenated the band's career.|$|E
