5|$|Selenium is a {{catalyst}} in some chemical reactions, {{but it is}} not widely used because of issues with toxicity. In X-ray crystallography, incorporation of one or more selenium atoms in place of sulfur helps with multiple-wavelength <b>anomalous</b> dispersion and single wavelength <b>anomalous</b> dispersion phasing.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 {{nuclear and}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA study produced a possible phylogenetic tree, although {{the position of}} the purple-bearded bee-eater appears <b>anomalous,</b> in that it appears amongst Merops species.|$|E
5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation frequently has specific requirements for X-ray crystallography. The intense ionizing radiation can cause radiation damage to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~100 K). However, {{synchrotron radiation}} frequently {{has the advantage}} of user selectable wavelengths, allowing for <b>anomalous</b> scattering experiments which maximizes <b>anomalous</b> signal. This is critical in experiments such as SAD and MAD.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anomalous</b> X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above {{and in the middle}} of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating <b>anomalous</b> scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E
5|$|The La Reforma {{volcanic}} rocks feature an <b>anomalous</b> chemistry {{resembling the}} calc-alkaline magma series, even though La Reforma {{is not a}} subduction zone volcano. This {{is consistent with the}} geochemistry of nearby Tres Virgenes, although one pyroclastic flow at La Reforma was considered peralkaline.|$|E
5|$|The idea of token {{identity}} {{is that only}} particular occurrences of mental events are identical with particular occurrences or tokenings of physical events. <b>Anomalous</b> monism (see below) and most other non-reductive physicalisms are token-identity theories. Despite these problems, there is {{a renewed interest in}} the type identity theory today, primarily due to the influence of Jaegwon Kim.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} with virtual particles also explains the small (about 0.1%) deviation of the intrinsic magnetic {{moment of the}} electron from the Bohr magneton (the <b>anomalous</b> magnetic moment). The extraordinarily precise agreement of this predicted difference with the experimentally determined value is viewed {{as one of the}} great achievements of quantum electrodynamics.|$|E
5|$|Working with Edward W. Washburn {{from the}} Bureau of Standards, Urey {{subsequently}} discovered {{the reason for}} the <b>anomalous</b> sample. Brickwedde's hydrogen had been separated from water by electrolysis, resulting in depleted sample. Moreover, Francis William Aston now reported that his calculated value for the atomic weight of hydrogen was wrong, thereby invalidating Birge and Menzel's original reasoning. The discovery of deuterium stood, however.|$|E

25|$|In popular usage, {{the term}} UFO {{came to be}} used to refer to claims of alien spacecraft. and because of the public and media ridicule {{associated}} with the topic, some investigators prefer to use such terms as unidentified aerial phenomenon (or UAP) or <b>anomalous</b> phenomena, as in the title of the National Aviation Reporting Center on <b>Anomalous</b> Phenomena (NARCAP).|$|E

25|$|The first {{application}} of BLFQ to QED solved for the electron in a two-dimensional transverse confining cavity and showed how the <b>anomalous</b> magnetic moment behaved {{as a function}} of the strength of the cavity.

25|$|In 1916, Einstein was to {{show that}} this <b>anomalous</b> {{precession}} of Mercury is explained by the spatial terms in the curvature of spacetime. Curvature in the temporal term, being simply an expression of Newtonian gravitation, has no part in explaining this <b>anomalous</b> precession. The success of his calculation was a powerful indication to Einstein's peers that {{the general theory of}} relativity could be correct.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the terrestrial Kennedy–Thorndike experiments mentioned above, Müller & Soffel (1995) and Müller et al. (1999) tested the RMS velocity dependence parameter by searching for <b>anomalous</b> distance oscillations using LLR. Since time dilation is already confirmed to high precision, a positive result would prove that light speed depends on the observer's velocity and length contraction is direction dependent (like in the other Kennedy–Thorndike experiments). However, no <b>anomalous</b> distance oscillations have been observed, with a RMS velocity dependence limit of , {{comparable to that of}} Hils and Hall (1990, see table above on the right).|$|E
