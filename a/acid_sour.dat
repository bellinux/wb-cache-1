40|$|Abstract. The sensors {{of taste}} and odor play {{important}} roles of recognition {{as well as}} reception. In our research, the taste and odor sensing capabilities {{were based on the}} photoluminescence (PL) responses of luminescent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). For the sensing of taste, [In(OH) (bdc) ]n (bdc = 1, 4 -benzenedicarboxylate) and [Tb(btc) ] (MOF- 76, btc = benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxylate), were tested on aqueous solutions of five basic tastants such as sucrose (sweet), caffeine (bitter), citric <b>acid</b> (<b>sour),</b> sodium chloride (salty) and monosodium glutamate (umami). The photoluminescence (PL) responses of polyacrylic acid-chelated [In(OH) bdc]n and lanthanide Tb(btc) were used to demonstrate the applicability of MOF-based biomimetic tongue through: (1) identification of five tastes: sweet, bitter, sour, salty and umami, by 3 -D PCA (principle component analysis) to distinguish the corresponding tastants, (2) quantification of the strength of five tastes determined by the relationships between the PL intensity and the τ scale of taste. For the sensing of odor, [In(OH) (bdc) ]n and [Zn 4 O(bdc) 3] (MOF- 5) were exposed to the odorants such as cumin, cinnamon, vanillin, p-xylene, m-xylene, o-xylene, water, and ethanol.

40|$|Although putatively taste {{has been}} {{associated}} with obesity as one of the factors governing food intake, previous studies have failed to find a consistent link between taste perception and Body Mass Index (BMI). A comprehensive comparison of both thresholds and hedonics for four basic taste modalities (sweet, salty, sour, and bitter) has only been carried out with a very small sample size in adults. In the present exploratory study, we compared 23 obese (OB; BMI > 30), and 31 lean (LN; BMI < 25) individuals on three dimensions of taste perception – recognition thresholds, intensity, and pleasantness – using different concentrations of sucrose (sweet), sodium chloride (NaCl; salty), citric <b>acid</b> (<b>sour),</b> and quinine hydrochloride (bitter) dissolved in water. Recognition thresholds were estimated with an adaptive Bayesian staircase procedure (QUEST). Intensity and pleasantness ratings were acquired using visual analogue scales (VAS). It was found that OB had lower thresholds than LN for sucrose and NaCl, indicating a higher sensitivity to sweet and salty tastes. This effect was also reflected in ratings of intensity, which were significantly higher in the OB group for the lower concentrations of sweet, salty, and sour. Calculation of Bayes factors further corroborated the differences observed with null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Overall, the results suggest that OB are more sensitive to sweet and salty, and perceive sweet, salty, and sour more intensely than LN...|$|E

40|$|Barium {{may affect}} the {{perception}} of taste intensity and palatability. Such differences are important considerations {{in the selection of}} dysphagia assessment strategies and interpretation of results. Eighty healthy women grouped by age (younger, older) and genetic taste status (supertaster, nontaster) rated intensity and palatability for seven tastants prepared in deionized water with and without 40 % w/v barium: noncarbonated and carbonated water, diluted ethanol, and high concentrations of citric <b>acid</b> (<b>sour),</b> sodium chloride (salty), caffeine (bitter), and sucrose (sweet). Mixed-model analyses explored the effects of barium, taster status, and age on perceived taste intensity and acceptability of stimuli. Barium was associated with lower taste intensity ratings for sweet, salty, and bitter tastants, higher taste intensity in carbonated water, and lower palatability in water, sweet, sour, and carbonated water. Older subjects reported lower palatability (all barium samples, sour) and higher taste intensity scores (ethanol, sweet, sour) compared to younger subjects. Supertasters reported higher taste intensity (ethanol, sweet, sour, salty, bitter) and lower palatability (ethanol, salty, bitter) than nontasters. Refusal rates were highest for younger subjects and supertasters, and for barium (regardless of tastant), bitter, and ethanol. Barium suppressed the perceived intensity of some tastes and reduced palatability. These effects are more pronounced in older subjects and supertasters, but younger supertasters are least likely to tolerate trials of barium and strong tastant solutions...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{are reported in}} which the perceptual interactions between oral pungency, evoked by CO 2, and the taste of each of four tastants—sucrose (sweet), quinine sulfate (bitter), sodium chloride (salty), and tartaric <b>acid</b> (<b>sour)</b> —were explored. In experiment 1 the effect of three concentrations of each tastant on the stimulus-response function for perceived oral pungency, {{in terms of both}} rate of change (slope) and relative position along the perceived pungency axis, was determined. In experiment 2 the effect of three concentrations of CO 2 on the stimulus-response function for the perceived taste intensity of each tastant was examined. Results show that the characteristics of the mutual effects of tastant and pungent stimulus depend on the particular tastant employed. Sucrose sweetness and CO 2 oral pungency have no mutual effect; sodium chloride saltiness or tartaric acid sourness and CO 2 oral pungency show mutual enhancement; and quinine sulfate bitterness abates CO 2 oral pungency, whereas CO 2 has a double and opposite effect on quinine sulfate bitterness—at low concentrations of bitter tastant CO 2 enhances bitterness, and at high concentrations of bitter tastant CO 2 abates bitterness. It is suggested that the perceptual attributes of saltiness and sourness are closer, from a qualitative point of view, to oral pungency than are the attributes of bitterness and sweetness...|$|E
40|$|Several {{transmitter}} candidates including serotonin (5 -HT), ATP, and norepinephrine (NE) {{have been}} identified in taste buds. Recently, c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as well as the associated synthetic enzymes and receptors have also been identified in taste cells. GABA reduces taste-evoked ATP secretion from Receptor cells and is considered to be an inhibitory transmitter in taste buds. However, to date, the identity of GABAergic taste cells and the specific stimulus for GABA release are not well understood. In the present study, we used genetically-engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably co-expressing GABAB receptors and Gaqo 5 proteins to measure GABA release from isolated taste buds. We recorded robust responses from GABA biosensors when they were positioned against taste buds isolated from mouse circumvallate papillae and the buds were depolarized with KCl or a stimulated with an <b>acid</b> (<b>sour)</b> taste. In contrast, a mixture of sweet and bitter taste stimuli did not trigger GABA release. KCl- or acid-evoked GABA secretion from taste buds was Ca 2 +-dependent; removing Ca 2 + from the bathing medium eliminated GABA secretion. Finally, we isolated individual taste cells to identify the origin of GABA secretion. GABA was released only from Presynaptic (Type III) cells and not from Receptor (Type II) cells. Previously, we reported that 5 -HT released from Presynaptic cells inhibits taste-evoked ATP secretion. Combined with the recent findings that GABA depresses taste-evoked ATP secretion [1], the present results indicate that GABA and 5 -HT are inhibitor...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Right insular cortex is {{involved}} in taste discrimination, but its functional organization is still poorly known. In general, sensory cortices represent the spatial prevalence of relevant features for each sensory modality (visual, auditory, somatosensory) in an ordered way across the cortical space. Following this analogy, we hypothesized that primary taste cortex is organized in similar ordered way in response to six tastes with known receptorial mechanisms (sweet, bitter, sour, salt, umami, CO 2). DESIGN: Ten normal subjects were enrolled in a pilot study. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), a high resolution cortical registration method, and specialized procedures of feature prevalence localization, to map fMRI responses within the right insular cortex, to water solutions of quinine hydrochloride (bitter), Acesulfamate K (sweet), sodium chloride (salt), mono potassium glutamate + inosine 5 ' mono phosphate (Umami), citric <b>acid</b> (<b>sour)</b> and carbonated water (CO 2). During an fMRI scan delivery of the solutions was applied in pseudo-random order interleaved with cleaning water. RESULTS: Two subjects were discarded due to excessive head movements. In the remaining subjects, statistically significant activations were detected in the fMRI responses to all tastes in the right insular cortex (p< 0. 05, family-wise corrected for multiple comparisons). Cortical representation of taste prevalence highlighted two spatially segregated clusters, processing two and three tastes coupled together (sweet-bitter and salt-umami-sour), with CO 2 in between. CONCLUSIONS: Cortical representation of taste prevalence within the right primary taste cortex appears to follow the ecological purpose of enhancing the discrimination between safe nutrients and harmful substances...|$|E
40|$|Taste {{perception}} depends {{not only}} on the chemical and physical properties of tastants, but may also depend on the physiological and psychological conditions of those who do the tasting. In this study, the effects of mood state on taste sensitivity was evaluated in humans who were exposed to conditions of mental or physical fatigue and tension. Taste responses to quinine sulfate (bitter), citric <b>acid</b> (<b>sour)</b> and sucrose (sweet) were tested. The intensity of the taste sensations were recorded by a computerized time-intensity (Tl) on-line system. Subjects performed mental tasks by personal computer or physical tasks by ergometer for 10 - 40 min. Before and after these sessions, the duration of the after-taste and the intensity of the sensation of taste were recorded by the Tl system, and in addition, psychological mood states were evaluated with POMS (Profile of Mood State). Tl evaluation showed that after the mental tasks, the perceived duration of bitter, sour and sweet taste sensations was shortened relative to the control. Total amount of bitterness, sourness and sweetness was also significantly reduced. Furthermore, the maximum intensity of bitterness was significantly reduced. There {{were no significant differences in}} bitterness and sweetness sensations following physical tasks. However, relative to before the physical task, the duration of the after-taste of sourness was significantly shortened by the physical task.

This study aimed to further investigate alterations in sweet food intake in rats and sucrose detection in humans after gastric bypass. Wistar rats were randomized to gastric bypass or sham-operations and preference for sucrose (sweet), sodium chloride (salty), citric <b>acid</b> (<b>sour)</b> and quinine hydrochloride (bitter) was assessed with standard two-bottle intake tests (vs. water). Intestinal T 1 R 2 and T 1 R 3 expression and plasma levels of glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP- 1) and peptide YY (PYY) were measured. Furthermore, obese patients and normal weight controls were tested for sucrose taste detection thresholds pre- and postoperatively. Visual analogue scales measuring hedonic perception {{were used to determine}} the sucrose concentration considered by patients and controls as "just about right" pre- and postoperatively. Gastric bypass reduced the sucrose intake relative to water in rats (p< 0. 001). Preoperative sucrose exposure reduced this effect. Preference or aversion for compounds representative of other taste qualities in naïve rats remained unaffected. Intestinal T 1 R 2 and T 1 R 3 expression was significantly decreased in the alimentary limb while plasma levels of GLP- 1 and PYY were elevated after bypass in rats (p= 0. 01). Bypass patients showed increased taste sensitivity to low sucrose concentrations compared with controls (p< 0. 05), but both groups considered the same sucrose concentration as "just about right" postoperatively. In conclusion, gastric bypass reduces sucrose intake relative to water in sucrose-naïve rats, but preoperative sucrose experience attenuates this effect. Changes in sucrose taste detection do not predict hedonic taste ratings of sucrose in bypass patients which remain unchanged. Thus, factors other than the unconditional affective value of the taste may also play a role in determining food preferences after gastric bypass...|$|E

40|$|The present review {{examines}} the pig {{as a model}} for physiological studies in human subjects related to nutrient sensing, appetite regulation, gut barrier function, intestinal microbiota and nutritional neuroscience. The nutrient-sensing mechanisms regarding <b>acids</b> (<b>sour),</b> carbohydrates (sweet), glutamic acid (umami) and fatty acids are conserved between humans and pigs. In contrast, pigs show limited perception of high-intensity sweeteners and NaCl and sense a wider array of amino acids than humans. Differences on bitter taste may reflect the adaptation to ecosystems. In relation to appetite regulation, plasma concentrations of cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide- 1 are similar in pigs and humans, while peptide YY in pigs is ten to twenty times higher and ghrelin two to five times lower than in humans. Pigs are an excellent model for human studies for vagal nerve function related to the hormonal regulation of food intake. Similarly, the study of gut barrier functions reveals conserved defence mechanisms between the two species particularly in functional permeability. However, human data are scant for some of the defence systems and nutritional programming. The pig model has been valuable for studying the changes in human microbiota following nutritional interventions. In particular, the use of human flora-associated pigs is a useful model for infants, but the long-term stability of the implanted human microbiota in pigs remains to be investigated. The similarity of the pig and human brain anatomy and development is paradigmatic.

This study aimed to determine the test-retest reliability of oral fatty acid thresholds. Seventeen subjects (eight males, age 31 ± 2. 3 years, BMI 22. 9 ± 0. 6 kg/m 2, nine females, age 29 ± 1. 8 years, BMI 23. 4 ± 0. 9 kg/m 2) attended 30 laboratory sessions to determine oral detection thresholds for oleic acid (C 18 : 1), linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) and lauric acid (C 12 : 0). Taste thresholds were also performed using sucrose (sweet), citric <b>acid</b> (<b>sour),</b> sodium chloride (salty), caffeine (bitter) and monosodium glutamate (umami). Each stimulus was evaluated on six occasions using ascending forced choice triangle tests, over 2 days. Diet records were also collected prior to each testing session. Fatty acid taste thresholds were determined for all subjects and strong intra-class correlations were found for within day and across day testing sessions for C 18 : 1, C 18 : 2 and C 12 : 0. The strongest correlations were found for across day testing for C 18 : 1 [intra-class correlation (ICC) = 0. 78, confidence interval (CI) = 0. 49 - 0. 91], C 18 : 2 (ICC = 0. 94, CI = 0. 84 - 0. 98) and C 12 : 0 (ICC = 0. 80, CI = 0. 54 - 0. 92).

40|$|The {{activity}} of taste cells maintained in the intact hamster tongue was monitored {{in response to}} acid stimulation by recording action currents from taste receptor cells with an extracellular "macro" patch pipette: a glass pipette was pressed over the taste pore of fungiform papillae and perfused with citric acid, hydrochloric acid, or NaCl. Because this technique restricted stimulus application to the small surface area of the apical membranes of the taste cells, many nonspecific, and potentially detrimental, effects of acid stimulation could be avoided. Acid stimulation reliably elicited fast transient currents (action currents of average amplitude, 9 pA) which were consistently smaller than those elicited by NaCl (29 pA). The frequency of action currents elicited by acid stimuli increased in a dose-dependent manner with decreasing pH from a threshold of about pH 5. 0. Acid-elicited responses were independent of K+, Na+, Cl-, or Ca 2 + at physiological (salivary) concentrations, and were unaffected by anthracene- 9 -carboxylic acid, tetraethylammonium bromide, diisothiocyanate-stilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid, vanadate, or Cd 2 +. In contrast, amiloride (< or = 30 microM) fully and reversibly suppressed acid-evoked action currents. At submaximal amiloride concentrations, the frequency and amplitude of the action currents were reduced, indicating a reduction of the taste cell apical conductance concomitant with a decrease in cell excitation. Exposure to low pH elicited, in addition to transient currents, an amiloride-sensitive sustained d. c. current. This current is apparently carried by protons instead of Na+ through amiloride-sensitive channels. When citric acid was applied while the taste bud was stimulated by NaCl, the action currents became smaller and the response resembled that produced by acid alone. Because of the strong interdependence of the acid and salt (NaCl) responses when both stimuli are applied simultaneously, {{and because of the}} similarity in the concentration dependence of amiloride block, we conclude that amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels on hamster taste receptor cells are permeable to protons and {{may play a role in}} <b>acid</b> (<b>sour)</b> taste...|$|E

A unified psychophysics?This Thesis proposes {{a means of}} unifying psychophysics. No new concepts are invoked; the model is a rearrangement of existing ideas and principles. First, it is shown that magnitude scales of sensation fail to comply with rigorous validity criteria. It is argued this occurs because the number continuum, in magnitude tasks, is perceived in a logarithmic manner. This explanation offers a means of resolving the discrepancy between magnitude and category scales. [...] A re-evaluation of the psychophysical law suggests that a valid psychophysical function may be derived from two theoretical premises: the empirical Weber function (not Weber's law), and Fechner's original assumption that just noticeable differences (JNDs) are subjectively equal. These premises specify the obsolete JND (or DL) scale. The present model also predicts, however, that a valid psychophysical function may be obtained by direct interval estimation techniques, e. g., category rating. The concomitant prediction is that, for a given modality, the psychophysical function obtained by direct interval estimation should be isomorphic with the function derived by cumulating JNDs. This isomorphism is shown to be supported by published work {{in a number of}} sensory modalities, and also to be consistent with the properly validated findings of functional measurement analysis. [...] All experiments in the Thesis were conducted in the taste modality. First, the predicted JND scale-category scale isomorphism is confirmed for taste stimuli representative of the four basic tastes: sweet, <b>acid</b> (<b>sour),</b> salty, and bitter. Methodological bias in the category rating of taste intensity is investigated and found not to be a serious problem in the present approach; nevertheless, a procedure for avoiding contextual bias is suggested and tested exper imentally. [...] A further experiment offers some support for the contention of the present model that rating scales are valid because they involve subjects matching sensation to the position on a line. Finally, in two experiments, the interaction of the sweeteners sucrose and fructose is explored using the functional measurement paradigm. Support for sweetness additivity at low concentrations provides a properly validated estimate of the psychophysical function for sucrose. This function is found to correspond well with the JND and category scales for sucrose obtained earlier, and also corroborates Fechner's assumption of the subjective equality of JNDs.

AHAs most commonly used in cosmetic applications are typically derived from food products including glycolic acid (from sugar cane), lactic <b>acid</b> (from <b>sour</b> milk), malic <b>acid</b> (from apples), citric acid (from citrus fruits) and tartaric acid (from grape wine). For any topical compound to be effective, including AHA, it must penetrate into the skin where it can act on living cells. Bioavailability (influenced primarily by small molecular size) {{is an important factor}} in a compound's ability to penetrate the top layer of the skin. Glycolic acid, having the smallest molecular size, is the AHA with greatest bioavailability and penetrates the skin most easily; this largely accounts for the popularity of this product in cosmetic applications.|$|R

It shows a clear recognition {{of the importance of}} experimentation, [...] "The first essential in chemistry is that thou shouldest perform practical work and conduct experiments, for he who performs not practical work nor makes experiments will never attain to the least degree of mastery." [...] He is credited with the use of over twenty types of now-basic chemical laboratory equipment, such as the alembic and retort, and with the description of many now-commonplace chemical processes - such as crystallisation, various forms of alchemical [...] "distillation", and substances citric <b>acid</b> (the <b>sour</b> component of lemons and other unripe fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar) and tartaric acid (from wine-making residues), arsenic, antimony and bismuth, sulfur, and mercury that have become the foundation of today's chemistry.|$|R
