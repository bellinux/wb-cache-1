500|$|When Lightning Bar {{was about}} five days old Pollard was afraid that he had leg {{problems}} and was buck-kneed, and considered putting the colt to sleep.

500|$|According to Canham, he {{met with}} Elliott in December 1968 and offered him the job of {{associate}} athletic director. [...] Canham told Elliott he could stay on as coach if he wanted, but Canham could not promise him that the job of associate athletic director would still be open in another couple of years. [...] Canham said: [...] "Bump smiled <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, ‘I don’t {{have to think about}} it.’ [...] He was ready to get out.

On learning this, Mac takes Larry aside and warns him never to get involved with a cast member of a show while in charge of it. No sooner has Mac said this than his girlfriend Betty (currently in the show across the street) auditions for the role of Carmen. The producer gives her the role. As Larry looks on with amusement, Mac accepts this professionally, then stamps off in disgust.|$|E

[...] He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers: [...] "The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I shooting at Frank McLaury." [...] Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first. Clanton missed, but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|The Field Spaniel was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} show ring by competitors who were attempting to develop an all-black Spaniel. Some of the breeding methods of those early developers were criticised; {{one of the first}} breeders of the Field Spaniel, Thomas Jacobs, said of the origin; [...] "Much has been written and said on the purity of the breed; deprecating the means I have adopted to produce them as calculated to alter a presumed type, and frequent missiles have <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my dogs from behind the hedge. But where is the pure bred black spaniel we hear so much about? Proof of the existence of the pure bred one (if there ever was one!) has not been forthcoming. Like most sporting dogs, they are the result of different crosses." ...|$|E
500|$|Barbara Steele as Elizabeth. [...] This was Steele's {{first film}} since her {{break-through}} horror performance in Mario Bava's Black Sunday (1960). [...] The actress recalled {{that she was}} [...] "in awe" [...] of Price during the production and described the filming of their final scene together as surprisingly physical: [...] "Our major confrontation where he strangles me was done in one take…He really went <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I had the bruises on my throat to prove it. [...] Afterward, he was so concerned he had hurt me—a perfect gentleman—a truly kind figure {{in spite of his}} image." [...] While watching the daily rushes of the movie, Corman became convinced that Steele's [...] "thick working class English accent" [...] was not blending well with the other cast members, so after the filming was completed he had all of her dialogue dubbed by a different actress.|$|E

500|$|In 1849, Tubman {{became ill}} again, which diminished her {{value as a}} slave. Edward Brodess tried to sell her, but {{could not find a}} buyer. Angry at him for trying to sell her and for {{continuing}} to enslave her relatives, Tubman began to pray for her owner, asking God to make him change his ways. She said later: [...] "I prayed all night long for my master till the first of March; and all the time he was bringing people to look <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> trying to sell me." [...] When it appeared as though a sale was being concluded, [...] "I changed my prayer," [...] she said. [...] "First of March I began to pray, 'Oh Lord, if you ain't never going to change that man's heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of the way.'" [...] A week later, Brodess died, and Tubman expressed regret for her earlier sentiments.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{shot on the}} streets of Los Angeles and in a studio soundstage. It begins with Frusciante {{standing}} alone on a pedestal wearing a red-and-white-striped collared shirt, brown khaki pants, brown shoes, and a purple, green and multicolored chullo, with white stitched wolves in the middle. He plays a 1966 Ocean Turquoise Fender Jaguar behind the backdrop of a desert and an inverted cloudy sky. His shadow is projected on the left and right of where he stands. Frusciante's then-girlfriend, Toni Oswald, selected his clothes that day. Frusciante remembers Van Sant's surprised, though favorable, reaction: [...] "when I got [...] Gus Van Sant was just looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> going 'God I'm so glad you wore that hat. I'm so glad you wore that shirt. Oh! Those pants are so great I'm so glad you wore those'". The video marks a significant shift in Frusciante's on-camera behavior; he no longer wished to jump around fervently as he had done in the band's prior music videos.|$|E
500|$|To Steinhauer's {{apparent}} surprise, Lody appeared nonchalant {{about the}} danger {{that he was about}} to go into. [...] "Well, after all, one might as well die that way as any other," [...] Lody said, according to Steinhauer; [...] "I shall be rendering the Fatherland a service and no other German can do more than that." [...] At a final meeting at the Anhalter Bahnhof in Berlin, Steinhauer repeated his warnings, but Lody [...] "only laughed <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> told me my fears were groundless." [...] Steinhauer regarded Lody's ability to carry out his mission as [...] "practically nil" [...] and warned the Chief of Naval Intelligence not to send him to the UK, but the warning went unheeded. He recalled that [...] "as he had specially volunteered for the task– and I must admit there were very few people in Berlin just then anxious to accompany him– they allowed him to go." ...|$|E

500|$|On 9 December 1980, McCartney {{followed}} {{the news that}} Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was [...] surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: [...] "It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for {{what appeared to be}} a superficial response. He later explained, [...] "When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, [...] "It's a drag".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make."

500|$|On May 19, Debbie Swenson {{placed a}} call to her biggest supporter, Randall van der Woning. She told him that Kaycee had not {{actually}} been her own child, but rather a foster daughter. She requested that he keep Kaycee's identity secret. Van der Woning did as requested and kept the information to himself; however, this had the side effect of allowing the Metafilter investigation to continue. As more and more evidence mounted {{that the story of}} Kaycee had been cobbled together using misdirection and borrowed facts, Swenson emailed the truth to him, and he, in turn, posted it to the In Living Colours blog on May 20: Kaycee Nicole had never existed. [...] "I didn't know the reactions would be so strong", Swenson said. [...] "I knew it was wrong and every day it ate <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I couldn't take it." [...] She now claimed that Kaycee was a composite of three people she had known with cancer, none of whom were her daughter.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{addition}} of guitarist Henry McCullough, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance {{in front of an}} audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances. McCartney later said, [...] "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe." [...] During the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour, the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material: the Little Richard cover [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the only song that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.|$|E
