The southern cutoff at Columbia Street completely excludes the Pioneer Square neighborhood, while the extension inland to First Avenue means that they consider the former warehouse district along Western Avenue and the entire Pike Place Market Historical District as part of the Central Waterfront.|$|E
25|$|In Eclipse, Bella {{agrees to}} marry Edward on the {{condition}} he will make love to her while she is still human. Edward eventually relents and <b>agrees,</b> <b>on</b> the stipulation it will only occur after they are married. The plot {{is driven by the}} machinations of the vampire Victoria, who, seeking revenge for the death of her mate James, is hunting Bella and creating new vampires to build an army. A grudging truce is made between the Cullens and the Native-American werewolf pack led by Sam Uley and Jacob Black, a friend of Bella's who was there for her when Edward broke her heart.

Ultimately, Edward accepts that Bella cares for Jacob and successfully destroys Victoria, and Bella acknowledges that Edward is {{the most important person in}} her life. Edward tells Bella that they may attempt making love before they get married, as he realizes that she spends too much of her life trying to please other people. However, she refuses his offer and agrees to doing things the way Edward initially wanted: marriage, making love, and then becoming a vampire.|$|E

500|$|In the Underworld, Proserpina, Queen of Hades, who {{has been}} deeply {{affected}} by Orfeo's singing, petitions King Plutone, her husband, for Euridice's release. Moved by her pleas, Plutone <b>agrees</b> <b>on</b> the condition that, as he leads Euridice towards the world, Orfeo must not look back. If he does, [...] "a single glance will condemn him to eternal loss". Orfeo enters, leading Euridice and singing confidently that on that day he will rest on his wife's white bosom. But as he sings a note of doubt creeps in: [...] "Who will assure me that she is following?". Perhaps, he thinks, Plutone, driven by envy, has imposed the condition through spite? Suddenly distracted by an off-stage commotion, Orfeo looks round; immediately, the image of Euridice begins to fade. She sings, despairingly: [...] "Losest thou me through too much love?" [...] and disappears. Orfeo attempts to follow her but is drawn away by an unseen force. The chorus of spirits sings that Orfeo, having overcome Hades, was in turn overcome by his passions.|$|E

500|$|Under this system, when an NPB {{player is}} [...] "posted", his NPB team notifies the MLB Commissioner and sets a posting fee not {{exceeding}} $20million. The player is then given 30days {{to negotiate with}} any MLB team {{willing to pay the}} NPB team's set posting fee. If the player <b>agrees</b> <b>on</b> contract terms with a team before the 30-day period has expired, the NPB team receives the posting fee from the signing MLB team as a transfer fee, and the player is free to play in MLB. If no MLB team comes to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee is paid, and the player's rights revert to his NPB team. The current process replaced one in which MLB held a silent auction during which MLB teams submitted sealed, uncapped bids in an attempt to win the exclusive negotiating rights with the posted player for a period of 30days. Once the highest bidding MLB team was determined, the player could then only negotiate with that team.|$|E
500|$|In a key {{episode in}} the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set's {{violation}} is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set's major characteristics, his forceful and indiscriminate sexuality. In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks {{to have sex with}} Horus, who <b>agrees</b> <b>on</b> the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength. The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus's body and makes him ill, but in [...] "Contendings", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus's semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result [...] "gives birth" [...] to the disk. In [...] "Contendings", Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; in earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.|$|E
