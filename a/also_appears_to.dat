5|$|Socioeconomic status <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> affect TBI rates; {{people with}} lower levels of {{education}} and employment and lower socioeconomic status are at greater risk.|$|E
5|$|A normal {{variation}} in the PRNP gene can modify {{the course of the}} disease by delaying the age of onset and affecting the type of symptoms that develop. This gene produces prion protein, which is active in the brain and other tissues and <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be involved in transporting copper. A role for the ApoE gene was initially suspected but could not be confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Although MUS81 is a {{component}} of a minor crossover pathway in the meiosis of budding yeast, plants and vertebrates, in the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila, MUS81 appears {{to be part of}} an essential, if not the predominant crossover pathway. The MUS81 pathway <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be the predominant crossover pathway in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.|$|E

5|$|M110 <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be {{interacting}} with the Andromeda Galaxy, and astronomers have found in the halo of the latter a stream of metal-rich stars that {{appear to have been}} stripped from these satellite galaxies. M110 does contain a dusty lane, which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation.|$|E
5|$|The King {{commissioned}} Ashmole {{to prepare}} a catalogue of the coins and medals held in the Royal Collection, and appointed him to lead a commission responsible for tracing items from the collection which had been dispersed or sold by the parliamentary regime. Ashmole <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> {{have been involved in}} the organisation of the coronation, or at least set himself up as an expert upon it.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> improve outcomes.|$|E

5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{inserted}} the entire {{text of the}} Libellus into book I of his Historia Ecclesiastica (completed ca. 731), where it makes {{up the bulk of}} chapter 27. Bede <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have relied upon the Libellus while writing his prose Vita Sancti Cuthberti in about the year 720. Where Bede acquired his copy of the Libellus is not known, but it seems that by the early eighth century it was beginning to be read widely throughout northern England.|$|E
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in 1321, possibly paying for the stone towers of the Bargate and some of the semi-circular wall towers. Work <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have begun on some stone walling to the south and west of the town, construction may have begun at the South Gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near the western docks. Later investigations by the Crown would suggest that some of the monies raised in these murage grants had been misspent, however, contributing to the poor standard of town defences, which included large gaps in the walled circuit.|$|E

5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysmâ€”a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|On the average, {{space is}} {{observed}} {{to be very}} nearly flat (close to zero curvature), meaning that Euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy {{throughout most of the}} Universe. Spacetime <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have a simply connected topology, in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent {{thousands}} of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the inner Solar System. The evolution of the outer Solar System <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.|$|E

5|$|Skeletal {{elements}} of the upper jaw {{appear to have been}} rhynchokinetic (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic premaxillae help with consuming large food items. The beak <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been able to withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food. In 2016, the first 3D endocast was made from the brain of the dodo; examination found that though the brain was similar to that of other pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large olfactory bulb. This gave the dodo a good sense of smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.|$|E
5|$|Stela 88 {{may have}} been paired with Stela 62. The {{monument}} has {{the image of a}} queen but her name is unknown. B'olon K'awiil <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be mentioned on the stela. It dates to around 751 and stands on the stairway of Structure 13. Stela 91 is another very late monument probably dating to the early 10th century. Like Stela 84, it bears an inscription that is a meaningless imitation of hieroglyphic writing.|$|E
5|$|The Edwardian castles {{also made}} strong {{symbolic}} {{statements about the}} nature of the new occupation. For example, Caernarvon was decorated with carved eagles, equipped with polygonal towers and expensive banded masonry, all designed to imitate the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power. The actual site of the castle may also have been important as it was positioned close to the former Roman fort of Segontium. The elaborate gatehouse, with an excessive five sets of doors and six portcullises, <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been designed to impress visitors and to invoke an image of an Arthurian castle, then believed to have been Byzantine in character.|$|E

50|$|A disease called Plummer-Vinson syndrome, {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} that causes a long-term iron deficiency, may {{also lead to}} Hypopharyngeal Cancer. Other factors like a deficiency in certain vitamins <b>also</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> contribute {{to this type of}} cancer.|$|R
5|$|The {{huntingtin}} protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, {{and appears to}} have multiple biological functions. The behavior of this mutated protein is not completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly in the brain. Early damage is most evident in the striatum, but as the disease progresses, {{other areas of the}} brain are also more conspicuously affected. Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical connectionsâ€”namely control over movement, mood and higher cognitive function. DNA methylation <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be changed in HD.|$|E
5|$|Walter de Beauchamp (died between 1130 and 1133) was {{a medieval}} nobleman and Sheriff of Worcestershire. Married to the {{daughter}} {{of one of his}} predecessors as sheriff. Nothing is known for sure of his background before he appears as a witness to royal charters between 1108 and 1111. Beauchamp also inherited offices in the royal household from his father-in-law, and <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been a royal forester. He and another nobleman divided some of the lands of his father-in-law, but disagreements about the division lasted until the 12th century between the two families. He died between 1130 and 1133, and one of his descendants later became Earl of Warwick.|$|E
5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump <b>also</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into {{the interior of the}} ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E
