The material for experiment was represented by crude oil, whose <b>acidity</b> <b>index</b> has been determined at once after obtaining, as well as at 5, 30 and 60 days of keeping at 4 oC (in dark and light) and at + 20 oC (in dark and light). The storage of maize and sunflower crude oils at + 4 oC and + 20 C, in dark and and light has led, comparatively with fresh samples, to increase of the <b>acidity</b> <b>index</b> after 30, and especially after 60 days. The highest values of this index have been registered after 60 days of keeeping at + 20 C.

40|$|Alfalfa is an {{important}} forage crop with high nutritive value, although highly susceptible to soil acidity. Liming {{is one of the}} most efficient and prevailing practices to correct soil acidity and improve alfalfa yield. The objective of this study was to evaluate response to liming of alfalfa grown in a greenhouse on a Typic Quartzipsamment soil. The treatments consisted of four lime rates (0, 3. 8, 6. 6 and 10. 3 Mg ha- 1) and two cuts. Alfalfa dry matter increased quadratically with increasing lime rates. In general, dry matter yield was maximized by a lime rate of 8. 0 Mg ha- 1. Except for the control, the dry matter nutrient contents in the treatments were adequate. The positive linear correlation between root and nodule dry matter with lime rates indicated improvement of these plant traits with decreasing soil acidity. The soil <b>acidity</b> <b>indices</b> pH, base saturation, Ca 2 + concentration, Mg 2 + concentration, and H + Al were relevant factors in the assessment of alfalfa yield. The magnitude of influence of these soil <b>acidity</b> <b>indices</b> on yield as determined by the coefficient of determination (R²) varied and decreased in the order: base saturation, H + Al, pH, Ca and Mg concentrations.

Methods The Al resistance of 15 species was represented by the Al activity in nutrient solution {{that resulted in a}} 50 % decrease in root length, {Al 3 +}(50), or, for published values, in root or plant biomass. The correlations between Al resistance and <b>acidity</b> or nitrogen <b>indices</b> and the correlation between Al resistance and selected traits (relative growth rate, leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area and leaf thickness) were calculated. Principal component analysis was used for the characterization of the relationships between Al resistance and measured traits. Key Results The {Al 3 +}(50) values of the resistant species Molinia caerulea and Sieglingia decumbens were 13 and 26 mu m {Al 3 +}(50), respectively. The known Al resistance of 15 species that were mainly of the intermediate strategy competitor-stress tolerator-ruderal (C-S-R) type and of the S type was correlated with Ellenberg's nitrogen and <b>acidity</b> <b>indices.</b> For the whole set of species, the correlation between Al resistance and traits was not significant. Conclusion The Al resistance of the C-S-R species was variable and independent of their traits. S-type species, adapted to acid soils and with traits of conservative strategy, displayed Al resistance.

The anti-ulcerogenic potential of this fruit was assessed using indomethacin and hypothermic restrain stress-induced ulceration models on rats at 150, 300 and 450 mg/kg dose orally. The parameters measured were gastric pH, volume, free and total <b>acidity,</b> ulcer <b>index,</b> and mucin, glutathione, super oxide dismutase, catalase and protein content. Hesperidin at 300 and 450 mg/kg dose showed significant (p < 0. 01 - 0. 001) increase in pH, decrease in <b>acidity</b> and ulcer <b>index</b> against indomethacin and hypothermic restrain stress, along with histological evidence of cytoprotection. Glutathione, super oxide dismutase, catalase and mucin levels increased significantly at 450 mg/kg (p < 0. 05 - 0. 001) after indomethacin ulceration, whereas hypothermic restrain stress only increased glutathione and mucin levels. Hesperidin prevents oxidative cell injury by significant rise of super oxide dismutase, glutathione and catalase levels in gastric mucosa. Hesperidin allowed the regeneration of ulcerated tissue, and prevented hemorrhagic injury of gastric mucosa. The potential anti-ulcer effect of hesperidin may be due to antioxidant, mucoprotective and cytoprotective activities...|$|R
