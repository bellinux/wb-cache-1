5|$|Having {{isolated}} Damascus, Khalid {{ordered his}} army to surround {{the city on}} August 21, 634 (the 20th of Jamadi-ul-Akhir, 13 Hijri). The corps commanders were instructed to repel any Byzantine attack from the respective gates, and seeking <b>assistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of heavy attack. Dharar bin al-Azwar commanded 2.000 horsemen from the mobile guard to patrol in the empty areas between the gates at night and to reinforce any corps attacked by the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|In 1534, the Ottomans under Mihalbegović laid a months-long siege with a {{constant}} concentrated cannonade to the fortress. Ferdinand urged the Pope to send ships {{to relieve the}} Ottoman siege. Although the Ottomans eventually lifted the siege, Ferdinand was displeased that the Pope had provided no <b>assistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> defense of the fortress. In 1535, the Ottomans tried to seize the fortress by treachery, and again in 1536, but they failed on both occasions. During that year the Ottomans started a new siege which would last until the final fall of the fortress.|$|E

5|$|While {{crossing}} northern Madagascar, Nadia produced widespread flooding. In Vohemar {{where it}} moved ashore, the storm destroyed most public buildings, although local churches provided <b>assistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath. Across the region, the storm downed {{power lines and}} destroyed more than 540tonnes (600tons) of rice. The cyclone killed 12people and caused about $200,000 damage (1994USD).|$|E
5|$|Bellew's Gartership also {{witnessed}} {{changes to}} {{the fabric of the}} College of Arms. Although it had survived the Blitz, structural problems with the roof and brickwork forced the heralds to decide between leaving the College's buildings on Queen Victoria Street or attempting expensive repairs. In 1954, they approached the Ministry of Works to ask for financial <b>assistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building work; the Ministry agreed to cover half the cost. A successful public appeal for the remaining funds followed and the restoration work carried out. The College of Arms Trust was established in 1956 to oversee funds for the building's maintenance.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the governor of Nueva Ecija requested then-Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos to declare his province a disaster area. Additionally, UNICEF was asked to provide water-purifying tablets. The Philippine Red Cross, Philippine government, local authorities and civic organizations provided relief <b>assistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate aftermath of the storm. Despite private appeals for up to $1.4million for reconstruction aid, the Philippine government did not submit a request for international aid. However, by October 25, eight non-government relief agencies provided relief, which totaled $1.15million. Furthermore, the government of Switzerland provided $8,061worth of aid.|$|E

Colonel Ditlev Ahlefeldt {{of the allied}} forces would not to let pride and vanity be the {{downfall}} of the attack and pleaded with Schack to attack. Shack brandished his rapier and mounted a forceful attack into the Swedish left flank. A bloody engagement ensued, but the Swedish cavalry was no match for the rested Danish forces—they fled towards Nyborg leaving the infantry defenseless. The Polish riders showed no pardon, cutting down the Swedish infantry almost to a man. The Dutch also intervened with an expeditionary fleet led by Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter.|$|E
5|$|In {{return for}} his <b>assistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war, Rome {{accepted}} Nabis' {{possession of the}} polis of Argos. While Nabis was already King of Sparta, he made his wife Apia ruler of her hometown Argos. Afterwards, Apia and Nabis staged a financial coup by confiscating large amounts of property from the wealthy families of these cities, and torturing those who resisted them; much of the confiscated land was redistributed to liberated helots loyal to Nabis. After increasing his territory and wealth by the aforementioned method, Nabis started to turn the port of Gythium into a major naval arsenal and fortified the city of Sparta. His Cretan allies were already allowed to have naval bases on Spartan territory, and from these they ventured on acts of piracy. His naval buildup offered a chance even for the very poor to participate, as rowers, in the profitable employment. However, {{the extension of the}} naval capacities at Gythium greatly displeased the abutting states of the Aegean Sea and the Roman Republic.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, the New Zealand Red Cross provided $10,000 (2004NZD) for essential relief supplies. In addition, the New Zealand government provided $70,000 for <b>assistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most affected areas, after the country's Air Force dispatched a plane over Vanuatu {{to determine the}} extent of damage. The Government of Australia similarly sent a helicopter reconnaissance mission to determine damage, as well as two planes with $200,000 (2004AUD) in relief supplies, including 2,400tarps, 2,600water containers, and 5,200packets of water purification tablets. The French government also sent a helicopter and assistance as per the 1992 FRANZ Agreement between New Zealand, Australia, and France.|$|E

5|$|Residents in some {{portions}} of the country became angry {{due to lack of}} <b>assistance.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> town of Lazaro Cardenas in Tabasco, residents opened ditches to alleviate flooding on their streets, which flooding thousands of vehicles along a section of highway near the state's capital, Villahermosa. In the capital city, which remained submerged by floodwaters for a week, residents protested the sandbagging efforts after waters were redirected to some neighborhoods. Due to the protests, police officers beat and arrested 100people. The Federal Consumer Protection Agency issued warnings to businesses accused of price gouging for water and other basic products. Isolated villages experienced food shortages due to cut off roads.|$|E
5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which people will be on the jury. It almost always entails an expert's <b>assistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm moved inland, 700 civil defense {{personnel}} were deployed to the affected region; however, due to damaged roads and poor travel conditions, they struggled to reach isolated regions. The Nicaraguan army supplied relief crews with four helicopters and two AN-2 aircraft for damage surveillance and search-and-rescue missions {{in the wake of}} Ida. The government of Nicaragua allocated roughly $4.4million in relief funds for those affected by the storm. Several agencies from the United Nations provided residents affected by the storm with relief supplies and donated disaster funds to the country. The United Nations Population Fund provided $49,000 in funds; the World Food Programme deployed several rescue vehicles and logistics teams; UNICEF also provided logistics <b>assistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. OCHA provided $2million in relief funds; the Government of Sweden provided 400,000 Swedish kronor ($55,946USD) for sanitation and health supplies; the Netherlands Red Cross also donated 20,000 euros ($27,226USD) for non-food items.|$|E

5|$|The {{second set}} of colonists disembarked from the Kennersley Castle in late March 1823. Their {{optimism}} was quickly extinguished. Hall returned in April with disheartening news: he had found no ship that could help and, far from considering them any responsibility of his, King George Frederic Augustus had not even been aware of their presence. The Kennersley Castle having sailed, MacGregor's victims could count on no <b>assistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future. The emigrants had brought ample provisions with them, including medicines, and had two doctors among them, so they were not in a totally hopeless situation, but apart from Hall none of the military officers, government officials or civil servants appointed by MacGregor made any serious attempt to organise the party.|$|E
5|$|After Myanmar's {{government}} {{failed to}} respond to the devastating effects of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, officials responded more quickly to the floods and the effects from Komen. Relief supplies were airdropped to marooned villages, assisting the Rohingya people in Rakhine. The government allocated US$1.2million toward supplying farmers with rice paddy seeds to regrow damaged crops. About half of the damaged crop was replanted by November 2015, and in most areas, the grounds remained fertile for future growing. Local businesses donated K2.06billion toward buying supplies, and businessman Aung Ko Win donated US$3.6million. The Myanmar Red Cross, which was already responding to the ongoing flooding, provided additional supplies and assisted with evacuations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted in these efforts by providing rice and blankets. Volunteers distributed sleeping mats, mosquito nets, medical supplies, and tarps. Various United Nations agencies assisted the residents in displaced camps that were affected further by Komen. Within a month of the storm, the World Food Programme had provided meals to over 450,000people. Food and oil prices rose in the weeks after the floods, and the price of rice reached record levels in the country in August and September 2015. The cost gradually declined after the next rice harvest. To help unemployed farm workers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation financed a program to pay storm victims to rebuild damaged embankments and restore clean water access. An assessment by the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Myanmar government found that women and children were the worst affected group during and after the disaster, due to the stresses of the damaged houses, and insufficient food and <b>assistance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subsequent months.|$|E
5|$|At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, and the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, {{signed the}} Quebec Agreement, which merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project {{to create a}} {{combined}} British, American and Canadian project.

John Cockcroft became {{the director of the}} joint British-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. A British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory led by James Chadwick, and later Peierls, included scientists such as Geoffrey Taylor, James Tuck, Niels Bohr, William Penney, Frisch, Ernest Titterton, and Klaus Fuchs, who was later revealed to be a spy for the Soviet Union. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.|$|E
