These animals feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to the Bering Sea. Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> gained a dominance over North Pacific right whales, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.|$|E
5|$|By 1445 Richard {{had become}} a knight, {{probably}} at Margaret of Anjou's coronation on 22April that year. He is visible in the historical record of service of King Henry VI in 1449, which makes mention of his services in a grant. He performed military service in the north with his father, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> taken part {{in the war against}} Scotland in 1448–1449. When Richard, Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father rallied to the side of King Henry VI.|$|E
5|$|During his {{backstage}} theatre job, Sellers began practising {{on a set}} {{of drums}} that belonged to the band Joe Daniels and his Hot Shots. Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited Sellers's temperament and artistic skills. Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on the drums <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> remained a jazz drummer, had he lacked his skills in mimicry and improvisation.|$|E

The anemoscope, in contrast, was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning. The instrument may have led to the other name of the tower, Tower of the Winds; however, an ancient observatory at Athens was also called the Tower of the Winds <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been the source for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|A slender chancel arch existed {{until the}} mid-19th century <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been pre-Conquest, but the {{earliest}} visible extant part {{of the church is}} the 13th-century north arcade, which may have been added to an earlier, now-lost, nave. The spire and tower date {{to the middle of the}} next century, roughly when the nave was rebuilt. Many of the windows are reticulated in a fashion popular during the early 14th century. Several medieval bequests are known: Olivia, wife of John Rossen of Quarrington, left 12 pence to the rector and church each in 1412; a donation of wool was made by another parishioner, Joan, wife of William Ward, around the same time. Later, 8 pence was left to the churchwardens by an unknown resident.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{was popular}} at Cambridge and enjoyed his time there. He {{took part in}} a variety of social engagements and became {{involved}} in other sports. These included fives, tennis, rugby union, golf and football. He captained Pembroke College at rugby and was close to playing for the full university side. Chapman continued to play rugby for Berkshire Wanderers until he was nearly 30 years old. Also for Pembroke, he played as goalkeeper in the football team <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> played for the university at hockey had he taken the sport seriously. In later years, he also displayed proficiency at tennis, in which critics thought he could have reached a high standard if motivated to do so, and golf.|$|E

5|$|Following its destruction, Nagar was rebuilt by the Akkadian empire, to form {{a center}} of the provincial administration. The city {{included}} the whole tell and a lower town at {{the southern edge of}} the mound. Two public buildings were built during the early Akkadian periods, one complex in area SS, and another in area FS. The building of area FS included its own temple <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> served as a caravanserai, being located near the northern gate of the city. The early Akkadian monarchs were occupied with internal conflicts, and Tell Brak was temporarily abandoned by Akkad at some point preceding the reign of Naram-Sin. The abandonment might be connected with an environmental event, that caused the desertification of the region.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{have been}} found in the upper Oldman Formation and lower Dinosaur Park Formation of Canada. The Oldman Formation dates to the Campanian, about 77.5 to 76.5 million years ago, and the Dinosaur Park Formation dates from 76.6 to 74.8 million years ago. Corythosaurus lived from ~77–75.7 million years ago. In the Dinosaur Park Formation C. casuarius lived from 76.6 to 75.9 mya, with C. intermedius living from 75.8 to 75.7 mya. In the Oldman Formation C. casuarius, the only species of Corythosaurus from the deposits, lived about 77 to 76.5 mya. The holotype {{specimen}} was clearly a carcass that had floated up on a beach, as Unio shells, water-worn bones, and a baenid turtle were preserved all around. Corythosaurus probably lived in a woodland forest, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> occasionally wandered into swampy areas.|$|E
5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{has been}} used by {{scientists}} in the interpretation of the evolution of lemurs and their kin. They are thought to have evolved from early adapiform primates around the Eocene or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they evolved from European adapids, but the fossil record suggests that they evolved from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the Paleocene (66 to 55mya) <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> evolved from early cercamoniines from Asia. Fossil primates such as Djebelemur, 'Anchomomys' milleri, and Plesiopithecus may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record prior to 40mya has created a conflict with molecular clock studies that suggest an older divergence between lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a ghost lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, {{a more liberal}} {{political}} climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague. He threw himself into the musical life of the city, primarily {{as a champion of}} the new genre of Czech opera. In 1866 his first two operas, The Brandenburgers in Bohemia and The Bartered Bride, were premiered at Prague's new Provisional Theatre, the latter achieving great popularity. In that same year, Smetana became the theatre's principal conductor, but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. Factions within the city's musical establishment considered his identification with the progressive ideas of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner inimical {{to the development of a}} distinctively Czech opera style. This opposition interfered with his creative work, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> hastened a decline in health that precipitated his resignation from the theatre in 1874.|$|E
5|$|Paterson Joseph as Greg Preston. Greg first {{encounters}} Abby on the motorway. His original wish is to {{be self-sufficient}} and alone, but as Abby convinces the other survivors to come together he decides to remain within the group. Greg is shown to be better prepared than most to survive in this post-virus world, having immediately assembled a range of necessities. Before the pandemic kill-off, Greg's wife had left him for a civil servant and had told Greg she was visiting Boston. At that point, she {{and their two children}} vanished. Greg later discovered that his wife possibly knew about the virus before the outbreak <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> escaped it.|$|E
5|$|The Safety Board {{believes}} that the flight crew of Flight 405 should have taken more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. The Safety Board {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.|$|E

5|$|The victors {{also found}} a golden crown among the booty. It was reputed {{to be from the}} time of the fifteenth-century Majapahit empire, during which there were reports of the use of a golden crown. The crown was handed to Captain Tack of the VOC, who insisted on {{requiring}} 1,000 Rds. before giving it to the king. This behaviour seemed to offend the king <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> contributed to Tack's death at the Mataram court in 1686. On 27 November, Hurdt presented the crown to the king, who proceeded to wear it. In an act of cultural misunderstanding, the VOC fired musket and cannon salutes, thinking the event was a coronation in the European sense. In reality, crowns did not have ceremonial importance in Javanese royal protocol. This episode attracted much attention among later historians. Dutch historian H. J. de Graaf opined that the king would later consider this event as a symbol of the European's condescension and that they were instrumental to the king's legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of betrayal by an informant, {{the source of the}} information that led the authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa Müller. Several of these suspects knew one another <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.|$|E
5|$|In 1236, Duke Vykintas led the Samogitian {{forces to}} victory in the Battle of Saule, where the Livonian Order {{suffered}} a catastrophic defeat. It seems that Vykintas did not receive support from Mindaugas. Vykintas' personal power grew. The Livonian Order {{was on the brink}} of collapse and was forced to become a branch of the Teutonic Knights. The combined Orders focused on the conquest of Samogitia, since only this land prevented them from consolidating their territories. The union of these aggressive powers could not have passed without notice in Lithuanian lands, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> furthered the unification process. In about 1239 Mindaugas took over the weakened Black Ruthenia and appointed his son Vaišvilkas to govern it. During the early 1240s, Mindaugas strengthened and established his power in various Baltic lands. In 1245, Mindaugas sent his nephews Tautvilas and Edivydas, the sons of Dausprungas and Vykintas, to conquer Smolensk, but they were unsuccessful. In 1249, an internal war erupted as Mindaugas sought to seize his nephews' and Vykintas' lands.|$|E

5|$|In 1884, Tchaikovsky {{began to}} shed his unsociability and restlessness. That March, Tsar Alexander III conferred upon him the Order of St. Vladimir (fourth class), which {{included}} a title of hereditary nobility and a personal audience with the Tsar. This {{was seen as a}} seal of official approval which advanced Tchaikovsky's social standing <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been cemented in the composer's mind by the success of his Orchestral Suite No. 3 at its January 1885 premiere in Saint Petersburg. In 1885, Alexander III requested a new production of Eugene Onegin at the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in Saint Petersburg. By having the opera staged there and not at the Mariinsky Theatre, he served notice that Tchaikovsky's music was replacing Italian opera as the official imperial art. In addition, thanks to Ivan Vsevolozhsky, Director of the Imperial Theaters and a patron of the composer, Tchaikovsky was awarded a lifetime annual pension of 3,000 rubles from the Tsar. This made him the premier court composer, in practice if not in actual title.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, {{parliament}} usually met in Stirling Castle or the Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh, which was rebuilt on {{the orders of}} Mary Queen of Scots from 1561. Charles I ordered the construction of Parliament Hall, which was built between 1633 and 1639 and remained the parliament's home until it was dissolved in 1707.

The attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and burgh commissioners joined them to form the Three Estates. It acquired significant powers over taxation, but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and other legislation. Much of the legislative business of the Scottish parliament was carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the 'Lords of the Articles', which drafted legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. Like many continental assemblies the Scottish Parliament was being called less frequently by the early sixteenth century <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been dispensed with by the crown {{had it not been for}} the series of minorities and regencies that dominated from 1513.|$|E

By the end of the Middle Ages the Parliament had evolved from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls into a 'colloquium' with a political and judicial role.
