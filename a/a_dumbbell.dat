The interchange between US223 the freeway at exit5 will also be upgraded to contain a pair of roundabouts in a configuration known as <b>a</b> <b>dumbbell</b> interchange.|$|E
5|$|An {{interchange}} {{is planned}} between MD 12 and US 113 south of Snow Hill {{in order to}} improve safety and traffic flow as a follow up to widening US 113; however, the project is currently on hold. This proposed interchange is to be <b>a</b> <b>dumbbell</b> interchange, a variation of the diamond interchange with two roundabouts on MD 12 where it intersects the ramps to US 113. The proposed cost needed to build this interchange is $24.2 million, which includes engineering, acquisition of land, and the actual construction.|$|E
5|$|Haumea {{displays}} large {{fluctuations in}} brightness {{over a period}} of 3.9 hours, which can only be explained by a rotational period of this length. This is faster than any other known equilibrium body in the Solar System, and indeed faster than any other known body larger than 100 km in diameter. While most rotating bodies in equilibrium are flattened into oblate spheroids, Haumea rotates so quickly that it is distorted into a triaxial ellipsoid. If Haumea were to rotate much more rapidly, it would distort itself into <b>a</b> <b>dumbbell</b> shape and split in two. This rapid rotation is thought to have been caused by the impact that created its satellites and collisional family.|$|E

5|$|MD32 heads {{west from}} Odenton along the {{southern}} edge of Fort George G. Meade. The freeway has <b>a</b> <b>dumbbell</b> interchange with MD198 (Laurel Fort Meade Road) just north of Tipton Airport. MD32 curves northwest and has an interchange with Samford Road, which is one of two interchanges that provide access to the NSA. The median of MD32 widens at the interchange as the eastbound ramps enter and exit on the left to a roundabout, from which Samford Road crosses the westbound lanes of MD32. Immediately to the north of a trumpet interchange with Canine Road, which provides access to the NSA, the National Vigilance Park, and the National Cryptologic Museum, the freeway has a cloverleaf interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway.|$|E
5|$|M-81 {{starts at}} a {{junction}} with M-13, {{with the two}} directions of each highway separated by a median. This central feature ends for M-81 immediately east of the intersection as the highway runs east out of Saginaw. The trunkline follows Washington Road easterly through residential subdivisions to an interchange with I-75/US23 in an industrial area of Buena Vista Township. This interchange, exit151 along the freeway, is built with roundabouts {{on either side of}} the bridge that carries Washington Road over the freeway in a variant of the diamond interchange design called <b>a</b> <b>dumbbell</b> interchange. After leaving the industrial properties on the east side of I-75/US23, M-81 follows Washington Road through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions. North of the community of Arthur, the highway intersects M-15 (Vassar Road). Further east, M-81 crosses out of Saginaw County; across the border in Tuscola County, the highway follows Saginaw Road.|$|E
5|$|MD 198 curves {{northeast}} and meets {{the northern end}} of MD 197 (Laurel Bowie Road) before crossing the Patuxent River, where the route leaves the city of Laurel and enters Anne Arundel County. The highway, now named Laurel Fort Meade Road, passes one of the main entrances to Laurel Park Racecourse and passes through Maryland City. MD 198 drops to four lanes at its partial cloverleaf interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway (unsigned MD 295) and then becomes a two-lane road a short distance east of the interchange. The state highway crosses the Little Patuxent River, then curves southeast and expands to a four-lane divided highway as it parallels MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). At the entrance to Tipton Airport, MD 198 curves north and meets MD 32 at <b>a</b> <b>dumbbell</b> interchange. The highway passes through an S-curve then reaches its northern terminus at an entrance to Fort Meade. The road continues into the military installation as Mapes Road.|$|E

5|$|Maryland and Delaware plan to {{continue}} to upgrade US 113 to introduce freeway elements and access control to improve service on the U.S. Highway. MDSHA has a Phase 5 in its US 113 divided highway project {{for the construction of}} an interchange between US113 and MD12 in Snow Hill. As of 2007, the interchange was planned to be <b>a</b> <b>dumbbell</b> interchange, a variation on the diamond interchange with roundabouts replacing the two intersections of the ramps with the crossroad. The work would include adding service roads to improve access among US 113, MD 12, Washington Street, and Brick Kiln Road. , Phase 5 was stalled in the design stage with no estimated completion date. The state has long-term plans to establish partial control of access on US 113 between Pocomoke City and {{the south end of the}} Snow Hill bypass. Once that project is complete, the only remaining stretch of US 113 in Maryland without access controls will be from Hayes Landing Road to the south end of the Berlin bypass.|$|E

Some star projectors have two balls at opposite ends of the projector like <b>a</b> <b>dumbbell.</b> In that case all stars can be shown and the view can go to either pole or anywhere between.

25|$|MD 103 {{continues}} southeast along Meadowridge Road, which meets MD 100 at <b>a</b> <b>dumbbell</b> interchange. The highway passes under Interstate 95 (I-95) with {{no access}} and passes between Meadow Ridge Memorial Park {{on the north}} and an industrial park to the south before its intersection with US 1 (Washington Boulevard). MD 103 continues east as Dorsey Road, which curves northeast and then southeast again. The route crosses Deep Run and passes through the community of Dorsey, where the highway enters Anne Arundel County by passing under CSX's Capital Subdivision, which carries MARC's Camden Line. The highway crosses a branch of Deep Run and begins to parallel the eastbound side of MD 100. MD 103's name changes to Parkway Drive South at its intersection with Coca Cola Drive, which is unsigned MD 100M and has an interchange with MD 100 immediately to the north. The state highway reaches its eastern terminus at an arbitrary point east of Race Road in a business park adjacent to MD 100's interchange with MD 295 (BaltimoreWashington Parkway) in Hanover.|$|E

500|$|Maryland Route 12 (MD 12) is a {{state highway}} on the Eastern Shore in the U.S. state of Maryland. The route runs [...] from the Virginia border south of Stockton, Worcester County, where it {{continues}} into Virginia as State Route 679 (SR 679), north to Main Street {{in the city of}} Salisbury in Wicomico County. The route is known as Snow Hill Road for most of its length and passes mostly through areas of woods and farms as well as the communities of Stockton, Girdletree, and Snow Hill. MD 12 intersects several roads including MD 366 in Stockton, U.S. Route 113 (US 113) and US 113 Business (US 113 Bus.) in Snow Hill, MD 354 in Indiantown, and US 13 near Salisbury. Portions of MD 12 near Snow Hill and Stockton existed as unnumbered state roads by 1910. When the first state highways in Maryland were designated by 1927, MD 12 was assigned to run from Stockton north to Salisbury. By 1940, the route was extended south to the Virginia border and a small incomplete portion between Snow Hill and Salisbury was finished. <b>A</b> <b>dumbbell</b> interchange is planned at the US 113 intersection; however, this project is currently on hold.|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{pressure}} versus temperature phase diagram of dimeric Janus nanoparticles using Molecular Dynamics simulations. The nanoparticle was modeled as <b>a</b> <b>dumbbells</b> particle, and have one monomer that interacts by a standard Lennard Jones potential and another monomer that is modeled using a two-length scale shoulder potential. Monomeric and dimeric systems modeled by this shoulder potential show waterlike anomalies, and we investigate if a Janus nanoparticle composed by one anomalous monomer will exhibit anomalous behavior and self-assembly structures. The {{influence of the}} non-anomalous monomer in the dimeric system properties was explored. We show that the diffusion anomaly is maintained, while the density anomaly can disappear depending on the non-anomalous monomer characteristics. As well, the self-assembled structures are affected. Our results {{are discussed in the}} basis of the distinct monomer-monomer interactions and on the two-length scale fluid characteristics...|$|R
