There are significant functional differences between diamond interchanges and arterial streets, as arterial streets serve mainly through traffic, while diamond interchanges serve mainly turning traffic. Due to these functional differences, special attention should be given to the traffic signal control. The objective of this thesis was to formulate and evaluate a strategy for integrating diamond interchange signal control and arterial street signal control. Specifically, the study attempted. to determine the conditions under which it would be beneficial to coordinate diamond interchange and arterial signal control. An approach for evaluating uncoordinated and coordinated interchange-arterial control was developed. The approach entails dividing the arterial-interchange system into three components, (i) the arterial, (ii) the interchange, and (iii) the <b>arterial.</b> <b>interchange</b> interface. The benefits of coordinated control on each of these components can be estimated by applying methodologies and heuristics developed in this thesis. The estimated performance of the three components under coordinated control must are then aggregated to estimate of the performance of the combined system under coordination. The combined performance estimate may be compared to the performance under uncoordinated control, to determine the benefits of coordination, if any. Separate strategies for coordinating diamond interchange and arterial signal control were developed for undersaturated and oversaturated conditions on the arterial and interchange. The strategy for undersaturated conditions was then tested on a hypothetical arterial-interchange system using microscopic simulation. Results indicated that the methodologies and guideline to estimate performance changes when changing from uncoordinated to coordinated control, but ideally, mesoscopic or microscopic simulate' ion should be used to accurately quantify delay differences. Nevertheless, the study indicated that under some conditions, notably particular cycle lengths, the coordination of diamond interchange and arterial signal control could be beneficial. This will be the case when the optimal cycle lengths of the arterial and interchange systems are similar-probably not differing by more than 10 to 15 seconds-and when the spacing between the interchange and the closest arterial signal is I conducive to good progression across the arterial-interchange interface...|$|E
40|$|Most highway-safety related {{research}} in the United States over the past 40 years has focused on major facilities (freeways, <b>arterials,</b> <b>interchanges</b> or intersections), or on specific treatments (traffic control devices, roadside barriers, rumble strips). Little effort {{has been devoted to}} a systematic assessment of potential safety improvements on low-volume rural roads, such as those administered by most counties, some states, and certain federal agencies. Although treatments that are safety effective on higher traffic volume facilities should also improve safety on low-volume roads, they may not be cost-effective. This paper analyzes the crash occurrence and potential safety treatments on low-volume rural roads. A safety survey was developed and distributed to a sample of those officials responsible for these roads. Using traffic volume data and traffic accidents for 1998 - 2001, potential field study sites were identified on rural state highways in New Mexico with average traffic volumes of less than 400 vehicles per day. Computer analyses of the accident data identified some common patterns among crashes on these roads. Field studies, somewhat less rigorous than road safety audits, were undertaken on nearly 300 miles of these highways for the purpose identifyin...|$|R
5000|$|Loop 303 {{currently}} {{begins at}} a stack interchange with I-10 in Goodyear as a six-lane freeway. It heads north under McDowell and Thomas Roads, then over an interchange with Indian School Road. The road heads through a farmland terrain and passes the Wildlife World Zoo near Northern Avenue. It over passes the BNSF Railway near Olive Avenue. At an interchange with Greenway Road, Route 303 enters a residential community and turns northeast, becoming a two lane highway past Clearview Boulevard. The route heads over a bridge above Grand Avenue (US 60) {{along with another}} BNSF railroad line. The route turns eastward and was recently upgraded to a six-lane freeway. It turns north near the Happy Valley Parkway interchange and then east again south of Lake Pleasant, passing through planned <b>arterial</b> <b>interchanges.</b> The freeway {{comes to an end}} at a temporary at-grade interchange (eventually to be a stack interchange with I-17 near Skunk Creek. East of this interchange, Route 303 becomes Sonoran Desert Drive. The south end from US 60 to I-10 is frequently used to bypass Grand Avenue and quickly move from Grand Avenue to Bell Road.|$|R

For example, freeways connect to <b>arterials</b> through an <b>interchange</b> {{that is designed}} for the transition.

50|$|From {{the western}} {{terminus}} at SR-126 (1900 West) in Ogden, the route is named 21st Street, a standard two-way, east - west minor <b>arterial,</b> with an <b>interchange</b> with I-15 near the west end. This {{section of the}} route is about 2 mi long. About half a mile west of the eastern terminus at SR-204 (Wall Ave), as it starts to pass over railroad tracks, the route splits into a one-way pair, with the eastbound lanes continuing as 21st street, and the westbound lanes located one block to the north as 20th Street.|$|R

It <b>interchanges</b> with Meadow Road at a partial cloverleaf interchange, where US 311 and NC 770 exit {{off to the}} east and NC 700 begins east. NC 14 and NC 87 narrow to two lanes and begin to curve to the west, intersecting many of the city's streets and paralleling the Smith River. Northwest of the city, the road intersects a former alignment of NC 87. At the Virginia state line, NC 87 and NC 14 end and the road becomes VA 87 to continue to Ridgeway, south of Martinsville.|$|R
50|$|While {{land was}} obtained, the {{expressway}} was not built, although a short connecting road built {{to connect the}} Don Valley Parkway to the Bayview Avenue Extension and Bloor Street would likely have been integrated into the project. When {{the first section of}} the Don Valley was opened from Bloor Street to Eglinton Avenue, the roadway was the southern terminus, and is still used as an on/off ramp for the Parkway. Sections of the Parkway south of the road, and north of Eglinton Avenue were opened later. The unnamed roadway is a four-lane <b>arterial</b> road with <b>interchanges</b> at either end. The interchange with the Don Valley is named the 'Chester Hill' interchange.|$|R
50|$|The Crosstown Arterial, {{signed as}} New York State Route 85, is a four-lane divided highway serving western {{sections}} of Albany, particularly the Buckingham Lake and Campus neighborhoods. Although Route 85 {{signed as a}} west-to-east route, the Crosstown Arterial portion generally moves from northeast to southwest while in the City of Albany. The arterial begins at Route 85's eastern terminus, an interchange with Interstate 90. The westbound side of the Crosstown <b>Arterial</b> has <b>interchanges</b> with Washington Avenue, the State Office Campus, Daytona Avenue (providing access to US 20/Western Avenue), and Krumkill Road. Beyond Krumkill Road just prior to crossing the NYS Thruway, the Crosstown Arterial enters the town of Bethlehem, and in that town changes from a limited access highway to a two-lane surface street, {{referred to as the}} Slingerlands Bypass. On the eastbound side, the Crosstown Arterial has slightly different exits, sharing the Krumkill Road and State Office Campus interchanges, but providing access to US 20 via Ormond Street, and lacking a Washington Avenue interchange. Instead, the final exit on the eastbound side of the Crosstown Arterial before its terminus at I-90 is an interchange with Lincoln Avenue, a surface road which terminates at the arterial. The Lincoln Avenue exit allows access to Washington Avenue via Colvin Avenue, and various side street.|$|R
