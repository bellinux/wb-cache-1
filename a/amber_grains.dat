60|$|The week passed away. On the Saturday it rained, a soft drizzling {{rain that}} held off at times. In {{one of the}} {{intervals}} Gudrun and Ursula set out for a walk, going towards Willey Water. The atmosphere was grey and translucent, the birds sang sharply on the young twigs, the earth would be quickening and hastening in growth. The two girls walked swiftly, gladly, because of the soft, subtle rush of morning that filled the wet haze. By the road the black-thorn was in blossom, white and wet, its tiny <b>amber</b> <b>grains</b> burning faintly in the white smoke of blossom. Purple twigs were darkly luminous in the grey air, high hedges glowed like living shadows, hovering nearer, coming into creation. The morning was full of a new creation.|$|E

40|$|Background: Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) is a cereal crop widely {{grown in}} the Mediterranean regions; the <b>amber</b> <b>grain</b> is mainly used for the {{production}} of pasta, couscous and typical breads. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection technologies and high-throughput mutation induction represent a new challenge in wheat breeding to identify allelic variation in large populations. The TILLING strategy makes use of traditional chemical mutagenesis followed by screening for single base mismatches to identify novel mutant loci. Although TILLING has been combined to several sensitive pre-screening methods for SNP analysis, most rely on expensive equipment. Recently, a new low cost and time saving DHPLC protocol has been used in molecular human diagnostic to detect unknown mutations. Results: In this work, we developed a new durum wheat TILLING population (cv. Marco Aurelio) using 0. 70 - 0. 85 % ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). To investigate the efficiency of the mutagenic treatments, a pilot screening was carried out on 1, 140 mutant lines focusing on two target genes (Lycopene epsilon-cyclase, ε-LCY, and Lycopene beta-cyclase, β-LCY) involved in carotenoid metabolism in wheat grains. We simplify the heteroduplex detection by two low cost methods: the enzymatic cleavage (CelI) /agarose gel technique and the denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). The CelI/agarose gel approach allowed us to identify 31 mutations, whereas the DHPLC procedure detected a total of 46 mutations for both genes. All detected mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. The estimated overall mutation frequency for the pilot assay by the DHPLC methodology resulted to be of 1 / 77 kb, representing a high probability to detect interesting mutations in the target genes. Conclusion: We demonstrated the applicability and efficiency of a new strategy for the detection of induced variability. We produced and characterized a new durum wheat TILLING population useful for a better understanding of key gene functions. The availability of this tool together with TILLING technique will expand the polymorphisms in candidate genes of agronomically important traits in wheat...|$|R

5000|$|A {{review in}} Allmusic commented, [...] "Appropriately stoic and expansive, the main theme for Captain America: The First Avenger feels both {{familiar}} and iconic, arriving {{early in the}} soundtrack (as all good superhero themes must) on a foundation of rolling military snares, sepia-toned brass, and long strings that evoke an endless sea of <b>amber</b> waves of <b>grain.</b> It’s enjoyable and effective, but not groundbreaking, which pretty much sums up the score as a whole. Bombastic, melodramatic, and steeped in late-'70s/early-'80s big-budget adventure cinema, the Captain is well served here, even if it all feels a little old-fashioned at times. That said, it is awfully nice to hear a well-conducted orchestra, {{as opposed to a}} room full of expensive computers and keyboards, churn out a big traditional action score, and few do that as well as Silvestri." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{view from}} Pikes Peak is breathtaking. Situated where the Great Plains meets the Rocky Mountains, one {{feels as if}} the whole nation is laid out before you. It is the perfect vantage point from which to write an {{inspirational}} anthem to the environmental magnificence of the United States. In the summer of 1893, Katherine Lee Bates, a Wellesley College English professor, sat on the summit of Pikes Peak, inspired by the panorama to pen the words to 2 ̆ 2 America the Beautiful. 2 ̆ 2 Her poem was set to the tune 2 ̆ 2 Materna 2 ̆ 2 by Samuel Augustus Ward two years later to become one of our nation 2 ̆ 7 s most beloved anthems. Today her words are so ingrained in the American mind that one is hard pressed to read them without recalling the accompanying tune: 2 ̆ 2 O beautiful for spacious skies, / For <b>amber</b> waves of <b>grain,</b> / For purple mountain majesties / Above the fruited plain! 2 ̆ 2 Many educated Americans {{in the first half of}} the eighteenth century held an opinion that differed greatly from Bates 2 ̆ 7 s description of America 2 ̆ 7 s plains, considering the vast steppe between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains a Great American Desert that posed a barrier to westward expansion. The Stephen Long Expedition of 1820 did more to promulgate this idea than any other source. Thomas Say, the mission 2 ̆ 7 s zoologist, reported that the group dreaded the journey across 2 ̆ 2 the trackless desert which still separated [them] from the utmost boundary of civilization. 2 ̆ 2 Dr. Edwin James, the official chronicler of the expedition, stated that the explorers passed through 2 ̆ 2 a barren and desolate region. 2 ̆ 2 In his account, James claimed that beyond the ninety-sixth meridian travelers could expect a 2 ̆ 2 wide sandy desert, stretching westward to the base of the Rocky Mountains. 2 ̆ 2 The official report was illustrated by a map labeling the Great Plains as the 2 ̆ 2 Great American Desert. 2 ̆ 2 After the accounts and report of the expedition were made public, the number of textbook references to the Plains as a desert jumped dramatically. The debate over who accepted this description and how long it dominated geographical thought has been hotly contested. For this reason the Long Expedition will forever be known for its description of the Plains as a Great American Desert. While modern scholars have taken an interest in Long 2 ̆ 7 s exploration, neither they nor earlier historians investigated the origins of the expedition 2 ̆ 7 s conclusions. When we consider the factors that influenced the journalists of this mission to label the Plains a 2 ̆ 2 sandy waste, 2 ̆ 2 we get a more complete picture of the military exploration undertaken by Stephen Long and his men. Long 2 ̆ 7 s expedition greatly influenced the perception of the Plains in the nineteenth century. Culture, education, and experience influences how people perceive a region. These factors guided 2 ̆ 2 the Long party 2 ̆ 7 s portrayal of the Southern Plains. My investigation explores the role that culture, education, and experience play in influencing how people perceive a region. 2 ̆...|$|R
