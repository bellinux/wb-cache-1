5|$|The Czech {{government}} {{had made a}} decision to introduce a central registry for all misdemeanors in October 2014, planning to have the system working within two years. As police are obliged to revoke a gun license when the licensee has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> years, the central registry of misdemeanors might have allowed police to effectively revoke the license long before the murders.|$|E

5|$|After {{releasing}} The Sting (1986) and Electro Reggae (1987) {{as members}} of their Taxi Gang band, Sly and Robbie enlisted Laswell again to work on Rhythm Killers. They recorded the album over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> months at Quad Recording in New York City. Before entering the studio, Sly and Robbie originally had planned music and demos to work with, but scrapped them after Chris Blackwell of Island discouraged the idea. Blackwell wanted the duo {{to come up with}} original material at the studio, as they had been known to do since their early years in Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Resurrection was {{originally}} {{set for a}} Christmas 2004 release. However, Square Enix issued a cease-and-desist letter to Resurrection Games before the release for trademark and copyright infringement. Faced with a threat of legal action, the project was publicly closed on September 6, 2004. According to the development team, the website of the project had received significant hits from Square Enix Japanese IP addresses for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> months before the letter issuing. They assumed these visits were mostly from employees rather than top executives, and hoped the company would see the demo as how the team sees it, a tribute to Chrono Trigger rather than a replacement.|$|E
5|$|Goldsmith scored The Motion Picture over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> to four months, a {{relatively}} relaxed schedule compared to typical production, but time pressures resulted in Goldsmith bringing on colleagues {{to assist in}} the work. Alexander Courage, composer of the original Star Trek theme, provided arrangements to accompany Kirk's log entries, while Fred Steiner wrote eleven cues of additional music, notably the music to accompany the Enterprise achieving warp speed and first meeting V'Ger. The rush to finish the rest of the film impacted the score. The final recording session finished at 2:00 am on December 1, only five days before the film's release.|$|E

5|$|In 1873, Coolsma {{published}} a grammar of the Sundanese language, titled Handleiding bij de beoefening der Soendaneesche taal (Manual for the Writing of the Sundanese Language). He reluctantly used a transcription method developed by K.F. Holle and proscribed by the colonial government. That {{year he was}} tasked with translating the New Testament into Sundanese. He left his school {{in the hands of}} fellow missionary D. J. van der Linden and went to Sumedang; there he worked on his translation over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> years.|$|E
5|$|In August 1930 Cardinal Liénart {{assigned}} Lefebvre to be assistant curate in {{a parish}} in Lomme, {{a suburb of}} Lille. Even before this, Lefebvre had already asked to be released for missionary duties {{as a member of}} the Holy Ghost Fathers. But the cardinal insisted that he consider this for a year while he engaged in parish work in the Diocese of Lille. In July 1931 Liénart released Lefebvre from the diocese. In September Lefebvre entered the novitiate of the Holy Ghost Fathers at Orly. A year later, on 8 September 1932, he took simple vows for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> years.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1916, McGee {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force for service during the First World War.

He was advanced to lance corporal on 22 May. On finalising its primary training, the 40th Battalion embarked for the United Kingdom on 1 July, with McGee aboard HMAT Berrima. Arriving seven weeks later, the battalion was dispatched to Salisbury Plain to complete an additional period of training in preparation of its deployment to the Western Front.|$|E

5|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} sparse {{through most of}} the life of the railway. In 1905, three trains per day ran from Goole to Haxey Junction and back, with a {{separate}} train operating on the Fockerby Branch. By November, only the morning and evening train ran, except on Wednesdays. A coal strike in 1912 resulted in all services being withdrawn except on Wednesdays and Saturdays for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> weeks. At a public meeting held in October 1920, users complained about the poor service and the lack of trucks to carry goods. The chairman of the Isle of Axholme Rural District Council was particularly exasperated by the fact that the trains arrived at Haxey Junction shortly after the trains on the other line had departed.|$|E
5|$|Peggy was {{introduced}} {{as a guest}} character in April 1991, by executive producer Michael Ferguson. The character was brought in {{as the mother of}} the already established Mitchell clan: Phil (Steve McFadden), Grant (Ross Kemp) and Sam (Danniella Westbrook). Specifically, she {{played a key role in}} a storyline about the elopement of her daughter Sam with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). Peggy was played by actress Jo Warne for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> months, but was written out upon the completion of the storyline. Two other actresses had been cast in the part before Warne. The first quit before she could film any scenes, and the second filmed eight episodes, though all of her scenes were scrapped before broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Sjumandjaja {{was born}} in Batavia on 5 August 1934. The fifth of eight children, Sjumandjaja was ethnically Javanese but soon became {{accustomed}} to the local Betawi culture. He studied Quran reading for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> days, but stopped after numerous disagreements with the teacher. When he was ten years old, his father died, leaving Sjumandjaja to be raised by his mother. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies from 1942 to 1945, he witnessed several forced labourers being beaten to death near his home during the construction of Kemayoran Airport.|$|E

A matha (hut) in a forest is ideal, but any private place that is free from distractions, high winds or intense {{sunshine}} is a good location for yoga. Either a pad made of kusha grass or a solid ground with deer skin mat on it, is desirable. Yoga can be learned, {{with the help of}} a teacher, within three to four months if practiced six times a day. If frequent practice is not possible, yoga can be mastered over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> to four years.|$|E

Appointments are made by the President on the advice of the Cabinet. If the President does not concur with Cabinet's advice, he may veto appointments. However, he is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers ("CPA"), and if the CPA does not concur with his view, Parliament may override his decision with a resolution passed with a two-thirds majority vote. The President has no power to remove current PCMR members.|$|E
5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{painting}} on millboard by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It depicts a wrestling match between a black man and a white man, both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature.

Slovenia and Croatia agreed to suspend activities stemming from their 25 June declarations of independence for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> months. The document also resolved border control and customs inspection issues regarding Slovenia's borders, resolved air-traffic control responsibility and mandated an exchange of prisoners of war. The Brioni Agreement also formed the basis for an observer mission to monitor implementation of the agreement in Slovenia. Eleven days after the agreement was made, the federal government pulled the JNA out of Slovenia. Conversely, the agreement made no mitigating impact on fighting in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The group {{recorded}} with Finn over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> months at numerous locations in their hometown of San Diego and in Los Angeles. Finn was key in producing the fast-paced, melodic mixes, creating pop punk {{with a more}} radio-friendly, accessible polish. Lyrically, the album is inspired by adolescent frustration and relationships. Guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus primarily culled stories from friends and autobiographical situations to craft summery tracks revolving around breakups, suburban parties and maturity, {{as well as more}} offbeat subject matter such as UFO conspiracy theories. The cover artwork for Enema of the State features porn star Janine Lindemulder famously clad in a nurse uniform, and the title is a pun on the term enemy of the state.|$|E
5|$|By 1933, Alabama again {{switched}} conferences, {{joining the}} SEC as a charter member. Alabama {{won the first}} SEC title in 1933 and its fourth and fifth national championship in the 1934 and 1941 seasons. After winning five national championships and nine conference championships through 1946, Alabama saw a decline between 1946 and 1957 and captured a single conference title. After they only won four games over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> seasons, Bear Bryant was hired as head coach in 1958. Under his guidance Alabama won thirteen SEC championships and national championships in the 1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978 and 1979 seasons. After the retirement of Bryant in 1982, Alabama had two coaches, and won one SEC championship before Gene Stallings was hired in 1990. Stallings coached Alabama for seven years, won a national championship in 1992 season, an SEC championship that same season, and four SEC West Division titles. His retirement {{was followed by a}} succession of four coaches who only won one SEC championship among them.|$|E
