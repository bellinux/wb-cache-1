5|$|On {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Agnew resumed his legal studies, and secured a job <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>law</b> clerk with the Baltimore firm of Smith and Barrett.

There were already many ambitious young Democrats in Baltimore and its suburbs, whereas competent, personable Republicans were scarcer. Agnew took Barrett's advice; on moving with his wife and children to the Baltimore suburb of Lutherville in 1947, he registered as a Republican, though he did not immediately become involved in politics.|$|E

5|$|After the {{resignation}} of Lord Oaksey in 1956 Denning was offered a job <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Law</b> Lord. After a period of contemplation (he worried that such an appointment would reduce his chances of becoming Master of the Rolls or Lord Chief Justice) he accepted, and was formally offered the job on 5 April 1957. He was appointed on 24 April 1957, as Baron Denning, of Whitchurch in the County of Southampton; for the supporters of his coat of arms he chose Lord Mansfield and Sir Edward Coke. Many members of the judiciary and the Bar approved of his appointment, but he was warned that he should move slowly to reform the court. During {{his time in the}} House of Lords he also served as Chairman of the Quarter Sessions of East Sussex. During his time in the House of Lords Denning frequently expressed dissenting opinions. Denning did not enjoy his time in the House of Lords and clashed frequently with Viscount Simonds, who was known as a conservative and orthodox judge. Despite his reputation as a fiercely individual judge, Denning dissented in only 16% of cases he heard in the House of Lords; fewer than Lord Keith, who dissented 22% of the time. On 9 May 1960, Denning was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex.|$|E
5|$|By the 14thcentury, Norwich {{was one of}} {{the largest}} and most prosperous cities in England, and Norwich Market was a major trading hub. Control of, and income from, the market was ceded by the monarchy to the city of Norwich in 1341, from which time it {{provided}} a significant source of income for the local council. Freed from royal control, the market was reorganised to benefit the city as much as possible. Norwich and the surrounding region were devastated by plague and famine in the latter half of the 14thcentury, with the population falling by over 50%. Following the plague years, Norwich came under the control of local merchants and the economy was rebuilt. In the early 15thcentury, a Guildhall was built next to the market to serve as a centre for local government and law enforcement. The largest surviving mediaeval civic building in Britain outside London, it remained the seat of local government until 1938 and in use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>law</b> court until 1985.|$|E
