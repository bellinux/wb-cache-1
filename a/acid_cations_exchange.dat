In this study a new technology is proposed, {{which is based on}} ammonium concentration from municipal wastewater by ion exchange followed by biological removal of ammonium from the concentrated stream by partial nitritation/Anammox process. In experiments on ammonium concentration four the most common ion exchange materials were tested in packed bed columns, namely strong and weak <b>acid</b> <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> resins, natural and synthetic zeolites. Experiments with synthetic wastewaters with different content and municipal wastewater showed that strong <b>acid</b> <b>cation</b> resin is the most suitable for ammonium concentration from municipal wastewater due to its high exchange capacity and fast regeneration. Since NaCl was used for regeneration of ion exchange materials, spent regenerant had elevated salinity. Experiments with activity determination showed that both nitritation and Anammox bacteria are inhibited by NaCl, where effect on Anammox bacteria is more severe. Adaptation of partial nitritation/Anammox biomass was studied using two strategies of salinity increase and it was possible to adapt the biomass to NaCl content of 10 - 15 g/L. The technology was tested in batch mode using strong <b>acid</b> <b>cation</b> resin for ammonium concentration from pretreated municipal wastewater, and partial nitritation/Anammox biomass for nitrogen removal from concentrated stream.

The Pitzer activity coefficient model was used for the liquid phase and an empirical model for the adsorbed phase activity coefficients. Separation of concentrated acid lignocellulosic hydrolysates on an elastic strong <b>acid</b> <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> resin was used as a test system. The application is relevant in biorefineries when polysaccharides in wood are hydrolyzed to monosaccharides using concentrated sulfuric acid.

The predictions of the thermodynamic model were validated with dynamic column experiments (pulse injections and loading/elution curves).

In this thesis, chromatographic separation of valuable compounds using ion exchange resins was studied on an industrial scale. Of special interest were rare monosaccharides in biomass hydrolysates. A novel chromatographic separation process was developed for fucose, starting from pre-processed spent sulfite liquor. The core of the process consists of three chromatographic separations with different types of ion exchange resins. Chromatographic separation of galactose was tested with three biomass hydrolysates; lactose, gum arabic and hemicellulose hydrolysates. It was demonstrated that also galactose can be separated from complex carbohydrate mixtures. A recovery process for arabinose from citrus pectin liquid residual and for mannose from wood pulp hydrolysate were also developed and experimentally verified.

Surface horizon samples of a Typic Acrorthox and a Typic Tropohumult from Puerto Rico, a strong <b>acid</b> <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> resin (Dowex 50 W- 8), and an amorphous Al(OH) 3 were used. Heats for K/Ca exchange on the Dowex resin and the Oxisol, and K/Na exchange on the Ultisol, were consistent with literature values that were obtained using conventional batch calorimetry or derived from the temperature dependence of the exchange constant. Although peak areas associated with a given pair of exchange reactions were equal, peak shapes were generally not equivalent, indicating differences in the rate at which the two reactions occurred. For example, Ca displacing exchangeable K occurred more rapidly than the reverse reaction on the Dowex resin. The reaction of phosphate with the Ultisol and amorphous Al(OH) 3 was exothermic. Exposure of the soil to several cycles of phosphate was sufficient to saturate the sorption sites, as evidenced by the loss of a detectable heat signal. However, phosphate reactive sites were regenerated by flushing the column with a salt solution at pH 10. Precipitation of Al-phosphate was shown to be endothermic, confirming that precipitation was not the primary mechanism for phosphate sorption in this study.

In addition to high total dissolved solids (TDS), shale gas-produced brines typically contain elevated concentrations of radium (Ra), which must be treated properly to prevent contamination of surface waters and allow for safe disposal or reuse of produced water. Treatment strategies that isolate radium in the lowest volume waste streams would be desirable to reduce disposal cost and generate useful treatment by-products. The present study evaluates the potential of a commercial strong <b>acid</b> <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> resin for removing Ra 2 + from high-TDS brines using fixed-bed column reactors. Column reactors were operated with varying brine chemistries and salinities in an effort to find optimal conditions for Ra 2 + removal through ion exchange.

Results showed that Ra 2 + removal by the resin strongly depended on the TDS concentration and could be improved with careful selection of EDTA concentration.

Amberlite resin showed a higher metal ion adsorption capacity for the Na(I) ion (25. 03 mg/g) than poly(amidoxime) fibre (16. 40 mg/g) due to its higher exchange capacity. The adsorption capacity of Ca(II), Mg(II), and Na(I) in the adsorbent increased with an increase in poly(amidoxime) alkali treatment reaction time. The uptake of the alkali or alkaline earth metals was shown to be independent of pH, hence the amidoxime functionalized fibres do not exhibit any pH dependent selectivity for Na(I) ions and Amberlite being a strong <b>acid</b> <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> resin is not affected by pH. The kinetics of the fibrecation ion interaction, however, was found to be sufficiently rapid reaching equilibrium in 10 - 20 mins as compared to the resin which reaches equilibrium in 30 - 40 min. The advantage of a faster rate of equilibrium is achieved because of the fibrous configuration of the polymer backbone which allows for more rapid kinetics than resin bead type backbones...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis {{is a concept}} of zero liquid {{discharge}} for nanofiltration technology in drinking water treatment. Nanofiltration, defined as a process between Ultrafiltration (UF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO), is a rapidly emerging technology. The origin of NF membranes {{can be traced back}} to the late 1950 s when it was developed to treat sea water. Now it is applied in drinking water treatment, wastewater treatment and oil separation and also in the food industry. It is even called the future process of 21 st century. However, nanofiltration is also a controversial process because of the concentrate problem, especially for inland installations. In the Netherlands, this problem is more considerable due to the need of high quality of drinking water and the decreasing quality of the surface water. Concentrate contains high concentrations of dissolved organic and inorganic compounds in high concentration. The conventional approach of concentrate discharge to surface water becomes a growing problem due to the environmental guidelines from the authorities. The discharge of the concentrate is not the only problem. It is also a cost problem that 20 % of the feed water is wasted. In the Netherlands, taxes are paid for extracted groundwater. Also the pretreatment is costly. So with every m 3 discharged concentrate money is wasted. Therefore, there is a need for a technology by which the discharge of concentrate is not necessary. That is so-called Zero Liquid Discharge Technology. The primary problem to be solved with zero liquid discharge is the recovery. We expect through an innovative technology the nanofiltration membrane installation can be operated at very high recovery (99 %) without increasing the treatment cost of drinking water. The cost for residuals treatment and disposal can be minimized because the amount of the concentrate is decreased about 20 times. A series of pretreatment processes is used for removing the scaling components from the feed water. The scaling components mainly include bivalent ions, silica and etc. Preventing fouling and scaling can guarantee a constant flux, reduce membrane area, lower chemical cleaning frequency, extend the lifespan of membrane and decrease energy consumption. In this research, a pilot experiment was performed with sludge softening, sedimentation, weak <b>acid</b> <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> and nanofiltration at Kiwa Water Research. By using this treatment process, the recovery can be handled successfully at 99 % for at least 11 days. The pretreatment concept can remove the bivalent ions completely. Sludge softening is used to remove most of the bivalent ions, like calcium, magnesium and barium. The remaining bivalent ions can be effectively removed by weak <b>acid</b> <b>cation</b> <b>exchange.</b> In this way, the waste stream from the ion exchange is reduced. In theory, silica can be removed by sludge softening at high pH as the co-precipitation of of Mg(OH) 2 and CaCO 3. But in this experiment the removal efficiency of silica is low probably due to the shortage of magnesium in the feed water. After this treatment process, the remaining concentrate (1 %) 3 is evaporated, only remaining salt which can be sold or discharged to a waste facility. In order to improve and guarantee the good performance of silica removal by sludge softening, a jar test is performed to define the influencing factor for silica removal. pH and the magnesium concentration can influence the silica removal efficiency. Higher magnesium concentration is necessary for silica removal. Also, a ternary ion exchange model is needed to predict the breakthrough of cation concentration in order to guarantee the good quality of the feed water for nanofiltration. A ternary system is more complex than binary system. This short report can not include all the aspects of this model. This is the first step to build a ternary model. In the first phase, the basic equation has been already found. The basic model concept has been built up, but needs to be checked and improved. And some batch experiments have been done to obtain model parameters like equilibrium constants and kinetic constants. Also two groups of column experiments have been done in order to measure breakthrough curves for Ca 2 +, Na+ and H+(pH). The experimental result is expected to be compared with the model result in the future. The pretreatment concept consisting of sludge softening at high pH (around 10), weak <b>acid</b> <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> in series can remove calcium, magnesium and barium completely. The calcium removal by the ion exchange is quite good. After pH breakthrough is reached, calcium still can be removed by the resin because it is exchanged with the sodium on the resin. With high magnesium concentration, silica concentration also can be reduced by the sludge softening to some extent. This combination of the treatment processes is possible to make the recovery of NF membrane reach 99 % without scaling at least for 11 days. To put this innovative concept into practice needs lots of efforts on validation and testing. Stable operation of pilot experiment at 99 % for a longer time is needed to check the feasibility of this concept. It is interesting and significant work. With increasing demand of drinking water, more and more people in this world needs this kind of technology to improve their living condition and environment. We expect the occurrence of this new big step of drinking water treatment technology. Sanitary EngineeringWatermanagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

In this work, esterification of butyl cellosolve with acetic <b>acid</b> using <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> resin Amberlyst- 15 is investigated in a chromatographic reactor. The study involves determining the appropriate kinetic model for the reaction by performing experiments at different temperatures, mole ratios of the reactants, catalyst loadings and stirring speeds. Characterization of the adsorption capacity of the resin for different components involved in the reaction is performed through adsorption experiments for the non-reactive binaries. The combined separation-reaction process is experimentally investigated using a fixed bed chromatographic column.

In decontamination processes operated in the regenerative mode, the ion-exchange resin {{is also used}} for regenerating the spent formulation. Normally, the <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> resin is used during the regeneration stage of the process. During decontamination, the chemical formulation dissolves the contaminated metal oxide film from the system surfaces. The complexants present in the formulation form complexes with the metal ions thus released and keep them in solution. An investigation {{has been carried out}} to study the ion-exchange reaction among the complexants, the metal complexes of interest to decontamination, and the <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> resin.

A soillandscape organization pattern was developed using a geomorphopedological approach. Anthropogenic, climatic and topographic factors were identified as the main soil forming factors. Soil capability and associated edaphic constraints were assessed and the main soil types were identified and classified using FAO protocols. Spatial patterns of soil fertility appear quite homogeneous. Soils are <b>acid</b> and <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> capacity and nutrient reserves are generally low. The agro-ecosystem has largely been developed by the Hani population. This agro-ecosystem has succeeded in maintaining a relatively dynamic nutrient circulation system. Current research is focusing on: (i) {{the evaluation of the}} representativeness of the studied area compared to the whole terraced system in the Yuanyang terraced landscape; (ii) measurements of nutrients flows at the field scale; (iii) the effects of soil properties on crop yields; and (iv) up-scaling field levels results to larger spatial units.
