50|$|A grow {{light or}} plant light is an <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> <b>source,</b> {{generally}} an electric light, designed to stimulate plant growth by emitting an electromagnetic spectrum appropriate for photosynthesis. Grow lights {{are used in}} applications where there is either no naturally occurring light, or where supplemental light is required. For example, in the winter months when the available hours of daylight may be insufficient for the desired plant growth, lights are used to extend the time the plants receive light. If plants do not receive enough light, they will grow long and spindly.|$|E

50|$|A {{relatively}} new rating designation for sun protective {{textiles and clothing}} is UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor), which represents the ratio of sunburn-causing UV measured without and with {{the protection of the}} fabric. For example, a fabric rated UPF 30 means that, if 30 units of UV fall on the fabric, only 1 unit will pass through to the skin. A UPF 30 fabric that blocks 29 out of 30 units of UV is therefore blocking 96.7%. Unlike SPF (Sun Protection Factor) measurements that traditionally use human sunburn testing, UPF is measured using a laboratory instrument (spectrophotometer or spectroradiometer) and an <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> <b>source,</b> and then applying a sunburn weighting curve (erythemal action spectrum) across the relevant UV wavelengths. Theoretically, human SPF testing and instrument UPF testing both generate comparable measurements of a product's ability to protect against sunburn.|$|E

50|$|The Faroese {{physician}} Niels Finsen {{is believed}} to be the father of modern phototherapy. He developed the first <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> for this purpose. Finsen used short wavelength light to treat lupus vulgaris, a skin infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. He thought that the beneficial effect was due to ultraviolet light killing the bacteria, but recent studies showed that his lens and filter system did not allow such short wavelengths to pass through, leading instead to the conclusion that light of approximately 400 nanometers generated reactive oxygen that would kill the bacteria. Finsen also used red light to treat smallpox lesions. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1903. Scientific evidence for some of his treatments is lacking, and later eradication of smallpox and development of antibiotics for tuberculosis rendered light therapy obsolete for these diseases.|$|E

30|$|In general, {{lighting}} in 3 -D rendered images such as VR and CR is {{a function}} of ambient, diffuse, and specular light properties. In both techniques, the brightness of each voxel is defined by the distribution of these light properties, which results in different lighting of different body parts relative to the <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> introduced into the volume, giving rise to 3 -D impressions of the images. In VR, the differences in light emitted to the voxels are rather small. In contrast, CR uses a more complex lighting model taking into account the effect of lighting for other voxels and subsequent reflections as well. Also, the effect of body parts blocking the trace from the <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> to other structures introduces shadowing into the images. As a result of the differences in lighting functions—as being illustrated in the representative image examples of this pictorial review—CR images go along with a more natural image impression as compared to conventional VR.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Capturing {{image in}} {{underwater}} is challenging due to haze caused by light that is reflected from surface and is deflected and scattered by water particles. Color changes due to light attenuated for different wavelength. This paper proposes a novel systematic approach to enhance underwater images by a dehazing algorithm, {{to compensate the}} attenuation discrepancy along the propagation path, and to take {{the influence of the}} possible presence of an <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> into consideration. Once the depth map, i. e., distances between the objects and the camera, is estimated,the foreground and background within a scene are segmented. The light intensities of foreground and background are compared to determine whether an <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> is employed during the image capturing process. After compensating the effect of artificial light, the haze phenomenon and discrepancy in wavelength attenuation along the underwater propagation path to camera are corrected. Next, the water depth in the image scene is estimated according to the residual energy ratios of different color channels existing in the background light. Based on the amount of attenuation corresponding to each light wavelength, color change compensation is conducted to restore color balance. Effect of noise is also reduced by using the frequency filter. Using this technique the visibility and color of the image can be enhanced...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This study {{concerns}} a hybrid illumination device that applied lighting by sunlight, natural light, and {{light emitting diode}} (LED), artificial light. The device may provide natural light to all places needing sunlight by effectively using lighting and induction instruments at daytime and supply illumination using LED, an <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> <b>source,</b> at nighttime. In addition, LED illumination may replace natural light in areas where natural light is hard to reach during daytime. This study examines a hybrid illumination device that may control intensity of illumination both at daytime and at nighttime. Sunlight varies by season; It has diversity according to changes in weather and in altitude of the sun. Therefore, the device {{may be used as}} constant, natural indoor illumination by controlling the intensity of illumination with LED lighting, assistant illumination, during daytime and major illumination during nighttime. This technology may utilize massive amounts of new and renewable energies radiated to the earth, may efficiently save energies used for existing illumination devices, and is eco-friendly. Such hybrid illuminator may be applied to a diversity of structures for growth of plants and animals that need light and for energy saving. The <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> part was made possible to adjust mol of photons at a range between 0 and 100 %, thereby being able to grow various kinds of plants using mol of photons needed for their photosynthesis...|$|E
