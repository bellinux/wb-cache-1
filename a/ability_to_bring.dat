A review in the The Moving Picture World was positive to the moral lesson the film asserted and found the acting to be satisfactory.

The child's influence and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> sense to her father was seen as cheap theatrics, but ended with the assertion that the film was not second rate for employing such theatrics. The New York Dramatic Mirror was positive, but said that the scene upon which the little girl follows her father was not believable because she was unaware of her father's intentions to kill himself. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

This paper presents a case study of a large UK-based fashion retailer, and uses managerial discretion theory to develop a novel understanding of line managers’ contribution to the implementation of HRM practices. We describe three distinct ways in which line managers engage with HRM policies and procedures, and propose that line managers make an important contribution to the effective implementation of HRM systems through exerting their cognitive and political <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about decisions that are well suited to their local situations. Moreover, we find that HR specialists design and manage HRM policies and procedures to afford different levels of managerial discretion in different areas of HRM...|$|R
