5|$|After {{capturing}} Fort Duperre, the commandos received {{reports that}} <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> some 2,000 Zouaves were {{moving up to}} recapture the position. The French attack did not eventuate, however, {{and in the end}} the commandos marched all the way to Maison Blanche. Having only been issued with rations for a day, they had to rely on fruit and bread that they obtained by bartering with the locals on the way. Eventually they arrived at the port, where they embarked upon the destroyers HMS Wheatland and Lammerton and in company with <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> US Rangers they set out to capture the airfields at Allerlick and Duzzerville, near Bone.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the significance of}} sensitivity analysis {{as a basis for}} the dynamic synthesis of compliant mechanisms. Based on the results obtained from the sensitivity analysis, four models were developed and simulation results show that for model 1, at a frequency of 44. 5 rad/s, the mechanism yielded <b>a</b> median <b>force</b> <b>of</b> 135. 4 N with <b>a</b> <b>force</b> variance of± 0. 3 N, for model 2, at a frequency of 41. 5 rad/s, it yielded <b>a</b> median <b>force</b> <b>of</b> 91. 9 N with <b>a</b> <b>force</b> variance <b>of</b> ± 0. 4 N, for model 3, at a frequency of 35 rad/s, the compliant slider mechanism yielded <b>a</b> median <b>force</b> <b>of</b> 92. 7 N with <b>a</b> <b>force</b> variance <b>of</b> ± 1. 8 N and for model 4, at a frequency of 44 rad/s, it yielded <b>a</b> median <b>force</b> <b>of</b> 73. 4 N with <b>a</b> <b>force</b> variance <b>of</b> ± 0. 3 N. The results obtained shows the effectiveness of this method in improving the dynamic behavior of compliant mechanisms and also shows that, depending on what attributes are most desirable, the compliant slider mechanism parameters can be optimized to achieve the desired results...|$|R

Results for various plunge depths, weld speeds, rotational speed, and tool configurations will be presented.

5|$|The Battle of Lechaeum (391 BC) was an Athenian {{victory in}} the Corinthian War. In the battle, the Athenian general Iphicrates took {{advantage}} of the fact that a Spartan hoplite regiment operating near Corinth was moving in the open without the protection of any missile throwing troops. He decided to ambush it with his force of javelin throwers, or peltasts. By launching repeated hit-and-run attacks against the Spartan formation, Iphicrates and his men were able to wear the Spartans down, eventually routing them and killing just under half. This marked one of the first occasions in Greek military history on which <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> peltasts had defeated <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> hoplites (heavy infantry).|$|E
5|$|The Scots {{assembled}} <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> about 12,000, some {{of which}} were returned veterans of the Thirty Years War, led by Alexander Leslie, formerly the Field Marshal of the Swedish Army. Charles gathered <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> perhaps 20,000, many of which were ill-trained militia. There were a series of minor actions in the north of Scotland, which secured the Covenanter's rear against Royalist support and skirmishing on the border. As neither side wished to push the matter to a full military conflict, a temporary settlement was concluded, known as the Pacification of Berwick in June 1639, and the First Bishops' War ended with the Covenanters retaining control of the country.|$|E
5|$|A North Korean {{tank column}} {{equipped}} with ex-Soviet T-34/85 tanks overran {{the task force}} in the first encounter and continued its advance south. After the North Korean tank column had breached U.S. lines the Task Force opened fire on <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> some 5,000 North Korean infantry approaching its position, temporarily holding up the North Korean advance. North Korean troops eventually flanked and overwhelmed American positions and {{the remnants of the}} task force retreated in disorder.|$|E
