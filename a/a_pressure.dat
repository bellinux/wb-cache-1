Nonetheless, the pressure remains too high to list Opal {{as one of the}} ten strongest Atlantic tropical cyclones. Presently, Hurricane Wilma is the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, after reaching an intensity of 882mbar (hPa; 26.05inHg) in October2005; this also made Wilma the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide outside of the West Pacific, where seven tropical cyclones have been recorded to intensify to lower pressures.

40|$|Annealing {{was carried}} out at 950 and 1120 degreesC under various <b>As</b> <b>pressure</b> for undoped (ND) semi-insulating (SI) LECGaAs. The effects of {{annealing}} on native defects and electrical properties were investigated. Experimental results indicate that, after an annealing at 950 degreesC for 14 h under low <b>As</b> <b>pressure,</b> the Hall mobility decreases and the resistivity increases dramatically for the samples. These changes in electrical properties are due to the generation of intrinsic acceptor defects, and the generation of the intrinsic acceptor defects originates from the outdiffusion of As interstitial at high temperature. The generation of the intrinsic defects and these changes in electrical properties can be suppressed by increasing the applied <b>As</b> <b>pressure</b> during annealing. The concentration of the main donor defect E 12 (AsGaVGa) can be decreased by about one order of magnitude by an evacuated annealing at 1120 degreesC for 2 - 8 h followed by a fast cooling.

Although located closer {{to the center of}} Tingting, Rota reported lower winds than Guam; the highest sustained wind reached 70km/h (44mph) with gusts of 93km/h (58mph). Due to the lack of sufficient observations on Tinian, the highest sustained winds recorded were suspected to be lower than what they really were. Winds of 56km/h (35mph) were recorded several times with gusts to 84km/h (52mph). Sustained winds on Saipan were recorded up to 100km/h (62mph) with gusts to 124km/h (77mph); <b>a</b> <b>pressure</b> of 984.9hPa (mbar) was also recorded.

5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is negligible (<b>a</b> <b>pressure</b> rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E
