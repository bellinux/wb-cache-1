25|$|DirectSound3D (DS3D) is an {{extension}} to DirectSound introduced with DirectX 3 in 1996 with the intention to standardize 3D audio in Windows. DirectSound3D allows software developers to utilize audio by writing once for a single audio API instead of rewriting code numerous times to work for each <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> vendor.|$|E
25|$|Although Windows Driver Model (WDM) was {{available}} starting with Windows 98, few <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> manufacturers used it. Due to internal buffering, KMixer introduced significant processing latency (30 ms on then-current systems). Windows 98 {{also includes a}} WDM streaming class driver (Stream.sys) to address these real time multimedia data stream processing requirements. When the sound card uses a custom driver for use with the system supplied port class driver PortCls.sys or implements a mini-driver for use with the streaming class driver, applications can bypass the KMixer completely and use the kernel streaming interfaces instead to reduce latency.|$|E

50|$|The <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> was {{designed}} with standard CMOS logic ICs and used hardware {{to perform an}} audio data compression algorithm named ECAM, based on the critical bands masking principle, a property of the human ear. Today the same principle is used in all major lossy audio compression codecs. The <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> was plugged into an ISA slot of the PC and worked using direct memory access to the host memory. The driver and the client application were developed by Gustavo Pesci, while the hardware {{was designed}} by Ricardo Sidoti and Elio Demaria.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, the Company {{introduced}} its first commercial product, The CAT, a peripheral device which provides audio capability for personal computers. In 1993 and 1994, the Company introduced additional products, including CATBoard, a full duplex <b>audio</b> <b>card,</b> an internal <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> that provides high level compression. Net sales {{of these products}} totaled approximately $0.3 million, $0.4 Million and $0.2 Million in 1993, 1994 and {{the first nine months}} of 1995, respectively, and the Company did not expect to recognize significant revenues from sales of these products in the future.|$|E
5000|$|Ensoniq Soundscape S-2000 The {{original}} Soundscape was Ensoniq's first direct {{foray into}} the PC sound card market. It was a full-length ISA digital audio and 'wavetable' sample-based synthesis <b>audio</b> <b>card,</b> equipped with a 2MB Ensoniq-built ROM-based patch set.|$|E
50|$|In {{the period}} from 1985 to 1995 when Amiga audio (which was {{standard}} in Amiga computers) was of greater quality than other standard home computers, PC compatible systems began to be equipped with 8-bit <b>audio</b> <b>cards</b> inserted into 16 bit ISA bus slots. Soundtracker Module files were used on PC computers and were considered the only serious 8bit audio standard for creating music. The worldwide usage of these programs {{led to the creation}} of the so-called MOD-scene which was considered part of the demoscene. Eventually the PC world evolved to 16-bit <b>audio</b> <b>cards,</b> and Mod files were slowly abandoned. Various Amiga and PC games (such as Worms) supported Mod as their internal standard for generating music and audio effects.|$|R
5000|$|Early PC {{games were}} {{distributed}} on floppy disks, {{and the small}} size of MIDI files made them a viable means of providing soundtracks. Games of the DOS and early Windows eras typically required compatibility with either Ad Lib or Sound Blaster <b>audio</b> <b>cards.</b> These cards used FM synthesis, which generates sound through modulation of sine waves. John Chowning, the technique's pioneer, theorized that the technology would be capable of accurate recreation of any sound if enough sine waves were used, but budget computer <b>audio</b> <b>cards</b> performed FM synthesis with only two sine waves. Combined with the cards' 8-bit audio, this resulted in a sound described as [...] "artificial" [...] and [...] "primitive".|$|R
50|$|Nowadays with {{invention}} of the MP3 bit compression technology and standard <b>audio</b> <b>cards</b> {{there are a lot}} of automation software providers at the market. Some systems includes Administration facilities for the traffic department, Disc Jockey schedule, Live Assist windows and even Artificial Intelligence automation control.|$|R
50|$|Another unique {{feature of}} the TTM 57SL {{is that it can}} also be used as a {{standalone}} sound card, also known as an <b>audio</b> <b>card.</b> The TTM 57SL has a sound card integrated that can be used through the USB cable when not using Serato.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, THX {{was owned}} by sound card {{manufacturer}} Creative Technology Limited, which held a 60% share of the company. The company {{has had a long}} history with Creative, which was responsible for the creation of the first THX-certified <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> for computers, the Sound Blaster Audigy 2.|$|E
5000|$|Reasons {{for that}} might have been the lack of {{standardized}} and fully functional <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> standards by 1997 (AC'97 was not standardized yet, and most sound cards were partially functioning [...] "Soundblaster clones" [...] which lacked even full duplex capabilities) and the lack of CPU power on entry-level PC's.|$|E
50|$|Out of {{the current}} models (as of August 2007), only the Mac Pro and Xserve feature PCIe slots and {{standard}} hard drive bays for easy upgradability. The PCIe slots allow addition of (for example) RAID controllers, video <b>cards,</b> or specialty <b>audio</b> <b>cards.</b> The MacBook Pro features a PCIe slot, {{in the form of}} a single ExpressCard/34 slot.|$|R
50|$|Like the just-earlier Amiga model, the 3000, the A4000 {{has four}} {{internal}} 32-bit Zorro III expansion slots. This expansion bus allows {{the use of}} devices which comply with the AutoConfig standard, such as graphic <b>cards,</b> <b>audio</b> <b>cards,</b> network cards, SCSI controllers, and later even USB controllers. One of the most notable hardware items of the era is the NewTek Video Toaster system which became popular in the 1990s for amateur and commercial desktop video production of standard-definition broadcast quality video, consisting of tools for video switching, chroma keying, character generation, animation, and image manipulation.|$|R
50|$|Decillionix was {{a company}} based in Sunnyvale, California which sold {{computer}} music hardware and software in the mid-1980s. Its first product was the DX-1 for the Apple II, sold in 1983. The DX-1 consisted of a monophonic 8-bit <b>audio</b> input <b>card,</b> a monophonic 8-bit <b>audio</b> output <b>card,</b> and the DX-1 Effects II software. Decillionix later produced MIDI software and hardware.|$|R

5000|$|Sim Wong Hoo ( [...] ; born 1955) is the founder, CEO and Chairman of Creative Technology, a {{designer}} and manufacturer of products for personal computers and personal digital entertainment devices. Creative is notable for {{products such as}} the SoundBlaster <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> and the Creative ZEN range of audio and media products.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, the AICC {{produced}} a digital audio interoperability specification for DOS based platforms. This specification allowed multiple CBT vendors {{to use a}} single <b>audio</b> <b>card.</b> AICC audio drivers were produced for Elan, SoundBlaster(tm), WICAT, and other audio cards. A large number of older legacy CBT applications still use this specification today.|$|E
50|$|EAX 4.0 is {{supported}} by Sound Blaster Audigy 2 and the X-Fi Xtreme <b>Audio</b> sound <b>cards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Support for {{third-party}} <b>audio</b> <b>cards</b> was vendor-dependent, {{until the}} creation and adoption of AHI as a de facto standard. AHI offers improved functionality, such as seamless audio playback from a user-selected audio device, standardized functionality for audio recording and efficient software mixing routines for combining multiple sound channels, thus overcoming the four-channel hardware limit of the original Amiga chipset. AHI can be installed separately on AmigaOS v2.0 and later.|$|R
25|$|The DirectX team {{faced the}} {{challenging}} task of testing each DirectX release against {{an array of}} computer hardware and software. A variety of different graphics <b>cards,</b> <b>audio</b> <b>cards,</b> motherboards, CPUs, input devices, games, and other multimedia applications were tested with each beta and final release. The DirectX team also built and distributed tests that allowed the hardware industry to confirm that new hardware designs and driver releases would be compatible with DirectX.|$|R
