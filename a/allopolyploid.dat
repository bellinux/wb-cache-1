5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An <b>allopolyploid</b> plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and <b>allopolyploid</b> plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid <b>allopolyploid,</b> while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E
5|$|In The American Species of Crepis, Babcock and Stebbins {{described}} {{the concept of}} the polyploid complex, and its role in plant evolution. Some genera, such as Crepis, have a complex of reproductive forms that center on sexually diploid populations that have also given rise to polyploid ones. Babcock and Stebbins also observed that <b>allopolyploid</b> types formed from the hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or autotetraploid species, and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They also showed that hybridization in the polyploid complex could provide a mechanism for genetic exchange between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed. Their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all these complex processes could provide information on the history of a genus. This monograph was described by Swedish botanist Åke Gustafsson as the most important work on the formation of species during that period.|$|E

In 1902, Margaret Slosson hybridized A.rhizophyllum and A.platyneuron in pure culture to produce specimens effectively identical to A.×ebenoides, one of the first uses of this technique to demonstrate the parentage of a natural hybrid fern.

25|$|Autopolyploids possess {{at least}} three {{homologous}} chromosome sets, {{which can lead to}} high rates of multivalent pairing during meiosis (particularly in recently formed autopolyploids, a.k.a. neopolyploids) and an associated decrease in fertility due to the production of aneuploid gametes. Natural or artificial selection for fertility can quickly stabilize meiosis in autopolyploids by restoring bivalent pairing during meiosis, but the high degree of homology among duplicated chromosomes causes autopolyploids to display polysomic inheritance. This trait is often used as a diagnostic criterion to distinguish autopolyploids from allopolyploids, which commonly display disomic inheritance after they progress past the neopolyploid stage. While most polyploid species are unambiguously characterized as either autopolyploid or <b>allopolyploid,</b> these categories represent the ends of a spectrum between of divergence between parental subgenomes.

In reviewing the characteristics of the species in 1982, Wagner and his collaborators noted that as a hybrid, the name of the species was more correctly written Asplenium×ebenoides, according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. However, they preferred to use Wherry's combination of ×Asplenosorus ebenoides. (A change in the ICBN in 1972 rendered a Latin diagnosis for ×Asplenosorus unnecessary.)

40|$|Abstract. — Polyploidy, the {{duplication}} of entire genomes, {{plays a major}} role in plant evolution. In <b>allopolyploids,</b> genome duplication is associated with hybridization between two or more divergent genomes. Successive hybridization and poly-ploidization events can build up species complexes of <b>allopolyploids</b> with complicated network-like histories, and the evolutionary history of many plant groups cannot be adequately represented by phylogenetic trees because of such retic-ulate events. The history of complex genome mergings within a high-polyploid species complex in the genus Cerastium (Caryophyllaceae) is here untangled by the use of a network algorithm and noncoding sequences of a low-copy number gene. The resulting network illustrates how hybridization and polyploidization have acted as key evolutionary processes in creating a plant group where high-level <b>allopolyploids</b> clearly outnumber extant parental genomes. [Allopolyploidy; low-copy number gene; network construction; reticulate evolution. ] Polyploidy is increasingly recognized as an important process in plant evolution; it has occurred extensively during the evolution of angiosperms and it is consid-ered a major mechanism of adaptation and speciation (Soltis et al., 2003).

2500|$|Allopolyploids or amphipolyploids or heteropolyploids [...] are polyploids with {{chromosomes}} {{derived from}} {{two or more}} diverged taxa. As in autopolyploidy, this primarily occurs through the fusion of unreduced (2n) gametes, which can take place before or after hybridization. In the former case, unreduced gametes from each diploid taxa – or reduced gametes from two autotetraploid taxa – combine to form <b>allopolyploid</b> offspring. In the latter case, one or more diploid F1 hybrids produce unreduced gametes that fuse to form <b>allopolyploid</b> progeny. Hybridization followed by genome duplication {{may be a more}} common path to allopolyploidy because F1 hybrids between taxa often have relatively high rates of unreduced gamete formation – divergence between the genomes of the two taxa result in abnormal pairing between homoeologous chromosomes or nondisjunction during meiosis. In this case, allopolyploidy can actually restore normal, bivalent meiotic pairing by providing each homoeologous chromosome with its own homologue. If divergence between homoeologous chromosomes is even across the two subgenomes, this can theoretically result in rapid restoration of bivalent pairing and disomic inheritance following allopolyploidization. However multivalent pairing is common in many recently formed allopolyploids, so {{it is likely that the}} majority of meiotic stabilization occurs gradually through selection.|$|E

40|$|Genome-wide {{analysis}} has documented differential gene expression between {{closely related species}} in plants and animals and nonadditive gene expression in hybrids and <b>allopolyploids</b> compared to the parents. In Arabidopsis, 15 - 43 % of genes are expressed differently between the related species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa, the majority of which are nonadditively expressed (differently from mid-parent value) in allotetraploids. Nonadditive gene expression {{can be caused by}} transcriptional regulation through chromatin modifications, but the role of posttranscriptional regulation in nonadditive gene expression is largely unknown. Here we reported genome-wide analysis of mRNA decay in resynthesized Arabidopsis allotetraploids. Among ∼ 26, 000 annotated genes, over 1 % of gene transcripts showed rapid decay with an estimated half-life of less than 60 minutes, and they are called allotetraploid genes with unstable transcripts (AlloGUTs). Remarkably, 30 % of alloGUTs matched the nonadditively expressed genes, and their expression levels were negatively correlated with the decay rate. Compared to all genes, these nonadditively expressed alloGUTs were overrepresented 2 - 6 -fold in the Gene Ontology (GOSlim) classifications in response to abiotic and biotic stresses, signal transduction, and transcription. Interestingly, the AlloGUTs include transcription factor genes that are highly inducible under stress conditions and circadian clock regulators that regulate growth in A. thaliana. These data suggest a role of mRNA stability in homoeologous gene expression in Arabidopsis <b>allopolyploids.</b> The enrichment of nonadditively expressed genes in stress-related pathways were commonly observed in Arabidopsis and other <b>allopolyploids</b> such as wheat and cotton, which may suggest a role for stress-mediated growth vigor in hybrids and <b>allopolyploids...</b>|$|R
