40|$|Abstract—Pitch {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters to describe the speech characteristics. The paper proposed a new pitch detection algorithm for ultra-low-bit-rate vocoder based on dynamic programming as well as frequency-time domain analysis to eliminate the multi-half <b>pitch</b> <b>errors.</b> The algorithm detected the candidate pitches based on auto correlation function firstly and then utilized the dynamic programming and frequency-time domain analysis to get the final pitch. Simulation result showed that the algorithm had a better performance and could eliminate the multi-half <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> efficiently.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the music-reading errors of 6 [...] 13 -year-old piano students (n = 35) as they read three unfamiliar musical pieces. The musical pieces were similar in terms of tonality, and rhythmic and melodic complexity, but differed in terms of simultaneity of left- and right hand and complexity of left-hand arrangement. <b>Pitch</b> <b>errors</b> were examined in terms of frequency, placement, and type. Of all pitches played, 23 % were incorrect pitches. However, 30 % of the incorrect pitches were followed by an immediate correction (self-correction). There were significantly more errors made in the left-hand parts than in right-hand parts of all three pieces. The most common error type was erroneous pitches, followed by redundant and omitted <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> respectively. Erroneous <b>pitches</b> were significantly more often contour preserving than contour violating. The younger children made significantly more redundant <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> and contour violating <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> than did the older children and the younger children tended to make more self-corrections than did the older children. Timing data were examined {{in terms of the}} length of performances {{and in terms of the}} length and frequency of pauses. No significant differences were found between pieces or age groups in terms of timing. A high frequency of pauses was noted in both age groups. Evidence drawn from <b>pitch</b> and timing <b>errors</b> suggested that the children in this study tried to play all the pitches in the score with little or no consideration for the rhythmic information in the score. This finding was in accordance with results of previous studies on children and music reading. Implications for music education and research are discussed...|$|R

50|$|In music theory, an {{interval}} {{is the difference}} between two pitches. An interval may be described as horizontal, linear, or melodic if it refers to successively sounding tones, such as two <b>adjacent</b> <b>pitches</b> in a melody, and vertical or harmonic if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones, such as in a chord.|$|R

30|$|A pitch {{analysis}} {{searches for}} likely <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> in separated voices. The evaluator identifies <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> by applying a hidden Markov model using an nGram technique on a transformed data set to find unlikely pitch intervals. It transforms the data into an appropriate alphabet by first categorizing notes as being long, medium, short or simultaneous, {{based on the}} tempo of the piece. Rather than processing raw pitches, it extracts the interval between two pitches and scales it to an octave. For example, if a note with a long inter-offset-interval moves from C to E, in this alphabet it is represented as a long major third. Thus, the alphabet consists of duration and interval tuples.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{analysing}} {{the influence of}} profile errors upon load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness of spur gears is proposed. The analysis is based upon a static, two-dimensional finite element approach. The contacts between mating gear teeth are identified in the deformed state, and the nodal point density permits contact pressure distribution emulation for moderate to high load levels. In addition, artificial neural networks are employed for system identification in order to calculate load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness trends for low tooth load levels. The effect of tip relief on load-sharing properties is discussed. The contact force and the transmission error are simulated for two medium-quality spur gears where the profile and <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> are known. Experimental data validate {{the reliability of the}} approach. The contact ratio is shown to be highly load dependent due to profile and <b>pitch</b> <b>errors.</b> The discussion is focused upon the size of the area where the relation between torque and angular displacement is highly non-linear, i. e. load depending. Hence, the contact ratio is shown to be load depending due to geometrical errors, such as profile and <b>pitch</b> <b>errors,</b> in addition to material elasticity...|$|R
30|$|A music teacher’s {{ability to}} assess {{students}} {{has been well}} researched. The type of training a music teacher receives affects the kinds of errors a teacher detects. For example, band teachers are more attuned to rhythm errors whereas choir teachers are more attuned to <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> (Stambaugh 2016). Several factors affect a teacher’s ability to detect a <b>pitch</b> <b>error,</b> such as {{the size of the}} interval between a pitch and the previous pitch (Groulx 2013). Discrepancies in assessment arise when assessing the performance of an entire piece of music compared to splitting it into pieces and evaluating each section individually (Darrow 2006). Assessment becomes even more difficult when the teacher must compare a performance to the memory of another performance from a previous lesson.|$|R
50|$|Audio {{synchronizers}} {{that use}} variable speed reading are generally preferred in professional applications. The control of audio delay is generally more accurate and more easily accomplished. <b>Pitch</b> <b>errors</b> in lower performance devices are uncompensated and {{kept to a}} level generally not perceived by the average viewer, by limiting the amount of change of reading speed. Typically the change limit is {{in the order of}} 0.2%. Unfortunately, this limits the rate of delay change and when large video delay changes occur the slow tracking rate of these uncompensated synchronizers can cause the audio video sync to be off for several seconds or minutes until the audio delay catches up with the video delay. Additionally, listeners with excellent pitch perception may notice and be annoyed by even these small <b>pitch</b> <b>errors.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{processing}} {{principle is}} proposed for finding the pitches and separating the spectra of concurrent musical sounds. The principle, spectral smoothness, {{is used in}} the human auditory system which separates sounds partly by assuming that the spectral envelopes of real sounds are continuous. Both theoretical and experimental evidence is presented for the vital importance of spectral smoothness in resolving sound mixtures. Three algorithms of varying complexity are described which successfully implement the new principle. In validation experiments, random pitch and sound source combinations were analyzed in a single time frame. Number of simultaneous sounds ranged from one to six, database comprising sung vowels and 26 musical instruments. Usage of a specific yet straightforward smoothing operation corrected approximately half of the <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> that occurred in a system which was otherwise identical but did not use the smoothness principle.

30|$|The nGram {{approach}} to finding <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> requires a dataset for training. The training data comes from Classical piano music in MIDI format {{transformed into the}} pitch analyzer’s alphabet. This transformation was done by converting the notes’ pitches to intervals, and comparing their inter-onset-intervals to the tempo. The pitch analyzer uses this data to calculate the probabilities of 3 -g. After converting a performance to our alphabet, the evaluator determines {{the likelihood of a}} note given its predecessors. The evaluator flags improbable notes – sequences of three notes for which their 3 -g probability is below a configurable threshold – as being unlikely. This threshold was set by examining the 3 -g probabilities, and choosing a threshold that allowed the majority of observed 3 -g. By dividing the number of likely errors by the number of notes, the evaluator calculates a normalized <b>error</b> rate for <b>pitch</b> <b>errors.</b>|$|R
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} {{technique}} for reconstructing an acoustic speech signal solely from {{a stream of}} mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). Previous speech reconstruction methods have required an additional pitch element, but this work proposes two maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods for predicting pitch from the MFCC vectors themselves. The first method {{is based on a}} Gaussian mixture model (GMM) while the second scheme utilises the temporal correlation available from a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework. A formal measurement of both frame classification accuracy and RMS <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> shows that an HMM-based scheme with 5 clusters per state is able to correctly classify over 94 % of frames and has an RMS <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> of 3. 1 Hz in comparison to a reference pitch. Informal listening tests and analysis of spectrograms reveals that speech reconstructed solely from the MFCC vectors is almost indistinguishable from that using the reference pitch. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{inspection}} {{of each individual}} tooth element of a spur gear wheel can be a tedious and expensive process. Two methods of composite gear testing are available, namely, the single flank rolling gear test and the dual flank rolling gear test. The first method is well documented, but the dual flank system tends to have been neglected, few papers being available on the subject. As a preliminary stage to {{the investigation into the}} dual flank testing technique two methods of <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> measurement using ball ended contact probes are examined. These are :(i) the direct measurement of cumulative pitch measurement using a single contact probe and dividing arrangement and(ii) the span gauging of adjacent teeth, commercial measuring equipment being used in both cases. The two methods are compared theoretically in terms of the maximum cumulative <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> of a gear, and their probable accuracy of measurement compared with the allowable pitch tolerances quoted in the relevant British Standard. Specifications, a theory for the dual flank test is developed relating the variation in centre distance of a pair of gears in close mesh to the <b>errors</b> in tooth <b>pitch</b> and involute profile. The validity of the theory- is tested by experimental measurements, on actual gears, and- a means of determining the permissible variation in the dual flank test error trace from the allowable tolerances on tooth <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> and tooth profile error suggested. The identification of the type of elemental error from the pattern of the dual flank trace is also examined together with the limitations of the test...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "guitar intonation" [...] denotes to what {{precision}} {{the ideal}} equally tempered musical scale {{can be produced}} by a guitar, while [...] "piano intonation" [...] refers to the setup procedure of the individual hammers in the piano keyboard. A conventional nut or an elevated zero fret will cause <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> on the lower frets due to the increased pressure on the strings. The fret distances {{would have to be}} corrected for that increased tension effect, but with guitars that is not common. On the contrary the [...] "level" [...] zero fret will have no <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> on the fingered notes. This can be demonstrated by measuring the pitch deviation of each single note on the fingerboard. Players who frequently use the lower frets from 0 to 5 will benefit most from a zero fret. Using mainly the upper range of the fingerboard neutralizes the advantage of the zero fret and conventional nuts are equally suited. Those players usually avoid playing first and second fret positions because of the pitch problems there. For beginners a zero fretted guitar is preferable.|$|R
