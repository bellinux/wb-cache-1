40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} a new {{framework}} {{to assess the}} validity of Zipf <b>'s</b> <b>Law</b> for cities. Zipf <b>'s</b> <b>Law</b> states that, within a country, the distribution of city sizes follows a Pareto distribution with a Pareto index equal to 1. We adopt a two-step approach where we formally test if the distribution of city sizes is a Pareto distribution and then we estimate the Pareto index. Through Monte Carlo experiments, we investigate the nite sample performances of this testing procedure and we compare the small-sample properties of a new estimator (the minimum variance unbiased estimator) to those of commonly used estimators. The minimum variance unbiased estimator {{turns out to be}} more efficient and unbiased. We use this two-step approach to examine empirically the validity of Zipf <b>'s</b> <b>Law</b> on a sample of 115 countries. Zipf <b>'s</b> <b>Law</b> <b>is</b> not rejected in most countries (62 out of 115, or 53. 9 %).
