The repellent pheromone is especially useful in the repositioning of trails after a new food source has been introduced. It also helps prevent ants from concentrating on an undesirable trail.

ABP is an abstract model for defining <b>adaptive</b> <b>values,</b> called <b>adaptives,</b> which adapt {{in response to}} some associated feedback. We show how our design choices in Haskell motivate higher-level combinators and constructs and help us derive more complicated compositional adaptives. We also show an important specialization of ABP is in support of reinforcement learning constructs, which optimize <b>adaptive</b> <b>values</b> based on a programmer-specified objective function. This permits ABP users to easily define <b>adaptive</b> <b>values</b> that express uncertainty anywhere in their programs. Over repeated executions, these <b>adaptive</b> <b>values</b> adjust to more efficient ones and enable the user’s programs to self optimize.

The <b>adaptive</b> <b>value</b> of this nonaggression among colonies {{has to do}} with avoiding unnecessary {{injury and}} allowing proper resource allocation, ensuring success for all the colonies. Low nestmate recognition, caused in part by polygyny, also has a biochemical basis in M. pharaonis. Cuticular hydrocarbons are compounds, often found on antennae, that allow for communication in many social insects. In ant species, these compounds play an especially key role in nestmate recognition. Differences in cuticular hydrocarbons are detected by other ant species, who respond accordingly. However, all pharaoh ant colonies have the same hydrocarbons on their antennae. This leads to ineffective nestmate recognition, and nonaggression between colonies.|$|E

Studies have shown that significant barriers to establish stable perennial colonies arise from two main factors: high diploid male production and genetic polymorphism. There could be no supply of truly altruistic workers (or drones), since the supply would be inconsistent, with up to 50% of the intended diploid females actually being males. Therefore, with no drone class, colonies {{would not be able}} to adequately form. Another reason why there is such a high diploid male population is because diploid male larva live within thick, closed off resinous cells which are not readily eliminated by the females. Diploid males are therefore seen as a ‘waste’ in energy and resources, and have no <b>adaptive</b> <b>value</b> to other bees.|$|E

40|$|Plant {{functional}} traits {{provide a}} mechanistic approach {{to understanding the}} processes of environmental filtering and community assembly. Variation along environmental gradients results in changes in the <b>adaptive</b> <b>values</b> of traits. Climate and soil fertility are two dominant factors that drive these patterns of trait variation. These two factors simultaneously select for traits during environmental filtering. However, {{we do not understand}} how interactions between climate and soil fertility influence the variation in community-level traits of multiple plant organs. The roles of traits in New Zealand forests are also yet to be studied at a national scale. This thesis aimed to determine the <b>adaptive</b> <b>values</b> of multiple functional traits across broad climate and soil fertility gradients in New Zealand forests. This was achieved by the following methods. Data were collected for leaf, stem, root, seed, flowering, and whole-plant traits from the 64 most common native trees in forests nationwide. Community composition and soil properties were measured at 324 plots across the country. For each plot, long-term average climate data were extracted from a model. A variable representing variation in soil fertility in the plots was derived by principal components analysis (PCA). Community-weighted mean (CWM) functional traits, i. e. average trait values weighted by the abundance of species, were calculated for each plot. Dimensionality of the specie-trait matrix was determined by PCA. Multiple linear regression was used to model the variation of each of the CWM traits as functions of mean annual temperature (MAT), vapour pressure deficit (VPD), soil fertility, soil fertility × MAT interaction, soil fertility × VPD interaction, total basal area and topography. Five dimensions of trait variation were identified among New Zealand trees. Soil fertility was a more significant predictor of CWM traits than either of the climate variables. However, both of the interaction effects were significant for most traits and overrode the importance of the main effects. For example, in sites with high fertility soil, leaf economics traits varied from ‘slow’ in cool and dry conditions to ‘fast’ in warm and moist conditions, but in sites with low fertility, these traits were ‘slow’ in all climates. Therefore, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>values</b> of multiple functional traits of New Zealand forests varied depending on both soil fertility and climate. This thesis provides the first recognition of the significant roles of the interaction effects between soil fertility and climate in driving variation in CWM traits from multiple plant organs. Climate and soil fertility interact in a way that influences CWM trait values independently from the influence of each environmental variable. These interactions are suspected to be important globally and should be tested for worldwide to confirm the generality of their effects. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that studying the relationships between CWM traits and soil fertility or climate independently is insufficient, when attempting to understand the process of environmental filtering. It is critical that the interaction effects between climate and soil fertility are included in future studies to enhance our understanding and ability to predict community-level responses to processes such as climate change...|$|R

The proportions of striped specimens in populations of some frogs show clinal variations. For example, the proportion of striped Rana sylvatica in North America generally increases towards the west and north. The variations {{in the proportion of}} different color may relate to either genetic-stochastic processes. or their adaptive importance. For different colour morphs of Acris crepitans, the hypothesis about the direct <b>adaptive</b> <b>value</b> of different colour morphs (for escaping predation) competes with the hypothesis that these morphs correlate with thermotolerance. Striped specimens Rana sylvatica, striped specimens better perform in open areas. Differences in the proportion of striped frogs in Rana arvalis are explained with physiological differences between the morphs. Striped recently metamorphosed frogs have a relatively large liver, in comparison with unstriped ones, and their weight increases more rapidly. Tadpoles of striped Rana arvalis need more time for completing metamorphosis but, after metamorphosis, their growth is faster than that of unstriped froglets. In a frog widespread in Turkey and the Caucasus, Rana macrocnemis, the proportion of frogs with the stripe increases with the altitude in mountains of the Lesser Caucasus, but not in the Greater Caucasus. Given the same altitude, non-striped frogs from the Greater Caucasus grow slower and maturate later than the striped frogs from the Lesser Caucasus, which provides them selective advantage in high mountains, but their tadpoles are likely to be less resistant to overheating than those of the non-striped frogs.|$|E
