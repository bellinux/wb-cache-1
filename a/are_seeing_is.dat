[...] Early in 1992 one of the Sunday newspapers ran a [...] "Green Shoots Index" [...] of signs of recovery, only to have to drop it when few such signs could be found. However, Gavyn Davies, then chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a newspaper article at the time of Lamont's removal from the Treasury that the [...] "Green shoots" [...] speech {{had turned out to be}} [...] "remarkably prescient.

The suggestion we are to examine is that such: beliefs have some recognizable quality which secures their truth, and the truth of whatever is deduced from them according to self-evident principles of inference.

However, after some time has passed, the crew finds {{themselves}} back at the singularity, and quickly realize the ship they <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> themselves from before.

50|$|The {{notion of}} 'representation' {{is one of}} the first {{established}} principles of media education. Media offers viewers a facilitated outlook of the world and a re-representation of reality. Media production involves selecting and combining incidents, making events into stories, and creating characters. Media representations allow viewers to see the world in some particular ways and not others. Audiences also compare media with their own experiences and make judgements about how realistic they are. Media representations can be seen as real in some ways but not in others: viewers may understand that what they <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> only imaginary and yet they still know it can explain reality.|$|E

Other buddies who {{participate}} in group chat are also available to control the shared screen remotely.
