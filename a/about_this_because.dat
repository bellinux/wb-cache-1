5|$|The {{explosive}} lenses {{required by}} the Fat Man had to be fabricated. A small explosive plant was established at Los Alamos known as Site S, {{as it was a}} former sawmill. Groves was appalled at the work practices and safety at Site S, and considered it {{only a matter of time}} before it blew up. On Parsons' recommendation, Groves decided to establish a pilot plant at NOTS, because Caltech had experience in building and operating pilot ordnance plants. He had some misgivings <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> he thought that the Navy might err too far on the side of workplace safety.|$|E

25|$|When Julieta {{drives to}} the {{location}} of the retreat in the Pyrenees three months later, she is informed that her daughter has already left, and does not want her location disclosed to her mother. Julieta is racked by the loss and her attempts to find Antía are unsuccessful. The only contact she has is a blank card on her 19th, 20th and 21st birthdays. After the latter she is enraged and destroys most traces of her daughter in her life, moving from her apartment. She visits Ava, who has multiple sclerosis and is dying. Ava tells her that Antía knew about the argument that precipitated Xoan's death and blamed Julieta and Ava, and that she had ultimately internalised guilt <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> she was away at camp at the time. At Ava's funeral, Julieta meets Lorenzo and the two embark on a happy relationship, which distracts Julieta from her loss. She tells him nothing of Antía and he respects that she has some secrets in her life.|$|E
500|$|Schur {{said the}} writing staff had {{difficulty}} scripting {{the scene where}} Ann kisses Andy: [...] "We {{had a lot of}} discussions <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> we didn't want Ann to be too much of a jerk and kiss a guy who likes another girl, and we didn't want Andy to be too much of a jerk because he likes April. It was very delicate." [...] The episode marked a turning point for the romantic subplot between April and Andy, who shared their first kiss of the series in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti". Goor said filming of that scene, [...] "They nailed the kiss immediately." [...] While trying to get April to talk to him, Andy pretends he doesn't want to talk to her at all, which he incorrectly calls [...] "reverse psychiatry" [...] instead of reverse psychology. This line was improvised by Chris Pratt.|$|E
500|$|Fossils of chordates, the phylum {{to which}} humans belong, are very rare in Cambrian sediments. Conway Morris {{classified}} the Burgess Shale fossil Pikaia as a chordate {{because it had}} a rudimentary notochord, the rod of cartilage that evolved into the backbone of vertebrates. Doubts have been raised <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> most of the important features are not quite like those of chordates: it has repeated blocks of muscle along its sides {{but they are not}} chevron-shaped; there is no clear evidence of anything like gills; and its throat appears to be in the upper part of its body rather than the lower. It also has [...] "tentacles" [...] on the front of its head, unlike living chordates. At best it may be a stem group chordate, in other words an evolutionary [...] "aunt" [...] of living chordates. Metaspriggina, also found in the Burgess Shale but even rarer, may be a chordate, if the repeated chevron-shaped structures along its sides represent muscle blocks. While Pikaia was celebrated in the mid-1970s as the earliest known chordate, three jawless fish have since been found among the Chengjiang fossils, which are about 17million years older than the Burgess Shale.|$|E

500|$|In {{reporting}} on Ballo's death, United Press International noted, [...] "Critics say the break-you-down-build-you-up recruitment tool of Scientologists is controversial." [...] The issue received {{a significant amount}} of coverage in Norway news publications; and media attention focused criticism on the Church of Scientology. Both Verdens Gang and Dagbladet devoted several cover stories investigating the matter. News media received criticism regarding the amount of coverage given to the incident. A representative of the National Association for Suicide Survivors in Norway regarded it as excessive. News editor of Dagbladet, Peter Raaum, defended the amount of news coverage given to the incident: [...] "We write <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> the survivor has made criticism of the Scientology test that Kaja took just before she took her life. The family wanted a debate about this. What makes this so important is this test. What kind of test is this? Is it so reprehensible, and significant to what happened? If it is, I mean it's something that's extremely important to focus on." [...] Ballo's family agreed to discuss the incident with the media. In an interview Ballo's father said he did not have issues with the case being front-page news in newspapers.|$|E
500|$|Nineteen months later, Jim is {{a famous}} actor playing {{the title role}} in Richard III at the theatre, using the same, now redecorated, {{dressing}} room. A paralysed Tony comes backstage to visit him and talks about how far Jim's career has come. Jim broke up with Laura and has not seen her since his run in Macbeth. After Tony leaves, Kirstie arrives to see Jim. She is now Tony's full-time carer. She has watched Jim's performance {{every day of the}} week, and says she knew that he just needed [...] "a little push" [...] to achieve greatness. She tells him that Laura committed suicide by slitting her wrists in the dressing room's shower. Jim did not know <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> he was overseas filming a role in Game of Thrones at the time. He believes that Laura pushed Tony off the battlements and could not live with her guilt. Kirstie reveals that she herself is the one who pushed Tony, and spiked his juice with alcohol backstage. She also got Felicity sacked because Felicity would not let Jim perform as Macbeth. Kirstie is wearing the engagement ring that she took from Laura's corpse. She tells Jim that she is waiting for him [...] "in the wings ... like an understudy". She leaves, and as Jim prepares to go onstage, he sees bloody visions of Laura's death.|$|E
500|$|On 28 March 1942, Nedić {{indicated}} to Turner that, {{in the event}} of his departure, Ljotić was the only person who could be considered his successor as leader of the Government of National Salvation. Turner remarked that [...] " [...] could not [...] serious <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> Ljotić was a prophet and visionary, not a leader and statesman." [...] In December, the SDO was renamed the Serbian Volunteer Corps ( [...] , SDK) and placed under the command of General der Artillerie (lieutenant general) Paul Bader. Although it was not formally part of the Wehrmacht, the SDK received arms, ammunition, food and clothing from the Germans. Like the Serbian State Guard ( [...] , SDS), the SDK was under the direct command of the Higher SS and Police Leader August Meyszner and the Commanding General in Serbia. During operations its units were put under the tactical command of German divisions. It was the only group of armed Serbs that the Germans ever trusted during the war, its units often being praised for valour in action by German commanders. The SDK often helped the Gestapo track down and round up Jewish civilians who had managed to evade capture by the Germans and was involved in sending Jewish prisoners to the Banjica concentration camp. SDK units were not allowed to move from their assigned territory without German authorization. Members took an oath in which they pledged to fight to the death against both Communist forces and the Chetniks, to stay in the SDK for at least six months and to [...] "serve the cause of the Serbian people." [...] Ljotić himself had no control over the SDK, which was directly commanded by Mušicki. Most officers in the SDK came either from the ranks of the disbanded Royal Yugoslav Army or the Yugoslav gendarmerie. Morale was high amongst the volunteers, with education officers similar to those employed by the Soviets and the Yugoslav Partisans being assigned to each company, battalion and regiment to teach and indoctrinate soldiers and help maintain high levels of morale. According to SDK ideology, Ljotić was a [...] "guiding spirit" [...] in his [...] "political and philosophical pronouncements". In his instructions to unit commanders, Ljotić stressed the importance of volunteers believing in and having respect for God. He urged them to pray regularly and warned that poor battlefield results and failure to gain the support of the Serbian public came {{as a result of the}} [...] "wavering religiosity and faith" [...] of commanders and their frequent cursing of God's name. Ljotić criticized the widespread practice of alcoholism, gambling and sexual decadence found amongst volunteers. He also condemned acts of unnecessary violence committed by them when they were reported.|$|E

2500|$|Parsons {{suggested}} [...] that NOTS {{might be}} a suitable location. [...] It was remote and easy to secure, and Caltech had experience with pilot plants, {{such as the ones}} at Eaton Canyon and China Lake, where rocket propellants were manufactured.

His son was MP for Liverpool in 1755-67.|$|E
2500|$|On the way Israel is {{perceived}} in the Netherlands: [...] "The crisis of Dutch socialism can be sized {{up in its}} attitudes toward both Islam and Israel. It holds Israel to exceptionally high moral standards. The Israelis, however, will always do well, because they themselves set high standards for their actions. The standards for judging the Palestinians, however, are very low. Most outsiders remain silent on all the problems in their territories.

2500|$|Captain (later Admiral) Harte is Aubrey's nemesis. [...] His {{hatred of}} Aubrey stems from Aubrey's cuckolding him in Master and Commander. While never calling Jack out, he {{nevertheless}} tries to foil Aubrey's professional advancement whenever possible unless he can personally profit from it, as when Aubrey is placed {{under his command}} in Post Captain, even though Aubrey fails to bring in many prizes. Harte is especially angry <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> he did not profit from the [...] "Sophie's" [...] many prizes in Master and Commander. Harte {{is described as a}} little man, somewhat resembling Lord St. Vincent in appearance but not in character.

2500|$|Nomad {{makes his}} way to Dr. Rosenthal's {{research}} complex, where he has found a rare fossilized artifact predating humanity by twomillion years. The partially excavated artifact resembles one of the flying machines (designated [...] "exosuits") that has been attacking the team. Rosenthal also references other discoveries of similar artifacts in Afghanistan and Siberia, suggesting that the aliens have a global presence, and are not just confined to the island. While Rosenthal is running a scan on the artifact, it emits a powerful energy pulse that freezes Dr. Rosenthal solid. Nomad's Nanosuit is able to maintain his internal temperature, saving his life. Nomad then rendezvous with a VTOL, after eliminating a Nanosuit-equipped four-man KPA special forces team near the landing site. He notifies his superiors <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> the U.S. military had hoped to prevent the Koreans from acquiring Nanosuit technology.|$|E
2500|$|Rodriguez {{made his}} 2013 return with the Yankees on August 5 {{on the same}} day MLB {{announced}} he would be suspended through the 2014 season, pending an appeal, {{for his role in the}} Biogenesis scandal. On August 11, Rodriguez hit his first home run of the season off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. With the home run, Rodriguez passed Stan Musial for fifth place in career RBIs. Rodriguez continued to feud with Yankees management following his return, as his lawyers accused the team, and specifically Christopher S. Ahmad MD, of mishandling his hip injury in several ways; Rodriguez's legal team contends the team withheld the injury from him and continued to play him in 2012 despite his health, and that team president Randy Levine told Rodriguez's hip surgeon that he would be happy if Rodriguez never played again. In response to the accusations, Cashman said, [...] "I'm not comfortable talking to Alex <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> we feel we are in a litigious environment. Hello and goodbye, that's about it." [...] He added, [...] "It's not just Yankees' management. He's putting it at the level of our trainers, our medical staff. The organization. The team." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{emerged during}} the trial that Nelson's sister Laura Anne had been shown Zoe's body by Bayne {{on the morning after}} her murder, but had kept this {{information}} from the police for five days. Laura Anne, who gave her evidence from behind a screen to prevent her from seeing Bayne, did not relay the information until she made her third statement to the police on 28 May, the day of Bayne's arrest. Laura Anne said that she had gone to Bayne's address on the morning after Nelson disappeared in order to return some articles of clothing to him. When she arrived she said he appeared [...] "jumpy" [...] and was drinking vodka. Shortly after that, the two had left the house and Bayne told her he had [...] "something to show her". She said that he led her to the area where he had killed Nelson and pointed out the blackened body. She said she knew it was her sister because she recognised a Rangers F.C. tattoo on her arm. In her statement she said: [...] "At Monkey Hill Rab said to me 'I hit her with my hands. She tried to hit me back.' Rab also said 'I burned her with petrol.'" [...] She testified in court that she had kept silent because she was terrified of Bayne, although Neil Murray QC, for the defence, produced other police statements in court in which she denied she had been threatened, admitted she had been out with Bayne on the day after the body was discovered, and had also subsequently visited Bayne and spent some time in his bedroom listening to music. She also spent about an hour on the telephone to him. A friend also [...] "described her as happy and normal" [...] during the period of silence. When asked why she hadn't told the police when she was first interviewed, she said: [...] "I did not tell them <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> I was scared my mum would not believe me and think it was me who killed Zoe." [...] Bayne's grandmother testified that on the day the body was discovered, Laura Anne did not visit and he did not leave the house except to go with her to a local supermarket.|$|E
