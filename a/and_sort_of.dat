Rolling Stone author Tracey Grimson also commented on this, stating that [...] "Powderfinger have become practical advocates of space" [...] and lauding their acknowledgment that the [...] "absence of sound can be lush, evocative".

[...] Obsessed opened at top spot in its opening weekend with US$28 million, and made a total domestic gross of US$68 million, becoming Larter's second highest-grossing film in North-America. It resulted in Larter's third Teen Choice Award nomination and an MTV Movie Award for Best Fight with Beyonce.|$|E

In the final {{few weeks before the}} strike and start of production, Abrams and Lindelof polished the script for a final time. Abrams was frustrated that he was unable to alter lines during the strike, whereas normally they {{would have been able to}} improvise new ideas during rehearsal, although Lindelof acknowledged they could dub some lines in post-production. Orci and Kurtzman were able to stay on set without strikebreaking because they were also executive producers on the film; they could [...] "make funny eyes and faces at the actors whenever they had a problem with the line <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> nod when they had something better". Abrams was able to alter a scene where Spock combats six Romulans from a fistfight to a gunfight, having decided there were too many physical brawls in the film.|$|E

500|$|The artwork for {{the cover}} and liner note booklet of Axe to Fall was {{designed}} and created by Jacob Bannon. The booklet features a different piece of artwork for each song on the album. Bannon tried to create images that [...] "encapsulated some of the emotion of each song" [...] in contrast to more literal imagery, such as avoiding an axe literally falling for the song [...] "Axe to Fall." [...] He also experimented with a technique where a single image would be repeated within a frame, but the copies would be distressed or slightly different. This {{could be seen in}} the cover art where a single image of a woman's profile was broken down within the repetition, and some of the copies showed the woman's teeth through her cheek. Bannon stated that {{for the cover}} art, he [...] "just wanted to have something that felt timeless <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> embodied the whole emotional gamut of the record, something that was explosive and powerful but also something that felt poetic and soft at the same time.

500|$|In July 2015, Butters {{revealed}} that the season would feature the Darkforce, which ties to the characters Doctor Strange and Marcus Daniels, the latter having appeared in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In January 2016, Fazekas elaborated, saying that the Darkforce, known as Zero Matter in the series, {{is the result of}} a nuclear test gone wrong by Isodyne Energy. Looking to the history of the Darkforce in the comics, Fazekas and Butters [...] "were able to select what we liked <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> make our own rules as to what it does, how it operates, and who it affects in our world." [...] The producers tried to take a scientific approach to the explanation of the Zero Matter, consulting with theoretical physicist Clifford Johnson to help ground it in science. Johnson provided the science equations seen on blackboards throughout the season, as well as real world reference for the Zero Matter containment systems. The showrunners also conversed with Eric Carroll at Marvel Studios to ensure anything they were doing with the Darkforce would not contradict the Doctor Strange script, and to see if they could destroy Howard Stark's hover car, which was originally seen as a prototype in Captain America: The First Avenger. The mention in the season finale of the land Stark owns in Malibu is a reference to what will become the location for the home of his son, Tony, in the MCU films.|$|E

The group eventually decided against the idea but, drawn by the technical capabilities of the format and the desire to do something that had never been done before, produced a DVD version of Rings..., making it the first album to be simultaneously released on CD and DVD.
