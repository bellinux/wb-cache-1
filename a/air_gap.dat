Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the wavelength of visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal end of each scale, to about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light, which {{are determined by the}} thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{distance}} between the rotor and stator is called the <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> The <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> has important effects, and is generally as small as possible, as a large gap has a strong {{negative effect on the}} performance of an electric motor. It is the main source of the low power factor at which motors operate. The <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> increases the magnetizing current needed. For this reason, the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> should be minimal. Very small gaps may pose mechanical problems in addition to noise and losses.|$|E

25|$|In {{fulguration}} mode, {{the electrode}} is held {{away from the}} tissue, {{so that when the}} <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> between the electrode and the tissue is ionized, an electric arc discharge develops. In this approach the burning to the tissue is more superficial, because the current is spread over the tissue area larger than the tip of electrode. Under these conditions, superficial skin charring or carbonization is seen over a wider area than when operating in contact with the probe, and this technique is therefore used for very superficial or protrusive lesions such as skin tags. Ionization of an <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> requires voltage in the kV range.|$|E
25|$|Freetown {{was little}} more than a {{protected}} anchorage with no shore facilities. The town had been established as a resettlement area for freed slaves, with negligible European development. Convoy operations were coordinated by a naval staff aboard the elderly Union-Castle Liner Edinburgh Castle. Edinburgh Castle and a hospital ship anchored as far offshore as practicable to avoid the unhealthy conditions ashore. Tropical diseases were endemic in the oppressive heat and humidity. Local fresh water supplies were polluted. Refueling coal from the United Kingdom and oil from the West Indies was held and distributed afloat in detained merchant ships. Shore facilities were inadequate to support anti-submarine escorts for convoys until January 1941. Air cover was flown from Cornwall, Gibraltar, and Freetown when conditions allowed; but a northern Azores <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> and a southern Canaries <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> remained where U-boats and surface raiders could patrol the convoy routes unobserved. The northern gap was closed when air patrols began flying from the Azores in October 1943.|$|E

It was {{the objective of the}} activities reported here to demonstrate processes that allow to incorporate <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> in single-metal layer structures. Two different methods were used for this purpose: Philips favoreda "sacrificial materials" approach where the dielectric material between the metal lines was removed underneath a porous hard mask layer by thermal decomposition; the <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> of Infineon's "close-off" approach were etched between metal lines by RIE and subsequently sealed at the top by a novel selective oxide deposition. In both cases,air gaps could be created successfully and reproducibly. The Philips <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> are less than 150 nm wide. Preliminary electrical measurements indicate that the capacitance between adjacent metal lines indeed can be reduced to a value that is compatible with the requirements of the ITRS roadmap for the 45 nm node.

25|$|The advent {{during the}} mid twentieth century of the cavity wall saw the popularisation and {{development}} of another method of strengthening brickwork—the wall tie. A cavity wall comprises two totally discrete walls, separated by an <b>air</b> <b>gap,</b> which serves both as barrier to moisture and heat. Typically the main loads taken by the foundations are carried there by the inner leaf, and the major functions of the external leaf are to protect the whole from weather, {{and to provide a}} fitting aesthetic finish.|$|E

This is the 'return stroke' and it is the most luminous and noticeable part of the lightning discharge.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of grounding on the field distribution and on the dielectric behavior of small rod-plate and rod-rod <b>air</b> <b>gaps.</b> This effect {{can be attributed to}} the grounding of one electrode. In the different arrangements with one electrode grounded or with the electrodes symmetrically charged the experimental results of the corona and breakdown are recorded and compared to the simulation results of the field distribution. It is resulted that the grounding influences significantly the electric field distribution, the dc corona and the dc breakdown. The field is less inhomogeneous in grounded rod - plate <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> and in rod-rod <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> with symmetrically charged electrodes, and consequently the values of the corona onset and the breakdown voltage are higher. In longer <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> the corona current influences the field distribution and consequently the dc breakdown. The effect of grounding on the breakdown is weakened when the dc polarity of the voltage is negative, otherwise it is enhanced. In <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> with lengths > 3 cm (negative dc polarity) or > 8 cm (positive dc polarity) it is overlapped by the effect of the corona current. Relations between the field strength, the corona current, the corona onset and the breakdown voltage arise. The principle of action-reaction is valid. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R

25|$|Steam was {{collected}} inside a dome {{on top of}} the top chamber, and in the Reed boiler all but the dome and the ends of the three water chambers was enclosed in a double-layered casing with an <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> and asbestos lining that reduced the temperature of the outer layer. The casing rose at the top to form an outlet for hot gases into a funnel. The furnace was fed with coal by stokers through firebox doors at one end, and, whereas the Normand boiler required a fire of about 18inches (460mm) depth, the Reed boiler required a shallower one of between 8and 12inches (200–300mm). Air for the furnace passed through the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> in the boiler casing, thus providing a supply of heated air that was directed {{to the rear of the}} ashpan. This admitted air through three doors that closed automatically if a tube failed, the intention being to prevent flames, steam and debris escaping into the boiler room. A constant supply of pure water was essential for this type of boiler, as a shortage of water would rapidly result in an empty boiler liable to severe damage from the furnace, and the deposition of any contaminant, such as limescale, would result in a significant loss of efficiency and could block tubes. Each boiler had its own feedwater pump, and a feedwater regulator also of Reed's design.|$|E

The teeth probably were created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even. Due to advances in imaging and X-ray technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the basic operation of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.|$|E
25|$|All the {{electromagnetic}} motors, {{and that includes}} the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields. For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed.|$|E

These magnets will have a room temperature iron core with two 20 mm <b>air</b> <b>gaps.</b> Magnetic field in both horizontally separated <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> is excited by a single turn 100 kA superconducting transmission line. The alternative design with cold iron core, horizontally or vertically separated <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> is under investigation.

The vertical beam separation decreases volume superconductor, heat load from synchrotron radiation and eliminates fringing field from a return bus. But the horizontal beam separation has lowest volume of iron core and as a result lower heat load for cryosystem during cooling down. All these options are discussed and comparison is made. Superconducting correction system, combined with the magnet, allowing to increase the maximum field is also under discussion. Preliminary cost analysis are made for all options...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to staying below the arcing voltage, the ignition system keep the voltage across the points below the breakdown voltage for an <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> {{to prevent a}} glow discharge across the points. Such a glow discharge would quickly transition to an arc, and the arc would prevent the spark plug from firing. The minimum voltage for a glow discharge in air is about 320V. Consequently, the capacitor value is chosen to also keep the voltage across the points {{to be less than}} 320V. Keeping the points from arcing when they separate is the reason the ignition coil includes a secondary winding rather than using just a simple inductor. If the transformer has a 100:1 ratio, then the secondary voltage can reach 30kV.|$|E

Resonant bass trap absorbers need to be at a pressure maximum and tend to be thinner, so they are more conveniently and effectively positioned flat against a wall in a corner where the pressure is maximum, rather than straddling a corner where there is more velocity.|$|E

The two-bay wings and tailplane were identical in form to those of the Snipe, but were strengthened to cope with the extra weight, while the fin and rudder were identical to the Snipe. The new aircraft used the same Bentley BR2 rotary engine as the Snipe, covered by an unarmoured cowling – the foremost armour plate forming the firewall.|$|E
25|$|Green {{vehicles}} {{are intended to}} have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles, although when {{the environmental impact of}} a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its life cycle {{this may not be the}} case. Electric vehicle technology has the potential to reduce transport CO2 emissions, depending on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity. The primary sources of electricity currently used in most countries (coal, gas, oil) mean that until world electricity production changes substantially, private electric cars will result in the same or higher production of CO2 than petrol equivalent vehicles.

One of the lessons learned from SL-1 was that there is an extreme water hammer hazard whenever a shutdown reactor is cooled to room temperature and there is an <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> between the top of the water and the reactor vessel head. One of the recommendations in the analysis of the incident was that shutdown reactors be filled to the top with water so that a power excursion could not induce such a powerful water hammer. Air is not dense enough to appreciably slow water, while water (being nearly incompressible) is able to distribute explosive forces and limit peak pressure. The extra water is also a very effective radiation shield for those who are directly above the vessel. Written procedures at SL-1 had included a directive to pump down the level of water in the reactor prior to the maintenance procedure that destroyed it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} paper the Ground Effect of small rod–plate <b>air</b> <b>gaps,</b> which is {{observed}} due to the grounding {{of one of the}} electrodes, is investigated. Values of the field strength in the gap are recorded and analyzed for the two different arrangements, with the rod or the plate grounded. The distribution of the field along the axis of the gap is strongly affected by the geometry of the gap, and especially by the electrode chosen to be grounded. The Ground Effect also affects the breakdown voltage of the rod-plate <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> but in a quite different way than the Polarity Effect does. The values of the breakdown voltage depend on the maximum value of the field strength in the gap, and the corona leakage current through the gap. According to the Polarity Effect the breakdown voltage is considerably higher in the arrangement with negative polarity on the rod because of the intensive corona effects. According to the Ground Effect the breakdown voltage is higher in the arrangement with the rod grounded because the maximum value of the field strength is lower. The Ground Effect is intense in small rod-plate <b>air</b> <b>gaps,</b> while the influence of the corona leakage current and the Polarity Effect appears in longer <b>air</b> <b>gaps...</b>|$|R
