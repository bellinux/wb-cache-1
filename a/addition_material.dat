Meshes can be {{selected from a}} set of primitives (cube, ellipsoid, cone, etc.) or imported from third party software such as Maya or Blender. Physics are simulated with the Vortex engine. Users can specify separate collision and graphical meshes for a rigid body, greatly reducing simulation time. In <b>addition,</b> <b>material</b> properties and the interaction between materials can be specified, allowing different restitution, coefficient of friction, etc. within the simulation.|$|E
5000|$|Puny Express also marked {{producer}} Walter Lantz's {{return at}} directing a Woody Woodpecker [...] "cartune" [...] {{since the early}} 1940s. Before the 1948 layoff, director Dick Lundy had begun production on Puny Express, which along with Sleep Happy {{was one of two}} Woody Woodpecker shorts that storymen Ben Hardaway and Heck Allen had storyboarded and scripted. As such this is Lundy's final effort as director on a Woody short, although he does not have on-screen credit. When the studio reopened in 1950 neither three would return, and Lantz finished production on both films as writer (he had written <b>addition</b> <b>material</b> on both) and director. Lantz would then serve as director, and become head writer, for the next nine entrys in the Woody Woodpecker film series. He, of course, does not receive on-screen credit on any Woody [...] "cartune" [...] as writer or director.|$|E

50|$|This {{installation}} {{method is}} by far the most labor-intensive. In <b>addition,</b> <b>material</b> cost is a function of the width of the grate used in the trench.There are three main reasons why this is labor-intensive: the outlet pipe position in the floor, the levelling of the trench grate in the floor, and integration of the waterproofing. If the outlet is not exactly in the centre, then the channel must be customized, increasing cost and time to construct.This can be overcome by the use of modular trench drain systems. These allow the drain pipe to be connected anywhere along the trench, giving the builder and plumber more freedom to place the services, reducing construction time and costs, particularly in high-rise situations where moving plumbing services can be nearly impossible. Achieving a curbless or hobless entrance for special needs access is more readily achieved with a modular system, as the levelling of the shower floor to the bathroom floor is inherently problematic with non-modular systems as they have no on-site adjustment.Waterproofing is possibly the most critical aspect of the bathroom when integrating a channel/trench drain. There are two ways to approach the waterproofing issue. First is to develop a proprietary method where the waterproofing and trench drain are a kit. Second is to separate the waterproofing and trench drain.The first method has the benefit of an 'all-in-one' solution, but the downside is cost and limitation of the system in varying applications, i.e. limited generally to bathroom application. The second method is generally safest as the waterproofing is completed using established proven methods that most building contractors are familiar with. A second benefit is when the waterproofing is a separate item all methods of waterproofing (cementeous, bitumized, fibreglassed, paint-on, sweat-on, lead-lined, copper pan etc.) can be utilized. This will allow a modular system to be used in many applications such as pools, balconies, thresholds, pedestrian areas, public areas, essentially most wet areas where a waterproofing system is required, be it on ground or above (suspended slab).Stainless steel trench drains can also be installed in a home's shower and in commercial locations like hospital rooms, changing rooms and operating rooms.|$|E
5000|$|Professionally managed and {{maintained}} specimen and artifact collections, {{such as those}} at the Field Museum of Natural History, are a major research resource for the national and international scientific community, supporting extensive research that tracks environmental changes, benefits homeland security, public health and safety, and serves taxonomy and systematics research. [...] Many of Field Museum’s collections rank among the top ten collections in the world, e.g., the bird skin collection ranks fourth worldwide; the mollusk collection is among the five largest in North America; the fish collection is ranked among {{the largest in the}} world.The scientific collections of the Field Museum originate from the specimens and artifacts assembled between 1891 and 1893 for the World Columbian Exposition. [...] Already at its founding, the Field Museum had a large anthropological collection.A large number of the early natural history specimens were purchased from Ward’s Natural History Establishment in Rochester, New York. An extensive acquisition program, including large expeditions conducted by the museum’s curatorial staff resulted in substantial collection growth. During the first 50 years of the museum’s existence, over 440 Field Museum expeditions acquired specimens {{from all parts of the}} world. In <b>addition,</b> <b>material</b> was added through purchase, such as the Strecker butterfly collection in 1908 for example.Extensive specimen material and artifacts were given to the museum by collectors and donors, such as the Boone collection of over 3,500 East Asian artifacts, consisting of books, prints and various objects. In addition, “orphaned collections” were and are taken in from other institutions such as universities that change their academic programs away from collections-based research. For example, already beginning in 1907, Field Museum accepted substantial botanical specimen collections from universities such as University of Chicago, Northwestern University and University of Illinois at Chicago, into its herbarium. These specimens are maintained and continuously available for researchers worldwide. Targeted collecting in the US and abroad for research programs of the curatorial and collection staff continuously add high quality specimen material and artifacts; e.g., Dr. Robert Inger’s collection of frogs from Borneo as part of his research into the ecology and biodiversity of the Indonesian fauna.Collecting of specimens and acquisition of artifacts is nowadays subject to clearly spelled-out policies and standards, with the goal to acquire only materials and specimens for which the provenance can be established unambiguously. All collecting of biological specimens is subject to proper collecting and export permits; frequently, specimens are returned to their country of origin after study. Field Museum stands among the leading institutions developing such ethics standards and policies; Field Museum was an early adopter of voluntary repatriation practices of ethnological and archaeological artifacts.|$|E
