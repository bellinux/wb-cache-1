5|$|Ryan held a closed-door {{meeting with}} the Republican Caucus on October 20, where he {{explained}} that he would run for Speaker if he could be guaranteed <b>an</b> <b>overwhelming</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the Republican caucus would support him. Specifically, Ryan requested an increased threshold for the political maneuver of vacating the Speakership, stated that he would not lessen the amount of time he spends with his family, and requested an official endorsement from the Freedom Caucus, Republican Study Committee, and The Tuesday Group by October 23, before he could make his decision. Immediately after Ryan's announcement, Chaffetz announced that he would be dropping out of the race to support Ryan. The next day, the Freedom Caucus held a vote to determine which of its members would support Ryan; although the exact tally was not revealed, roughly two-thirds of the caucus voted to endorse Ryan. Although this was shy of the 80% vote needed for an official endorsement over Webster, both the caucus leaders and Ryan were satisfied with the result, and Ryan made efforts to move forward with a potential Speaker bid.|$|E

40|$|AbstractComplex {{financial}} instruments with multiple state variables often have no analytical formulas and therefore must be priced by numerical methods, like lattice ones. For pricing convertible bonds {{and many other}} interest rate-sensitive products, {{research has focused on}} bivariate lattices for models with two state variables: stock price and interest rate. This paper shows that, unfortunately, when the interest rate component allows rates to grow in magnitude without bounds, those lattices generate invalid transition probabilities. <b>As</b> the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> stochastic interest rate models share this property, {{a solution to the problem}} becomes important. This paper presents the first bivariate lattice that guarantees valid probabilities. The proposed bivariate lattice grows (super) polynomially in size if the interest rate model allows rates to grow (super) polynomially. Furthermore, we show that any valid constant-degree bivariate lattice must grow superpolynomially in size with log-normal interest rate models, which form a very popular class of interest rate models. Therefore, our bivariate lattice can be said to be optimal...|$|R
