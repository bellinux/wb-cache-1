40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{demonstrate}} conditioned inhibition of Pavlovian conditioning of autonomic responses in humans. Subjects (N = 21) were presented initially with four geometric shapes (A, B, C and D). An electric shock {{served as the}} unconditioned stimulus (US) during acquisition. Conditional stimuli lasted for 8 s and US onset coincided with CS offset. Subjects were trained with A-US, C-US, and AC-US pairings <b>and</b> AB <b>alone</b> <b>and</b> B <b>alone</b> presentations. The subsequent summation test consisted of C-US pairings <b>and</b> CB <b>alone</b> <b>and</b> CD <b>alone</b> presentations.

Evidence for conditioned inhibition during the summation test was found in US expectancy and second interval electrodermal responses. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

5|$|Lilly Wachowski, after {{completing}} her gender transition, {{decided to take}} some time off and did not return as writer or director for the second season, although she remained active as co-creator. Straczynski, who had a very active role during season 1 from pre-production to post-production in order to assist the Wachowskis with their first foray into TV, said his primary involvement in season 2 finished with the completion of the writing phase, as Lana felt this time she had the required experience to tackle the filmmaking aspect of the show on her own. He also said that the second season was designed to explore the mythology of sensates, introduce other clusters, and provide answers to many of the questions viewers had after the first season. Lana {{came up with the idea}} of making the first episode of the second season a two-hour Christmas special, because of her love for such programming in the television shows that she watched as a kid, such as Hill Street Blues, Mork & Mindy, and All My Children.
