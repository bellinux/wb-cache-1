5|$|After {{discussing}} Supreme Court precedent, Heins {{recounts the}} jury verdict which decided against her client by ruling that Richardson's firing was not illegal. Heins describes the trial chronologically, including the evidentiary process and testimony by witnesses. The jury's decision is examined; {{it found that}} Richardson sincerely believed that her school's administration practiced employment discrimination, and her criticism was made in good faith. However, the jury also determined that the administration did not fire Richardson because of this criticism. Heins critiques the compromise decision, contending that it reflects the bias of individual jurors rather than <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law as applied to Richardson's firing by the school's administration. In post-trial interviews, the jurors explained they {{felt that it was}} the duty of employees (such as Richardson) respect their superiors and Nesmith was one such superior in his capacity as {{dean of the school of}} theology.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{story about}} the Ceklin zduhać is given in an essay by {{literary}} theoretician Radoman Kordić. According to him, the story {{is a product of}} the symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhać narration and a heroic narration. The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaći, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society. The zduhać and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhać, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhać into a subject without identity. Kordić argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent narration in the story—that of the death drive—which crumbles the other two narrations.|$|E
