50|$|Founded in 1882 by Ben and George Maurer, Long Branch <b>Amusement</b> <b>Park</b> was {{originally}} an <b>amusement</b> <b>park</b> with boxing arenas, an arcade and a trolley. The <b>amusement</b> <b>park</b> closed in 1938.|$|R
5|$|In the 1930s Butlin had <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> in Mablethorpe (opened 1928), Hayling Island (1931), Felixstowe (1931), Southsea (1931) {{and on the}} Isle of Man. He {{continued}} to operate his winter fair at Olympia during this time and soon added the winter fairs at Waverley Hall in Edinburgh and at the Kelvin Hall in Glasgow. By 1935 most of his existing parks had zoos attached to them, providing another source of revenue.|$|E
5|$|Sales are {{primarily}} derived from branded ice cream parlors, quick-serve restaurants, {{and the distribution}} of its pre-packaged items to convenience stores, food service operators such as schools, hospitals, prisons, military installations, sports stadiums, <b>amusement</b> <b>parks,</b> and assisted living centers. Pre-packaged items are also sold in regional supermarkets, but this accounts for a minority of the company's sales.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey {{features}} a RoboCoaster G2 ride system provided by Dynamic Structures, KUKA and RoboCoaster. The first generation RoboCoaster system featured KUKA robotic arm technology anchored to a stationary platform, while the second-generation G2 system mounted the arms on a busbar track. The system was first publicly disclosed at the International Association of <b>Amusement</b> <b>Parks</b> and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show in 2003. At {{around the same}} time, rumors began circulating {{about the possibility of}} Islands of Adventure adding a Van Helsing-themed ride using this technology. These plans were later scrapped with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ultimately using the same technology and opening on the same plot of land proposed for the Van Helsing ride. The ride's seats are mounted on robotic arms which are in turn mounted on a track. This allows the arms to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, etc.). This concept first appeared in the 2004 International Association of <b>Amusement</b> <b>Parks</b> and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show. The disadvantage of this intricate machinery is that if the ride breaks down, some guests are stranded in uncomfortable positions, such as being tilted backwards in dark enclosed spaces.|$|E

5|$|Roller {{coasters}} are amusement rides {{developed for}} <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> and modern theme parks. During the 16th and 17th centuries, rides consisting of wooden sleds that took riders down large slides made from ice were popular in Russia. The first roller coasters, where {{the train was}} attached to a wooden track, first appeared in France in the early 1800s. Although wooden roller coasters are still being produced, steel roller coasters are more common {{and can be found}} on every continent except Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Growth came rapidly {{over the}} next few years as the town saw the {{construction}} of a bank, a public school, a city hall, several sizable industries and a series of <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> at present-day Treaty Oak Park. In 1910 Atlantic Boulevard opened between South Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Beaches, further cementing South Jacksonville's place as a hub for car and ferry traffic. By 1917 the town's population was ten times what it had been when it was incorporated, so local leaders planned the original Acosta Bridge, connecting Jacksonville and South Jacksonville by road for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Six Flags Great Adventure spent $42 {{million on}} new attractions {{including}} a prototype Floorless Coaster by Bolliger & Mabillard, Medusa (later Bizarro).

5|$|Speculation that Canada's Wonderland {{would build}} a new {{attraction}} for the 2014 season began {{at the end of}} July 2013 when maintenance work on the western side of Wonder Mountain was discovered. On August 8, Cedar Fair confirmed an interactive dark ride would be built at one of the company's parks. Wonderland officially announced Wonder Mountain's Guardian—a ten million dollar attraction—on August 30, 2013, on Breakfast Television, a morning news program for the Toronto area.

5|$|The resort {{initially}} {{depended on}} railroad and electric trolley service. The completion of Virginia Beach Boulevard in 1922, which extended from Norfolk to the oceanfront, opened the route for automobiles, buses, and trucks. The passenger rail {{service to the}} oceanfront was eventually discontinued as traffic increased by vehicle. The growing resort of Virginia Beach became an incorporated town in 1906. Over the next 45 years, Virginia Beach continued to grow in popularity as a seasonal vacation spot. The casinos were replaced by <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> and family-oriented attractions. In 1927 The Cavalier Hotel opened and became a popular vacation spot.|$|E

5|$|Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and {{insecure}} man {{in private}} but adopted {{a warm and}} outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was racist or anti-Semitic, they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed {{in the years after}} his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his studio maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney <b>amusement</b> <b>parks</b> have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.|$|E

25|$|By the 1950s, {{factors such}} as urban decay, crime, and even {{desegregation}} in the ghettos led to changing patterns in how people chose to spend their free time.

In 1964, Steeplechase Park, once the king of all <b>amusement</b> <b>parks,</b> closed down for good.
