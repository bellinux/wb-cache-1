5|$|John Jackson, Patrick Martin and Harriet Hughes, {{all members}} of the Countryside Alliance, sought {{judicial}} review of the use of the Parliament Acts to pass the Hunting Act. They claimed that the 1949 Act had not been lawfully passed either because the 1911 Act could not be used to amend itself or because it provided a method of making delegated or subordinate legislation which could not alter the process of legislating. Consequently, they claimed, the 1949 Act had not reduced the delay specified in the 1911 Act and the Hunting Act, which was passed only in accordance with the requirements <b>as</b> <b>amended</b> <b>by</b> the 1949 Act, was invalid.|$|E
5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, <b>as</b> <b>amended</b> <b>by</b> the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E
