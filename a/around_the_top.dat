5|$|Somerset {{became more}} stable in the {{aftermath}} of the post-invasion period and the unsuccessful 1068 rebellion against Norman rule. It was common in the period for the Normans to build religious houses to accompany major castles, and accordingly William de Mohun endowed a Benedictine priory at Dunster in 1090, along with its parent abbey at Bath. The River Avill was important for trade; the region around Dunster was rich with fisheries and vineyards, and Dunster Castle prospered. Stone fortifications were built on the site during the early 12th century, probably forming a shell keep <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the motte.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds {{rejoined the}} Cincinnati Reds farm system in 1987, {{this time as}} their Triple-A affiliate. As a result, a number of minor leaguers played in the Reds {{organization}} at two different levels with Nashville. Spending {{the beginning of the}} 1987 season <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the standings, the team hit a slump after losing a few key players midseason. The result was a 64–76 record under skipper Jack Lind and a last place finish. One player lost due to injuries was third baseman Chris Sabo. Sabo was promoted to Cincinnati in 1988 and was named the National League Rookie of the Year, a first for any former Sounds player.|$|E
5|$|William {{also began}} to {{reconstruct}} {{the inside of the}} inner bailey, a programme of work that was continued by his descendants over the next few decades. The work included a chapel, a hall and solar, and various service buildings. An open-backed square tower was built in stone along the wall on top of the motte; this tower was later rebuilt, possibly because of pressure on it from the motte earthworks, and the top of the motte was relaid with flagstones to form pathways <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> A stone gatehouse was built {{on the west side of}} the wall, leading from the outer bailey.|$|E

5|$|One {{factor was}} the {{introduction}} of stone into castle building. The earliest stone castles had emerged in the 10th century, with stone keeps being built on mottes along the Catalonia frontier and several, including Château de Langeais, in Angers. Although wood was a more powerful defensive material than was once thought, stone became increasingly popular for military and symbolic reasons. Some existing motte-and-bailey castles were converted to stone, with the keep and the gatehouse usually the first parts to be upgraded. Shell keeps were built on many mottes, circular stone shells running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the motte, sometime protected by a further chemise, or low protective wall, around the base. By the 14th century, a number of motte and bailey castles had been converted into powerful stone fortresses.|$|E
5|$|What's the Story was {{released}} on 2 October 1995. The album sold quickly; the Daily Mirror reported the day after release that central London HMV stores were selling copies of the album {{at a rate of}} two per minute. At {{the end of the first}} week of sales, the album had sold a record-breaking 347,000 copies, making it (at the time) the second-fastest-selling album in British history, behind Michael Jackson's Bad. After initially entering the UK charts at number one, it hovered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> three for the rest of the year before initiating a six-week stay at the top in mid January, followed by a further three weeks at number one in March. In total, the album didn't leave the top three for an astonishing seven months.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E

5|$|Dry air {{prevented}} the convection from initially reorganising after Gillian was downgraded. With a ridge to the south, the low turned westward <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Top</b> End of northwestern Australia. On 17March, the system moved north of 10°S, {{into the area}} of warning responsibility of the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics. By that time, the low-level circulation was disconnected from its mid-level circulation, and land interaction with Indonesia was expected to prevent redevelopment. Late on 18March, the storm moved over the island of Timor, and over the subsequent two days passed over several other Indonesian islands. On 21March, the convection reorganised due to a drop in wind shear, and at 12:00UTC that day, the BoM again upgraded Gillian to tropical cyclone status while the storm was about 380km (235mi) south-southeast of Jakarta. On the same day, the JTWC also re-initiated advisories on the storm, noting that the circulation had improved as it moved away from Indonesia. With low wind shear and favourable outflow, Gillian gradually intensified while moving southwestward around the ridge. On 22March, the storm passed just north of Christmas Island while Gillian was developing an eye; by that time, the 10minute sustained winds had increased to 95km/h (60mph) within an environment favourable for continued strengthening.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Gillian was {{the second}} most {{powerful}} of the 2013–14 Australian region cyclone season and the strongest in the basin in four years. It developed on 8March, 2014, in the Gulf of Carpentaria offshore northern Australia. It drifted southeastward, moving over northwestern Queensland on 10March as a weak tropical cyclone, and subsequently turned to the southwest and later to the west. Unfavourable wind shear, land interaction, and dry air prevented much restrengthening, and for several days, Gillian was a weak tropical low. The storm moved northward and curved westward <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Top</b> End of northwestern Australia, and subsequently moved across several islands in Indonesia, first Timor on 18March. On 21March, Gillian again became a tropical cyclone as it moved away from Indonesia. On the next day, it passed just southeast of Christmas Island as an intensifying storm, and subsequently Gillian underwent rapid deepening. On 23March, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph). On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1-minute sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph), making it a Category5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Increased wind shear caused the cyclone to rapidly weaken, and both BoM and JTWC discontinued advisories on Gillian on 26March.|$|E

30|$|Using a 46.5 -MHz {{atmospheric}} radar {{referred to}} as the MU radar (MUR) and a Raman/Mie lidar installed at the Shigaraki (34 ° 51 ′N, 136 ° 06 ′E), continuous wind motions <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of <b>the</b> midlatitude cirrus are described for the first time. The cloud system extended from the northeast to southwest (35 °N- 50 °N) along the eastward-moving trough and passed over Shigaraki in the nighttime between 5 – 6 November 2004. Cloud-top altitude observed by the lidar was located at ∼ 10.6 km around 1900 LST 5 November, then gradually descended to ∼ 8.4 km around 0500 LST 6 November. The westerly wind observed by MUR with 12 -min and 150 -m resolutions showed a rapid increase with altitude <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cloud <b>tops</b> and was almost always larger than 25 m s− 1 above ∼ 1 km higher than <b>the</b> cloud <b>tops.</b> Objective reanalysis showed that a subtropical jet whose core existed to the south of Shigaraki caused a synoptic-scale vertical increase in <b>the</b> westerly wind <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cloud <b>tops.</b> Radiosondes observed a significant vertical increase of potential temperature (greater than 4 K within several hundred meters) <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cloud <b>tops.</b> MUR successfully observed fine time and altitude variations of winds which showed a good correspondence with <b>the</b> descending cloud <b>tops.</b>|$|R
