5|$|With new {{suburban}} developments beckoning, {{many white}} middle-class residents {{moved out of}} the city along new highway routes, and Norfolk's population declined, a pattern repeated in numerous cities during the postwar era independently of segregation issues. In the late-1960s and early-1970s, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's Granby Street commercial corridor, located just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>blocks</b> inland from the waterfront. The opening of malls and large shopping centers drew off retail business from Granby Street.|$|E

5|$|NY22 {{runs along}} South Catherine Street for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>blocks,</b> then divides into one-way couplets {{for the first}} time since Westchester County, with {{northbound}} traffic moving a block to the east to follow Oak Street, while southbound traffic comes down North Catherine Street. It parallels US9 for a couple of blocks, intersecting NY3 (Cornelia Street) just a block west of its eastern terminus at that highway. After Boynton Avenue, the separate streets reunite and turns northwest just before it has its second and final exit with the Northway. Just after the exit, NY374 begins along the westbound route as NY22 turns to the north once again.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between April 16, 1991 and September 27, 1991, using a mix of fixed sets and on-location footage. The production suffered {{from a lack of}} available set space because of shortages; the Starfleet Headquarters set was actually built <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>blocks</b> away from Paramount Pictures at the Hollywood Presbyterian Church. Meyer copied a technique used during filming of Citizen Kane, where the filmmakers let the set fall into darkness to save money on construction. The film was shot in Super 35 instead of anamorphic format, because of the former's greater flexibility in framing and lens selection, larger depth of field, and faster lenses.|$|E
