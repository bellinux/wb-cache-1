50|$|A single {{survey is}} made {{of at least a}} sample (or full {{population}} {{in the case of a}} census), a method of data collection (e.g., a questionnaire) and individual questions or items that become data that can be analyzed statistically. A single survey may focus on different types of topics such as preferences (e.g., for a presidential candidate), opinions (e.g., should <b>abortion</b> <b>be</b> <b>legal?),</b> behavior (smoking and alcohol use), or factual information (e.g., income), depending on its purpose. Since survey research is almost always based on a sample of the population, the success of the research is dependent on the representativeness of the sample with respect to a target population of interest to the researcher. That target population can range from the general population of a given country to specific groups of people within that country, to a membership list of a professional organization, or list of students enrolled in a school system (see also sampling (statistics) and survey sampling).|$|E

50|$|Therapeutic <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>abortion</b> induced {{following}} {{a diagnosis of}} medical necessity.

25|$|A Gallup poll {{conducted}} in May 2014 indicates that 50% of Americans believe that <b>abortions</b> should <b>be</b> <b>legal</b> under certain circumstances, 28% believe <b>abortion</b> should <b>be</b> <b>legal</b> under any circumstances, and 21% believe that <b>abortion</b> should <b>be</b> illegal in all circumstances.|$|R
50|$|Birth control <b>is</b> <b>legal</b> {{nationwide}} as of 2014. <b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal</b> nationwide as of 2014; however, {{states are}} allowed to place regulations on abortion which fall short of prohibition after the first trimester of pregnancy.|$|R
50|$|<b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal</b> {{in nearly}} every European country {{although}} there is a wide variation in the restrictions under which it is permitted. Restrictions on <b>abortion</b> <b>are</b> most stringent in countries that are more strongly observant of the Catholic faith.|$|R

5000|$|A Gallup poll in December 2001 asked respondents: [...] "Do {{you think}} <b>abortions</b> should <b>be</b> <b>legal</b> under any {{circumstances}}, legal only {{under certain circumstances}} or illegal in all circumstances and in what circumstances?" [...] The results showed that 32% of Canadians believed <b>abortion</b> should <b>be</b> <b>legal</b> in all circumstances (down from 37% in 2000), 52% believed <b>abortion</b> should only <b>be</b> <b>legal</b> in certain circumstances and 14% thought <b>abortions</b> should <b>be</b> illegal in all circumstances, (up 9% from 2000).|$|R
50|$|Legal {{protection}} {{of access to}} <b>abortion</b> has <b>been</b> brought into some countries where <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal.</b> These laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction, vandalism, picketing, and other actions, or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment.|$|R
5000|$|Unsafe abortions {{sometimes}} occur where <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal,</b> {{and safe}} <b>abortions</b> sometimes occur where <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> illegal. [...] Legalization {{is not always}} followed by elimination of unsafe abortion. [...] Affordable safe services may be unavailable despite legality, and conversely women {{may be able to}} afford medically competent services despite illegality.|$|R
5000|$|Even though <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal,</b> <b>abortion</b> {{can carry}} heavy social stigma; {{for this reason}} {{incidence}} of <b>abortions</b> may <b>be</b> difficult to measure because in medicine they can be reported variously as miscarriage, [...] "induced miscarriage", [...] "menstrual regulation", [...] "mini-abortion", and [...] "regulation of a delayed/suspended menstruation".|$|R
50|$|Hungary is country {{influenced}} by Roman Catholicism, and, although <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal,</b> it not {{very easy to}} access: women {{have to go through}} a specific procedure involving counseling, a waiting period, and a certificate from a midwife in order to obtain an abortion.|$|R

50|$|In practice, {{access to}} {{abortion}} varies greatly between different Muslim-majority countries. In countries like Turkey and Tunisia, <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> unconditionally <b>legal</b> on request.

50|$|<b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal</b> {{in cases}} where the {{continuation}} of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the mother's physical or mental health or life, subject to medical certification.

5000|$|Great Britain: A January 2010 Angus Reid Public Opinion poll asked [...] "Do {{you think}} <b>abortion</b> should <b>be</b> <b>legal</b> under any circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances, or illegal in all circumstances?"

50|$|In Italy <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal,</b> but, in {{the past}} years, {{it has become more}} and more {{difficult}} to access it, due to the rising number of objectors among doctors and nurses.

50|$|Hammond {{revealed}} on the Donnie McClurkin Show {{that his}} mother confessed to him three months before she died that she had attempted to have him aborted. The procedure, done in 1960, before <b>abortions</b> <b>were</b> <b>legal,</b> failed. Hammond's mother returned for a second attempt but decided against the procedure; Hammond was later born in December 1960.|$|R
5000|$|Alongside {{apartheid}} the NP government {{implemented a}} programme of social conservatism. Pornography [...] and gambling were banned.

50|$|Abortion: This {{was not a}} {{significant}} issue in this election. <b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal</b> in Canada after Parliament's failure to pass legislation to replace previous restrictions ruled illegal by the courts. Many Conservatives and a few Liberals oppose abortion. The Liberals tried {{to use it as a}} wedge issue after comments from pro-life Conservatives, but it didn't change the outcome.|$|R
2500|$|Reported {{methods of}} unsafe, {{self-induced}} abortion include misuse of misoprostol, and insertion of non-surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus. These methods are rarely seen {{in developed countries}} where surgical <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal</b> and available. All of these, and any other method to terminate pregnancy may be called [...] "induced miscarriage".|$|R

50|$|Some pro-life Democrats {{believe that}} <b>abortion</b> should <b>be</b> {{strictly}} illegal under all conditions except {{instances in which}} the mother's life is in jeopardy.

50|$|<b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal</b> in New Zealand, {{if certain}} {{criteria}} are met. In general, either {{the health of}} the pregnant woman or the foetus must be in jeopardy.

5000|$|Clauses 312-321 of the 1977 {{penal code}} limit the {{circumstances}} when an <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>legal</b> in Israel. <b>Abortions</b> must <b>be</b> {{approved by a}} termination committee. <b>Abortions</b> can only <b>be</b> performed by licensed gynecologists in recognized medical facilities that are specifically and publicly recognized as a provider of abortions. [...] However, the Israeli Cabinet updated the 1977 law in 2014 to allow abortion on demand for nearly every woman in the country seeking an abortion.|$|R
50|$|Abortion in Costa Rica is {{severely}} restricted by criminal law. Currently, <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> allowed in Costa Rica only {{in order to}} preserve the life or physical health of the woman. <b>Abortions</b> <b>are</b> illegal in almost all cases, including when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest and when the fetus suffers from medical problems or birth defects. Both social and economic factors have led to this legal status. It remains unclear whether <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> <b>legal</b> to preserve the mental health of the woman.|$|R

50|$|The {{defense had}} {{asked the court to}} hear the {{testimony}} of the former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline and Barry Disney, a current member of that office.
