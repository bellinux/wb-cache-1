There, the Æsir invite him in for a drink. Hrungnir goes in, demands a drink, and becomes drunk and belligerent, stating that he will remove Valhalla {{and take it to}} the land of the jötunn, Jötunheimr, among various other things. Eventually, the gods tire of his boasting and invoke Thor, who arrives. Hrungnir states that Thor is under their protection, and subsequently he can't be harmed while in Valhalla. After an exchange of words, Hrungnir challenges Thor to a duel at the location of Griotunagardar, resulting in Hrungnir's death.|$|E

25|$|Yellow flowers such as primrose, rowan, hawthorn, gorse, hazel, and marsh {{marigold}} were placed at doorways and windows in 19th century Ireland, Scotland and Mann. Sometimes loose flowers were strewn <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and windows {{and sometimes they}} were made into bouquets, garlands or crosses and fastened to them. They would also be fastened to cows and equipment for milking and butter making. It is likely that such flowers were used because they evoked fire. Similar May Day customs are found across Europe.|$|E

Pursued by RCMP officers, he passed, on his left, {{the door to a}} committee room in which Stephen Harper and the Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) were meeting. Directly opposite was the door to another caucus room, where leader of the opposition, Thomas Mulcair, and New Democratic Party MPs were gathered. (The Liberals, as the third party, were holding their caucus meeting in a chamber downstairs.) During the shooting, one bullet penetrated the outer doors to the NDP caucus room. Inside their room, NDP MPs dove for cover. Across the hall, Harper was hidden in a closet while Conservative MPs made a barricade <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> grabbing flagpoles to use as rudimentary spears.|$|E
25|$|At dawn Sunday March 4, {{the attackers}} left their hiding {{place in the}} boat and they were divided in two groups: Heraugiere {{attacked}} the position of guard, while Fervet tried to seize control of the fort's arsenal. In a fast action, that took by surprise the Italian soldiers garrisoning the city; the attackers killed forty defenders without any loss. So surprised were the Italians and Spanish that they dispersed into a total rout into {{the streets of the}} city. Before dawn, count Hohenlohe arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of Breda with the Dutch cavalry and after him Maurice of Nassau with {{the main body of the}} army; Count Solms, and Francis Vere being among them. By then the men of Heraugiere had already taken control of most the city.|$|E
25|$|Attempting {{to cross}} the {{mountain}} Caradhras, a snowstorm causes an avalanche, closing the pass. The party reluctantly decide the only way past the Misty Mountains is to go under them, via the goblin mines of Moria. They arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> of Durin, but are attacked by the Watcher. After slaying the creature, they continue into Moria. Inside, Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) is horrified to learn that his cousin Balin is dead. In the Chamber of Mazarbul, the Fellowship finds Balin's tomb and a record of how the dwarves lost the mine to the goblins. The fellowship is then attacked by a hoard of goblins and a cave troll. The party manage to fight off their attackers {{and get to the}} exit, but on their way across the Bridge of Khazad-dûm they are confronted by a Balrog, and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) sacrifices himself to allow the others to escape.|$|E

25|$|In 1583, Spanish {{soldiers}} {{under the}} command of D. Pedro de Toledo landed in Pasteleiro in the southwestern part of the island. After some skirmishes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of the fort, the Captain of Faial, António Guedes de Sousa, was executed. Four years later, the Earl of Cumberland commanding a fleet of 13 British ships in the Azores Voyage of 1589 captured a Spanish ship, and then plundered the town's churches and convents, profaning them and destroying reliquary and crucifixes. They captured several artillery pieces and set fire to the houses within the Fort of Santa Cruz. Two cannons, located in Porto Pim, were taken. In 1597, a new force, under Sir Walter Raleigh, second in command to Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, sacked and burned the religious buildings and churches in Horta, as well as the neighboring parishes of Flamengos, Feteira and Praia do Almoxarife. The constant threat of privateers and pirates forced the construction of several forts and lookouts.|$|E
25|$|The Ninth Session {{was held}} on Friday, 17 May, at which it was decreed that anyone could leave the Obedience of Gregory or the Obedience of Benedict without penalty, but that those who {{positively}} refused to leave would be permanently punished. The Tenth Session took place on Tuesday 22 May, at which a petition was presented to send an embassay to Genoa to engage in negotiations. The two contending parties, Benedict and Gregory, were summoned once again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of the Cathedral by two cardinals. A petition was presented to certify that the two cardinals had carried out the summons. A Notary began to read the articles which were being proffered against the two popes, first in general terms and then in detail, citing witnesses and documents. These were produced by the Bishop of Pisa, Alamanno Adimari. Twenty articles were read and accepted before {{the time for the}} day's sitting elapsed. The reading and the presentation of witnesses and proofs continued at the Eleventh Session on 23 May.|$|E
