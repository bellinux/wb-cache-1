40|$|Abstract: A {{scheme for}} {{gathering}} detailed <b>assignment</b> <b>level</b> data on curricula for assessment purposes is presented. An assessment tool {{that focuses on}} the individual <b>assignment</b> <b>level</b> can provide detailed information, which may not be apparent at the course or program level. An assignment database containing a record for each student assignment is proposed here to provide a means to access detailed assessment data that is readily available from the faculty teaching the courses in the major. The assessment scheme described here incorporates data that is based on actual student activities in the program. Assignment attributes that are based upon the desired outcomes of the program are provided for each assignment by the faculty responsible for each course. Therefore an inherent connection to the curricula, faculty input and a means for direct feedback to the curricula are built into this assessment scheme. The grade statistics available on the individual assignments can be a component of the performance measures utilized to assess the achievement of the program's desired student outcomes. This database, once built, can be efficiently maintained using standard personal computer spreadsheet and database office software...|$|E

40|$|A {{classifier}} {{system is}} a machine learning system that learns a collection of rules, called classifiers. Mostly, classifiers {{can be regarded as}} simple stimulus-response rules. A first level of learning called credit <b>assignment</b> <b>level,</b> consists of reinforcement learning on these classifiers. A classifier is reinforced in dependence on the result of an interaction between the CS and its environment. A second level that is independent of the first one consists of rule discovery. For that a CS usually uses genetic algorithms that can only use very indirect information about the interaction between the system and the environment in the form of rule strengths. It is often the problem with CSs that hierarchical chunks of classifiers are destroyed when the rule discovery is applied. Therefore in some applications CSs don't use the rule discovery level or don't delete classifiers (eg. Riolo 1991).

40|$|The {{considered}} problem {{consists in}} optimizing the refueling {{costs of a}} fleet of locomotives over a railway network. The goal consists in determining the number of trucks contracted for each yard (truck assignment problem) and to determine the refueling plan of each locomotive (fuel distribution problem), while minimizing the costs and satisfying constraints. A two-levels approach is proposed to tackle this NP-hard problem. Three metaheuristics (namely a descent procedure, a tabu search, and an ant local search algorithm) are proposed for the truck <b>assignment</b> <b>level,</b> and a flow model is designed for the fuel distribution level. A post-optimization procedure can be combined with the latter flow model. Six algorithms are proposed for the whole problem, and were tested on a realistic instance proposed by the Railway Applications Section of INFORMS. Competitive results were obtained.

40|$|Recognition of {{tone and}} {{intonation}} {{is essential for}} speech recognition and language understanding. However, most approaches to this recognition task have relied upon extensive collections of manually tagged data obtained at substantial time and financial cost.

We employ both unsupervised clustering and semi-supervised learning to recognize pitch accent in English and tones in Mandarin Chinese. In unsupervised Mandarin tone clustering experiments, we achieve 57 - 87 % accuracy on materials ranging from broadcast news to clean lab speech. For English pitch accent in broadcast news materials, results reach 78 %. In the semi-supervised framework, we achieve Mandarin tone recognition accuracies ranging from 70 % for broadcast news speech to 94 % for read speech, outperforming both Support Vector Machines (SVMs) trained on only the labeled data and the 25 % most common class <b>assignment</b> <b>level.</b> These {{results indicate that the}} intrinsic structure of tone and pitch accent acoustics can be exploited to reduce the need for costly labeled training data for tone learning and recognition...|$|E

The reaction used was 54 Fe(29 Si, 2 pn) 80 Sr at beam energies between 85 and 110 MeV. γ-γ coincidence measurements were performed with a thin target to investigate the level structure. Both neutron gated and singles angular distribution measurements were carried out {{to aid in the}} <b>assignment</b> of <b>level</b> spins. The directional correlation ratios extracted from the γ-γ coincidence data provided a consistency check for the spin <b>assignments.</b> <b>Level</b> lifetimes were measured by the Doppler shift attenuation method in a thick target γ-γ coincidence measurement. The ground state band has been identified up to (26 +) and three previously unobserved sidebands have been discovered. The deduced level scheme is compared with cranking model calculations; the predicted transformation to mostly non-collective excitations of an oblate shape is not observed experimentally. The behaviour of the J (1) and J (2) moments of inertia is discussed and presented as evidence for either static or dynamic γ-deformation in the light Sr isotopes. In addition, the level structure is compared with IBM- 2 calculations. These calculations indicate the importance of proton excitations across the Z= 40 subshell gap, into the g 9 / 2 orbital, and suggest that the lowest lying 80 Sr sideband can be identified with the collective IBM- 2 quasi-γ band.

40|$|Individuals sampled in hybrid {{zones are}} usually {{analysed}} {{according to their}} sampling locality, morphology, behaviour or karyotype. But the increasing availability of genetic information more and more favours its use for individual sorting purposes and numerous assignment methods based on the genetic composition of individuals have been developed. The shrews of the Sorex araneus group offer good opportunities to test the genetic assignment on individuals identified by their karyotype. Here we explored the potential and efficiency of a Bayesian assignment method combined or not with a reference dataset to study admixture and individual assignment in the difficult context of two hybrid zones between karyotypic species of the Sorex araneus group. As a whole, we assigned more than 80 % of the individuals to their respective karyotypic categories (i. e. 'pure' species or hybrids). This <b>assignment</b> <b>level</b> is comparable to what was obtained for the same species away from hybrid zones. Additionally, we showed that the assignment result for several individuals was strongly affected by the inclusion or not of a reference dataset. This {{highlights the importance of}} such comparisons when analysing hybrid zones. Finally, differences between the admixture levels detected in both hybrid zones support the hypothesis of an impact of chromosomal rearrangements on gene flow...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Verbal autopsies provide {{valuable}} information for studying mortality patterns in populations that lack reliable vital registration data. Methods for transforming verbal autopsy results into meaningful information for health workers and policymakers, however, are often costly or complicated to use. We present a simple additive algorithm, the Tariff Method (termed Tariff), {{which can be}} used for assigning individual cause of death and for determining cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs) from verbal autopsy data. Methods Tariff calculates a score, or "tariff," for each cause, for each sign/symptom, across a pool of validated verbal autopsy data. The tariffs are summed for a given response pattern in a verbal autopsy, and this sum (score) provides the basis for predicting the cause of death in a dataset. We implemented this algorithm and evaluated the method's predictive ability, both in terms of chance-corrected concordance at the individual cause <b>assignment</b> <b>level</b> and in terms of CSMF accuracy at the population level. The analysis was conducted separately for adult, child, and neonatal verbal autopsies across 500 pairs of train-test validation verbal autopsy data. Results Tariff is capable of outperforming physician-certified verbal autopsy in most cases. In terms of chance-corrected concordance, the method achieves 44. 5 % in adults, 39 % in children, and 23. 9 % in neonates. CSMF accuracy was 0. 745 in adults, 0. 709 in children, and 0. 679 in neonates. Conclusions Verbal autopsies can be an efficient means of obtaining cause of death data, and Tariff provides an intuitive, reliable method for generating individual cause assignment and CSMFs. The method is transparent and flexible and can be readily implemented by users without training in statistics or computer science. </p...|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} Data {{published by}} Eurocontrol report the traffic growth over summer 2011 {{to be around}} 2 %. In these conditions alleviating delays caused by airspace congestion is, {{and will continue to}} be, critical to the operation of the European air traffic control system. In the origin of delays are several factors, an important one being the congestions. We will focus on congestion in the airspace rather than at airports, both problems can be treated separately. Here we are interested in reducing the en-route congestion and the induced cost, and we study flight level optimization with respect to a given traffic demand and given routes. We typically consider here the total cost due to en-route conflict resolution. With respect to the FLA (Flight <b>Level</b> <b>Assignment)</b> problem, we restrict ourselves to only three possible levels for each flight, called preferred levels (the one in the middle being the most preferred). Despite this restriction, the problem remains highly combinatorial due to the large number of simultaneous flights. We prove formally that the flight <b>level</b> <b>assignment</b> problem is NP-complete in the strong sense even for an airspace with only three flight levels, which makes it hard to solve at optimum even for reduced size instances. The problem becomes rather more difficult when involving the uncertainties in ATM (Air Traffic Management). More precisely, an important question that we raise in this paper is how to include the potential en-route conflicts associated with each aircraft in the flight <b>level</b> <b>assignment</b> model and take into account the uncertainties related to it. All this leads to the robust flight <b>level</b> <b>assignment</b> problem and the associated mathematical model, which is the main focus of this work. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Taxonomic {{classification}} of metagenomic sequences {{is the first}} step in metagenomic analysis. Existing taxonomic classification approaches are of two types, similarity-based and composition-based. Similarity-based approaches, though accurate and specific, are extremely slow. Since, metagenomic projects generate millions of sequences, adopting similarity-based approaches becomes virtually infeasible for research groups having modest computational resources. In this study, we present INDUS - a composition-based approach that incorporates the following novel features. First, INDUS discards the 'one genome-one composition' model adopted by existing compositional approaches. Second, INDUS uses 'compositional distance' information for identifying appropriate <b>assignment</b> <b>levels.</b> Third, INDUS incorporates steps that attempt to reduce biases due to database representation. Results INDUS is able to rapidly classify sequences in both simulated and real metagenomic sequence data sets with classification efficiency significantly higher than existing composition-based approaches. Although the classification efficiency of INDUS is observed to be comparable to those by similarity-based approaches, the binning time (as compared to alignment based approaches) is 23 - 33 times lower. Conclusion Given it's rapid execution time, and high levels of classification efficiency, INDUS is expected to be of immense interest to researchers working in metagenomics and microbial ecology.
