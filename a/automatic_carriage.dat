50|$|In 1934, Scammell {{produced}} the three-wheeled Mechanical Horse, designed by Oliver North to replace horses in rail, postal and other delivery applications. This featured <b>automatic</b> <b>carriage</b> coupling {{and the single}} front wheel could be steered through 360 degrees. It was sold in three- and six-ton versions. The three-tonner was powered by a 1,125-cc side-valve petrol engine and the six-tonner by a 2,043-cc engine. Karrier had introduced a similar vehicle, the Cob, four years earlier.|$|E
5000|$|The Blick Electric was {{a revolutionary}} machine and was {{far ahead of}} its time when it was first {{introduced}} at the Pan-American Exhibition in Buffalo in 1901 following its patent in August 1900 (patent no.656,085). It had all the familiar characteristics of the manual models, plus a QWERTY or a DHIATENSOR keyboard and all the advantages of later electric typewriters, including a light key touch, even typing, and <b>automatic</b> <b>carriage</b> return and line spacing. The machine was powered by an Emerson electric motor mounted on the rear and switched on by turning a Yale key on the side.http://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/index.php3?machine=blickel&cat=ks The motor ran on 104 Volt 60 Hz AC electric current, which was not yet widely standard at the time.

50|$|This Tigr {{is used by}} the Russian Interior Ministry OMON in {{counter-terrorism}} {{operations and}} territorial defense. It is armoured, with IEC 50963-96 Class 3 side/rear protection and Class 5 frontal protection. The vehicle has accommodations for seven occupants including the driver. Early models permit the firing of personal weapons through one-way portholes in the body. In later models personal weapons can be fired through portholes in the armored glass. An <b>automatic</b> gun <b>carriage</b> can be fitted to the roof, along with radio signal jamming equipment.|$|R
5000|$|... "The saw on {{his left}} sets the pace. If the singing blade rips 50 rough {{shingles}} off the block every minute, the sawyer must reach over to its teeth 50 times in 60 seconds; if the <b>automatic</b> <b>carriage</b> feeds the odorous wood 60 times into the hungry teeth, 60 times he must reach over, turn the shingle, trim its edge on the gleaming saw in front of him, cut the narrow strip containing the knot hole with two quick movements of his right hand, and toss the completed board down the chute to the packers, meanwhile keeping eyes and ears open for the sound that asks him to feed a new block into the untiring teeth. Hour after hour the shingle weaver's hands and arms, plain, unarmored flesh and blood, are staked against the screeching steel that cares not what it severs. Hour after hour the steel sings its crescendo note as it bites into the wood, the sawdust cloud thickens, the wet sponge under the sawyer's nose fills with fine particles. [...] "If 'cedar asthma,' the shingle weaver's occupational disease, does not get him, the steel will. Sooner or later he reaches over a little too far, the whirling blade tosses drops of deep red into the air, and a finger, a hand, or part of an arm comes sliding down the slick chute." ...|$|E
40|$|A display {{processor}} used {{to interface}} a 21 -inch {{cathode-ray tube display}} with a small research computer is described. Inputs from an external 4 K memory, incremental and absolute shaft position encoders, and data/control switches are also provided. In addition to the point-plotting and single-character mode of the display, a line generator using incremental binary rate multiplier techniques is incorporated for drawing vectors, circles, and parabolas. A character sequencer allows 4 characters per 24 -bit word to be displayed, and also provides <b>automatic</b> <b>carriage</b> return and line feed for text displayed on the CRT screen.
