50|$|Adhesion {{barriers}} are physical films, fabrics, gels or other {{materials that are}} applied between layers of tissues {{at the end of}} a surgery before the incision site is closed. While in place, the <b>adhesion</b> <b>barrier</b> acts as a physical barrier to separate traumatized tissue surfaces so that they do not adhere to one another while the tissue surfaces heal. Once the tissue surfaces heal, which is usually between 3 and 7 days, the barrier dissolves and is absorbed by the body.|$|E
30|$|Summary (4 lines): The {{safety of}} the new bioresorbable <b>adhesion</b> <b>barrier</b> system was {{evaluated}} in patients undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy. It {{was found that the}} use of the system was safe without major complications.|$|E

30|$|Results: Adhesion {{formation}} {{was significantly}} reduced after treatment with the <b>adhesion</b> <b>barriers</b> than after no treatment. Coverage of the traumatized areas with adhesions was 79 % {{in the control}} group. This was reduced to 54 % by the liquid barrier Adept(R) and to 69 % by the gel barrier Spraygel(R).

30|$|Less {{frequently}} reported complications include {{a case of}} unabsorbed <b>adhesion</b> <b>barrier</b> observed during repeat surgery at 1  year [7] and reports of disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis, iatrogenic adenomyosis and parasitic myomas following laparoscopic myomectomy [8 – 10].|$|E
30|$|Peritoneal adhesions can be {{classified}} into three categories—congenital, inflammatory (e.g. post-infectious or due to endometriosis), and post-operative. Post-operative adhesions occur secondary to surgery and they represent the most frequent complication of abdominal and pelvic operations [1]. Consequently, experimental and clinical {{research has focused on}} ways to prevent adhesion formation [2, 3]. Experiments mostly depend on animal models with objective and reproducible scoring approaches for adhesions. There are a myriad of different adhesion-inducing models with subsequent scoring systems descriptively listed in the literature, both macroscopic and microscopic [4]. These aim to describe experiments to improve <b>adhesion</b> <b>barriers</b> [5, 6] or optimise surgical instruments with regards to adhesiogenesis. However the lack of uniformity in experimental settings makes the assessment and comparison of <b>adhesion</b> <b>barriers</b> and surgical instruments difficult. As the reproducibility and quality of any adhesion research depends crucially on the employed scoring systems, {{it is important to consider}} the strengths and weaknesses of the respective system used and its potential clinical relevance. Regarding adhesions it would be of clinical benefit to have a uniform, widely used score that seeks to describe a relevant surgical condition for inter-surgeon comparability.|$|R

30|$|Seprafilm <b>adhesion</b> <b>barrier</b> is a bioresorbable {{membrane}} {{composed of}} chemically modified sodium hyaluronate (HA) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The absorbable <b>adhesion</b> <b>barrier</b> received FDA market approval in 1996 {{and is available}} worldwide. To date, over two million patients have been treated with Seprafilm. The product is indicated for use in adult patients undergoing abdominal or pelvic laparotomy and is intended to reduce the incidence, extent, and severity of postoperative adhesions between the abdominal wall and omentum, small bowel, bladder, and stomach; and between the uterus and tubes, ovaries, large bowel, and bladder [1]. Postsurgical adhesions are also {{known to be a}} source of complications following abdominal and pelvic laparoscopy [2], pediatric procedures as well as in surgical patients with infections and malignancy. Consequently, Seprafilm has been used and studied “off-label,” at the discretion of individual surgeons, following many of these types of surgeries.|$|E
50|$|Applying <b>adhesion</b> <b>barriers</b> {{during surgery}} {{can help to}} prevent the {{formation}} of adhesions. There are two methods that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adhesion prevention: Intercede and Seprafilm. One study found that Seprafilm is twice as effective at preventing adhesion formation when compared to just surgical technique alone. Surgical humidification therapy may also minimise the incidence of adhesion formation. Laparoscopic surgery has a reduced risk for creating adhesions. Steps can be taken during surgery to help prevent adhesions such as handling tissues and organs gently, using starch- and latex-free gloves, not allowing tissues to dry out, and shortening surgery time.|$|R
30|$|Results from {{randomised}} {{trials and}} clinical series {{have shown that}} laparoscopic myomectomy provides the advantages of shorter hospitalisation, faster recovery, fewer adhesions, and less blood loss than abdominal myomectomy when performed by skilled surgeons. Improvements in surgical instruments and techniques allow for safe removal and multilayer myometrial repair of multiple large intramural myomas. Randomised trials {{support the use of}} absorbable <b>adhesion</b> <b>barriers</b> to reduce <b>adhesions,</b> but there is no apparent benefit of presurgical use of GnRH agonists. Pregnancy outcomes have been good, and the risk of uterine rupture is very low when the myometrium is repaired appropriately. Laparoscopic myomectomy is an appropriate alternative to abdominal myomectomy, hysterectomy, and uterine artery embolisation for some women [30].|$|R
30|$|Sodium {{hyaluronate}} and carboxymethylcellulose (Seprafilm®, Genzyme Genzyme Biosurgery, Bridgewater, USA) is a hyaluronate–carboxymethylcellulose membrane, {{which is}} placed over a suture or an injured area without stitches and remains {{in place for}} 7  days. In contrast to Interceed®, no loss of efficacy {{in the presence of}} blood has been reported. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of Seprafilm® mainly in general surgery. It {{is one of the most}} widely studied <b>adhesion</b> <b>barriers,</b> with more than 20 published studies that included over 4600 patients [70]. In gynecological surgery, the efficacy of Seprafilm® has also been demonstrated for some procedures, but it is not easy to use in all procedures. Seprafilm is fragile and, therefore, difficult to handle particularly in laparoscopy.|$|R

40|$|Background: Adhesions follow {{abdominal}} surgery with an incidence {{as high as}} 95 %, resulting in invalidating complications such as bowel obstruction, female infertility, and chronic pain. Searches have been performed for a safe and effective adhesion barrier; however, such barriers have impaired anastomotic site healing. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of a new <b>adhesion</b> <b>barrier,</b> polyvinyl alcohol gel, on healing of colonic anastomoses using a rat model. Methods: Thirty-two Wistar rats were divided in two groups. In all animals, an anastomosis was constructed in the ascending colon. The first group received no <b>adhesion</b> <b>barrier,</b> whereas in the second group, 2 mL of polyvinyl alcohol gel (A-Part Gel®; Aesculap AG, Tuttlingen, Germany) was applied circularly around the anastomosis. All animals were sacrificed on the seventh post-operative day, and the abdomen was inspected for signs of anastomotic leakage. The anastomotic bursting pressure, the adhesions around the anastomosis, and the collagen content of the excised anastomosis were measured. Results: No significant differences were observed between the two groups in the incidence of anastomotic leakage, the anastomotic bursting pressure (p= 0. 08), or the collagen concentration (p= 0. 91). No significant reduction in amount of adhesions was observed in the rats receiving polyvinyl alcohol gel. Conclusions: This experimental study showed no significant differences in anastomotic leakage, anastomotic bursting pressure, or collagen content of the anastomosis when using the <b>adhesion</b> <b>barrier</b> polyvinyl alcohol around colonic anastomoses.

30|$|Six RCTs have {{assessed}} {{the role of}} semi-solid (gel) <b>adhesion</b> <b>barriers</b> used postoperatively [33 – 38] {{as they may be}} suitable for preventing IUAs owing to high sensitivity and prolonged time on an injured surface such as the postoperative endometrium [39]. These studies randomized women and compared polyethylene oxide-sodium carboxymethylcellulose gel and hyaluronic acid derivatives against control groups or against each other. For two of these studies, procedures unrelated to pregnancy were examined and reported a significant reduction in de novo <b>adhesion</b> formation when <b>barriers</b> were used compared with controls (3 / 55 [6 %] vs 12 / 55 [22 %] [33] and 7 / 67 [10 %] vs 17 / 65 [26 %] [35]; p[*]<[*]. 05 for both studies). The third of these studies did not report a reduction in de novo adhesion formation in blinded follow-up with 13 / 18 (72 %) treated women versus 15 / 22 (68 %) women in the control group with no adhesions at 9  weeks follow-up [38]. Adhesions {{were more likely to be}} severe in the control group, although not statistically significant. Unfortunately, none of these studies report data on subsequent pregnancy.|$|R
30|$|Intrauterine and intraabdominal adhesions are a {{major cause}} for infertility. The most recent {{investigations}} have demonstrated the potential of intraperitoneal <b>adhesion</b> <b>barriers</b> combined with good surgical technique to reduce adhesion formation. For intrauterine adhesions we suggest to minimize unipolar and bipolar instrumentation whenever possible. We advocate the use of estrogens for 10  days after adhesiolysis: 2 dd two tablets of estradiol 2  mg. Instillation of Hyalobarrier Gel Endo actually is not reimbursed but may have a beneficial effect after myomectomy or adhesiolysis. Concerning laparoscopic and laparotomic prevention of adhesion also, meticulous surgical technique is of the utmost importance. Residual blood should be avoided by careful hemostasis and rinsing with Ringer’s lactate with heparin. Preferably braided sutures {{are not to be}} left in the abdominal cavity. We advise to avoid unipolar and bipolar cauterization when possible and to replace with ultrasonic or laser energy. The use of floatation barriers does not seem to add substantial benefit in the prevention of <b>adhesions.</b> Gel <b>barriers</b> (Hyalobarrier Gel Endo® or Intercoat®) are proven to {{have a significant effect on}} adhesion prevention. As for sheets, there is enough evidence that they prevent adhesions. The use of NSAID in the prevention of pain and/or corticosteroids in the prevention of postoperative nausea is already mainstay after surgery and can be further endorsed in the prevention of adhesions.|$|R
