5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in <b>advertisements</b> appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among <b>advertisements.</b> Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – {{the level at which}} <b>advertisements</b> are most effective.|$|E
