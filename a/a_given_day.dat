5|$|In some areas, {{people use}} weather {{forecasts}} {{to determine what}} to wear on <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day.</b> Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and the wind chill, forecasts {{can be used to}} plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead to survive through them.|$|E
5|$|Departure {{times for}} these flights as {{specified}} during booking are by definition approximate, with the settlement service optimised {{on the fly}} depending on local demand for <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day.</b> Settlement flights in the Disko Bay region are unique {{in that they are}} operated only during winter and spring. During summer and autumn, transport between settlements is only by sea, with services operated by Diskoline, a government-contracted ferry service based in Ilulissat.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day.</b> Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2014, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.|$|E

50|$|The second {{approach}} to informal testing is {{to wait for}} some days or weeks and then, as time allows, randomly select proofs to re-read while outside the department. Such proofs {{may or may not}} be accompanied by the copy pages that the proofreader saw. Here the re-reader is examining the proof from the perspective of typographical and formatting accuracy alone, ignoring how many other pages the first reader had read that day, and had yet to read, and how many pages were successfully read and how many deadlines were met under <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day's</b> specific conditions.|$|R
5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} narcosis will occur on <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day,</b> the first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often more predictable and personal. For example, one diver may have trouble with eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience feelings of euphoria, and another feelings of claustrophobia. Some divers report that they have hearing changes, and that the sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to ascend to avoid the narcosis, although severe narcosis may interfere with the judgement necessary to take preventive action.|$|E
5|$|Both the Zygalski-sheet {{method and}} each bomba worked {{for only a}} single {{scrambler}} rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day.</b> This {{increased the number of}} possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.|$|E

5000|$|On some occasions, {{under these}} conditions, each house {{has chosen to}} meet only on every third day during the period {{spanning}} the election (and sometimes throughout the post-election period as well, until sine die adjournment). In addition, {{it is not necessary}} that either house transact any business during these intermittent meetings. If, during <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day's</b> session, no business is transacted, it becomes a pro forma session, meaning one held only [...] "for the sake of formality." [...] In this case, the formality being satisfied is the constitutional requirement that neither house recess for more than three days if the other has not consented to a recess.|$|R
25|$|The manner {{by which}} wages are {{determined}} can also vary greatly between detasseling contractors.

25|$|SuperFetch caches frequently-used {{applications}} and documents in memory, and {{keeps track of}} when commonly used applications are usually loaded, {{so that they can}} be pre-cached and it also prioritizes the programs currently used over background tasks. SuperFetch aims to negate the negative performance effect of having anti-virus or backup software run when the user is not at the computer. Superfetch is able to learn at what time of <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day</b> an application is used and so it can be pre-cached.|$|E
25|$|Tides are {{commonly}} semi-diurnal (two high waters and two low waters each day), or diurnal (one tidal cycle per day). The two high waters on <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day</b> are typically {{not the same}} height (the daily inequality); these are the higher high water and the lower high water in tide tables. Similarly, the two low waters each day are the higher low water and the lower low water. The daily inequality is not consistent and is generally small when the Moon is over the equator.|$|E
25|$|In Eastern Poland, as in {{many other}} Catholic countries, people {{celebrate}} name days (imieniny) on the day of their patron saint. On the other hand, in Western Poland, birthdays are more popular. Today, in Eastern Poland, birthdays remain relatively intimate celebrations, as often only relatives and close friends know a person's date of birth. Name days, on the other hand, are often celebrated together with co-workers and other less-intimate friends. Information about whose name is associated with <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day</b> can be found in most Polish calendars and on the internet.|$|E

30|$|Another {{approach}} trains a SVM classifier {{to judge}} the presence of animals in photographs [8]. It also divides the content into indoor and outdoor scenes, and proposes 15 attributes to describe various general scene types. For outdoor scenes, it uses sky-illumination attributes to measure the lighting, which effect the perception of photographs. Photos taken in <b>a</b> sunny <b>day</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> clear sky, while those taken in <b>a</b> cloudy <b>day</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> dark sky. Obviously, photos with a clear sky appear aesthetic.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to possessing an intrinsic value, storage {{may also have}} extrinsic value. Intrinsic valuation of storage does not take the cycling ability of high-deliverability storage. The extrinsic valuation {{reflects the fact that}} in such facilities, say salt cavern formations, a proportion of the space can be used more than once, thus increasing value. Such high-deliverability storage facility allows its user to respond to variations in demand/price within a season or during <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day</b> rather than just seasonal variations {{as was the case with}} single cycle facilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{distance}} a trireme {{could cover}} in <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day</b> depended {{much on the}} weather. On a good day, the oarsmen, rowing for 6–8 hours, could propel the ship between eighty and a hundred kilometres. There were rare instances however when experienced crews and new ships were able to cover nearly twice that distance (Thucydides mentions a trireme travelling 300 kilometres in one day). The commanders of the triremes also had to stay aware of the condition of their men. They had to keep their crews comfortably paced {{so as not to}} exhaust them before battle.|$|E
25|$|Much {{research}} has been done on the foraging behavior of the red harvester ant. Three types of workers are most involved in the foraging process: nest patrollers, trail patrollers, and foragers. On <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day,</b> nest patrollers emerge first from the nest to assess the safety and profitability of foraging. The colony gets the majority of its water from the metabolism of the fats in seeds. If food is scarce, or if it is a particularly hot day, the energy and water benefits of foraging may be outweighed by its energy and water costs. In this case, the colony may be forced to rely on its extensive food stores. Seeds may be stored in the nest for months or even several years.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{provides}} a framework for predicting stock magnitude and trend for making trading decisions by making use {{of a combination of}} Data Mining and Text Mining methods. The prediction model predicts the stock market closing price for <b>a</b> <b>given</b> trading <b>day</b> ‘D’, by analysing the information rich unstructured news articles along with the historical stock quotes. In particular, we investigate the immediate impact of the news articles on the time series based on Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). Key phrases provide semantic metadata that summarize and characterize documents. This framework incorporates Kea [1], an algorithm for automatically extracting key phrases from news articles. The prediction power of the Neural Network is used for predicting the closing price for <b>a</b> <b>given</b> trading <b>day.</b> The Neural Network is trained on the extracted key phrases and the stock quotes using the Back propagation Algorithm...|$|R

25|$|Probability {{distributions}} {{are generally}} {{divided into two}} classes. A discrete probability distribution (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes is discrete, such as a coin toss or a roll of dice) can be encoded by a discrete list of the probabilities of the outcomes, known as a probability mass function. On the other hand, a continuous probability distribution (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes can take on values in a continuous range (e.g. real numbers), such as the temperature on <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day)</b> is typically described by probability density functions (with the probability of any individual outcome actually being 0). The normal distribution is a commonly encountered continuous probability distribution. More complex experiments, such as those involving stochastic processes defined in continuous time, may demand the use of more general probability measures.|$|E
25|$|To {{counter the}} virus' use of {{pseudorandom}} domain names, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and several TLD registries began in February 2009 a coordinated barring of transfers and registrations for these domains. Variant D counters this by generating daily {{a pool of}} 50,000 domains across 110 TLDs, from which it randomly chooses 500 to attempt for that day. The generated domain names were also shortened from 8–11 to 4–9 characters {{to make them more}} difficult to detect with heuristics. This new pull mechanism (which was disabled until April 1, 2009) is unlikely to propagate payloads to more than 1% of infected hosts per day, but is expected to function as a seeding mechanism for the virus' peer-to-peer network. The shorter generated names, however, are expected to collide with 150–200 existing domains per day, potentially causing a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) on sites serving those domains. However the large number of generated domains and the fact that not every domain will be contacted for <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>day</b> will probably prevent DDoS situations.|$|E
