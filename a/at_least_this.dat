5|$|The {{time frame}} of the Solar System's {{formation}} has been determined using radiometric dating. Scientists estimate that the Solar System is 4.6billion years old. The oldest known mineral grains on Earth are approximately 4.4billion years old. Rocks this old are rare, as Earth's surface is constantly being reshaped by erosion, volcanism, and plate tectonics. To estimate {{the age of the}} Solar System, scientists use meteorites, which were formed during the early condensation of the solar nebula. Almost all meteorites (see the Canyon Diablo meteorite) are found to have an age of 4.6billion years, suggesting that the Solar System must be <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>this</b> old.|$|E
5|$|When {{a colony}} is dying, for {{whatever}} cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a bee yard), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions {{for their own}} use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>this</b> particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E

In some rural areas, particularly in North India, wives may also take a new first name after their nuptials. Children inherit their surnames from their father.|$|E

25|$|Orites revolutus is 1 of 9 {{species in}} the genus Orites, with 7 endemic to Australia and only 4 in Tasmania. The {{remaining}} 2 species reside in the Chilean Andes and Bolivia. Recent phylogenetic work suggests the Orites genus spread over the Gondwanan continent from South America to Australia during the Paleogene, reaching Australia by the Early Oligocene.

Men wore trousers either as outer garments or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear their pants (termed sokgot) without a covering skirt.

25|$|No later {{mention of}} Morgantina is made until Thucydides lists {{it as part}} of the terms of a truce in the war of 427–424BCE between Syracuse and the Dorian cities of Sicily on one side, and Kamarina, the Khalkidian cities of Sicily, the Sikels, and Athens on the other side. Thucydides says that Syracuse agreed at the Congress of Gela to give Morgantina to Kamarina in return for payment of an indemnity. Kamarina was {{destroyed}} in 405 by the Carthaginians. Morgantina therefore must have been independent from <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>this</b> date, although it was soon recaptured by Dionysios of Syracuse in 396. Syracuse retained (occasionally more nominal than actual) control of Morgantina until the Second Punic War. In 317, Morgantina received the tyrant Agathocles, then in exile, and offered him help in returning to Syracuse. He was elected praetor at Morgantina, and later dux.|$|E
25|$|National glory {{returned}} in 2002–03 when Bayern achieved its fourth double {{by winning the}} Bundesliga with the second largest gap ever to the runner-up and a straight 3–1 win over 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the cup final. However, the whole season was overshadowed by Bayern's unceremonious exit from the Champions League in the first group stage, {{without so much as}} a single win in six matches. The following season, the team, enhanced with the €19 million acquisition of Dutch striker Roy Makaay from Deportivo de La Coruña, overcame <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>this</b> hurdle, but even an underperforming Real Madrid in crisis managed to eliminate the Reds in the round of 16. Bayern itself was not reaching any consistent form all year and even the formerly sturdy defence proved highly vulnerable. In the end, the club's second-placed finish in the league was not descriptive of Bayern's strength but rather of inconsistent performances by its competitors. The cup elimination by second division Alemannia Aachen was symptomatic for a season in which the team showed not a single convincing performance. Even the newcomers Michael Ballack and 2002 World Cup-winning defender Lúcio could not make a difference.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} later the Emperor awarded Caxias the Order of PedroI and raised him from marquis to duke, the highest rank of Brazilian nobility, and a unique {{distinction}} during PedroII's 58-year reign. The Emperor also appointed him to the Council of State on October 1870. But none of this prevented Caxias from attacks and accusations—some petty—in the parliament, including having left his post without permission. The embittered duke wrote to his friend Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval: [...] "When I was young, my friend, I {{did not know how}} to explain why the elderly were selfish, but now that I am old, I see that they are like that because of the disappointments and ingratitudes they suffer during their lives. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>this</b> is what happens to me".|$|E
500|$|After {{recovering}} from his wounds in 1945, Beynar {{decided to leave}} the resistance, and instead began publishing in an independent Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny. It was then that he took the pen-name Jasienica (from the name of the place where he had received treatment for his injuries) in order not to endanger his wife, who was still living in Soviet-controlled Vilnius, Lithuania. Soon he {{became a member of the}} weekly's staff and then an editor. In 1948 he was arrested by the Polish secret police (...) but after several weeks was released after the intervention of Bolesław Piasecki from the PAX Association. In gratitude to Piasecki, therefater he worked with PAX, leaving Tygodnik Powszechny for PAX in 1950. In 1950, he became a director of the Polish Caritas charity. Jasienica became a member of the Klub Krzywego Koła (Curved Circle Club), which espoused free speech and open discussion. His essays were published in Dziś i Jutro, Słowo Powszechne, Życie Warszawy, Po Prostu. From <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>this</b> period until his death he would live in Warsaw. His wife Władysława died 29 March 1965.|$|E

Jessica also mentions Angela del Toro as another private investigator, who in the comics is the hero White Tiger and has connections with K'un-Lun and Iron Fist. Paul Tassi, writing for Forbes, was disappointed with how the season fit into the larger MCU, feeling the season seemed [...] "removed from the world of The Avengers" [...] and did not acknowledge Daredevil enough given that [...] "it’s supposed to be sharing <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>this</b> little [...] of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with it." [...] Eric Francisco of Inverse countered that Jessica Joness lack of overt connections to the MCU was [...] "the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, Jessica Jones also proves the MCU's thematic durability." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} {{of the first two}} episodes of the season, Brian Lowry of Variety said that while [...] "You're Gonna Love Tomorrow" [...] is {{satisfactory}} and establishes the five-year jump effectively, the second episode is better, calling it [...] "a knock-out." [...] Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker commended the time jump as a reflection of both the characters' and series' ambitions, rating the episode a 'B+'. Joanna Weiss of The Boston Globe gave the episode a mixed review. She said that the time leap proved to be successful, as the show had been [...] "flailing" [...] for several seasons and concluded that, [...] "so far, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>this</b> season promises to be less about plot than personality. That doesn't mean the show is perfect - it never was - but it's better, and that's a big relief." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Rob Owen was positive in his review, noting that the writers handled the five-year leap well, especially in regards to Lynette's storyline. He complimented the episode's comedy and expressed his hope that the time jump would allow the writers to focus on humor rather than overly-dramatic storylines.|$|E
500|$|Prince Carol {{sparked a}} dynastic crisis when he officially renounced his rights to succeed Ferdinand on 5 January 1926, {{simultaneously}} waiving all parental rights over Prince Michael, {{who had been}} proclaimed heir apparent. A Provisional Regency Bill was passed, creating a regency council composed of Prince Nicholas; the Orthodox Patriarch, Miron Cristea; and Gheorghe Buzdugan, {{the president of the}} Court of Cassation. However, both Marie and Ferdinand were reluctant to leave the country {{in the hands of a}} five-year-old boy, even overseen by a regency, for fear that the lands gained during World War I would be reclaimed by neighbouring countries and that political disturbances might lead to civil unrest. Nevertheless, when Marie returned from America, Ferdinand's death seemed imminent. He was suffering from intestinal cancer, and by April 1927 had come so close to death as to be given the last rites of the Catholic Church. He died on 20 July, in Marie's arms. She later wrote: [...] "'I am so tired' were his last words and when he lay so quiet in my arms one hour later, I knew that I must thank God for him <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>This</b> was rest indeed." ...|$|E
500|$|.....a {{great number}} of citizens, {{in various parts of}} the United States, are preparing, and many have {{actually}} emigrated to this Territory, to get free from a Government which does tolerate slavery ... And although it is contended by some, that, at this day, there is a great majority in favor of slavery, whilst the opposite opinion is held by others, the fact is certainly doubtful. But when we take into consideration the vast emigration into this Territory, and of citizens, too, decidedly opposed to the measure, we feel satisfied that, at all events, Congress will suspend any legislative act on this subject until we shall, by the constitution, be admitted into the Union, and have a right to adopt such a constitution, in this respect, as may comport with the wishes of a majority of the citizens....
