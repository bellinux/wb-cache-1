5|$|The PIP and Para {{versions}} of the M249 {{have been used in}} the Iraq war since the invasion. By 2004, many M249s had been in service for almost 20 years and were becoming increasingly unreliable. Soldiers were requesting replacements and new features, and there are reports of soldiers holding their weapons together with duct tape. The lethality of the 5.56mm ammunition has been called into question by reports of enemy soldiers still firing after being hit multiple times. As in previous conflicts, the sandy environment causes the M249s and other weapons to clog up <b>and</b> <b>jam</b> if they are not cleaned frequently.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, Chain Reaction <b>and</b> <b>Jam</b> Band {{played at}} the same gig. Tyler {{immediately}} loved Jam Band's sound, and wanted to combine the two bands. In October 1970, the bands met up again and considered the proposition. Tyler, {{who had been a}} drummer and backup singer in Chain Reaction, adamantly refused to play drums in this new band, insisting he would only take part if he could be frontman and lead vocalist. The others agreed, and a new band was born. The band moved into a home together at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, where they wrote and rehearsed music together and relaxed in between shows.|$|E

In Finland, the day is called laskiainen and is generally celebrated by eating green pea soup and a pastry called laskiaispulla (sweet bread filled with whipped cream <b>and</b> <b>jam</b> or almond paste, same as the Swedish semla). The celebration often includes downhill sledging. In Estonia, the day is called Vastlapäev and is generally celebrated by eating pea soup and whipped-cream or whipped-cream <b>and</b> <b>jam</b> filled sweet-buns called vastlakukkel, similar to the Swedish fastlagsbulle or semla. Children also typically go sledding on this day.|$|E

25|$|While Patrick's initial {{announcement}} {{was that he}} hoped the touring would resume in 2003, these plans never surfaced. With band members gone and pressure from the record label, he forwent his touring plans in lieu of entering the recording studio to record another album.

25|$|ECM {{stations}} for both communication and non-com (radar etc.) systems. The Indian Army has ordered its Signal Corps to be a prime contributor {{in the design}} and development stage, along with the DRDO's DLRL. The scale of this venture is substantial – it comprises COMINT and Electronic intelligence stations which can monitor <b>and</b> <b>jam</b> different bands for both voice/data as well as radar transmissions. In contrast to other such systems, Samyukta is an integrated system, which can perform the most critical battlefield EW tasks in both COM and Non-COM roles. The system will be the first of its type in terms of its magnitude and capability in the Army. Its individual modules can also be operated independently. A follow on system known as Sauhard is under development.|$|E
