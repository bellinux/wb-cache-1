5|$|Local {{officials}} in Allegan have proposed {{creation of a}} truck route around the town. Concerned about the traffic and noise, residents have formed the Citizens for a Safer Community. They cite reports that show that the accident rates in town are higher than the statewide average. The group and local officials <b>are</b> <b>proposing</b> using 24th Street, 118th Avenue and Babylon Road for truck traffic. MDOT would require permits to erect the signs needed for the truck route. The department has indicated that the bypass {{would not be a}} state highway. MDOT will not take ownership of the roads needed for the truck route, but overall the department is supportive of the city's efforts to make the downtown area more pedestrian friendly.|$|E
25|$|There {{are only}} two {{airports}} in the county: Carlisle Lake District and Barrow/Walney Island. Both airports formerly served scheduled passenger flights and both <b>are</b> <b>proposing</b> expansions and renovations to handle domestic and European flights in the near future. The nearest international airports to south Cumbria are Blackpool, Manchester and Liverpool John Lennon. North Cumbria is closer to Newcastle, Glasgow Prestwick and Glasgow International. Barrow-in-Furness {{is one of the}} country's largest shipbuilding centres, but the Port of Barrow is only minor, operated by Associated British Ports alongside the Port of Silloth in Allerdale. There are no ferry links from any port or harbour along the Cumbria coast.|$|E
25|$|The Common Sayings Source {{is one of}} many {{theories}} that attempts to provide insight into the Synoptic Problem. The theory posits that the Gospel of Thomas, a sayings gospel, and the Q source, a hypothetical sayings gospel, have a common source. Elements of this Common Sayings Source {{can be found in the}} text of the Gospel of Thomas and what scholars <b>are</b> <b>proposing</b> existed in the Q source. The high level of similarities between the two sources suggests that both documents are later redactions of a single source, the original Common Sayings Source, which was then redacted by different groups to suit their own needs.|$|E

A linear decorrelator detector <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> in[26]. However, the method is computationally intensive as it requires inversion of a large matrix for satisfactory performance. A joint CFO compensation and channel estimation algorithm <b>is</b> <b>proposed</b> in[27] for multi-antenna SC-FDMA systems. Several time-domain CFO compensation schemes paired with successive interference cancelation and MU ordering <b>are</b> <b>proposed</b> in[24].

25|$|Traditionally, in some upland areas, foxes were flushed by {{packs of}} dogs to be shot. This {{activity}} is still permitted in Scotland under the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002. However MPs, in making law for England and Wales, {{decided that this}} activity did result in unnecessary suffering, not least {{because it is more}} difficult to control a large number of hounds in dense woodland where this activity used to take place. On Wednesday, 15 July 2015, the current Conservative Government <b>are</b> <b>proposing</b> Amendments to the Act, after realising they had only a slender chance of Repealing it. The amendments will be voted upon by a free vote, after just one hour's debate in the House of Commons. One of the key amendments is the flushing out of foxes, for them to be shot to death. Whilst this might sometimes prevent the foxes from being attacked by hounds, it is conceivable such attacks will happen, especially with dogs having previously been trained to do so.|$|E

Council leader Mick Page stated [...] "The only way we will start anything in Jaywick is for us to lead it. We will be the catalyst." [...] The council <b>are</b> <b>proposing</b> to stop the allocation of housing benefit to rented properties in Jaywick by 2017, to discourage rental in poor quality buildings. Former council leader Neil Stock has called Jaywick [...] "an embarrassment to the whole country", blaming planning regulations he believes are draconian. Stock reported around 30 to 40 absentee landlords were renting poor quality accommodation to tenants on benefits without requiring any deposit, adding that [...] "the state is subsidising squalor." [...] Carswell has been critical of the government's response to Jaywick, noting that although the area contained large numbers of unemployed, these were often people who were unable to find work both due to disabilities or a lack of available jobs. He believes the [...] "downward spiral will continue" [...] unless existing planning laws are relaxed and the area has economic investment.|$|E

[...] This was due to their having established, powerful Hispanic communities, deep cultural ties to Mexico, past experience with bruising political battles over the issue (such as with California Proposition 187 in the 1990s), and the perception among their populations that illegal immigration was less severe a problem.|$|E
