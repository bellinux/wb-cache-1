5|$|Hundreds of books, {{articles}} and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS {{recognized as an}} important subgroup. Whether it {{should be seen as}} distinct from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study, and there <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> about the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. In 2013, DSM-5 eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm chaser deaths, Kansas Emergency Management Association {{president}} Brian Stone called for there to be regulations put on future storm chasing; however, he stated that there <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> as to how it would actually be implemented. AccuWeather Senior Vice President Mike Smith urged against overreacting to their deaths, citing that they were the first chasers to be killed in 40years of the practice and that chasing as a whole is a significant source of real-time and research information.|$|E

5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> {{about the}} {{external}} {{validity of the}} AS diagnosis. That is, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA is partly due to a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring bioethical {{questions from}} a human rights perspective has been criticised {{on the grounds that}} human rights theory contains unresolved problems. Bioethicists have claimed that bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems. Cochrane claims that this contribution to human rights literature offers three insights, but that these are not entirely original. These insights <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> about institutional fairness, rights as trumps and rights as solely belonging to humans. Cochrane holds that human rights should be reconceptualised as sentient rights. The grounding of human rights, he claims, are not distinct from the grounding of human obligations to nonhuman animals, and attempts to distinguish human rights from the rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes and}} degree of Olmec {{influences}} on Mesoamerican cultures has been a subject of debate over many decades. Although the Olmecs {{are considered to be}} perhaps the earliest Mesoamerican civilization, there <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> concerning how and how much the Olmecs influenced cultures outside the Olmec heartland. This debate is succinctly, if simplistically, framed by the title of a 2005 New York Times article: “Mother Culture, or Only a Sister?”.|$|E
25|$|Many {{tasks that}} we would like to {{automate}} by using a computer are of question–answer type: we would like to ask a question and the computer should produce an answer. In theoretical computer science, such tasks are called computational problems. Formally, a computational problem consists of instances together with a solution for each instance. Instances <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.|$|E

25|$|Such {{growth has}} not come without difficulties. There <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> {{as to how much}} more {{passenger}} growth can occur. The airport's present terminal and runway layout are reaching full utilization and PHL remains the world's largest airport without an inground fueling system thus requiring fuel to be trucked to each airplane. These two factors have led to congestion and delays. Additionally, the airport's parking facilities have been severely taxed. Exhaustion of all 17,000 parking spaces at the airport has become a regular occurrence. However, airport officials have ambitious plans for terminal and runway expansion.|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} {{reported}} effect of culture on performance is that strong cultures result in high performance. The three {{reasons for this}} are goal alignment, motivation, and the resulting structure provided. Goal alignment {{is driven by the}} proposed unified voice that drives employees in the same direction. Motivation comes from the strength of values and principles in such a culture. And structure is provided by these same attributes which obviate the need for formal controls that could stifle employees. There <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> that concern researchers about causality and the veracity of the driving voice of a strong culture.|$|E

AQAP's most determined opponent, the Houthis, disengaged to face rival Yemeni militias {{at the same time}} as they were being hit by coalition air strikes; Yemeni troops in the south remained in their bases instead of confronting al-Qaeda militants, fearing Saudi air strikes on any troop movements. With the destruction of much of Yemen's military infrastructure by the coalition, even once peace is achieved, there <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> about the ability of the country to confront its Islamist militancy problem.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> or {{uncertainties}} {{as to how}} the Chu Ci came to {{be collected}} into its present form; however, at least some outlines of this historical process have been presented in scholarly literature. Another important aspect of Chu Ci studies is the editorial history. One regard is the order in which the various titles appear. There are also reasons to believe that some of the sections (juan) were subject to editing for various reasons, including to suit the verses to theatrical performance and {{due to the nature of}} the textual process of ancient China, involving writing lines of text on individual bamboo strips which were bound together, but when the bindings broke were subject to editorial decisions as to what their original order was.|$|E
25|$|During a quiz bowl game, {{two or more}} {{teams of}} usually up to four or five players are read {{questions}} by a moderator. In most forms of quiz bowl, {{there are two basic}} types of questions: toss-ups and bonuses. Toss-ups <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> that any individual player can attempt to answer, and players are generally not allowed to confer with each other. Each player usually has a signaling device, also called a buzzer, to signal in {{at any time during the}} question to give an answer. If the answer given is incorrect, then no other member of that team may give an answer. If a toss-up is successfully answered, the correctly answering team is given an opportunity to answer a bonus. Bonuses are usually worth a total of 30 points, and consist of three individual questions worth ten points each. Team members are generally permitted to confer with each other on these questions.|$|E

25|$|Mexican state social {{investment}} depends to a {{great extent}} on the profits from oil exports controlled by Pemex as a state monopoly. The leftist political movement National Regeneration Movement has expressed concern that Pemex will be systematically excluded as a commercial competitor by the government. They believe that Pemex's infrastructural decline was due to a deliberate strategy of self-sabotage by the government through lack of reinvestment, and fear that the Mexican oil rent may be taken over by private corporations. The leftist opposition is concerned that energy reform may be a concealed maneuver for privatization. They also worry that laws derived from the constitutional reforms are not explicit in demonstrating that energy reform will avoid having the oil rent be controlled by the private sector. There <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> as to how the Mexican system of public health, education and subsidized transportation (not to mention the newly created presidential fund for retirement and umemployment) would be funded if there is privatization of the oil rent.|$|E
500|$|Section 1 of the Act {{allows a}} third party to enforce terms of a {{contract}} in one of two situations: firstly if he is specifically mentioned in the contract as someone authorised to do so, and secondly if the contract [...] "purports to confer a benefit" [...] on him. An exception to the second rule is if the contract makes it clear that the third party is not meant to be able to enforce the term. In Nisshin Shipping Co Ltd v Cleaves & Co Ltd [...] EWHC 2602 the High Court decided that in situations where there <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> over whether or not the second rule has been disapplied by a statement in the contract, the onus is on the party claiming that it has been disapplied. In the same decision the court decided that simply arranging an alternative way of enforcing the terms does not indicate that the 1999 Act was not meant to be used.|$|E
500|$|During his {{successful}} 2005 season, 32-year-old Kinkladze {{said he hoped}} to play on well into his thirties. The 2006 season, however, was his last. He sustained an injury in Rubin's first competitive match, a 1–0 cup match defeat against Shinnik which {{proved to be the}} last time he played a full match. A recurrence of an old injury meant he was sidelined for longer than expected, only making his return to full training in late May. Kinkladze continued to struggle to maintain fitness, making five further appearances for Rubin, two of which were starts. A match against Rostov on 20 August 2006 was the last of Kinkladze's playing career. In September, he was called to the Georgia national team but did not play or appear on the substitutes' bench. A short time later he had to undergo another course of medical treatment. He also passed a thorough medical examination, the results of which were reported as the deciding factor for his future at the club. In October, he was an unused substitute just once; he and his compatriots were the subject of criticism from Rubin's general director who announced to the press [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> about the Georgians in the team regarding their training and attitude to football". In November, Kinkladze again suffered an injury and missed the remainder of the season.|$|E
