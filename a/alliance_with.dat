5|$|Bohemond {{concluded}} an <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> Gumushtekin, atabeg of Aleppo, against Saladin, the Ayyubid {{ruler of}} Egypt and Syria, in May 1176. On Bohemond's demand, Gumushtekin released his Christian prisoners, including Bohemond's stepfather, Raynald of Châtillon. To strengthen his <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> the Byzantine Empire, in 1177 Bohemond married Theodora, who was {{closely related to}} Emperor Manuel.|$|E
5|$|The Macedonians {{had just}} {{concluded}} the First Macedonian War and Philip, seeing {{his chance to}} defeat Rhodes, formed an <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> Aetolian and Spartan pirates who began raiding Rhodian ships. Philip also formed an <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> several important Cretan cities, such as Hierapytna and Olous. With the Rhodian fleet and economy suffering from the depredations of the pirates, Philip believed his chance to crush Rhodes was at hand. To help achieve his goal, he formed an <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> the King of the Seleucid Empire, Antiochus the Great, against Ptolemy V of Egypt (the Seleucid Empire and Egypt were the other two Diadochi states). Philip began attacking the lands of Ptolemy and Rhodes's allies in Thrace and around the Propontis.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} the Aetolian League {{concluded}} a peace agreement with Philip V in 206 BC, the Roman Republic negotiated the Treaty of Phoenice, which ended the war and allowed the Macedonians to retain the settlements they had captured in Illyria. Although the Romans rejected an Aetolian request in 202 BC for Rome to declare war on Macedonia once again, the Roman Senate gave serious consideration to the similar offer made by Pergamon and its ally Rhodes in 201 BC. These states grew increasingly concerned once Philip V formed an <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire, which invaded the war-weary and financially exhausted Ptolemaic Empire in the Fifth Syrian War (202–195 BC), while Philip V captured Ptolemaic settlements in the Aegean Sea. Although Rome's envoys {{played a critical role}} in convincing Athens to join the anti-Macedonian <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> Pergamon and Rhodes in 200 BC, the comitia centuriata (i.e. people's assembly) rejected the Roman Senate's proposal for a declaration of war on Macedonia. Meanwhile, Philip V conquered vital territories in the Hellespont and Bosporus as well as Ptolemaic Samos, which led Rhodes to form an <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> Pergamon, Byzantium, Cyzicus, and Chios against Macedonia. Despite Philip V's nominal <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> the Seleucid king, he lost the naval Battle of Chios in 201 BC and was subsequently blockaded at Bargylia by a combined fleet of the victorious Rhodian and Pergamene navies.|$|E
40|$|How do {{small firms}} manage their <b>alliance</b> {{strategies}} <b>with</b> large firms? This study compares the relative impacts of exploration and exploitation <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> large firms on small firms' valuation. Integrating the literatures on the exploration/exploitation paradigm and alliance governance, {{we argue that}} exploitation <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> large firms will on average generate higher values for small firms than exploration <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> large firms due to a heightened risk of appropriation in exploration alliances. However, if small firms can manage their <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> large firms via proper alliance governance, they will increase their valuations from exploration <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> large firms. Analyses of the U. S. biopharmaceutical industry from 1984 to 2006 largely support our hypotheses...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The main {{purposes}} of the study are to: test the strategic alliance framework developed by Sambasivan et al. on the strategic <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> suppliers and customers, separately; and compare the factors influencing strategic <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> suppliers and customers based on the results. The present study analyzes the effect of strategic alliance motives, environment, asset specificity, perception of opportunistic behavior, interdependence between supply chain partners, and relational capital on strategic alliance outcomes. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 228 companies representing different industries in manufacturing in Malaysia participated in the study. The sampling frame used was Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers directory. A questionnaire was distributed to all the companies. The authors tested the structural model for 185 suppliers and 75 customers using structural equation modelling. Findings – Based on the results, the key differences in the strategic <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> suppliers and customers are: the relationship between environment and alliance motives is stronger for <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> suppliers, the relationship between alliance motives and relational capital is significant for <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> customers, the relationship between asset specificity and interdependence is significant for <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> customers, the relationship between perception of opportunistic behaviour and relational capital is significant for <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> customers, {{and the relationship between}} perception of opportunistic behaviour and interdependence is significant for <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> suppliers. Originality/value – The current study adds to the body of knowledge on strategic alliances. The results can help supply chain managers identify factors that influence the success of strategic <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> suppliers and customers and develop strategies to enhance effective collaborative relationships between supply chain partners. The authors specify the limitations and directions for future research...|$|R

5|$|Abaqa died in 1282 and {{was briefly}} {{replaced}} {{by his brother}} Tekuder, who had converted to Islam. Tekuder reversed Abaqa's policy of seeking an <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> the Franks, offering instead an alliance to the Mamluk Sultan Qalawun, who continued his own advance, capturing the Hospitaller fortress of Margat in 1285, Lattakia in 1287, and the County of Tripoli in 1289. However, Tekuder's pro-Muslim stance was not popular, and in 1284, Abaqa's Buddhist son Arghun, {{with the support of}} the Great Khan Kublai, led a revolt and had Tekuder executed. Arghun then revived the idea of an <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> the West, and sent multiple envoys to Europe.|$|E

The {{citizens}} of Omiš responded by an <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> Venice in August, {{in accordance with}} a 20-year peace treaty signed by knezes Radoš, Bogdan, Juraj and Semen. This triggered conflict on the land and sea in 1275. The activities in the intermediate years are unknown, besides that in April 1278 the islands of Hvar and Brač recognized Venetian authority, and the Omiš in 1281.|$|E
5|$|Constant news of Ottoman {{campaigns against}} Bosnia and Morea but not against Albania {{seemed to suggest}} to Skanderbeg that Mehmed II had been {{considering}} an armistice with Skanderbeg. The latter took advantage of this lull in the fighting by preparing for his voyage to Italy and by securing his northern frontiers from a possible attack by Skanderbeg's elusive ally in northern Albania, Lekë Dukagjini, who {{had been trying to}} expand his realm by reaching an agreement with the Turks. In order to curb his ambitions, Skanderbeg seized Shat Fortress and presented it as a gift to Venice. Skanderbeg then established an <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> Venice against Dukagjini, while Dukagjni was strengthening his Turkish alliance. The new pope issued a bull against Dukagjini, giving him fifteen days to break his <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> the Ottomans and to reconcile with Skanderbeg, or be subject to interdiction; Dukagjini conceded and chose the former option. He then reestablished his <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> Skanderbeg and Venice and accepted all of its losses.|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} entrepreneurship literature {{maintains that}} small- and medium-size firms can suffer from resource constraints {{as they move}} abroad. To alleviate this problem, research suggests participating in strategic alliances. We develop and test the theoretical perspective that not all alliances are the same; cooperative agreements with non-competitors and competitors have disparate direct and moderating impacts on international performance. Based on an analysis of 162 British and U. S. private SMEs, our results indicate that <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> non-competitors are positively associated with international performance, but that <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> competitors are negatively related. In addition, {{our findings suggest that}} in <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> non-competitors, entrepreneurial orientation helps SMEs increase international performance and that in <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> competitors, entrepreneurial orientation simply reduces the negative impact...|$|R

Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese-occupied state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan. Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army. In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.|$|E

5|$|Instead of annexing Shishman's lands, Milutin reinstalled Shishman as the despot of Vidin and {{concluded}} an <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> him.

It is quite apparent that Shishman's unlikely reinstallment in Vidin and <b>alliance</b> <b>with</b> Serbia were dictated by Nogai, as at the same time Serbia also came under Tatar dependence.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{innovation}} performance benefits of alliances for spin-off firms, in particular spin-offs from either other firms or from public research organizations. During {{the early years}} of the emerging combinatorial chemistry industry, the industry on which our empirical analysis focuses, spin-offs engaged in <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> large and established partners, partners of similar type and size, and with public research organizations, often for different reasons. We seek to understand to what extent <b>alliances</b> of spin-offs <b>with</b> other firms (either large or small and medium sized firms) affected their innovation performance and also how this performance may have been affected by their corporate or public research background. We find evidence that in general <b>alliances</b> of spin-offs <b>with</b> other firms, in particular <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> large firms, increased their innovation performance. Corporate spin-offs that formed <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> other firms outperformed public research spin-offs <b>with</b> such <b>alliances.</b> This suggests that, in terms of their innovation performance, corporate spin-offs that engaged in <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> other firms seemed to have benefitted from their prior corporate background. Interestingly, it turns out that the negative impact of alliances on the innovation performance of public research spin-offs was largely affected by their <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> small and medium sized firms...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{patterns}} and determinants of technology <b>alliance</b> formation <b>with</b> partner firms from emerging economies, {{with a focus}} on European firms' alliance strategies. We examine to what extent European firms' <b>alliance</b> formation <b>with</b> partners based in emerging economies is persistent, that is: to what extent prior collaborative experience determines new alliance formation, and we compare this pattern <b>with</b> <b>alliance</b> formation <b>with</b> developed country partners. Second, we examine to what extent prior engagement in international <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> partners from developed countries increases the propensity to form technology <b>alliances</b> <b>with</b> partners based in emerging economies and vice versa (interrelation). We find that both persistence and interrelation effects are present, and that they are generally not weaker for emerging economy <b>alliances.</b> <b>Alliance</b> formation <b>with</b> Indian and Chinese firms is significantly more likely if firms have prior <b>alliance</b> experience <b>with</b> Japanese firms. The findings suggest that firms extend their alliance portfolio from developed to emerging economies, increasing the geographic diversity of their alliance portfolio and building on their prior international alliances experience.
