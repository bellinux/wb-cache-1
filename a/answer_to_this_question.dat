5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the matter in the {{universe}} that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter in the universe is dark matter. The spatial distribution of dark matter in the universe is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E
5|$|The many {{different}} forms of periodic table have prompted {{the question of whether}} there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table. The <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the {{many different}} forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.|$|E
5|$|While {{scholars}} {{have proposed a}} number of hypotheses {{to explain why the}} poem was written, a definitive <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> remains elusive. But regardless of Proba's intent, there is evidence that the poem was widely circulated, and it eventually was used in schools to teach the tenets of Christianity, alongside Augustine of Hippo's De Doctrina Christiana. Critical reception to the poem, however, was more mixed. A pseudonymous work purportedly by Pope Gelasius I disparaged the poem, deeming it apocryphal. Many also believe that St. Jerome disliked the poem. At the same time, others like Isidore of Seville, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio wrote highly of Proba. During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent {{scholars have}} written more positively about it.|$|E

5|$|Since the Maxwell {{theory of}} light allows for all {{possible}} energies of electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially {{that the energy}} quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits the radiation. In 1905, Einstein {{was the first to}} propose that energy quantization was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself. Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell's theory, Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if the energy of a Maxwellian light wave were localized into point-like quanta that move independently of one another, even if the wave itself is spread continuously over space. In 1909 and 1916, Einstein showed that, if Planck's law of black-body radiation is accepted, the energy quanta must also carry momentum , making them full-fledged particles. This photon momentum was observed experimentally by Arthur Compton, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1927. The pivotal question was then: how to unify Maxwell's wave theory of light with its experimentally observed particle nature? The <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> occupied Albert Einstein {{for the rest of his}} life, and was solved in quantum electrodynamics and its successor, the Standard Model (see Second quantization and The photon as a gauge boson, below).|$|E
5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E

25|$|Abhinavagupta {{remained}} unmarried all his life, we do however {{know him}} to be an adept of Kaula and as such, used his energy (ojas, or internally sublimated semen) as a vital force, {{a constant source of}} shakti to power the spiritual nervous system he outlined in his works. This system involves ritual union between Purusha as (Shiva) and shakti, yet this union is essentially non-physical and universal, and thus for a master such as Abhinavagupta, he was always in communion with Shiva-Shakti.

There is no simple <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>question,</b> and the underlying reasons are complex and numerous. One important {{fact is that the}} Ottomans did not, as a rule, actively seek to convert their Christian subjects to Islam (the many generations it took for Bosnia to become predominantly Muslim and the retaining of Slavic customs among converts testify to this). The Ottoman Empire at the time was centered on militaristic expansion independent of religion, and the primary split was not between Muslims and nonbelievers but between the military-administrative class (the Ottomans) and various classes of serfs (known as rayah), neither of which was exclusive to any particular faith. Though the state eventually acquired a more Islamic focus, by this time, Muslims already made up a large majority of Bosnia's population.|$|E
