She later learned that Raynor was executed and seeks revenge on Arcturus. As she enters a Leviathan, she controls the local Swarm inside, and starts rebuilding her forces from scratch. She later evolved into <b>a</b> <b>Primal</b> Zerg after a confrontation with Zeratul, leading her to the origins of the Zerg. She became <b>a</b> <b>Primal,</b> after absorbing the spawning pool and killing Primal Leaders to collect essence. With her newfound power, she initially takes the fight to the Dominion after subduing countless Queens. She was later shocked after she knows that Raynor survived and held by Dominion as a bargaining chip. She organizes a raid, rescuing Raynor but the man fell into disbelief that the one he saved, returns to being a monster. She also confronted an ancient Shapeshifter creating Hybrids at the behest of her former rival named Alexei Stukov. She later prepared to end Arcturus Mengsk's reign by killing him in his palace in Korhal. She later left to confront the Shapeshifter's master.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that a vector is in a second order cone if and only if its "arrow" matrix is {{positive}} semidefinite. But much less well-known is about the relation between a second order cone problem (SOCP) and its corresponding semidefinite problem (SDP). The correspondence between the dual problem of SOCP and SDP is quite direct and the correspondence between the primal problems is much more complicated. Given <b>a</b> SDP <b>primal</b> optimal solution which is not necessarily "arrow-shaped", we can construct <b>a</b> SOCP <b>primal</b> optimal solution. The mapping from the primal optimal solution of SDP to the primal optimal solution of SOCP can be shown to be unique. Conversely, given <b>a</b> SOCP <b>primal</b> optimal solution, we can construct <b>a</b> SDP <b>primal</b> optimal solution which is not an "arrow" matrix. Indeed, we will show that in general no primal optimal solutions of the SOCP-related SDP can be an "arrow" matrix...|$|R

5|$|Zelenin and Jimenez {{respectively}} {{side with}} Law and Chaos, while a resurrected Gore becomes Neutral. Depending on the choices {{made during the}} game, the protagonist has the choice of allying with either Law, Chaos or following a Neutral route and continuing with the original mission. If he sides with Law, the protagonist and Zelenin defeat both Jimenez and Mem Aleph before using the Cosmic Eggs to create a World of Law, with Zelenin worshiped as a channel to God for humanity, which is forced to surrender its free will. If he sides with Chaos, he and Jimenez help Mem Aleph and defeat Zelenin, using the Eggs to fulfill the Schwarzwelt's original purpose and create a world where humans and demons live together in <b>a</b> <b>primal</b> world where only the strong survive. In both the Law and Chaos routes, Arthur chooses to destroy his new personality to save the protagonist after the Red Sprite is damaged by Gore. If the protagonist rejects Law and Chaos, Gore transmits the necessary information {{for the destruction of}} the Schwarzwelt to him before truly passing on. After defeating Zelenin, Jimenez, and Mem Aleph, the protagonist and surviving crew escape in the Red Sprite while Arthur sacrifices himself to ensure the destruction of the Schwarzwelt, although there is a chance of it reappearing if humanity continues its abuse of the Earth.|$|E

It depicts creation in a series of emanations from <b>a</b> <b>primal</b> monadic source, finally resulting in the creation of the material universe. These schools tend to view evil in terms of matter that is markedly inferior to goodness and lacking spiritual insight and goodness rather than as an equal force.|$|E

40|$|A unified {{framework}} for formulating primal and dual Domain Decomposition methods (DDM) {{is presented in}} this paper, aiming at providing a mathematical tool for a uniform treatment of high performance DDM in Structural Mechanics. A novel approach for developing new DDM from existing methods is also presented and is applied to dual and primal methods. In the field of the FETI methods, this approach leads to <b>a</b> new <b>primal</b> category of methods derived from existing FETI variants. Furthermore, <b>a</b> two level <b>primal</b> method is introduced and <b>a</b> variant <b>primal</b> method is also obtained that constitutes a general form of the Balancing Domain Decomposition method.

25|$|Manichaeism conceives of two coexistent {{realms of}} light and {{darkness}} that become embroiled in conflict. Certain elements of the light became entrapped within darkness, {{and the purpose of}} material creation is to engage in the slow process of extraction of these individual elements. In the end the kingdom of light will prevail over darkness. Manicheanism inherits this dualistic mythology from Zurvanist Zoroastrianism, in which the eternal spirit Ahura Mazda is opposed by his antithesis, Angra Mainyu. This dualistic teaching embodied an elaborate cosmological myth that included the defeat of <b>a</b> <b>primal</b> man by the powers of darkness that devoured and imprisoned the particles of light.|$|E
25|$|By {{proposing that}} the earth has a molten core, he {{anticipated}} modern geology.

One of his principal works on this subject, Protogaea, unpublished in his lifetime, has recently been published in English for the first time. He worked out <b>a</b> <b>primal</b> organismic theory. In medicine, he exhorted the physicians of his time—with some results—to ground their theories in detailed comparative observations and verified experiments, and to distinguish firmly scientific and metaphysical points of view.|$|E

25|$|The President of the United States in {{the name}} of the Congress takes {{pleasure}} in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR toCORPORAL JAMES L. DAYUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVEfor service as set forth in the following CITATION:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a squad leader serving with the Second Battalion, Twenty-Second Marines, Sixth Marine Division, in sustained combat operations against Japanese forces on Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands from 14 to 17 May 1945. On the first day, Corporal Day rallied his squad and the remnants of another unit and led them to a critical position forward of the front lines of Sugar Loaf Hill. Soon thereafter, they came under an intense mortar and artillery barrage that was quickly followed by a fanatical ground attack of about forty Japanese soldiers. Despite the loss of one-half of his men, Corporal Day remained at the forefront, shouting encouragement, hurling hand grenades, and directing deadly fire thereby repelling the determined enemy. Reinforced by six men, he led his squad in repelling three fierce night attacks but suffered five additional Marines killed and one wounded whom he assisted to safety. Upon hearing nearby calls for corpsman assistance, Corporal Day braved heavy enemy fire to escort four seriously wounded Marines, one at a time, to safety. Corporal Day then manned a light machine gun assisted by a wounded Marine, and halted another frenzied night attack. In this ferocious action, his machine gun was destroyed, and he suffered multiple white phosphorus and fragmentation wounds. Assisted by only one partially effective man, he reorganized his defensive position in time to halt a fifth enemy attack with devastating small arms fire. On three separate occasions, Japanese soldiers closed to within a few feet of his foxhole, but were killed by Corporal Day. During the second day, the enemy conducted numerous unsuccessful swarming attacks against his exposed position. When the attacks momentarily subsided, over 70 enemy dead were counted around his position. On the third day, a wounded and exhausted Corporal Day repulsed the enemy's final attack and dispatched around 12 of the enemy at close range. Having yielded no ground and with more than 100 enemy dead around his position, Corporal Day preserved the lives of his fellow Marines and made <b>a</b> <b>primal</b> contribution to the success of the Okinawa campaign. By his extraordinary heroism, repeated acts of valor, and quintessential battlefield leadership, Corporal Day inspired the efforts of his outnumbered Marines to defeat a much larger enemy force, reflecting great credit upon himself and upholding the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.|$|E

In the hands of siddhas, dakinis, wrathful and semi-wrathful yidam deities, protective deities or dharmapalas these implements became pure symbols, weapons of transformation, and an expression of the deities' wrathful compassion which mercilessly destroys the manifold illusions of the inflated human ego.|$|R
