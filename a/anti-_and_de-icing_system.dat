50|$|Using {{the carbon}} roving as an {{electric}} heating element offers the possibility to manufacture composite structures with embedded heating layers. Due to the high flexibility {{in the design of}} the heating pattern an overall nearly equal heat distribution can be achieved. In terms of applications this technology embedded in solid composite molds is very beneficial for resin consolidation and binder activation in out-of-autoclave processes. Composite molds show similar heat expansion properties as the manufactured composite parts. The lower thermal mass of composite tools compared to common metal molds help to shorten the manufacturing cycle of FRP parts and decrease the energy need for the production process. Further the TFP heating elements can be applied in CFRP wing structures of airplanes or blades of wind mills for <b>anti-</b> <b>and</b> <b>de-icing</b> tasks.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} atmospheric ice accretion {{on a large}} horizontal axis ‘NREL 5 MW’ wind turbine blade {{has been carried out}} using the computational fluid dynamics based technique. Numerical analyses were carried out at five different sections along the wind turbine blade for both rime and glaze ice conditions. Based upon the flow field calculation and the droplet collision efficiency, the rate and shape of accreted ice was simulated at different atmospheric temperatures. Results indicate that the icing is less severe near the blade root sections, where the blade profiles are larger and thicker, both in terms of local ice mass and accreted ice thickness. Change in accreted ice growth with the atmospheric temperature is significant along the blade sections from centre to tip.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} paper is to propose a general {{methodology}} for the numerical modelling of both anti <b>and</b> <b>de-icing</b> <b>systems.</b> A lubrication model is used {{for dealing with the}} dynamics of the runback water film. As regards thermal effects, in order to take into account heat conduction and unsteadiness, a parabolic temperature profile is assumed with respect to the normal coordinate for the ice layer. Heat transfers in the airfoil solid structure are described using a dedicated solver based on the unsteady heat conduction equation. The most original contribution of this work is the new technique (herein referred to as the "improved Schwarz method") which is proposed for coupling in a robust way the accretion-runback model and the solid heat conduction model. This new coupling algorithm allows to ensure fast convergence of both temperature and heat flux at the coupling interface (airfoil outer surface) and can be used either for steady state computations (anti-icing mode) or unsteady computations (de-icing mode).

Despite this significant amount of chemicals and distance, winter maintenance is often omitted from current environmental studies of roads and transportation. Current studies focus primarily on vehicles, fuel technology and construction activities. This focus {{has been based on}} the fact that these are the largest source of emissions from road transportation. However, as vehicle and fuel technology advances and have less impact per unit, other aspects of transportation, such as maintenance and operation of infrastructure become increasingly important and should be included in LCA studies of roads in cold climates. In this study, life cycle analysis (LCA) is used to estimate the environmental impacts of the production, transport and distribution of chemicals during winter maintenance in Norway. The study is based on reported quantities for winter maintenance during an average winter between 2010 - 2015. The functional unit is set as <b>anti-</b> <b>and</b> <b>de-icing</b> operations on national and state roads per km during winter an average winter from 2010 through 2014.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the present}} paper is to {{consider}} the use of PIV technique in an industrial icing wind tunnel and the potentiality/advantages of applying PIV technique to this specific field. Scope of icing wind tunnels is to simulate the aircraft flight condition through cloud formations. In this operational condition ice accretions appear on the aircraft exposed surfaces due {{to the impact of}} the water droplets present in the clouds and the subsequent solidification. The investigation of aircraft aerodynamic performances and flight safety in icing condition is a fundament aspect in the phase of design, development and certification of new aircrafts. The description of this peculiar ground testing facility is reported. The assessment of PIV in CIRA-IWT has been investigated. Several technological problems have been afforded and solved developing the components of the measurement system, as the laser system and the recording apparatus, both fully remotely controlled, equipped with several traversing mechanism and protected by the adverse environment conditions (temperature and pressure).

40|$|In-flight {{and ground}} icing has {{historically}} posed {{a significant problem}} {{for all types of}} aircraft, and has been determined to be the cause of numerous accidents. Canadian airspace is especially hazardous as air temperatures are typically sub-zero, leading to ripe conditions for the onset of icing. Ice accretion on the leading edge and other areas of wings, fuselage, windows, engine inlets, and sensors degrade the aerodynamic form of the aircraft, and results in decreased lift and a higher stall velocity. Multiple solutions to this problem have been developed and applied to fixed-wing and, to a lesser extent, rotary aircraft. Most of these applications have shown promise and some have already seen limited service time. However, all current applications have considerable disadvantages, specifically in terms of weight and power requirements. Rotorcraft are known to be particularly sensitive to in-flight icing due to the large effective distance the rotor blades travel compared to the effective distance that any component of a fixedwing aircraft travels. The lift generated by the rotor blades is extremely sensitive to the effective shape of the blade itself; therefore, it is imperative that ice is either prevented from forming, or effectively removed once formed. The majority of today's civil and military helicopters certified to fly in icing conditions are equipped with electro-thermal ice protection systems. Due to their proven record of reliability, durability and effectiveness versus the complete spectrum of other de-icing technologies developed, electro-thermal de-icing remains the favored solution after decades of research and development.

40|$|A novel anti-icing/de-icing system {{composed}} of bi-stable laminate composite structures with superhydrophobic surface and soft electrothermal patch is investigated in this paper. In this system, the superhydrophobic surface has superior performance in anti-icing <b>and</b> <b>de-icing</b> {{by reducing the}} adhesion of the ice-skin interface; meanwhile, a thermo-mechanical way to remove ice is conducted by deforming the bi-stable structures using heating actuation method. The superhydrophobic layer is fabricated by decreasing the free energy of copper oxide on the copper surface. The water contact angle of the superhydrophobic surface is tested by an optical contact angle measuring device, which reaches above 155 ° and the sliding angle is less than 10 °. In addition, the microstructure of superhydrophobic layer is characterized by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to illustrate the superhydrophobic mechanism.

40|$|In cold seasons, {{irregular}} {{layers of}} atmospheric ice (AI) are usually accreted on the rotor blades of wind turbines. These layers can cause unexpected downtimes {{and increase the}} maintenance cost reducing the efficiency. AI presents an unpredictable mixture of crystalline and amorphous ices including such forms as dense snow frozen to the surface, soft rime, hard rime, clear ice, and glaze. The parameters of the AI-layer e. g., the thickness, mass volumetric density, porosity, elastic moduli, viscosities, and stress relaxation time, vary significantly, from a half on order to a few orders, depending on the parameter and type of AI. To solve the icing problem for wind turbines, the ice-detection <b>and</b> <b>de-icing</b> <b>systems</b> are needed. The ice detection systems (IDSs) should not only detect the AI-layer on the blade skin but also provide the data allowing identification of the AI-layer parameters, which are sufficient for the cost-efficient de-icing. The identification method is, thus, in {{the focus of the}} IDS development, which deals with the following main features. (1) The operational load in a blade creates irregular space-time distributions of acoustic variable (e. g., strain, stress, and displacement) which depend on the acceleration, deceleration, and speed of rotation of the rotor, the blade-pitch angle, the wind, the presence of the AI layer on the skin, and other factors. The corresponding experimental data are well documented. (2) The blade skin is a layer of a complex, curvilinear shape, which, {{in the course of the}} turbine operation, varies in space and time. This feature is also well documented. (3) The AI stress-relaxation time can be in an interval of a few orders. (4) The AI-layer parameters should be identified by means of an appropriate acoustic model from the data of the sensors, which are located on the inner surface of the blade skin and wirelessly controlled in the real-time mode by a computer and gateways. The present work develops an acoustic model and method for identification of four of the AI-layer parameters: the thickness, mass density, bulk-wave speed, and stress-relaxation time. Due to Point (1), the identification method presumes passive rather than active sensing. The method is based on measurements of the acoustic accelerations at different points on the inner surface of the skin. The challenge in Point (2) is met by the generalizing the thin-planar-disk approximation from a single solid layer to the system of the blade-skin/AI layers. The proposed identification method is computationally efficient and suitable for the use indicated in Point (4). It extends the scope of the structural health monitoring techniques...|$|R

Furthermore, the <b>de-icing</b> <b>systems</b> were discovered to be problematic, causing a lot of unplanned downtime. The main goals of this project are to determine {{the causes of the}} discrepancies in availability and production at the wind farm. As part of the investigation, the malfunctioning <b>de-icing</b> <b>systems</b> are also investigated. Initially, the background of the wind farm was researched. Important contracts, maintenance reports and other documentation was reviewed. Moreover, interviews were performed with four people involved with the wind farm. These revealed that problems first began during the construction phase. Delays and poor construction quality in general led to problems being carried over to the operations stage. Complications with the <b>de-icing</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> blade drainage holes contributed to underperformance {{during the first year of}} operation. The second year of operation was marked by the <b>de-icing</b> <b>system</b> electrical cabinet detaching in the hub of turbine 2. Analysis of the turbine data and status files confirmed and elaborated on the information provided by the qualitative analysis. Investigation of the production and lost production figures revealed that the main problems have been related to the pitch systems, low temperature kits, sonic anemometers, PT- 100 sensors, and the software for the controllers. Furthermore, a significant proportion of the lost production and downtime in years one and two can be attributed to tests and repairs performed on the <b>de-icing</b> <b>systems.</b> However, early indications in year three suggest that the single active <b>de-icing</b> <b>system</b> in turbine 3 is functioning as it should.
