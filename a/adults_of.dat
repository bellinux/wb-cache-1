5|$|The phylum has a {{wide range}} of body forms, {{including}} the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the <b>adults</b> <b>of</b> most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth. Almost all ctenophores are predators, taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the <b>adults</b> <b>of</b> small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the salps on which <b>adults</b> <b>of</b> their species feed. Most species are hermaphrodites, and juveniles of at least some species are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. This combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>of</b> {{most species}} can {{regenerate}} tissues that are damaged or removed, although only platyctenids reproduce by cloning, splitting {{off from the}} edges of their flat bodies fragments that develop into new individuals.|$|E
5|$|Among P. labiata {{and some}} other Portias, when <b>adults</b> <b>of</b> the same species but {{opposite}} sexes recognise each other, they display at 10 to 30centimetres. Males usually wait for 2 to 15minutes before starting a display, but sometimes a female starts a display first.|$|E

5|$|Helminths {{known to}} infest weasels include the {{trematode}} Alaria, the nematodes Capillaria, Filaroides and Trichinella and the cestode Taenia. Least weasels are commonly {{infected with the}} nematode Skrjabingylus nasicola, <b>adults</b> <b>of</b> which {{are found in the}} nasal sinuses and can damage the skull.

5|$|Several fungal {{diseases}} infect {{and kill}} adult cicadas while another entomopathogenic fungus, Cordyceps spp., attacks nymphs. Massospora cicadina specifically attacks the <b>adults</b> <b>of</b> periodical cicadas, the spores remaining dormant {{in the soil}} between outbreaks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>of</b> Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids {{release their}} eggs into the water, and the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the larva makes {{its way into the}} copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is {{the main part of the}} circulatory system) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larva metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E

5000|$|A study {{conducted}} in Ohio found that retroactive AWA re-classification {{increased the number}} of offenders and altered their placement in management categories. Prior to implementation of AWA in Ohio 76% <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> and 88% <b>of</b> juvenile offenders were designated on the least restrictive category or did not have to register at all, while only 20% <b>of</b> <b>adults</b> and 5% <b>of</b> juveniles were classified as [...] "sexual predators", the most restrictive category.

5|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>of</b> {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>of</b> {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order to mate, or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} workers in Alberta did not {{recognize}} it at the time, they were finding the remains of juvenile Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as <b>adults</b> <b>of</b> a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. The first such animal to be named was Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could belong to a new genus, which he labelled Didanodon without further discussion. In 2006, Lund and Gates stated that Didanodon altidens was a nomen nudum, without further discussion.|$|E

5|$|Bryars {{chose to}} {{distinguish}} the character types through the vocal ranges they were given. The <b>adults</b> <b>of</b> the town are largely given deep voices, bass and bass-baritone for the men, contralto and mezzo-soprano for the women. The lovers have high voices, soprano and counter-tenor. In {{order to make the}} scientists sound unlike the townspeople, Bryars made Ox a tenor and Ygène a baritone, both parts being agile, lyric and relatively high in their voice range.|$|E
5|$|For newly emerged <b>adults</b> <b>of</b> most {{myrmecophilous}} Lycaenidae, deciduous waxy scales {{provide some}} protection from predators as they {{emerge from the}} nest. In {{the case of the}} moth butterfly (Liphyra brassolis), the caterpillars are unwelcome guests in nests of tree ants, feeding on ant larvae. The adults emerging from pupae are covered with soft, loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as they make {{their way out of the}} nest after hatching.|$|E
5|$|From the Permian, {{numerous}} stem group {{representatives of}} mayflies are known, {{which are often}} lumped into a separate taxon Permoplectoptera (e.g. including Protereisma permianum in the Protereismatidae, and Misthodotidae). The larvae of Permoplectoptera still had 9 pairs of abdominal gills, and the adults still had long hindwings. Maybe the fossil family Cretereismatidae from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil also belongs as the last offshoot to Permoplectoptera. The Crato outcrops otherwise yielded fossil specimens of modern mayfly families or the extinct (but modern) family Hexagenitidae. However, from the same locality the strange larvae and <b>adults</b> <b>of</b> the extinct family Mickoleitiidae (order Coxoplectoptera) have been described, which represents the fossil sister group of modern mayflies, {{even though they had}} very peculiar adaptations such as raptorial forelegs.|$|E

5|$|In adults, {{blood lead}} levels {{steadily}} increase with increasing age. In <b>adults</b> <b>of</b> all ages, men have higher blood lead levels than women do. Children {{are more sensitive}} to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. Children may also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and {{may be more likely}} to have contact with and ingest soil. Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead levels, possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and they use their mouths in their exploration. Blood levels usually peak at about 18–24months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.|$|E
5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} 3 to over 30years. <b>Adults</b> <b>of</b> most species are of one sex {{throughout}} their lives. The gonads are masses of developing gametes (ova or sperm), and most species have four gonads, two in each valve. Those of articulates {{lie in the}} channels of the mantle lobes, while those of inarticulates lie near the gut. Ripe gametes float into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity via the metanephridia, which open {{on either side of}} the mouth. Most species release both ova and sperm into the water, but females of some species keep the embryos in brood chambers until the larvae hatch.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-backed fairywren is {{predominantly}} insectivorous; they eat {{a wide variety}} of insects, including beetles such as weevils, leaf-, jewel-, flea- and ground-beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, moths, wasps and cicadas. Insect larvae and eggs are eaten as well as spiders. Seeds and other plant material make up only a very small proportion of its diet. It can be found hunting for insects in leaf litter, shrubbery and on the edges of bodies of water, mostly in the morning and late afternoon. <b>Adults</b> <b>of</b> both sexes as well as helper birds feed the young.|$|E

5|$|Lowe speculated in his 1927 paper that, in {{the absence}} of {{mammalian}} predators on the island, the brown skua would be the Inaccessible Island rail's only predator. A study of the diet of brown skuas on Inaccessible Island confirmed this, but found that although skuas do eat <b>adults</b> <b>of</b> this species, the rail and other landbirds formed {{only a small part of}} the diet of that seabird, especially compared to their abundance on the island. They noted that the landbirds alarm-called when brown skuas were seen. After hearing another rail make an alarm call, adult Inaccessible Island rails become alert, while chicks fall silent. Adults are rarely preyed upon, but the mortality of chicks is high and predation by Tristan thrushes is a major cause.|$|E
5|$|Masked shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. <b>Adults</b> <b>of</b> {{the two species}} are easily distinguished, since the masked shrike has white on its head and a dark rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the masked shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump.|$|E
