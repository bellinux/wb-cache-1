5|$|A 1977 BBC {{television}} debate discussed <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> {{and against}} Myra Hindley's release, with Lord Longford {{on the side}} who argued that Hindley should be released and Ann West (the mother of Lesley Ann Downey) on the side arguing against any suggestion of Hindley being released and threatening to kill her if she ever got out of prison.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a response to}} Chapter 25 ’s account of self-determination and the human right to democracy. It suggests that the chapter’s <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the human right to democracy fails {{because it does not}} sufficiently address the justificatory challenge that human rights face. It contrasts the justice-based <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> a human right to democracy with a legitimacy-based <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> a human right to political participation. It discusses the implications of this right to political participation for self-determination in the final section...|$|R
5|$|Beddard {{states in}} the book that it {{contains}} little that is new, intending instead to give a clear overview of the subject. The main topics covered are camouflage, then called 'protective coloration'; mimicry; and sexual selection. <b>Arguments</b> <b>for</b> and against these aspects of animal coloration are intensively discussed in the book.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Pope Urban VIII had {{personally}} asked Galileo to give <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> and against heliocentrism in the book, {{and to be}} careful not to advocate heliocentrism. He made another request, that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by Galileo.|$|E
5|$|Historian of {{philosophy}} Peter Adamson called the argument {{one of the}} most influential medieval <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> God's existence, and Avicenna's biggest contribution to the history {{of philosophy}}.

5|$|O'Connor {{made two}} <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> the dissenting justices: that {{predisposition}} was proven {{by the fact}} that Jacobson had ordered materials both times he was actually solicited, and that the Court had usurped the jury's rightful role in deciding whether he was entrapped. She also expressed fears that the court had so broadened the definition of predisposition as to make it a viable defense in almost any case.|$|E
5|$|Other {{opinions}} included Dr H Stern's, who {{postulated that}} the History was composed {{by a team}} of writers during the reign of Constantius II after the defeat of Magnentius on behalf of the Senatorial aristocracy who had supported the usurper. In the 21st century, Alan Cameron rebutted a number of Syme's and Barnes' <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> a composition date c.395–400, suggesting a composition date between 361 and the 380s.|$|E
5|$|Senator Bricker {{introduced}} another proposal {{later in}} the 83rd Congress and proposed similar constitutional amendments in the 84th and 85th Congresses. While hearings were held in the 84th and 85th Congresses, the full Senate took no action {{and the idea of}} amending the Constitution was never again seriously considered. In part, this was because the Supreme Court issued rulings that undercut <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> it, notably in Reid v. Covert.|$|E

5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best <b>Arguments</b> <b>for</b> and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E

5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle but they may later originate from the lower mantle. <b>Arguments</b> <b>for</b> an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based on the notion that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E
5|$|Both studios now faced rival projects, {{which could}} {{undercut}} their own long-term financial stability and plans. Columbia had no consistent movie franchise, and had sought Spider-Man since 1989; MGM/UA’s only reliable source of theatrical income {{was a new}} James Bond film {{every two or three}} years. An alternate 007 series could diminish or even eliminate the power of MGM/UA’s long-running Bond series. Likewise, an MGM/UA Spider-Man film could negate Columbia’s plans to create an exclusive cash cow. Both sides seemed to have strong <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> the rights to do such films.|$|E
5|$|First officially {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum, Hydnum repandum was sanctioned by Elias Fries in 1821. The species has been shuffled to several genera: Hypothele by Jean-Jacques Paulet in 1812; Dentinum by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821; Tyrodon by Petter Karsten in 1881 Sarcodon by Lucien Quélet in 1886. After a 1977 nomenclatural proposal by mycologist Ronald H. Petersen was accepted, Hydnum repandum became the official type {{species of the}} genus Hydnum. Previously, supporting <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> making H.repandum the type were made by Marinus Anton Donk (1958) and Petersen (1973), while Zdeněk Pouzar (1958) and Kenneth Harrison (1971) thought that H.imbricatum should be the type.|$|E

5|$|In her <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an {{emerging}} middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an Enlightenment belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical tableaux.|$|E
