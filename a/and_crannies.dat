25|$|The {{hospital}} {{buildings have}} been used on many occasions as a film or television location due to the proximity to several TV and film studios, Victorian prison-like architecture, lots of external nooks <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> and during the 1980s and 1990s plenty of empty ward space. Closed down wards became film locations as nightclubs (J block), hairdressers (H block) and free-French army barracks (an F block dining room).|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} for other wildlife are the reef-building species like the inshore horse mussel of Strangford Lough and the inter-tidal honeycomb worm of Morecambe Bay, Cumbria and Lancashire. These build up large structures over many years and, in turn, provide surfaces, nooks <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> where other marine animals and plants may become established and live out some or all of their lives.|$|E
25|$|Monserrate Román is a {{scientist}} in NASA who helped NASA build {{part of the}} International Space Station. She is the Chief Microbiologist for the Environmental Control and Life Support System project who determines how microbes will behave under different situations and in different locations, such as the nooks <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> of the Space Station. Roman {{was a member of}} the team which built the International Space Station. The Station was designed with materials that are microbe-resistant. Temperature and humidity are controlled to discourage microbe growth. Roman must study an international, multicultural group of the microbes, since crewmembers, visitors, experiments and hardware hail from 15 Station partner countries and comes with his or her own unique set of microbes.|$|E

25|$|For {{the most}} {{powerful}} black powder, meal powder, a wood charcoal, is used. The best wood for the purpose is Pacific willow, but others such as alder or buckthorn can be used. In Great Britain between the 15th and 19th centuries charcoal from alder buckthorn was greatly prized for gunpowder manufacture; cottonwood {{was used by the}} American Confederate States. The ingredients are reduced in particle size and mixed as intimately as possible. Originally, this was with a mortar-and-pestle or a similarly operating stamping-mill, using copper, bronze or other non-sparking materials, until supplanted by the rotating ball mill principle with non-sparking bronze or lead. Historically, a marble or limestone edge runner mill, running on a limestone bed, was used in Great Britain; however, by the mid 19th century this had changed to either an iron-shod stone wheel or a cast iron wheel running on an iron bed. The mix was dampened with alcohol or water during grinding to prevent accidental ignition. This also helps the extremely soluble saltpeter to mix into the microscopic nooks <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> of the very high surface-area charcoal.|$|E
500|$|ILM's {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} Scott Farrar said that [...] "not {{only were the}} film's effects ambitious, they also had to be designed for 3-D", and explained the company's solutions for the new perspective: [...] "We did make sure things are as bright as possible; Michael called up theatre owners {{to make sure they}} keep the lamps bright in the theatres... make everything a little sharper, because we know that through the steps, no matter what, {{when you get to the}} final screening things tend to go less sharp." [...] On the last weekend of ILM's work on Dark of the Moon, the company's entire render farm was being used for the film, giving ILM more than 200,000 hours of rendering power a day—or equivalent to 22.8 years of rendering time in a 24-hour period. Farrar embraced the detail in creating giant robots for 3-D, making sure that in close-ups of the Transformers' faces [...] "you see all the details in the nooks <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> of these pieces. It's totally unlike a plain surface subject like a human head or an animated head." [...] The supervisor said that Bay's style of cinematography helped integrate the robots into the scenes, as [...] "Michael is keen on having foreground/midground/background depth in his shots, even in normal live-action shots. He'll say, ’Put some stuff hanging here!' It could be women's stockings or forks and knives dangling from a string out of focus – it doesn't matter, but it gives you depth, and focus depth, and makes it more interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|The Otis Redding Dictionary of Soul {{received}} positive critical reception. Mark Deming of Allmusic {{gave the}} album 5 out of 5 stars, stating that it [...] "found the rugged-voiced deep soul singer continuing {{to expand the}} boundaries of his style while staying true to his rough and passionate signature sound." [...] He liked [...] "My Lover's Prayer" [...] and [...] "Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)", asserting that they were worthy of an Academy Award. The backing bands were for him [...] "thoroughly distinctive and remarkably adaptable, fitting to the nooks <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> of Redding's voice with their supple but muscular performances." [...] Magazine Rolling Stone rated the album 4 out of 5 stars, stating that Redding [...] "delivers {{one of his most}} mature performances, smoky and at times almost langorous" [...] in [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", and the second single is [...] "hard and precise but swinging." [...] In 2009, Daryl Easlea of BBC music gave the album a positive review and stated that Redding was at the [...] "peak of his powers" [...] when he recorded it. One song from the album, [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", was said by Easlea to be Redding's most remembered song after only [...] "(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay", which was released posthumously shortly after his death. The album was ranked at number 251 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Critic Jon Landau called it [...] "The finest record ever to come out of Memphis and certainly the best example of modern soul ever recorded." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Salto de San Anton {{is a large}} ravine with a small {{waterfall}} that is located within the city limits of Cuernavaca. The waterfall is [...] high, with its water coming from a small tributary of the Zempoala River. The vertical walls of the ravine are of basalt and broad-leafed vegetation grows in nooks <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> of the stone. A series of stairs and platforms have been built to enable access to the waterfall area from the park above. Unfortunately, a lot of trash gets dumped there.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cabin is}} {{intended}} to be upscale and luxurious in line {{with the rest of the}} Range Rover brand. [...] More notable options are a cabin length fixed sunroof and an 8–inch touch screen entertainment system that can display two different images simultaneously to both the driver and front passenger, the same system used in other Range Rover and Land Rover models. As well as mood lighting, in colours such as red, and blue, located in the door sills, handles, and other nooks <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> of the Evoque. The Evoque also has a push button start system, which will start the vehicle automatically, once the key fob is sensed. The cabin seats four, with optional heated seating, steering wheel, and windscreen wipers. There is also a 5–inch driver's information display, which displays information about the vehicle, and more. There are 12 interior colour choices available in a variety of wood and metal trims as well as three optional contrasting roof treatments.|$|E
2500|$|Wall Street {{is a major}} {{location}} of tourism in New York City. One report described lower Manhattan as [...] "swarming with camera-carrying tourists". Tour guides highlight places such as Trinity Church, the Federal Reserve gold vaults 80 feet below street level (worth $100 billion), and the NYSE. A Scoundrels of Wall Street Tour is a walking historical tour which includes a museum visit and discussion of various financiers [...] "who were adept at finding ways around finance laws or loopholes through them". Occasionally artists make impromptu performances; for example, in 2010, a troupe of 22 dancers [...] "contort their bodies and cram themselves into the nooks <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> of the Financial District in Bodies in Urban Spaces" [...] choreographed by Willi Donner. One chief attraction, the Federal Reserve Building in lower Manhattan, paid $750,000 to open a visitors' gallery in 1997. The New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange also spent money in the late 1990s to upgrade facilities for visitors. Attractions include the gold vault beneath the Federal Reserve and that [...] "staring down at the trading floor was as exciting as going to the Statue of Liberty".|$|E

The album was released in Australia on 21 October, which debuted at No.7 on the ARIA Albums Charts, and in 2008 it received platinum accreditation.|$|R
2500|$|The {{critical}} reception {{was generally}} positive, with some mixed responses. Review aggregator iDreamBooks gives it (...) a 73% meta-score from 61 critic reviews (48 positive, 13 negative) and 868 user ratings (76% positive). Meta-reviewer Complete Review summarized 20 press reviews as, [...] "No real consensus; many find it winning, many irritated by {{too much about}} it/Murakami's writing" [...] (in addition to their own assessment, [...] "B+: typically Murakamian shallow depth, but goes down very nice and easy"). Kirkus Reviews included the novel in its list of best books of 2014, describing it as [...] "Another tour de force from Japan’s greatest living novelist." [...] In {{the review of the}} novel for The New York Times, Patti Smith wrote [...] "This is a book for both the new and experienced reader. It has a strange casualness, as if it unfolded as Murakami wrote it; at times, it seems like a prequel to a whole other narrative... A shedding of Murakami skin. It is not [...] "Blonde on Blonde," [...] it is [...] "Blood on the Tracks." [...] Reviewing the novel for NPR, Meg Wolitzer wrote: [...] "Colorless Tsukuru's mystery is solved before the end, but the mystery of the spell that the great Murakami casts over his readers, myself included, goes, as ever, unsolved. The novel feels like a riddle, a puzzle, or maybe, actually, more like a haiku: full of beauty, strangeness, and color, thousands of syllables long." [...] In the review of the novel for The Washington Post, Marie Arana called it [...] "a deeply affecting novel, not only for the dark nooks <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> it explores, but for the magic that seeps into its characters’ subconsciouses, for the lengths to which they will go to protect or damage one another, for the brilliant characterizations it delivers along the way... Murakami can herd the troubles of a very large world and still mind a few precious details. He may be taking us deeper and deeper into a fractured modernity and its uneasy inhabitants, but he is ever alert to minds and hearts, to what it is, precisely, that they feel and see, and to humanity’s abiding and indomitable spirit." ...|$|E

60|$|A {{few minutes}} later they paddled ashore, and Vane landed them on a strip of shingle.

All was mirth, fun, and high good humour. Blue devils, hypochondria, and doleful dumps went and hid themselves among the nooks <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> of the rocks.|$|E
60|$|It {{may well}} be imagined, therefore, how well adapted is this mysterious and {{subterranean}} Hall of Eblis to the clandestine proceedings of gamblers, especially as the hammocks not only hang thickly, {{but many of them}} swing very low, within two feet of the floor, thus forming innumerable little canvas glens, grottoes, nooks, corners, <b>and</b> <b>crannies,</b> where a good deal of wickedness may be practiced by the wary with considerable impunity.|$|E
