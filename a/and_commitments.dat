40|$|The study here {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} ethical marketing norms, relationship quality (RQ), <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> {{in the context of}} legal services. Through a survey of customers of legal services providers in Malaysia, data were collected. Results from a standard analysis of data show that the four dimensions of ethical marketing norms contribute significantly and explain a significant amount of variance in RQ <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> The results further show that three dimensions of ethical norms namely price and distribution norm, information and contract norm, and general honesty and integrity norm are significantly associated with relationship quality <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> Product <b>and</b> promotion norm has no significant relationship with relationship quality <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> RQ plays a mediating role in the relationship between marketing norms <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> The study reveals that the same three dimensions of marketing norms predict both RQ <b>and</b> <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> are useful for effective legal services marketing.

25|$|Bernard Williams {{has argued}} that consequentialism is alienating because it {{requires}} moral agents to put too much distance between themselves and their own projects <b>and</b> <b>commitments.</b> Williams argues that consequentialism requires moral agents to take a strictly impersonal view of all actions, since {{it is only the}} consequences, and not who produces them, that are said to matter. Williams argues that this demands too much of moral agents—since (he claims) consequentialism demands that they be willing to sacrifice any and all personal projects <b>and</b> <b>commitments</b> in any given circumstance in order to pursue the most beneficent course of action possible. He argues further that consequentialism fails to make sense of intuitions that it can matter whether or not someone is personally the author of a particular consequence. For example, that participating in a crime can matter, even if the crime would have been committed anyway, or would even have been worse, without the agent's participation.|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Past research has indicated that lack of supervisory leadership reduces teachers' job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> This quantitative study examined and compared therelationships between principals' supervisory leadership styles and high school teachers job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> in both China and the United States. The mail-in survey questionnaire included three measures, the Supervisory Behavior Description, the Teacher Job Satisfaction, <b>and</b> the Organizational <b>Commitment,</b> with a demographic form. This study found that the U. S. teachers had much higher levels of job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> than the Chinese teachers. U. S. teachers perceived their principals as using more consideration leadership style while Chinese teachers perceived their principals as using more initiating structure leadership style. Positive relationships between the consideration leadership style and both job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> negative relationships between the initiating structure leadership style and both job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> were found in both countries. Further, these relationships were found to be stronger among the Chinese teachers than the U. S. teachers.
