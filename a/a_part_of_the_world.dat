5|$|A {{third period}} of mission {{foundations}} began in 1748 {{with the establishment}} of San Ignacio de Velasco, which was not declared <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Heritage Site. The church is nonetheless a largely faithful 20th-century reconstruction – as opposed to renovation (a key criterion for inclusion in the World Heritage Site group) – of the second Jesuit templo built in 1761. In 1754 the Jesuits founded the mission of Santiago de Chiquitos. This church also is a reconstruction, dating from the early 20th century and likewise {{is not part of the}} World Heritage Site group. In 1755 the mission of Santa Ana de Velasco was founded by the Jesuit Julian Knogler; it is the most authentic of the six World Heritage Site missions dating from the colonial period. The last mission in the Chiquitania to be established was founded by the Jesuits Fr. Antonio Gaspar and Fr. José Chueca as Santo Corazón in 1760. However, nothing of the original settlement remains in the modern village.|$|E

25|$|One {{consequence}} of these positions that Unger points {{to is the}} revision of the concept and function of mathematics. If {{there is only one}} world drenched in time through and through, then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes that captures reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world of time and space it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of certain ways in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured wholes and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the time-bound particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, but it is not <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

Writing in 2015, Haiven called [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] a [...] "telling narrative" [...] and described it as a [...] "grim and timely warning" [...] about religious fundamentalism, and its power to shape society.

2500|$|David Abram {{explains}} Merleau-Ponty's {{concept of}} [...] "flesh" [...] (chair) as [...] "the mysterious tissue or matrix that underlies and {{gives rise to}} both the perceiver and the perceived as interdependent aspects of its spontaneous activity," [...] and he identifies this elemental matrix with the interdependent web of earthly life. This concept unites subject and object dialectically as determinations within a more primordial reality, which Merleau-Ponty calls [...] "the flesh," [...] and which Abram refers to variously as [...] "the animate earth," [...] "the breathing biosphere," [...] or [...] "the more-than-human natural world." [...] Yet this is not nature or the biosphere conceived as {{a complex set of}} objects and objective processes, but rather [...] "the biosphere as it is experienced and lived from within by the intelligent body — by the attentive human animal who is entirely <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> that he, or she, experiences. Merleau-Ponty's ecophenemonology with its emphasis on holistic dialog within the larger-than-human world also has implications for the ontogenesis and phylogenesis of language, indeed he states that [...] "language is the very voice of the trees, the waves and the forest." [...] Merleau-Ponty himself refers to [...] "that primordial being which is not yet the subject-being nor the object-being and which in every respect baffles reflection. From this primordial being to us, there is no derivation, nor any break..." [...] Among the many working notes found on his desk {{at the time of his}} death, and published with the half-complete manuscript of The Visible and the Invisible, several make evident that Merleau-Ponty himself recognized a deep affinity between his notion of a primordial [...] "flesh" [...] and a radically transformed understanding of [...] "nature." [...] Hence in November 1960 he writes: [...] "Do a psychoanalysis of Nature: it is the flesh, the mother." [...] And in the last published working note, written in March 1961, he writes: [...] "Nature as the other side of humanity (as flesh, nowise as 'matter')." ...|$|E
