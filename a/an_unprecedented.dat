5000|$|<b>As</b> <b>unprecedented</b> events {{occur in}} history it is {{necessary}} to examine current policies for adequacy. A federal law that [...] "prohibits military personnel from enforcing the law within the United States" [...] is an inadequate policy for addressing the Global War on Terrorism. In years prior to September 11, 2001 the Department of Defense narrowly focused on the military's ability to enforce laws domestically and not the President's authority to authorize such use of force.|$|R

40|$|AbstractGeological {{sequestration}} of CO 2 on {{a massive}} scale implies that large area fractions of the underground could become flooded by CO 2, imposing <b>a</b> <b>unprecedented</b> regulatory challenge to environmental authorities. Therefore we propose carbon sequestration bonds as complementary, market-based instruments that should further help to manage the risk of decadal-scale CO 2 leakage. Such bond schemes address market failures that could occur if the investment behavior of operators under uncertainty differed from society’s preference. For a stylized setup we demonstrate that our bond system has the potential to simultaneously address regulatory challenges stemming from information asymmetries and diverging orders of preference...|$|R
