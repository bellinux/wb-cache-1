5|$|Janet Burnett Grossman {{writes that}} girls {{appear to be}} commemorated about <b>as</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> boys on {{surviving}} Attic gravestones, although previous scholars suggested that boys were commemorated up to twice as often. If they survived, Athenian children were named in a ceremony (the dekate) ten days after birth. Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth (at five, seven, and forty days after birth) were also observed. Later rites of passage were apparently more common and elaborate for boys than for girls.|$|E
5|$|Camille and {{executive}} producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner eventually convinced Cosby that the series should feature {{a family that}} resembled their own more closely, specifically one headed {{by a pair of}} successful parents with white-collar professions. Thus, Cosby relented and re-wrote Clair and Cliff into a lawyer and doctor, respectively. The idea of Clair being Dominican was abandoned before the pilot was filmed. However, the character still speaks some Spanish in the first episode and continues to speak the language periodically throughout the series, albeit not <b>as</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> Cosby had originally intended. Cosby borrowed several names from his real-life family for his fictional one; Clair's maiden name is Hanks, which she shares with Camille. The second season explores each character gaining more responsibility, none more-so than Clair, who is deliberately provided with more storylines to experience and new emotions to expess in terms of her relationship with her husband and children.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons Johnson {{featured}} intermittently in the first team. He scored five goals in 12 appearances for the first team in 1920–21, playing more regularly for the reserves, for whom he was the leading goalscorer with 18 goals. He became a regular first team selection in 1922–23, playing 35 matches. In 1923 Manchester City moved from Hyde Road to a new stadium, Maine Road, in the Moss Side area of the city. Johnson scored in the first match at the new stadium, against Sheffield United. While Johnson was a regular goalscorer {{at this point in}} his career, he did not score <b>as</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> teammates Frank Roberts and Horace Barnes. Firmly established in the first team, he missed only one match in the 1924–25 season.|$|E

25|$|By Savoy Opera standards, Princess Ida was not {{considered}} a success due, in part, to a particularly hot summer in London in 1884, {{and it was not}} revived in London until 1919.

25|$|The items used in {{decoration}} {{may also}} have been darker and heavier than those used today, simply as a matter of practicality. London was noisy and its air was full of soot from countless coal fires. Hence those who could afford it draped their windows in heavy, sound-muffling curtains, and chose colours that didn't show soot quickly. When all washing was done by hand, curtains were not washed <b>as</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> they might be today.|$|E

25|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} is {{also useful}} in measuring {{the degree of}} polymerization in polymer manufacture. Changes in the character or quantity of a particular bond are assessed by measuring at a specific frequency over time. Modern research instruments can take infrared measurements across the range of interest <b>as</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> 32 times a second. This can be done whilst simultaneous measurements are made using other techniques. This makes the observations of chemical reactions and processes quicker and more accurate.|$|E
25|$|Eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} {{is a rare}} disease. Parasitic causes {{are most}} common in geographic areas where each parasite is endemic. AEP can occur at any age, even in previously healthy children, though most patients are between 20 and 40 years of age. Men are affected approximately twice <b>as</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> women. AEP {{has been associated with}} smoking. CEP occurs more frequently in women than men and {{does not appear to be}} related to smoking. An association with radiation for breast cancer has been described.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{have played}} a role in {{managing}} fire for thousands of years in the Great Western Woodlands. Although there is very little published information that describes how Aboriginal people utilised fire in this region historically, these fire regimes are believed to have changed significantly in the last century. Recent evidence that utilises natural clues for past fire regimes (for example, the distribution and age of long-lived, fire-sensitive plants such as Calitris Pine) suggest that woodland habitats were disturbed by fire on average every 400 years, whereas shrubland habitats burnt <b>as</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> every 60 years.|$|E

25|$|Kermode {{bears are}} {{omnivorous}} {{for most of}} the year, subsisting mainly on herbage and berries except during autumn salmon migrations, when they become obligate predators. During the day, white bears are 35% more successful than black bears in capturing salmon. Scientists have also found that salmon evade large, black models about twice <b>as</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> they evade large white models, giving white bears an advantage in salmon hunting. On some islands, white Kermode bears have more marine derived nutrients in their fur, indicating that white Kermode bears eat more salmon than the black Kermode bears.|$|E
25|$|Women's {{personal}} name changes were recorded less often, {{so they may}} not have changed their names <b>as</b> <b>frequently</b> <b>as</b> men did, but women who went into service as maids or entertainers frequently changed their names for the duration of their service. During their employment, their temporary names were treated as their legal names. For example, a maid who was involved in legal dealings in Kyoto in 1819-1831 signed legal documents as Sayo during one period of employment and as Mitsu during a later period of employment, but she signed as Iwa, presumably her birth name, when she was between jobs.|$|E
