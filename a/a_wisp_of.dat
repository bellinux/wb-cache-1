5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E

25|$|Australia was 151 {{for seven}} – {{and the man}} wreaking the havoc was F. R. Brown! That was the {{remarkable}} part of this afternoon of sensations...one would not expect him to run through a first-class side of batsman, yet here was {{his name on the}} board with three Test batsman to his credit at a very small cost and at a very vital stage of the game. With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and an ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> straw in his mouth to make him look like the original Farmer Brown.|$|E
60|$|He {{then took}} <b>a</b> little <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> straw, and brushed away a clean place upon the barn floor, and then poured down the nails upon it.|$|R
60|$|Richard stooped {{and picked}} it up. It was <b>a</b> fly <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> {{rhinoceros}} horn which {{the man had}} let fall when the Zulu's spear struck him.|$|R
6000|$|He. That's all right. One moment, dear. There's <b>a</b> little <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> hair got {{loose from}} behind your right ear and it's straggling over your cheek. So! ...|$|R
25|$|Covered by {{only four}} riflemen, he fought {{for four hours}} under terrific enemy small-arms fire and {{repeatedly}} returned to his own lines to prepare demolition charges and obtain serviced flame throwers. He returned to the front, frequently {{to the rear of}} hostile emplacements, to wipe out one position after another. At one point, <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> smoke alerted him to the air vent of a Japanese bunker, and he approached close enough to put the nozzle of his flamethrower through the hole, killing the occupants. On another occasion, he was charged by enemy riflemen who attempted to stop him with bayonets and he killed them with a burst of flame from his weapon.|$|E
500|$|He {{observes that}} [...] "Every naturalist {{traveller}} {{appears to have}} some instance to relate of how he was taken in by a protectively-coloured insect. These stories are told with a curiously exaggerated delight at the deception...", giving as example how Professor Drummond in his book Tropical Africa thought a mantid was <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> hay. He picks up on the casually mentioned fact that Drummond's African companion was not deceived, writing {{that we should not}} judge camouflage [...] "from the human standpoint".|$|E
500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I... I {{shall never}} forget what you did, sir," [...] said she, through her {{diminishing}} tears. She was <b>a</b> slight <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> girl, a child, no more.|$|R
60|$|So he took <b>a</b> bundle <b>of</b> <b>wisps</b> <b>of</b> {{letters and}} {{envelopes}} {{out of his}} pocket.|$|R
60|$|He was <b>a</b> little <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man, and I shook 'im {{like a dog}} shakes a rat. I {{remembered my}} own pocket being picked, and I nearly shook the breath out of 'im.|$|R
2500|$|She is also closely {{associated}} with the white mist that often surrounds the mountain. [...] While in just a few stories either her skin or hair is white, in most tales, it is her radiant clothing which makes people who have seen her think that perhaps they just saw <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> cloud through the trees and mistook it for Maria.|$|E
2500|$|Mild to {{moderate}} cases are often treated conservatively {{with warm water}} and epsom salt soaks, antibacterial ointment {{and the use of}} dental floss. If conservative treatment of a minor ingrown toenail does not succeed, or if the ingrown toenail is severe, surgical treatment may be required. A [...] "gutter splint" [...] may be improvised by slicing a cotton-tipped wooden applicator diagonally to form a bevel and using this to insert <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> cotton from the applicator head under the nail to lift it from the underlying skin after a foot soak.|$|E
2500|$|Don Taxay, in {{his book}} on {{commemorative}} coins, described the seal as [...] "a rather whimsical composition"; Beach had deemed it [...] "rather amusing" [...] and had hoped the new coins [...] "will {{be a little more}} interesting than the others I have done". Swiatek and Breen referred to [...] "the quint device of King Neptune riding backwards on a spouting whale, whose eye is represented as being about where its blowhole should be. Neptune is briefly clad in <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> cloth 'blowing in the wind'." [...] They suggested that the position of the moon meant, if it was waxing, that the ship was sailing west toward America, but if waning, was sailing east to Europe.|$|E
60|$|What could Hannibal or Caesar {{have done}} more? Our own {{loss in the}} whole affair has been insignificant--three killed and about fifteen wounded. Got their banner, <b>a</b> green <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thing with a {{sentence}} of the Koran engraved upon it.|$|R
60|$|She {{slammed the}} door on his protests and, {{returning}} to the parlour, gazed fiercely into the glass on the mantelpiece. It reflected sixteen stone of honest English womanhood, <b>a</b> thin <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> yellowish-grey hair, {{and a pair of}} faded eyes peering through clumsy spectacles.|$|R
60|$|The {{door opened}} to a gaunt figure, partly {{composed}} of bed-quilt and partly of plaid shawl. A predominance {{of the latter}} and <b>a</b> long <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> iron-gray hair determined her sex. She leaned against the post {{with an air of}} fatigue, half moral and half physical.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are widely}} {{contrasting}} views about Brown's personality. He was well-liked in Australia when he captained England there in 1950–51 as recorded by O'Reilly (see above). According to Kay, Brown had a hearty appetite {{for food and}} drink and was combative and forceful by nature, which endeared him to the Australian public. Jack Fingleton commented: [...] "With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> straw in his mouth {{to make him look}} like the original Farmer Brown". On the other hand, professional players viewed Brown's silk neckerchief with contempt as it [...] "enhanced the impression of a bumptious windbag". Brown was considered [...] "a bully who preyed on weakness or quirk of character".|$|E
2500|$|The Kecksburg UFO {{incident}} occurred on December 9, 1965, at Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, United States. A large, brilliant fireball {{was seen by}} thousands in at least six U.S. states and Ontario, Canada. It streaked over the Detroit, Michigan – Windsor, Canada area, reportedly dropped hot metal debris over Michigan and northern Ohio, starting some grass fires, and caused sonic booms in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. It was generally assumed and reported by the press to be a meteor after authorities discounted other proposed explanations such as a plane crash, errant missile test, or reentering satellite debris. However, eyewitnesses in the small village of Kecksburg, about 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, claimed something crashed in the woods. A boy said he saw the object land; his mother saw <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> blue smoke arising from the woods and alerted authorities. Another reported feeling a vibration and [...] "a thump" [...] {{about the time the}} object reportedly landed. Others from Kecksburg, including local volunteer fire department members, reported finding an object in the shape of an acorn and about as large as a Volkswagen Beetle. Writing resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs was also said to be in a band {{around the base of the}} object. Witnesses further reported that intense military presence, most notably the United States Army, secured the area, ordered civilians out, and then removed an object on a flatbed truck. The military claimed they searched the woods and found [...] "absolutely nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|She stopped, and {{put back}} <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> her disordered {{chestnut}} hair.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not in the least,' she replied, in her {{measured}} way. Loerke laughed, wrinkling up {{his face}} oddly. There was <b>a</b> thin <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> his hair straying on his forehead, she noticed that his skin was of a clear brown colour, his hands, his wrists. And his hands seemed closely prehensile. He seemed like topaz, so strangely brownish and pellucid.|$|R
60|$|She leaned {{a little}} towards him. <b>A</b> long <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> her hair blew in his face. A moment of madness {{came to him}} with the gust of wind which blew her almost into his arms. For one {{exquisite}} moment he held her. The violets at her bosom were crushed against his coat. Then she tore herself away.|$|R
5000|$|In a letter, Brahms {{referred}} to the scherzo from his Second Piano Concerto as <b>a</b> [...] "little <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scherzo", {{in one of his}} typically ursine pleasantries, as it is a heavyweight movement.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Grile {{hastened to}} proffer a paper of tobacco, which {{disappeared}} like <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> oats {{drawn into a}} threshing machine.|$|E
60|$|She {{arranged}} {{it herself}} in his coat. He laughed as she swept aside <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> her hair which brushed his cheek.|$|E
60|$|Rupert Dixon smirked. A smirking man, {{wrapped in}} a bath towel, with <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> wet hair over one eye, is a {{repellent}} sight.|$|E
60|$|But {{all through}} the {{afternoon}} that scene was painted {{on the pages of}} Stephen's books. The crude booth in the darkened way. The free pose of the girl standing in front of her companions, <b>a</b> blue <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> autumn sunlight falling at her feet. The young Prince laughing at her sallies, and the elderly gentleman smiling with benevolence upon the pair.|$|R
60|$|Presently, in came {{a company}} of young men, {{relatives}} of Nimni. They were slender as sky-sail-poles; standing in a row, resembled a picket- fence; and were surmounted by enormous heads of hair, combed out all round, variously dyed, and evened by being singed with <b>a</b> lighted <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> straw. Like milliners' parcels, they were very neatly done up; wearing redolent robes.|$|R
6000|$|In {{front of}} us were the dogs, and then, a hundred paces beyond them, was <b>a</b> brown <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thing, the fox itself, {{stretched}} to the uttermost. The sight of him fired my blood. [...] "Aha, we have you then, assassin!" [...] I cried, and shouted my encouragement to the huntsman. I waved my hand to show him that there was one upon whom he could rely.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was hard}} then {{to realize that}} the bleared, {{wrinkled}} creature, so like <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> charred rag, could ever have been [...] "Lispeth of the Kotgarh Mission." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Built it myself," [...] Ferguson proclaimed, [...] "and, by God, she drew! Never <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> smoke {{anywhere}} save in {{the pointed}} channel, and {{that during the}} big southeasters." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Ripley {{came to the}} window, {{buttoning}} {{her dress}} at the throat, <b>a</b> <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> her hair sticking assertively from the little knob {{at the back of}} her head.|$|E
60|$|Appleby {{said nothing}} further for a while, and the boat’s gunwale became {{level with the}} froth that splashed about it, for the breeze freshened as they drew out from the land. <b>A</b> thin <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> haze had {{stretched}} across the moon and dimmed the silvery light, {{but there was a}} wide strip of faintly shining water in front of them when he fancied he caught a faint, pulsating sound.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Chester Portwood, {{ploughing}} his {{way through}} a long speech, stopped and looked apprehensively over his shoulder. The girl with the lisp, who had been listening in a perfunctory manner to the long speech, screamed loudly. The voice of an unseen stage-hand called thunderously to an invisible [...] "Bill" [...] to commere quick. And from the scenery on the prompt side there curled lazily across the stage <b>a</b> black <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> smoke.|$|R
60|$|Madame la Duchesse threw a {{quick glance}} into the gilt-framed mirror close by. She {{smoothed}} <b>a</b> stray <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> hair which had escaped from under her lace cap: she gave a tug to her fichu and a pat to her skirts. Then, as the folding doors were once more thrown open, and Hector--stiff, solemn and pompous--appeared under the lintel, Madame threw back {{her head in the}} grand manner pertaining to the old days at Versailles.|$|R
