60|$|And {{looking back}} through the prodigious vista of the past, I find no record of the {{commencement}} of life, and therefore I am devoid of any means of forming a definite conclusion as to the conditions of its appearance. Belief, in the scientific sense of the word, is a serious matter, and needs strong foundations. To say, therefore, in the admitted absence of evidence, that I have any belief as to the mode in which the existing forms of life have originated, would be using words in a wrong sense. But expectation is permissible where belief is not; {{and if it were}} given me to look beyond the abyss of geologically recorded time to the still more remote period when the earth was passing through physical and chemical conditions, which it can no more see again than a man can recall his infancy, I should expect to be a witness of the evolution of living protoplasm from not living matter. I should expect to see it appear under forms of great simplicity, endowed, like existing fungi, with the power of determining the formation of new protoplasm from such matters as <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> oxalates and tartrates, alkaline and earthy phosphates, and water, without the aid of light. That is the expectation to which analogical reasoning leads me; but I beg you once more to recollect that I have no right to call my opinion anything but an act of philosophical faith.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAmmonium-bearing {{minerals}} {{have been}} suggested to be present on Mars, Ceres, and various asteroids and comets. We undertook a systematic study of the spectral reflectance properties of ammonium-bearing minerals and compounds that have possible planetary relevance (i. e., <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> chlorides, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, silicates, and sulfates). Various synthetic and natural NH 4 +-bearing minerals were analyzed using reflectance spectroscopy in the long-wave ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared regions (0. 35 - 8 mu m) {{in order to identify}} spectral features characteristic of the NH 4 + molecule, and to evaluate if and how these features vary among different species. Mineral phases were confirmed through structural and compositional analyses using X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, and elemental combustion analysis. Characteristic absorption features associated with NH 4 {{can be seen in the}} reflectance spectra at wavelengths as short as similar to 1 mu m. In the near-infrared region, the most prominent absorption bands are located near 1. 6, 2. 0, and 2. 2 mu m. Absorption features characteristic of NH 4 + occurred at slightly longer wavelengths in the mineral-bound NH 4 + spectra than for free NH 4 + for most of the samples. Differences in wavelength position are attributable to various factors, including differences in the type and polarizability of the anion(s) attached to the NH 4 +, degree and type of hydrogen bonding, molecule symmetry, and cation substitutions. Multiple absorption features, usually three absorption bands, in the mid-infrared region between similar to 2. 8 and 3. 8 mu m were seen in all but the most NH 4 -poor sample spectra, and are attributed to fundamentals, combinations, and overtones of stretching and bending vibrations of the NH 4 + molecule. These features appear even in reflectance spectra of water-rich samples which exhibit a strong 3 mu m region water absorption feature. While many of the samples examined in this study have NH 4 absorption bands at unique wavelength positions, in order to discriminate between different NH 4 +-bearing phases, absorption features corresponding to molecules other than NH 4 + should be included in spectral analysis. A qualitative comparison of the laboratory results to telescopic spectra of Asteroids 1 Ceres, 10 Hygiea, and 324 Bamberga for the 3 mu m region demonstrates that a number of NH 4 -bearing phases are consistent with the observational data in terms of exhibiting an absorption band in the 3. 07 mu m region.

40|$|To offer better {{solutions}} for the recycling of salt cake from secondary aluminum melting, several innovative investigations were carried out based on hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical views. Thermal diffusivity measurements {{as a function of}} temperature on salts-Al composites having various compositions (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 wt pct metallic Al) were carried out. Its attempt to derive theoretical relationships between aluminium contents in the salt-Al composites and the thermal conductivities so that these would serve as calibration curves for industrial samples taken out from secondary aluminium re-melting at a later stage. The AlN hydrolysis behavior in NaCl solution was investigated by immersing pure AlN powder in deionized water, 0. 3 mol/l NaCl aq, 0. 6 mol/l NaCl aq and NaCl solution respectively with CO 2 bubbling at 291 K. The results showed that AlN powder underwent enhanced hydrolysis in NaCl aq than that in deionized water, while, the introduction of CO 2 was found to hinder the hydrolysis even in the presence of NaCl. The characterization of the products after hydrolysis was carried out using XRD, SEM and TEM analyses. It was shown that the hydrolysis process included a slow-reaction period involving the dissolution of aluminum hydroxide layer around raw AlN particle, followed by the precipitation of aluminum hydroxide gel and the crystallization of boehmite, bayerite and gibbsite. The effects of sodium chloride concentration on the hydrolysis behavior are presented. The leaching process in CO 2 -saturated water showed that, at a solid to liquid ratio of 1 : 20 and 3 h at 291 K, the extraction of Na and K from the dross could be kept as high as 95. 6 % and 95. 9 %, respectively. At the same time, with continuous CO 2 bubbling, the mass of generated NH 3 during the leaching process decreased significantly, also the escaping NH 3 gas decreased from 0. 25 mg in pure water down to < 0. 006 mg. The above results showed that the introduction of CO 2 causes hindrance to the hydrolysis of AlN, meanwhile, effective absorption of ammonia. The plausible mechanisms for the observed phenomena are discussed. The concept of the leaching of the salt cake by carbonated water and the consequent retention of AlN in the leach residue opens up a promising route towards an environment-friendly recycling process for the salt cake viz. recovery of the salts, utilization of CO 2 and further processing of the dross residue, towards the synthesis of SiAlON from the leach residues.    In alternative route to the processing of salt cake, the ammonia gas evolved by hydrolysis of AlN was collected by CO 2 -saturated water during water leaching at 373 K. The products, i. e. <b>ammonium</b> <b>carbonates</b> which are free of chlorides, has application as a fertilizer, besides that, this method also has the advantage of fixing carbon from CO 2, which is the subject of many investigations around the world. The oxidation behavior of composites SiMgAlON phases (β-SiAlON, MgAlON and 15 R) synthesized from the residue during the leaching treatment of salt cake and corresponding synthetic samples was investigated in air by thermogravimetric measurements. The oxidation studies reveal the effects of impurities, namely, Fe 2 O 3 and CaO present in the salt cake residue. From the view of kinetics, the addition of Fe 2 O 3 brings a lower activation energy and more aggressive oxidation. The additive of CaO caused the shrinkage during the synthesis and liquid formation during the oxidation above 1673 K, thus retard the oxidation rate. The impurities of CaO and Fe 2 O 3 in the leaching residue can result in an aggressive oxidation at low temperature and a protective oxidation at temperatures above the eutectic point. From the view of phase evolution, with the progress of oxidation, the composition of the material being oxidized moved towards the Al 2 O 3 -rich corner of MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 or CaO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 phase diagrams relevant to SiMgAlON composite. At lower temperatures, the addition of Fe 2 O 3 and CaO facilitated the formation of cordierite and anorthite, respectively. With the increasing of temperature, islands of silicate melt were formed dissolving these oxides, with the liquidus temperature getting lowered as a consequence. The liquid phase formed engulfed the adjacent solid phases providing strong mobility for the cations and enabling the crystal growth. As a result, intermediate products, i. e. cordierite, anorthite, spinel, which formed earlier during oxidation are found to get dissolved in the liquid phase. QC 20120912 </p...|$|E
