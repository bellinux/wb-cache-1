5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{argue that}} there is no one High Priest who is the strongest candidate for identification with each of the Wicked Priest passages.

5|$|After {{assuming}} {{office in}} 1897, United States President William McKinley signed {{the treaty of}} annexation for the Republic of Hawaii, but it failed to pass in the United States Senate after the Kūʻē Petitions were submitted by Kaulia, Kalauokalani, John Richardson and William Auld <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strong resistance of the Native Hawaiian community to annexation. Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina collected over 21,000 signatures opposing an annexation treaty. Another 17,000 signatures were collected by members of Hui Kālaiʻāina but not submitted to the Senate because they were asking {{for the restoration of}} the queen and the delegates. The petitions were used <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strong resistance of the Hawaiian community to annexation and the treaty was defeated in the Senate. After the failure of the treaty, Hawaii was instead annexed by means of a joint resolution called the Newlands Resolution, in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

5|$|Fay {{damaged the}} roof of the airport's {{terminal}} building, causing the sprinkler system to malfunction and inundate parts of the structure with water; the resultant flooding crippled computer systems crucial to processing passenger information. The airport's radar was also impacted by the storm. In response to the damage, the airport was closed to all flights, though it quickly reopened to emergency diversions and non-commercial flights. Including subsequent damage from Gonzalo, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need for a newer terminal in a more protected location.|$|E

Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that {{the most important aspect of}} the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E

5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) is an {{environmental}} movement {{that calls for}} all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent environmental degradation. The group states that {{a decrease in the}} human population would prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harm caused by human overpopulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{centre of}} these {{architectural}} developments was the region encompassing the present-day Dharwad district; it included areas of present-day Haveri and Gadag districts. In these districts, about fifty monuments have survived <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> widespread temple {{building of the}} Western Chalukyan workshops. The influence of this style extended beyond the Kalyani region in the northeast to the Bellary region {{in the east and}} to the Mysore region in the south. In the Bijapur–Belgaum region to the north, the style was mixed with that of the Hemadpanti temples. Although a few Western Chalukyan temples {{can be found in the}} Konkan region, the presence of the Western Ghats probably prevented the style from spreading westwards.|$|E

He would {{work as a}} jewelry salesman, a bottle label painter and as night manager of a construction warehouse. Nevertheless, Pilecki was informed in July 1946 that his actual identity had been uncovered by the MBP. He was ordered to leave the country; but he declined. In April 1947, he began independently collecting evidence of Soviet atrocities committed in Poland during the 1939–1941 occupation as well <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unlawful arrest and prosecution of Home Army veterans and ex-members of the Polish Armed Forces in the West, which often resulted in execution or imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|In June 1897 President McKinley {{signed the}} treaty of {{annexation}} for the Republic of Hawaii, but it failed to pass in the United States Senate after the Kūʻē Petitions were submitted by a commission of Native Hawaiian delegates consisting of James Keauiluna Kaulia, David Kalauokalani, William Auld, and John Richardson. Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina collected over 21,000 signatures opposing an annexation treaty. Another 17,000 signatures were collected by members of Hui Kālaiʻāina but not submitted to the Senate because they were asking for restoration of the Queen.

Members of the Bermuda Regiment immediately began cleanup and recovery efforts, while the government provided tarps to affected homeowners. Sailors from the Argyll teamed up with Regiment soldiers upon the ship's arrival to continue relief work. Some 35of the vessel's crew members worked to clear debris from the runway at the airport, which reopened on October 19 after thorough evaluations. Including damage from Fay, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need for a newer terminal in a more protected location.

5|$|It was {{alleged that}} the police helped the mob against the Muslim {{community}} {{on the day of}} massacre. Evidence included complaints filed by victims' family members which state that police officials fired bullets and helped the mob, resulting in the killings. It was also alleged that police guided the mob of rioters to residents' hiding places. According to Human Rights Watch, the police did nothing as houses and people were burnt and, {{on the day of the}} violence, did not respond to telephone calls until the massacre ended. Numerous eyewitnesses saw police aiming tear gas shells at, and firing upon, Muslim youths who tried to defend themselves or others. There also have been allegations that police themselves burnt houses and looted. In the violence, the extensive use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was reported, which was cited <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> involvement of officials because of easy access to it.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in adverse {{conditions}} for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities. While he was gone the native Caribs attacked the settlement of Cumaná, burned {{it to the ground}} and killed four of Las Casas's men. He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard the news of the massacre. The rumours even included him among the dead. To make matters worse, his detractors used the event <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need to pacify the Indians using military means.

5|$|The Minoan {{eruption}} {{is a key}} {{marker for}} the Bronze Age chronology of the Eastern Mediterranean world.

Despite the evidence, the exact date of the eruption {{has been difficult to}} determine. Archaeologists have traditionally placed it at approximately 1500 BCE. Radiocarbon dates, including analysis of an olive branch buried beneath a lava flow from the volcano that gave a date between 1627 BCE and 1600 BCE (95% confidence interval), suggest an eruption date more than a century earlier than suggested by archaeologists. Thus, the radiocarbon dates and the archaeological dates are in substantial disagreement.|$|E

5|$|The {{verdict was}} treated with scepticism by much of the {{international}} media and the U.S. government of President Jimmy Carter. On 2 February 1978, {{based on the evidence}} given at the inquest, {{the attorney general of the}} Eastern Cape stated that he would not prosecute the officers. After the inquest, Biko's family brought a civil case against the state; at the advice of their lawyers, they agreed to a settlement of R65,000 (US$78,000) in July 1979. Shortly after the inquest, the South African Medical and Dental Council initiated proceedings against the medical professionals who had been entrusted with Biko's care; eight years later two of the medics were found guilty of improper conduct. The failure of the government-employed doctors to diagnose or treat Biko's injuries has been frequently cited as an example of a repressive state influencing medical practitioners' decisions, and Biko's death <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need for doctors to serve the needs of patients before those of the state.|$|E
