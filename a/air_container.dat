Air springs are rubber bladders which provide damping as well as isolation and are used in large trucks. Some pneumatic isolators can attain low resonant frequencies and are used for isolating large industrial equipment. Air tables consist of a working surface or optical surface mounted on air legs. These tables provide enough isolation for laboratory instrument under some conditions. Air systems may leak under vacuum conditions. The <b>air</b> <b>container</b> can interfere with isolation of low-amplitude vibration.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} a decision-making framework for modelling containerisation of air cargo forwarding problems. The {{objective is to}} help logistics managers make decisions about how to rent <b>air</b> <b>containers</b> from <b>air</b> carriers and how to load air cargos into these <b>containers</b> optimally. The <b>air</b> carriers can provide different types of <b>air</b> <b>containers</b> with differing weight and volume limits. The problem is further complicated by the cost charged by the air carriers: {{this is based on}} a fixed cost for using the container and a variable cost that depends on the weight that the container will hold. A mathematic programming model is formulated to minimise the total rental cost while satisfying the customer's shipping requirements. The objective function in the model, however, is a non-decreasing piece-wise linear one. The model is changed into a mixed integer linear programming model by introducing two new sets of variables, and the new model can be solved by employing many mathematical programming software packages available today. The model is illustrated with a practical problem faced by a logistics company and sensitivity analysis of three different scenario...|$|R

5000|$|Refueling the {{compressed}} <b>air</b> <b>container</b> using {{a home or}} low-end conventional air compressor may {{take as long as}} 4 hours, though specialized equipment at service stations may fill the tanks in only 3 minutes. To store 2.5 kWh @300 bar in 300 liter reservoirs (90 m3 of air @ 1 bar), requires about 30 kWh of compressor energy (with a single-stage adiabatic compressor), or approx. 21 kWh with an industrial standard multistage unit. That means a compressor power of 360 kW is needed to fill the reservoirs in 5 minutes from a single stage unit, or 250 kW for a multistage one. [...] However, intercooling and isothermal compression is far more efficient and more practical than adiabatic compression, if sufficiently large heat exchangers are fitted. Efficiencies of up to 65% might perhaps be achieved, (whereas current efficiency for large industrial compressors is max. 50% [...] ) however this is lower than the Coulomb's efficiency with lead acid batteries.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Photocatalytic {{oxidation}} is {{an emerging}} technology for destruction of dilute air contaminants {{that is currently}} under commercial development, which using TiO 2 as photocatalyst. UV illumination of the TiO 2 film placed in a gaseous formaldehyde (HCHO) / <b>air</b> <b>container</b> resulted in the total degradation of formaldehyde to CO 2 and H 2 O. Despite its potential advantages, the key unresolved issues in the commercial application of photocatalytic oxidation technologies to contaminated air purification are that of optimum photocatalytic reactor design and the load of photocatalyst. In this paper, successive alternating banks of UV lamps and structured catalyst support monoliths are mounted directly in a square duct. The photocatalyst TiO 2 was loaded {{on the surface of}} honeycomb monoliths by different methods. The square duct including banks of UV lamps and structured catalyst support monoliths was put in a 4 cubic meters glass container. The polluted gas was injected into the container. The photocatalytic degradation of air contaminants was studied. The results shown that the air contaminants formaldehyde can be degraded by photocatalytic oxidation technology. The photocatalytic efficiency was different photo-initiated by UV lamps with peak wavelength at 254 nm and 365 nm. The distance between the UV lamps bank and the honeycombs monoliths was found to affect the efficient of photodegradation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>air</b> <b>container</b> renting {{and cargo}} loading problems experienced by freight forwarding companies. Containers {{have to be}} booked in advance, {{in order to obtain}} discounted rental rates from airlines; renting or returning containers on the day of shipping will incur a heavy penalty. We first propose a mixed-integer model for the certain problem, in which shipment information is known with certainty, when booking. We then present a two-stage recourse model to handle the uncertainty problem, in which accurate shipment information cannot be obtained when booking, and all cargoes have to be shipped without delay. The first-stage decision is made at the booking stage, to book specific numbers of different types of containers. The second-stage decision is made on the day of shipping, depending {{on the extent to which}} the uncertainty has been realized. The decisions include number of additional containers of different types that are required to be rented, or the number of containers to be returned, under the scenario that might occur on the day of shipping. We then extend the recourse model into a robust model for dealing with the situation in which cargoes are allowed to be shipped later. The robust model provides a quantitative method to measure the trade-off between risk and cost. A series of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the robust model in dealing with risk and uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Runtime. A runtime, like AIR, {{is a type}} of {{application}} or collection {{of application}} resources that you install on your computer for other applications to use in order to runThese applications can be either HTML/JavaScript based or SWF (ActionScript 3) based. When played in AIR, each have access to unique APIs for doing a lot more than what is capable in the browser. and identifying which file (HTML or SWF) is to be loaded into the <b>AIR</b> <b>container.</b> An AIR application cannot run without this XML file. What is AIR? AIR (code name Apollo) is a new technology by Adobe allowing web developers create Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) for the desktop. As desktop applications, your RIAs can take advantage of additional features such as access to the file system, control over application windows, and support for drag and drop as well as everything they could when played in the browser. AIR stands for Adobe Integrated Runtime. A runtime, like AIR, {{is a type of}} application or collection of application resources that you install on your computer for other applications to use in order to run. One of the main advantages of a runtime is that with runtimes installed on multiple platforms (Windows, OS X, or Linux) you can develop an application once without worrying about platform-specific programming. All of that is handled behind the scenes by the runtime. Another advantage is that applications built for the runtime will not have to bear all of the basic, redundant application weight that they would otherwise have to include in order run by themselves. Instead, all of the common application data (which, in this case, is mostly the Flash Player and the Webkit web browser) is installed with the runtime once and not necessary for individual applications keeping them small and lightweight. If you do not already have the AIR runtime installed, you can do so here...|$|E

Containers {{have to be}} booked in advance to obtain a discount rental rate from airlines, as urgent requirement or cancellation of containers {{on the day of}} shipping will incur a heavy penalty. We firstly formulate a mixed 0 - 1 integer model to determine the booking types and quantities of containers for the deterministic problem under accurate information. We then formulate a stochastic mixed 0 - 1 model to structure a dual-response forwarding system for the uncertain problem where accurate information is not available when booking. The first-stage response is to determine the booking types and quantities of containers. The second-stage response is to prepare for different scenarios that might occur on the day of shipping, including the types and quantities of containers required or returned for each scenario, and also the corresponding cargo loading plan. Computational results show that the stochastic model can provide a cost-efficient, flexible and responsive cargo forwarding syste...|$|R
