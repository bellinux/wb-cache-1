"No," [...] murmured Smither in the hall, {{where the}} air had the {{singular}} freshness of the outside day, [...] "we haven't been very satisfied with him, not <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>week.</b> He's always been one to leave a titbit to the end; but ever since Monday he's been eating it first. If you notice a dog, Mr. Soames, at its dinner, it eats the meat first. We've always thought it such a good sign of Mr. Timothy at his age to {{leave it to the}} last, but now he seems to have lost all his self-control; and, of course, it makes him leave the rest. The doctor doesn't make anything of it, but"--Smither shook her head--"he seems to think he's got to eat it first, in case he shouldn't get to it. That and his talking makes us anxious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This week," [...] Sogrange went on, [...] "it is {{expected}} that {{the result of the}} salvage works will be made known. That is to say, it is highly possible that {{the question of whether the}} Maine was blown up from outside or inside will be settled once and for <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> <b>week,</b> mind, Baron. Now see what happens. Sirdeller returns to America. The Count von Hern and Prince Marsine come to America. The Duchesse della Nermino comes to America. The Duchesse, Sirdeller, and Marsine are upon this steamer. The Count von Hern travels by the Lusitania only because it was reported that Sirdeller at the last minute changed his mind, and was travelling by that boat. Mix these things up in your brain--the conjurer's hat, let us call it," [...] Sogrange concluded, laying his hand upon Peter's arm. [...] "Sirdeller, the Duchesse, Von Hern, Marsine, the raising of the Maine--mix them up, and what sort of an omelette appears?" ...|$|E

I hear that Batsby is altogether fixed by the fascinations of Merle Park. I hope that you and Albury will receive consolation in the money." [...] Then there was a postscript.

6000|$|Carmody {{had been}} decidedly {{friendly}} <b>all</b> through <b>this</b> troublesome <b>week,</b> {{and here was}} a good place for him to say, [...] "I'll go your bail, Hans," [...] but he didn't--he couldn't.

6000|$|He {{had been}} restless <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> since {{his attempt to}} prosecute trusteeship, uneasy in his {{conscience}} which was ever acute, disturbed in his sense of compassion which was easily excited, and with a queer sensation as if his feeling for beauty had received some definite embodiment. Autumn was getting hold of the old oak-tree, its leaves were browning. Sunshine had been plentiful and hot this summer. As with trees, so with men's lives! 'I ought to live long,' thought Jolyon; 'I'm getting mildewed for want of heat. If I can't work, I shall be off to Paris.' But memory of Paris gave him no pleasure. Besides, how could he go? He must stay and see what Soames was going to do. 'I'm her trustee. I can't leave her unprotected,' he thought. It had been striking him as curious how very clearly he could still see Irene in her little drawing-room which he had only twice entered. Her beauty must {{have a sort of}} poignant harmony! No literal portrait would ever do her justice; the essence of her was--ah I what?... The noise of hoofs called him back to the other window. Holly was riding into the yard on her long-tailed 'palfrey.' She looked up and he waved to her. She had been rather silent lately; getting old, he supposed, beginning to want her future, as they all did--youngsters! ...|$|E
6000|$|This winter garden, {{fashioned}} by the Wordsworths {{out of the}} old quarry at Coleorton, during Sir George and Lady Beaumont's absence in 1807, exists {{very much}} as it was {{at the beginning of the}} century. The [...] "perennial bowers and murmuring pines" [...] may still be seen, little altered since 1807. The late Sir George Beaumont (whose grandfather was first-cousin to the artist Sir George, Wordsworth's friend), with strong reverence for the past, and for the traditions of literary men which have made the district famous since the days of his ancestor Beaumont the dramatist, and especially for the memorials of Wordsworth's ten months' residence at Coleorton,--took a pleasure in preserving these memorials, very much as they were when he entered in possession of the estates of his ancestors. Such a reverence for the past is not only consistent with the [...] "improvement" [...] of an estate, and its belongings; it is a part of it. Wordsworth, and his wife and sister, were adepts in the laying out of grounds. (See the reference to the poet's joint labour with Wilkinson at Yanwath, p. 2.) It was the Wordsworths also, I believe, who designed the grounds of Fox How--Dr. Arnold's residence, near Ambleside. Similar memorials of the poet survive at Hallsteads, Ullswater. The following is an extract from the letter of Dorothy Wordsworth to Lady Beaumont above referred to, and having the post-mark of February 18, 1807. [...] "For more than a week we have had the most delightful weather. If William had but waited a few days, it would have been no anticipation when he said to you, 'the songs of Spring were in the grove;' for <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> the birds have chanted from morn till evening, larks, blackbirds, thrushes, and far more than I can name, and the busy rooks have joined their happy voices." ...|$|E

5000|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Rae Votta of Billboard gave the episode a positive review, saying [...] "An episode with a title like “The End of Twerk” {{sounds like a}} Glee recipe for disaster, but by <b>all</b> miracles <b>this</b> <b>week</b> skirted the line of absurd, touching, and managed to advance multiple character narratives. The last is especially a feat {{in the world of}} Glee, and if the audience has to endure a little booty shaking and inappropriate Mr. Schue failures to get there, then so be it." [...] Derek Chavis of the Baltimore Sun also gave the episode a positive review, despite expecting to dislike it, saying [...] "Glee nailed tonight for the first time all season and made me feel like I was watching the show I’ve loved for the last four years." ...|$|R
