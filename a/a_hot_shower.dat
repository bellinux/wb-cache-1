2500|$|Jeremy had the {{nickname}} [...] "The Hedgehog" [...] bestowed upon him by fellow porn actor Bill Margold in 1979 after a {{situation on the}} set of the porn film Olympic Fever. Jeremy flew in from New York to shoot the movie. Expecting warm California weather, he wore only a T-shirt and shorts and brought no additional clothing. During the long motorcycle ride to the set, located near Lake Arrowhead in the California mountains, the weather deteriorated to blizzard conditions, which chilled him to the point of near hypothermia. Upon arriving at the set, Jeremy was immediately whisked away to thaw out in <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>shower.</b> When he finished, his skin had taken on a pinkish hue from the temperature extremes, and all the many hairs on his body were standing on end. Margold's comment upon seeing Jeremy at that moment was [...] "You are a hedgehog, my friend. A walking, talking hedgehog." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eleanor Gower of the Daily Mail {{thought the}} slow moving number shows Rihanna at her most vulnerable. A {{reviewer}} of The Huffington Post commented, [...] "The heartfelt ballad, from her latest album Unapologetic, {{is full of}} emotion - and the video matches that, as a stripped-down Rihanna soaks in a tub." [...] August Brown of the Los Angeles Times commented on the video saying, [...] "we kind of want to curl up in <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>shower</b> {{and have a good}} cry ourselves." [...] They continued saying, [...] "It's kind of an echo of her famous [...] "We Found Love" [...] video, with that clip's quick-cut, drugged-up frenzy of bad romance replaced with solitary, locked-off shots that feel more intimate than exploitative. She looks amazing, but the focus isn't so much her body as the look of constant devastation on her face." [...] Brown summarised the clip as being [...] "appropriately minimalist" [...] and concluded calling it [...] "a beautiful video that broaden's Rihanna's emotional-musical palette." [...] Bené Viera of VH1 commented on the video saying, [...] "Usually the tough girl posturing is a cover up for a very sensitive soul. Rihanna cut the 'I don't give an eff' attitude for four minutes of makeup free, teary-eyed, glistening wet, raw emotion in the video for 'Stay.'" [...] Sarah Flanigan of Yahoo! thought the video shows [...] "a softer side of [...] personality audiences rarely get to see." [...] She also stated, [...] "There are no gimmicks, no flashy clothes, just a very raw and emotional performance allowing her to tell this love story in her own words." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV labelled the video as [...] "perfectly heartbreaking/emotionally vulnerable" [...] and thought the [...] "baptismal effect" [...] of the video [...] "feels like a seamless transition from Rihanna's 'Diamonds' video." [...] Tamar Anitai also of MTV compared the video to Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] (2004), writing that both videos [...] "are equal parts stunning and sobering, haunting and harrowing, and both feature impossibly famous singers reflecting upon damaged relationships while inviting us into their well-designed bathrooms as they vulnerably perform their ablutions." [...] Rihanna's [...] "Stay" [...] video was also compared to and said to be inspired by Janet Jackson's [...] "Every Time" [...] video, as well as Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] video, with one critic noting [...] "Rihanna isn't the first pop star to brood in a bathtub. Janet Jackson and Britney Spears also bared their emotion immersed in water. Janet bared all in a blue lagoon for her 'Every Time' video. A little less glam, Britney's tub scene in her 'Everytime' video proved dark foreshadowing into her troubled world." ...|$|E

25|$|Mobile Decontamination System: {{with the}} NBC {{aspect of the}} {{battlefield}} in mind, the DRDO developed a Tatra vehicle based Mobile Decontamination system for decontamination of personnel, clothing, equipment, vehicles & terrain during war. The main sub-systems of mobile decontamination system are: pre-wash, chemical wash and post wash systems respectively. The pre-wash system consists of a 3000-litre stainless steel water tank and a fast suction pump. A high-pressure jet with a capacity of 3400 l/hour and a low-pressure jet with a capacity of 900 l/hour and 1600 l/hour are included. The chemical wash system is capable of mixing two powders and two liquids with variable feed rates and has a five-litre per minute slurry emulsion flow rate. The post wash system consists of <b>a</b> high-pressure <b>hot</b> water jet, <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> water <b>shower</b> for personnel and provision of steam for decontamination of clothing. The decontamination systems have been introduced into the services. The system is under production for the Army at DRDO's partnering firms, with the DRDO itself manufacturing the pilot batch.|$|R

40|$|Cannabinoid {{hyperemesis}} {{syndrome is}} characterized by chronic, heavy use of cannabis, recurrent episodes of severe nausea and intractable vomiting, and abdominal pain. Temporary relief of symptoms is achieved by taking <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> bath or <b>shower,</b> and resolution of the problem when cannabis use is stopped. Failure to recognize the syndrome leads to misdiagnoses such as psychogenic vomiting, the cyclic vomiting syndrome, an eating disorder or ‘drug-seeking behaviour’, and may lead to extensive, expensive and unproductive investigations, psychiatric referrals and ineffective treatments. Other than stopping cannabis use, there is no proven treatment. Why a substance known for its antiemetic properties should cause such a syndrome is unknown...|$|R

60|$|The attack had {{now become}} general. The firemen swarmed {{in at the}} doors and windows the moment that it was {{possible}} for a human being to breathe the smoke and live. One of the engines attached two additional lengths of hose, dragged the branch through the first floor {{to the back of the}} house, got upon an outhouse, in at a back window, and attacked the foe in rear. On the roof, Frank and Dale were plying their hatchets, their tall figures sharply defined against the wintry sky, and looking more gigantic than usual. The enemy saved them the trouble of cutting through, however, for it suddenly burst upwards, and part of the roof fell in. It would certainly have taken Frank prisoner had not Dale caught him by the collar, and dragged him out of danger. Instantly a branch was pointed downwards, and the foe was beaten back; from above, below, before, and behind, it was now met with deluges of water, which fell on the shoulders of the men in the lower floor in <b>a</b> continuous <b>hot</b> <b>shower,</b> while they stood ankle-deep in hot water.|$|R
