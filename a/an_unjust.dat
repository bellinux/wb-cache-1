5|$|Garfield {{thought the}} land grants given to {{expanding}} railroads was <b>an</b> <b>unjust</b> practice. He also opposed some monopolistic practices by corporations, {{as well as}} the power sought by workers' unions. Garfield supported the proposed establishment of the United States civil service as a means of ridding officials of the annoyance of aggressive office seekers. He especially wished to eliminate the common practice whereby government workers, in exchange for their positions, were forced to kick back a percentage of their wages as political contributions.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty of Versailles {{stipulated that}} Germany must {{relinquish}} {{several of its}} territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans saw the treaty as <b>an</b> <b>unjust</b> humiliationâ€”they especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war. The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of what he considered to be <b>an</b> <b>unjust</b> social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his {{being one of the}} first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E

The elder Van der Sloot then brought a second action, seeking monetary damages {{for himself and his}} family because of his false arrest. The action was initially successful, but the award of 40,000 Aruban florins (US$22,300) was reversed on appeal. The family's finances were depleted by the legal expenses. In January 2007, Paulus found work as a managing partner at the law firm that represented him.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Commission {{began its}} {{work and the}} {{proceedings}} were followed closely and eagerly debated by the public. As Playford did not commute Stuart's sentence, Dunstan introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment. The vote was split along party lines and was thus defeated, but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media, portraying the failed legislation as <b>an</b> <b>unjust</b> triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome.|$|E
5|$|After the Boston Massacre, Adams {{and other}} town leaders met with Bernard's {{successor}} Governor Thomas Hutchinson and with Colonel William Dalrymple, the army commander, {{to demand the}} withdrawal of the troops. The situation remained explosive, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Adams wanted the soldiers to have a fair trial, because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the victim of <b>an</b> <b>unjust</b> occupation. He convinced his cousins John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend the soldiers, knowing that those Whigs would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal. However, Adams wrote essays condemning the outcome of the trials; he thought that the soldiers should have been convicted of murder.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson's most {{immediate}} sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own {{draft of the}} preamble of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence. They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English Declaration of Rights, which formally ended the reign of King JamesII. During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights {{as a model of}} how to end the reign of <b>an</b> <b>unjust</b> king. The Scottish Declaration of Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.|$|E

5|$|Left {{without any}} family, Morales headed for Antofagasta, then a port town in Bolivia that was booming {{due to the}} nitrate mines in the area. She {{travelled}} there as a steerage passenger, with a ticket she bought by selling nearly all of her possessions. While working there, she met Santiago Pizarro, a Chilean in his 30s who made his living in a Bolivian military band, and married him in mid-1878, aged 13. He was tried and executed on 21 September of that year for killing a Bolivian soldier in a drunken brawl. She found his body dumped {{by the side of}} the railway tracks and took a gold ring from his finger, which she wore for the rest of her life. Pizarro's execution was widely protested by the mostly Chilean population of Antofagasta, which resented what was seen as <b>an</b> <b>unjust</b> Bolivian government.|$|E
