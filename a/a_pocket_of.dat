5|$|According to the 2006 Canadian census, {{there were}} 114,565 {{people living in}} the {{municipality}} in 43,241 private dwellings. 37% of households contained a married couple with children, 25% contained a married couple without children, and 22% were one-person households. Of the 32,185 reported families: 77% were married couples with an average of 3.2 persons per family, 15% were lone-parents with an average of 2.5 persons per family, and 8% were common-law couples with an average of 2.6 persons per family. The median age of Coquitlam’s population was 39.0 years, slightly younger than the British Columbia median of 40.8 years. Coquitlam had 82.6% of its residents 15 years of age or older, less than the provincial average of 83.5%. The south part of Coquitlam has <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> French speakers.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:00pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon {{returned home}} from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon {{had been trying to}} contact her by phone and text, but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon called her again, but her mobile phone rang from <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> her coat, which was still in the flat. He found that her purse and keys were also at the flat, and that their cat appeared to have been neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E

5|$|At this point, NY75 turns northeastward, {{overlapping}} with US62 into {{the nearby town}} of Hamburg along Gowanda State Road. Development along the highway quickly rises in density from a large farm and <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> homes {{at the start of the}} concurrency to a series of residential streets across the town line that make up the hamlet of Water Valley. The influx of homes brings US62 and NY75 across the main channel of Eighteenmile Creek and into the village of Hamburg, where the highway changes names to Pierce Avenue. The two routes remain concurrent for three blocks to an intersection with Lake Avenue, where Pierce Avenue becomes Main Street. While US62 continues east into Hamburg's central business district on Main Street, NY75 follows Lake Street northward along the mostly residential western edge of the village.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should {{cancel each other out}} if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E
5|$|The Saborsko Independent Company, {{consisting}} of approximately 30 personnel, {{was stationed in}} the village by the Croatian police {{the day after the}} Plitvice Lakes incident on 1 April 1991. The tensions worsened in July. That month the JNA distributed 1,000 small arms to ethnic Serbs living in Gorski kotar region, including Plaški. Skirmishes took place near Josipdol and Plaški. In June–August, Saborsko was targeted by artillery and mortars positioned at JNA barracks in Lička Jasenica, and the bulk of its civilian population fled by early August. However, approximately 400 returned to their homes the same month after 20–30 special police troops were deployed from Duga Resa to Saborsko along with 15–20 regular police drawn from Slunj as reinforcements. On 25 September, 100–200 police reservists arrived to Saborsko from Zagreb. The final Croatian reinforcements arrived in October, {{consisting of}} 20–50 police. By October, <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> Croatian-controlled territory formed around the town of Slunj south of Karlovac, on the boundary of the regions of Kordun and Lika, hampering direct communications between SAO Krajina-held areas in the two regions. The pocket was separated from the bulk of the Croatian Government-controlled territory by the SAO Krajina-controlled town of Plaški to the west. In turn, Plaški was inaccessible to the central SAO Krajina authorities as the road to Plaški ran through the village of Saborsko, situated within the Slunj pocket.|$|E

25|$|One {{scientist}} {{believed that}} the lander's thrusters splashed <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> brine from just below the Martian surface onto the landing strut during the vehicle's landing.

On the same day, the SDF reached the northeastern entrance of Al-Shaddadi, and they also advanced within 3 kilometers of Al-Shaddadi's northwestern outskirts, capturing the town of Sabaa. SDF forces also captured another 47 villages around Al-Shaddadi, and fully besieged the city. This also trapped many ISIL fighters in <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> villages between Al-Arishah and Al-Shaddadi.|$|E

25|$|The Air-Filled Rubber Membrane, so it’s called, {{uses the}} same {{principles}} as the Nozzle System to reduce cavitation in marine propellers.

This membrane builds on the lessons learned in designing the Nozzle System and uses <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> air to prevent cavitation but does not require nozzles or compressors. While {{at the same time as}} limiting the cost of operation, this membrane provides just as much protection against cavitation as the nozzles do.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, six {{companies}} of the 22nd Regiment were released from their entrenchments {{and ordered to}} reinforce the line of Union skirmishers that lay {{to the north of}} the fortifications. At 6 a.m. on the morning of July 12, these companies were ordered to advance northward. Doing so, they cleared out <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> Confederate sharpshooters that had established themselves on a nearby hilltop and who had been harassing the Union forces overnight. By 7:00a.m., the 24th regiment of the Veteran Reserve Corps arrived at Fort Kearny to relieve the remaining {{companies of}} the 22nd, which were dispatched northward as reserves for the first six companies, which had already advanced two miles north of Fort Kearny.|$|E

In this area, NY15, now Mount Hope Avenue, serves the Monroe County offices and meets NY15A at East Henrietta Road, completing the eastern alternate loop of NY15. One long block to the north is Elmwood Avenue (formerly NY47), which crosses NY15 at the southeastern corner of Mount Hope Cemetery.|$|E

25|$|A team of Hungarian {{scientists}} {{proposes that}} the geysers' most visible features, dark dune spots and spider channels, may be colonies of photosynthetic Martian microorganisms, which over-winter beneath the ice cap, {{and as the}} sunlight returns to the pole during early spring, light penetrates the ice, the microorganisms photosynthesize and heat their immediate surroundings. <b>A</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> liquid water, which would normally evaporate instantly in the thin Martian atmosphere, is trapped around them by the overlying ice. As this ice layer thins, the microorganisms show through grey. When the layer has completely melted, the microorganisms rapidly desiccate and turn black, surrounded by a grey aureole. The Hungarian scientists believe that even a complex sublimation process is insufficient to explain the formation and evolution of the dark dune spots in space and time. Since their discovery, fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke promoted these formations as deserving of study from an astrobiological perspective.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial species {{generally}} have tiny traps (sometimes {{as small as}} 0.2mm) with a broad beak-like structure extending and curving down over the entrance; this forms a passageway to the trapdoor and may help prevent the trapping and ingestion of inorganic particles. Aquatic species tend to have larger bladders (up to 1.2cm), and {{the mouth of the}} trap is usually surrounded not by a beak but by branching antennae, which serve both to guide prey animals to the trap's entrance and to fend the trap mouth away from larger bodies which might trigger the mechanism needlessly. Epiphytic species have unbranched antennae which curve in front of the mouth and probably serve the same purpose, although it has been observed that they are also capable of holding <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> water in front of the mouth by capillary action, and that this assists with the trapping action.|$|E
