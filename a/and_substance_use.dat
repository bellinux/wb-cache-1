As far as other personality disorders, NPD may be associated with histrionic, borderline, antisocial, and paranoid personality disorders.|$|E
25|$|Agoraphobia is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The condition often runs in families, and stressful events such as the death of a parent or being attacked may be a trigger. In the DSM-5 agoraphobia is classified as a phobia along with specific phobias and social phobia. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include separation anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and major depressive disorder. Those affected are at higher risk of depression <b>and</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorder.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} anxiety {{disorders}} {{is a combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a history of child abuse, family history of mental disorders, and poverty. Anxiety disorders often occur with other mental disorders, particularly major depressive disorder, personality disorder, <b>and</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorder. To be diagnosed symptoms typically need to be present at least six months, be more than would be expected for the situation, and decrease functioning. Other problems that may result in similar symptoms including hyperthyroidism, heart disease, caffeine, alcohol, or cannabis use, and withdrawal from certain drugs, among others.|$|E

25|$|Individuals {{differ in}} the way by which they metabolize substances, such as alcohol; these {{positive}} reinforcing effects are partly predetermined. Individual reactivity {{to the effects of}} substances may affect motivation to use. For example, if a person experiences strong positive (and weak negative) effects from a substance, due to their biochemical profile, their expectations of the positive effects from the substance will be heightened, therefore increasing their desire for continued use, resulting in dependence. According to this model, the experience of the positive mood enhances implicit attention to substance cues and implicit associations between reward <b>and</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
25|$|Deacon and Valentiner (2000) {{conducted}} a study that examined co-morbid panic attacks <b>and</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> in a non-clinical sample of young adults who experienced regular panic attacks. The authors found that compared to healthy controls, therapeutic alcohol and sedative use was greater for non-clinical participants who experienced panic attacks. These {{findings are consistent with}} the suggestion made by Cox, Norton, Dorward, and Fergusson (1989) that panic disorder patients self-medicate if they believe that certain substances will be successful in alleviating their symptoms. If panic disorder patients are indeed self-medicating, there may be a portion of the population with undiagnosed panic disorder who will not seek professional help {{as a result of their}} own self-medication. In fact, for some patients panic disorder is only diagnosed after they seek treatment for their self-medication habit.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of {{hepatitis}} is {{made on the}} basis of some or all of the following: a patient's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual <b>and</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy. In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes {{of hepatitis}}, the patient's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis. For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful. In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis as histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in patients with liver injury and cirrhosis.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between negative affect <b>and</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders {{has been the}} most widely studied model of addiction. It proposes that individuals who experience the greatest levels of negative affect are at the greatest risk of using substances or behaviours as a coping (psychology) mechanism. Here, substances and behaviours are used to improve mood and distract from unpleasant feelings. Once physical dependence has been established, substance abuse is primarily motivated by a desire to avoid negative affective states associated with withdrawal. Individuals high in affective mood disorders (anxiety) most commonly report high levels of negative affect associated with cravings. The {{relationship between}} negative affect and addiction is not unidirectional. That is, while positive affect increases the likelihood of initiation of substance use, the negative affective states produced by withdrawal are the most commonly reported factors for continued use.|$|E
25|$|Bipolar disorder, {{previously}} {{known as}} manic depression, is a mental disorder that causes periods {{of depression and}} periods of elevated mood. The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases. During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 3040 percent. Other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders <b>and</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorder are commonly associated.|$|E
25|$|The causes are {{not clearly}} understood, but both {{environmental}} and genetic factors play a role. Many genes of small effect contribute to risk. Environmental factors include {{a history of}} childhood abuse, and long-term stress. The condition is divided into bipolar I disorder {{if there has been}} at least one manic episode, with or without depressive episodes, and bipolar II disorder if there has been at least one hypomanic episode (but no manic episodes) and one major depressive episode. In those with less severe symptoms of a prolonged duration, the condition cyclothymic disorder may be diagnosed. If due to drugs or medical problems, it is classified separately. Other conditions that may present in a similar manner include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia, <b>and</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorder {{as well as a number}} of medical conditions. Medical testing is not required for a diagnosis, though blood tests or medical imaging can be done to rule out other problems.|$|E
25|$|Complementary and {{alternative}} medicine (CAM) treatments are the {{diverse group of}} medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that {{are not part of}} conventional medicine and have not been proven to be effective. Complementary medicine usually refers to methods <b>and</b> <b>substances</b> <b>used</b> along with conventional medicine, while alternative medicine refers to compounds used instead of conventional medicine. CAM use is common among people with cancer.|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} victim <b>and</b> {{offender}} preassault <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> on {{the outcomes of}} sexual assault incidents was analyzed. Nine hundred and seventy female sexual assault victims were identified from {{the first wave of}} a longitudinal study based on a convenience sampling strategy. Multivariate models showed that victim injury was more likely in assaults involving offender <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> (regardless {{of whether or not the}} victim was also <b>using</b> <b>substances).</b> Offender <b>use</b> of physical force and verbal threats were also related to greater odds of completed rape and injury, and force was associated with medical attention seeking. Based on this study, rape prevention programs should target men and focus on the role of <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> in sexual assault. These prevention programs should incorporate information on the roles of offender <b>and</b> victim <b>substance</b> <b>use,</b> offender aggression, <b>and</b> other situational factors in sexual assault outcomes.

2500|$|Research has {{consistently}} shown strong associations between affective disorders <b>and</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> disorders. Specifically, people with mood disorders are {{at increased risk}} of substance use disorders. Affect and addiction can be related {{in a variety of ways}} as they play a crucial role in influencing motivated behaviours. For instance, affect facilitates action, directs attention, prepares the individual for a physical response, and guides behaviour to meet particular needs. [...] Moreover, affect is implicated in a range of concepts relevant to addiction: positive reinforcement, behaviour motivation, regulation of cognition and mood, and reasoning and decision making. [...] Emotion-motivated reasoning has been shown to influence addictive behaviours via selecting outcomes that minimize negative affective states while maximizing positive affective states.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>using</b> <b>substances</b> with friends on future individual use was {{examined in the}} context of parental monitoring rules and the ecology of peer activities. A 1 -year longitudinal study design included a combined sample of North Italian and French Canadian adolescents (N = 285, 53 % girls, M = 14. 25 years). Data analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling and multiple regression analyses. As expected, the covariation between parental monitoring <b>and</b> adolescent <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> was mediated by co-use with friends. Moreover, the relation between <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> with friends <b>and</b> individual <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> was moderated by parental monitoring rules and the peer activity context. Specifically, the relation between substance co-use with friends <b>and</b> individual <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> was stronger when the level of parental monitoring rules was low and when friends spent their time together primarily in unstructured contexts such as on the street or in park settings. These findings underline the importance of adults’ use of rules to monitor adolescents prone to <b>substance</b> <b>use,</b> <b>and</b> the role of context in facilitating or reducing peer influence...|$|R

2500|$|The disease {{model of}} {{addiction}} has long contended the maladaptive patterns of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use</b> displayed by addicted individuals {{are the result}} of a lifelong disease that is biological in origin and exacerbated by environmental contingencies. This conceptualization renders the individual essentially powerless over his or her problematic behaviors and unable to remain sober by himself or herself, much as individuals with a terminal illness are unable to fight the disease by themselves without medication. Behavioral treatment, therefore, necessarily requires individuals to admit their addiction, renounce their former lifestyle, and seek a supportive social network who can help them remain sober. Such approaches are the quintessential features of Twelve-step programs, originally published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous in 1939. These approaches have met considerable amounts of criticism, coming from opponents who disapprove of the spiritual-religious orientation on both psychological and legal [...] grounds. Nonetheless, despite this criticism, outcome studies have revealed that affiliation with twelve-step programs predicts abstinence success at 1-year follow-up for alcoholism. Different results have been reached for other drugs, with the twelve steps being less beneficial for addicts to illicit substances, and least beneficial to those addicted to the physiologically and psychologically addicting opioids, for which maintenance therapies are the gold standard of care.|$|E
2500|$|The Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI) is a {{behavioral}} rating checklist created by Dr. Kenneth Gadow and Dr. Joyce Sprafkin that assesses {{a range of}} behaviors related to common emotional and behavior disorders identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM), including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, major depressive episode, mania, dysthymic disorder (now pervasive depressive disorder in DSM-5), schizophrenia, autistic spectrum disorder, anorexia, and bulimia. In addition, one or two key symptoms {{of each of the}} following disorders are also included: obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, panic attack, motor tics, vocal tics, <b>and</b> <b>substance</b> <b>use.</b> [...] CASI combines the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI) and the Adolescent Symptom Inventory (ASI), letting it apply to both children and adolescents ages 5 to 18. The CASI is a self-report questionnaire completed by the child's caregiver or teacher to detect signs of psychiatric disorders in multiple settings. Compared to other widely used checklists for youths, the CASI maps more closely to DSM diagnoses, with scoring systems that map to the diagnostic criteria as well as providing a severity score. Other measures {{are more likely to have}} used statistical methods, such as factor analysis, to group symptoms that often occur together; if they have DSM-oriented scales, they are often later additions that only include some of the diagnostic criteria. It is not yet clear scientifically whether a statistical or DSM-oriented approach is more useful at a clinical level. The CASI provides a low burden way of gathering a lot of information quickly about common problems, helping the clinician and family decide where to focus attention during interviews and treatment.|$|E
