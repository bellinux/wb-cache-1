5|$|Many {{examples}} of rock art by the Muisca {{have been discovered}} on the Altiplano. The first rock <b>art</b> <b>has</b> been discovered by conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada during the Spanish conquest of the Muisca. The rock art consists of petroglyphs (carvings) and petrographs (drawings). The petrographs were made using the index finger. Pioneer {{in the study of}} the rock <b>art</b> <b>has</b> been Miguel Triana. Later contributions have been done by Diego Martínez, Eliécer Silva Celis and others. It is theorised that the rock <b>art</b> <b>has</b> been made under the influence of ayahuasca (yahé).|$|E

5|$|<b>Art</b> <b>has</b> {{sometimes}} {{stimulated the}} development of mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research {{that led to the}} work of Brook Taylor and Johann Heinrich Lambert on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing, and ultimately to the mathematics of projective geometry of Girard Desargues and Jean-Victor Poncelet.|$|E

5|$|Taoist {{literature}} and <b>art</b> <b>has</b> influenced {{the cultures of}} Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.

Data collected in 2010 for religious demographics of Hong Kong and Singapore show that, respectively, 14% and 11% of the people of these cities identify as Taoists.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} between Japanese and European <b>art</b> <b>has</b> been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which {{began to be}} exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence {{on the development of}} modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism. Famous ukiyo-e artists include Hokusai and Hiroshige. Hokusai coined the term manga. Japanese comics now known as manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide. Japanese animation is called anime. Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contributor}} to the critical oblivion was the loss of archival documents or, indeed, the artwork itself, often dismembered if not destroyed.

While a catalog of his works of <b>art</b> <b>has</b> been reconstructed within the framework of the Renaissance in Brescia, the full story still suffers from gaps and there are still events to be clarified.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} {{scarcity of}} hyena depictions in Paleolithic rock <b>art</b> <b>has</b> been theorised {{to be due}} to the animal's lower rank in the animal worship hierarchy; the spotted hyena's appearance was likely unappealing to Ice Age hunters, and it was not sought after as prey. Also, it was not a serious rival like the cave lion or cave bear, and it lacked the impressiveness of the mammoth or woolly rhino.|$|E
5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said that African American <b>art</b> <b>has</b> grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles {{to other forms of}} documentation. She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members of a culture that has experienced extensive negativity. In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects of the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Canadian visual <b>art</b> <b>has</b> been {{dominated}} by figures such as Tom Thomson – the country's most famous painter – and by the Group of Seven. Thomson's career painting Canadian landscapes spanned a decade up to his death in 1917 at age 39. The Group were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating the Group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston, and by commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson {{became part of the}} Group in 1926. Associated with the Group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Since the 1950s, works of Inuit art have been given as gifts to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government.|$|E

5|$|Maya art is {{essentially}} {{the art of the}} royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas. Maya <b>art</b> <b>has</b> many regional styles, and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text. The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.|$|E
5|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Blink-182. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was {{released}} on June 12, 2001, through MCA Records. The band {{had spent much of}} the previous year traveling and supporting their third album Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band's mainstream career. The title is a tongue-in-cheek pun on male masturbation ("take off your pants and jack it"). The cover <b>art</b> <b>has</b> icons for each member of the trio: an airplane ("take off"), a pair of pants, and a jacket. The album's first, limited pressing came in three separate discs reflecting each icon and containing separate bonus tracks and joke songs.|$|E
5|$|The Afrasiab {{paintings}} of the 6th to 7th centuries in Samarkand, Uzbekistan offer a rare surviving example of Sogdian art. The paintings, showing scenes of daily life and {{events such as the}} arrival of foreign ambassadors, are located within the ruins of aristocratic homes. It is unclear if any of these palatial residences served as the official palace of the rulers of Samarkand. The oldest surviving Sogdian monumental wall murals date to the 5th century and are located at Panjakent, Tajikistan. In addition to revealing aspects of their social and political lives, Sogdian <b>art</b> <b>has</b> also been instrumental in aiding historians' understanding of their religious beliefs. For instance, it is clear that Buddhist Sogdians incorporated some of their own Persian deities into their version of the Buddhist Pantheon. At Zhetysu, Sogdian gilded bronze plaques on a Buddhist temple show a pairing of a male and female deity with outstretched hands holding a miniature camel, a common non-Buddhist image similarly found in the {{paintings of}} Samarkand and Panjakent.|$|E

It has become the archetypal ballpoint pen and is considered ubiquitous, {{to the extent that the}} Museum of Modern <b>Art</b> <b>has</b> made it a permanent part of its collection. Its hexagonal form and design mimics a classic lead pencil; it is sold in a variety of colours.|$|E
5|$|The first {{forms of}} art {{recognised}} on the Altiplano are petrographs and petroglyphs in various locations on the Altiplano, mainly {{at the rock}} shelters of the Bogotá savanna. El Abra, Piedras del Tunjo and Tequendama are among the oldest sites where rock <b>art</b> <b>has</b> been discovered. The Herrera Period, commonly defined from 800 BC to 800 AD, was {{the age of the}} first ceramics. The oldest Herrera pottery has been discovered in Tocarema and dates to 800 BC. Herrera art is also represented by the archaeoastronomical site, called El Infiernito by the Spanish. On a field outside Villa de Leyva, menhirs in the shape of aligned phalluses were erected. This site, the oldest remaining of constructed art, dated at 500 BC, formed an important place for religious rituals and festivities where great quantities of the alcoholic drink chicha was consumed. The evidence for festivities at this site are from a later date, already in the Muisca Period.|$|E
