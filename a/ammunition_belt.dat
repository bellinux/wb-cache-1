25|$|The {{machine gun}} {{is defined as}} a fully {{automatic}} firearm, usually designed to fire rifle cartridges in quick succession from an <b>ammunition</b> <b>belt</b> or large-capacity magazine. The world's first true machine gun, the Maxim gun, was invented in 1884 by the American inventor Hiram Stevens Maxim, who devised a recoil power of the previously fired bullet to reload rather than the crude method of a manually operated, hand-cranked firearm. With the ability to fire 750 rounds per minute, Maxim's other great innovation was the use of water cooling to reduce overheating. Maxim's gun was widely adopted and derivative designs were used on all sides during World War I.|$|E
25|$|The {{machine gun}} is {{typically}} {{considered to be}} a fully automatic firearm, usually designed to fire rifle cartridges in quick succession from an <b>ammunition</b> <b>belt</b> or large-capacity magazine. The Gatling gun, invented and patented in 1861 by Richard Gatling during the American Civil War, was the earliest precursor to a machine gun {{in the sense that it}} had all of the underlying features of reliable loading as well as the ability to fire sustained multiple bursts of rounds, the only drawback being, it had to be manually operated and hand-cranked unlike its 1884 successor, the Maxim gun, which was indisputably the world's first true machine gun.|$|E

2500|$|His art, in {{a fashion}} similar to the steles of the Maya, tells stories. The mural En el Arsenal (In the Arsenal) shows on the {{right-hand}} side Tina Modotti holding an <b>ammunition</b> <b>belt</b> and facing Julio Antonio Mella, in a light hat, and Vittorio Vidali behind in a black hat. However, the En el Arsenal detail shown does not include the right-hand side described nor any of the three individuals mentioned; instead it shows the left-hand side with Frida Kahlo handing out munitions. Leon Trotsky lived with Rivera and Kahlo for several months while exiled in Mexico. Some of Rivera's most famous murals are featured at the National School of Agriculture [...] (Chapingo Autonomous University of Agriculture) at Chapingo near Texcoco (1925–27), in the Cortés Palace in Cuernavaca (1929–30), and the National Palace in Mexico City (1929–30, 1935).|$|E
2500|$|The LMGs built made a 44% and 43% {{reduction}} of weight (for the cased telescoped and the caseless weapons, respectively). [...] Secondary goals {{have also been}} met: the LMG {{has the potential to}} improve battlefield effectiveness (due to its simpler and more consistent weapon action, its light weight and low recoil, and its stiffer barrel); its use of recoil compensation (with a long-stroke gas-system, for example) has produced positive feedback regarding controllability; the simpler mechanism of the LMG is both more reliable and easier to maintain; a rounds counter has been integrated to improve maintainability, and the weapon is capable of accepting other electronic devices; improved materials used in the chamber and barrel have reduced heat load on the weapon; and the weapon cost is equivalent to the existing M249. [...] The standard LSAT machine gun weighs 9.4lb empty, compared to 17.6lb for a standard SAW. [...] Cased telescoped ammunition weighs 40% less than brass-cased ammo, so a 100-round <b>ammunition</b> <b>belt</b> weighs about 2lb for the LSAT, compared to 3.3lb for a brass-cased belt.|$|E

50|$|The Navy Board {{found that}} Bailey had brought an {{insufficient}} number of <b>ammunition</b> <b>belts</b> for a thorough reliability and endurance test, {{and because of}} this, they refused to officially take the weapon under consideration. They did allow Bailey to fire off as many rounds as he desired for unofficial consideration, however. The <b>ammunition</b> <b>belts</b> that Bailey had provided held 100 rounds each, and a second belt could not be loaded after a burst of fire had been initiated. The sustained rate of fire was therefore found to be inadequate for Naval requirements. Bailey did manage to demonstrate a very high rate of fire, firing off a complete 100 round belt in 6 seconds for an official firing rate of 1,000 rounds per minute.|$|R

2500|$|The Irregulars in the laneway {{opened fire}} with rifles on the convoy. Emmet Dalton ordered {{the driver of}} the touring car to 'drive like hell', but Collins said 'no, stop and we'll fight 'em' and jumped from the vehicle along with the others. Collins first took cover behind the low grass bank {{bordering}} the road but then jumped up and ran back along the road to begin firing with his Lee Enfield rifle from behind the armoured car. The Vickers machine gun in that car had also been firing at the attackers but then stopped because a badly-loaded <b>ammunition</b> <b>belt</b> caused it to jam. Apparently {{to get a better view}} of the laneway, Collins foolishly left the protection of the armoured car and moved even further back along the road. Now standing in the open, he fired a couple of shots and as he was once more working the bolt of his rifle he was shot in the head. He was the only fatality, although another member of his party suffered a neck wound. At this stage, the firing abated and the Irregulars moved away. Collins was found, face down, on the roadway. One of his men whispered an Act of Contrition into his ear, but Collins was clearly dead. He was lifted into the back of the touring car with his head resting against the shoulder of Emmet Dalton.

60|$|He {{saw to it}} {{that his}} <b>ammunition</b> <b>belt</b> {{contained}} no more than half a dozen cartridges, and then took up his rifle, handling it almost lovingly; for this, his only valuable possession, he intended to part with in order to secure what might be necessary for his father's relief and comfort.|$|E
60|$|His anticipations {{turned out}} correct; {{he was already}} some {{distance}} off {{when he heard the}} call of the sentry to the quarter-guard, followed almost immediately by a still louder shout, that told that he had discovered the flight of the prisoners; then came the sound of a musket shot, a drum beat the alarm, and a babel of sounds rang on the still air. But by this time Ned was halfway to the clump of trees, and three minutes later he was in his father's arms. There was no time to talk then. Another coat was hurried on to him, an <b>ammunition</b> <b>belt</b> and pouch thrown over his shoulder, and Captain Manners carrying his musket until he should have quite recovered breath, the five went off at a steady trot, which after {{a quarter of an hour}} broke into a walk--for there was no fear of pursuit--in the direction in which they knew Delhi to lie.|$|E
