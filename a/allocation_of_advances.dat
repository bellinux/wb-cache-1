40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the design and}} {{implementation}} of the Migol brokering framework. Migol is a Grid middleware, which addresses the fault-tolerance of long-running and compute-intensive applications. The framework supports e. g. the automatic and transparent recovery respectively the migration of applications. Another core feature of Migol is the discovery, selection, and <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> resources using <b>advance</b> reservation. Grid broker systems can significantly benefit from advance reservation. With advance reservation brokers and users can obtain execution guarantees from local resource management systems (LRM) without requiring detailed knowledge of current and future workloads or of the resource owner’s policies. Migol’s Advance Reservation Service (ARS) provides an adapter layer for reservation capabilities of different LRMs, which is currently not provided by existing Grid middleware platforms. Further, we propose a shortest expected delay (SED) strategy for scheduling <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> reservations within the Job Broker Service. SED needs information about the earliest start time of an application. This is currently not supported by LRMs. We added this feature for PBSPro. Migol depends on Globus and its security infrastructure. Our performance experiments show the substantial overhead of this serviceoriented approach...|$|R

40|$|When a {{disaster}} {{occurs in the}} United States, individuals in the impacted areas look to the local, state and federal government agencies to provide aid {{in the form of}} food, water, shelter, and other essential commodities. The responding agencies have the task of preparing their logistics networks in <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> {{a disaster}} to enable them to meet the demand for these essential commodities shortly after an event occurs. This thesis uses stochastic modeling and related metrics to answer three central questions that inform the development of a framework for applying these metrics for evaluating the disaster response capacity of a logistics network. The thesis answers the questions of (1) where should inventory be placed, considering both normal, steady-state <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> inventory as well as <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> inventory in <b>advance</b> <b>of</b> a notice event such as a hurricane, (2) how does private sector involvement change the response capacity of a logistics network, and (3) what is the impact of reduced demand for critical commodities on the logistics network's ability to respond? Two case studies are conducted on the logistics networks of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM). Results from these case studies indicate that applying stochastic modeling and the associated metrics to inform the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> critical commodities in a logistics network demonstrate measurable benefits in terms of fraction of overall demand met, time to serve a disaster affected population, and related metrics. For prepositioning decisions in FDEM's logistics network the benefits were particularly convincing. By locating stock closer to the areas predicted to suffer the greatest losses, FDEM is able to decrease the time per unit served of two critical commodities by 10 - 15 %. For FEMA's logistics network, results indicate that restructuring the terms of contract stock has the potential to increase fraction of overall demand served by 14 % within 24 hours after a disaster and 16 % within 36 hours after a disaster. by Lauren A.

40|$|Abstract – In {{the last}} two decades, we have {{witnessed}} an increasing <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> unlicensed spectra. <b>Advanced</b> modulation techniques such as OFDM and ultra-wideband, multi-access protocols and ad-hoc multihop networks have been proposed allowing heterogeneous wireless systems to co-exist in the same wireless channel. Multiple-antenna systems provide additional degrees of freedom to alleviate the requirements across these layers. As a modulation scheme in the physical layer, it improves the reliability against channel fluctuation by resolving the propagation paths and increases the data rate by creating parallel spatial channels. In the MAC layer, its interference suppression and avoidance capabilities alleviate the hidden terminal and exposed terminal problems. In the network layer, the wired cooperation among peer systems can be resembled by beamforming. As a result, multiple-antenna systems provide a cross-layer performance benefits and should be an indispensable component {{in the next generation}} wireless network. In this paper, we will incorporate antenna theory with physical channel modeling to understand the full scope of multiple-antenna systems in real environments. In particular, we will show the impact of physical environment, hardware cost and signal processing complexity on these cross-layer performance benefits and their trade-offs. ...|$|R

The combined use of both mechanisms allows effective <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> bandwidth to the set of threads, and better control of latencies.
