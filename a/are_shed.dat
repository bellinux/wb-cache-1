5|$|Elk {{range in}} forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark. Male elk have large antlers which <b>are</b> <b>shed</b> each year. Males also engage in ritualized mating {{behaviors}} during the rut, including posturing, antler wrestling (sparring), and bugling, a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females.|$|E
5|$|Some species, such as Gryllus assimilis, take off, fly, {{and land}} {{efficiently}} and well, while other species are clumsy fliers. In some species, the hind wings <b>are</b> <b>shed,</b> leaving wing stumps, usually after dispersal of the insect by flight. In other species, {{they may be}} pulled off and consumed by the cricket itself or by another individual, probably providing a nutritional boost.|$|E
5|$|The buds are {{produced}} in opposite pairs, ovoid (approximately oval in shape) and pointed, with the bud scales (the modified leaves that enclose {{and protect the}} bud) green, edged in dark brown and with dark brown tips, 0.5–1cm (0.2-0.4in). When the leaves <b>are</b> <b>shed</b> they leave horseshoe shaped marks called leaf scars on the stem.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} flooding in SE Queensland and Northern NSW in December 2010 and January 2011 {{may have affected}} {{the health of the}} fruit bats. Urine sampling in flying fox camps indicate that a larger proportion of flying foxes than usual <b>are</b> <b>shedding</b> live virus. Biosecurity Queensland's ongoing surveillance usually shows 7% of the animals <b>are</b> <b>shedding</b> live virus. In June and July nearly 30% animals have been reported to <b>be</b> <b>shedding</b> live virus. Present advice is that these events are not being driven by any mutation in HeV itself.|$|R

5|$|The {{characteristic}} {{bright orange}} bill plates and other facial characteristics {{develop in the}} spring. At {{the close of the}} breeding season, these special coatings and appendages <b>are</b> <b>shed</b> in a partial moult. This makes the beak appear less broad, the tip less bright and the base darker grey. The eye ornaments <b>are</b> <b>shed</b> and the eyes appear round. At the same time, the feathers {{of the head and neck}} are replaced and the face becomes darker. This winter plumage is seldom seen by humans because when they have left their chicks, the birds head out to sea and do not return to land until the next breeding season. The juvenile bird is similar to the adult in plumage but altogether duller with a much darker grey face and yellowish-brown beak tip and legs. After fledging, it will make its way to the water and will head out to sea and not return to land for several years. In the interim, each year it will have a broader bill, paler face patches and brighter legs and beak.|$|E
5|$|In most species, {{the sexes}} are {{separate}} {{and there is}} little sexual dimorphism, but a few species are hermaphroditic and some parasitic forms show large differences between the sexes. Some Cymothoidans are protandrous hermaphrodites, starting life as males and later changing sex, and some Anthuroideans are the reverse, being protogynous hermaphrodites that are born female. Some Gnathiidans males are sessile and live with a group of females. Males have a pair of penises, which may be fused in some species. The sperm is transferred to the female by the modified second pleopod which receives it from the penis and which is then inserted into a female gonopore. The sperm is stored in a special receptacle, a swelling on the oviduct close to the gonopore. Fertilisation only takes place when the eggs <b>are</b> <b>shed</b> soon after a moult, at which time a connection is established between the semen receptacle and the oviduct.|$|E
5|$|Mammals are {{a diverse}} class of animals, mostly {{terrestrial}} {{but some are}} aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel. The teeth <b>are</b> <b>shed</b> once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, {{as is the case}} in cetaceans. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.|$|E
25|$|Poaching of {{peacocks}} {{for their}} meat and feathers and accidental poisoning by feeding on pesticide treated seeds are known threats to wild birds. Methods to identify if feathers have been plucked or have <b>been</b> <b>shed</b> naturally have <b>been</b> developed as Indian law allows only {{the collection of}} feathers that have <b>been</b> <b>shed.</b>|$|R

25|$|Whistling {{telephone}} wires, automobile radio antennae, certain automobile front grilles, {{and smoke}} stacks are {{other examples of}} this tone. At very low Reynolds numbers, the flow around a cylinder is stable, forming two fixed vortices behind it. As the speed increases, the flow, although laminar, becomes unstable and vortices <b>are</b> <b>shed</b> alternately.|$|E
25|$|Male {{red deer}} retain their antlers {{for more than}} half the year, and are less gregarious and less likely to group with other males when they have antlers. The antlers provide self-defence, as does a strong front-leg kicking action {{performed}} by both sexes when attacked. Once the antlers <b>are</b> <b>shed,</b> stags tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to cooperatively work together. Herds tend to have one or more members watching for potential danger, while the remaining members eat and rest.|$|E
25|$|Oocysts in cat feces take {{at least}} a day to sporulate and become {{infectious}} after they <b>are</b> <b>shed,</b> so disposing of cat litter daily greatly reduces the chances of infectious oocysts being present in litter. As infectious oocysts from cat feces can spread and survive in the environment for months, humans should wear gloves when gardening or working with soil, and should wash their hands promptly after disposing of cat litter. The same precautions apply to outdoor sandboxes, which should be covered when not in use.|$|E

25|$|Vixens are in {{heat for}} one to six days, making their {{reproductive}} cycle twelve months long. As with other canines, the ova <b>are</b> <b>shed</b> during estrus {{without the need for}} the stimulation of copulating. Once the egg is fertilized, the vixen enters a period of gestation that can last from 52 to 53 days. Foxes tend to have an average litter size of four to five with an 80 percent success rate in becoming pregnant. Litter sizes can vary greatly according to species and environmentthe Arctic fox, for example, can have up to eleven kits.|$|E
25|$|A {{tracheal}} tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of taenidia in various geometries such as loops or helices. In the head, thorax, or abdomen, tracheae {{may also be}} connected to air sacs. Many insects, such as grasshoppers and bees, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are {{able to control the}} flow of air through their body. In some aquatic insects, the tracheae exchange gas through the body wall directly, {{in the form of a}} gill, or function essentially as normal, via a plastron. Note that despite being internal, the tracheae of arthropods <b>are</b> <b>shed</b> during moulting (ecdysis).|$|E
25|$|There are two {{different}} types of whistle tones - hole tones and edge tones. A hole (or 'oriﬁce') tone is produced by a fast-moving cylinder (or 'vena contracta') of air that interacts with the slow-moving anulus of air surrounding it. Instability in the boundary layer leads to perturbations that increase in size until a feedback path is established whereby specific frequencies of the resonance chamber are emphasized. An edge tone, on the other hand, is generated by a thin jet of air that strikes an obstacle. Vortices <b>are</b> <b>shed</b> near the point of disturbance in the ﬂow, alternating {{on each side of the}} obstacle or 'wedge'.|$|E

50|$|Most {{infected}} cats will shed oocysts {{only once}} in their lifetimes, {{for a period of}} about one to two weeks. Although this period of <b>shedding</b> <b>is</b> quite transient, millions of oocysts can <b>be</b> <b>shed,</b> with each oocyst capable of spreading and surviving for months. An estimated 1% of cats at any given time <b>are</b> actively <b>shedding</b> oocysts.|$|R
25|$|The cancellous part {{of bones}} contain bone marrow. Bone marrow {{produces}} blood cells {{in a process}} called hematopoiesis. Blood cells that are created in bone marrow include red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells. Progenitor cells such as the hematopoietic stem cell divide in a process called mitosis to produce precursor cells. These include precursors which eventually give rise to white blood cells, and erythroblasts which give rise to red blood cells. Unlike red and white blood cells, created by mitosis, platelets <b>are</b> <b>shed</b> from very large cells called megakaryocytes. This process of progressive differentiation occurs within the bone marrow. After the cells are matured, they enter the circulation. Every day, over 2.5 billion red blood cells and platelets, and 50–100 billion granulocytes are produced in this way.|$|E
25|$|Several {{proteins}} of the synaptic ribbon {{have also}} {{been found to be}} associated with conventional synapses. RIM (Rab3-interacting proteins) is a GTPase expressed on synaptic vesicles that is important in priming synaptic vesicles. Immunostaining has revealed the presence of KIF3A, a component of the kinesin II motor complex whose function is still unknown. The presynaptic cytomatrix proteins Bassoon and Piccolo are both expressed at photoreceptor ribbons, but Piccolo is only expressed at retinal bipolar synaptic ribbons. Bassoon is responsible for attaching itself {{to the base of the}} synaptic ribbons and subsequently anchoring the synaptic ribbons. The function of Piccolo is unknown. Also important is the filaments that tether the vesicles to the ribbon synapse. These <b>are</b> <b>shed</b> during high rates of exocytosis. The only unique protein associated with the synaptic ribbon is RIBEYE, first identified in purified synaptic ribbon from bovine retina. It is found to be a part of all vertebrate synaptic ribbons in ribbon synapses and is the central portion of ribbon synapses. RIBEYE interactions are required to form a scaffold formation protein of the synaptic ribbon.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of rabbits seem to become infected with E. cuniculi from their mothers. Infection can also occur when something contaminated by urine containing E. cuniculi spores has been ingested. Approximately {{one month after}} the rabbit is infected it begins to shed E. cuniculi spores via its urine. Spores continue to <b>be</b> <b>shed</b> for approximately 3 months, but can <b>be</b> <b>shed</b> throughout the rabbit's life.|$|R
