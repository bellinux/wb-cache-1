2500|$|Tanker 130 had {{departed}} the Minden, Nevada <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> <b>base</b> at 2:29p.m. PDT with [...] of fire retardant for its sixth drop of the day, {{and arrived at}} the fire at 2:45p.m. The crew, Steven Ray Wass, Pilot, 43 years; Craig LaBare, Co-Pilot, 37 years; Mike Davis, Engineer, 59 years, made an initial spotting pass over the drop zone, then flew back for the drop, {{which was to be}} a 1/2 salvo, dispensing half of the onboard retardant. The drop run required the aircraft to make a perpendicular crossing of a ridgeline and then descend into a valley. A video of the accident shows the aircraft crossing the ridge and then pitching down to begin its drop of the retardant. Near the end of the drop, the nose of the aircraft began to pitch up to level attitude as the descent was arrested. The nose continued to pitch up past level attitude, {{and at the end of}} the drop, the right wing began to fold upwards, followed less than one second later by the left wing. Two debris fields were found, one [...] in length and the other [...] in length. A post-impact fire in the first debris field consumed major portions of the wing and engine components; there was no fire in the second debris field, which included the fuselage and empennage.|$|E

50|$|From the {{beginning}} of Ryan <b>Air</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>Base,</b> Cal Fire and the USFS used privately owned contracted World War II vintage aircraft. The type and sizes of aircraft varied based on vendor, availability of flyable airframes and spare parts. As the years counted off and the flight hours increased these airplanes became static museum displays or were robbed for parts to keep the dwindling fleet flying. Because of the dwindling air tanker fleet, Cal Fire acquired excess U.S. Navy Grumman S-2A submarine hunting aircraft. These planes were converted from military use to firefighting aircraft using a design developed by Hemet Valley Flying Service. The first two aircraft build-ups were completed by Hemet Valley Flying Service and tested at Ryan <b>Air</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>Base.</b> The basic aircraft design has been in continuous state service since 1975.|$|E

The new tankers are S-2F3AT Turbine Tanker conversions with upgrades including constant flow 1200 gallon tanks and turbine engines allowing for better capabilities and performance.|$|R

50|$|The {{operations}} were reduced and finally discontinued due to 1) a catastrophic German <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> on the <b>bases</b> in June, 2) Soviet hostility and non-cooperation {{that began in}} August, and 3) {{the inability of the}} Americans to receive permission to use the bases for support of the Warsaw Uprising, which soured relations between the two countries.|$|R
