5|$|In 1951, {{the first}} Miss World contest (originally the Festival Bikini Contest), was {{organized}} by Eric Morley. When the winner, Kiki Håkansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. Håkansson remains {{the first and last}} Miss World to be crowned in her bikini, a crowning that was condemned by Pope Pius XII who declared the swimsuit to be sinful. Bikinis were banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy. In 1949 the Los Angeles Times reported that Miss America Bebe Shopp on her visit to Paris said she did not approve the bikini for American girls, though she did not mind French girls wearing them. Actresses in movies like My Favorite Brunette (1947) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> on a 1948 cover of LIFE were shown in traditional two-piece swimwear, not the bikini.|$|E
5|$|In June 1947, the {{military}} requirements were updated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Model</b> 464-17 met {{all of them}} except for the range. It was becoming obvious to the Air Force that, even with the updated performance, the XB-52 would be obsolete {{by the time it}} entered production and would offer little improvement over the Convair B-36; as a result, the entire project was postponed for six months. During this time, Boeing continued to perfect the design, which resulted in the Model 464-29 with a top speed of 455miles per hour (395kn, 730km/h) and a 5,000-mile range. In September 1947, the Heavy Bombardment Committee was convened to ascertain performance requirements for a nuclear bomber. Formalized on 8 December 1947, these requirements called for a top speed of 500miles per hour (440kn, 800km/h) and an 8,000mile (7,000nmi, 13,000km) range, far beyond the capabilities of 464-29.|$|E

5|$|Müllerian mimicry, {{named for}} the German naturalist Fritz Müller, {{describes}} a situation where two or more species have similar warning or aposematic signals and both share genuine anti-predation attributes (e.g. being unpalatable). At first, Bates could not explain why this should be so—if both were harmful why did one need to mimic another? Müller put forward the first explanation for this phenomenon: if a common predator confuses two species, individuals in both those species {{are more likely to}} survive. This type of mimicry is unique in several respects. Firstly, both the mimic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> benefit from the interaction, which could thus be classified as mutualism in this respect. The signal receiver is also advantaged by this system, despite being deceived about species identity, as it avoids potentially harmful encounters. The usually clear distinction between mimic and model is also blurred. Where one species is scarce and another abundant, the rare species can be said to be the mimic. When both are present in similar numbers, however, it is more realistic to speak of each as a co-mimic than of distinct 'mimic' and 'model' species, as their warning signals tend to converge. Also, the two species may exist on a continuum from harmless to highly noxious, so Batesian mimicry grades smoothly into Müllerian convergence.|$|E
5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>model</b> hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined {{together for the}} complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E
