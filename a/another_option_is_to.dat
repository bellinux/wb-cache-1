5|$|Debian offers {{different}} network installation methods. A minimal install of Debian {{is available}} via the netinst CD, whereby Debian is installed {{with just a}} base and later added software can be downloaded from the Internet. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> boot the installer from the network.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{insert a}} small pellet of {{medication}} into the urethra, but this requires higher doses than injections {{and may not}} be as effective. Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{classify}} selection by {{the life}} cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split {{the life cycle}} into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> realign the A2100 {{north of}} the junction, but this <b>option</b> <b>was</b> less {{favourable}} due to environmental concerns.|$|R
5000|$|One option favoured by Diamandi <b>was</b> <b>to</b> put the Principality {{under the}} {{sovereignty}} of the Romanian Crown (as an associated [...] "free state"). <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> link the principality to the ruling Italian House of Savoy. None of these <b>options</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> realised.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> cancel Solomon and Sheba altogether: the {{production}} <b>was</b> insured up <b>to</b> $3 {{million in the}} case of the death of one of the six lead players; Lloyd's of London covered the daily $100,000 bill while the film was halted. However, in the end it <b>was</b> decided <b>to</b> proceed with Brynner in the role of Solomon.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find {{applications}} for the isotopes in nuclear waste so as to re-use them.|$|E
25|$|A {{self-healing}} concrete {{has been}} developed that can also last longer than conventional concrete. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use hydrophobic concrete.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{sell the}} methane product as biogas. For example, biogas can be compressed, much like natural gas, {{and used to}} power motor vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|A similar {{approach}} {{had been taken}} note of by neighbourly state Kedah, where its state government is looking into the possibility of building such an infrastructure, to [...] "overcome the menace", saying <b>another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create more job opportunities for them as {{most of them were}} jobless. The state's Chief Minister Azizan Abdul Razak said: ...|$|R
50|$|First Mgr. Hoser banned Lemański from {{teaching}} religious studies in public schools. On July 7, 2013, he asked Lemański {{to leave the}} parish and move to a residence for retired priests, despite the fact he <b>was</b> only 52. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transferred <b>to</b> another parish, where he would serve as an auxiliary staff. Lemański {{did not agree with}} the decision and said that he would appeal against it. In June 2014 he was made chaplain in an institution for mentally injured children, but two months later he was suspended from the priesthood.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} used in {{the early}} days of OHC engines <b>was</b> <b>to</b> drive the camshaft(s) via a vertical shaft with bevel gears at each end. This system was, for example, used on the pre-World War I Peugeot and Mercedes Grand Prix cars. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use a triple eccentric with connecting rods; these were used on certain W.O. Bentley-designed engines and also on the Leyland Eight.|$|R
25|$|Yet <b>another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use a compose key (hardware-based or software-emulated). Pressing the compose key, then ~, {{and then}} n results in ñ. A capital N can be {{substituted}} to produce Ñ, {{and in most cases}} the order of ~ and n can be reversed.|$|E
25|$|While powered (energized), photomultipliers must be {{shielded}} from ambient light {{to prevent their}} destruction through overexcitation. In some applications this protection is accomplished mechanically by electrical interlocks or shutters that protect the tube when the photomultiplier compartment is opened. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> add overcurrent protection in the external circuit, {{so that when the}} measured anode current exceeds a safe limit, the high voltage is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{discussion}} {{has taken place}} on ways to make open-source hardware as accessible as open-source software. Providing clear and detailed product documentation is an essential factor facilitating product replication and collaboration in hardware development projects. Practical guides {{have been developed to}} help practitioners to do so. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> design products so they are easy to replicate, as exemplified in the concept of open-source appropriate technology.|$|E
50|$|When leprosy {{sanatoriums}} {{were constructed}} in 1909, the question arose concerning {{the care of}} children born to leprosy patients. In the Kyushu Sanatorium, now the Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium, healthy, non-resident relatives of the family <b>were</b> directed <b>to</b> care {{for the children of}} leprosy patients. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> allow the Tairo-in Sanatorium, or Tairoin Hospital take care of the children with funding provided by the leprosy prevention association.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{political}} attitudes prevailing {{after the end of}} the war, the Norwegian government made proposals to forcibly deport 8000 children and their mothers to Germany, but there were concerns that the deportees would have no means of livelihood there. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> send them <b>to</b> Sweden. Australia <b>was</b> also considered after the Swedish government declined to accept these people; the Norwegian government later shelved such proposals.|$|R

25|$|In San Diego, the San Diego Trolley's Blue Line {{goes from}} the San Ysidro Border Crossing, roughly along Interstate 5 to Downtown and Old Town. As the trolley travels it {{also serves as}} a means of {{transportation}} for the southern suburbs. Passengers may transfer at the 12th & Imperial station to an Orange Line trolley, serving the eastern suburbs. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> transfer at the Old Town Trolley Station to a Green Line trolley serving Mission Valley and the campus of San Diego State University.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have a head {{official}} or {{remaining members}} of the elected body appoint a new member to fulfill the vacancy. In Australia, for example, the state legislatures appoint replacements members to the Australian Senate, now done {{at the suggestion of}} the party of the outgoing senator. Before this rule, disputes over Senate vacancies contributed to the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975, ultimately resulting in a 1977 amendment to the Constitution of Australia to provide that the legislature must elect a member of the same party as the outgoing senator. Vacancies in the New South Wales Legislative Council are filled in a similar way by a joint sitting of both the legislative council and assembly.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to reduce the {{concentration}} of inclusions. In order to reduce oxide formation the metal can be melted with a flux, in a vacuum, or in an inert atmosphere. Other ingredients can be added to the mixture to cause the dross to float to the top where it can be skimmed off before the metal is poured into the mold. If this is not practical, then a special ladle that pours the metal from the bottom can be used. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> install ceramic filters into the gating system. Otherwise swirl gates can be formed which swirl the liquid metal as it is poured in, forcing the lighter inclusions to the center and keeping them out of the casting. If some of the dross or slag is folded into the molten metal then it becomes an entrainment defect.|$|E
50|$|The ND812 did {{not have}} an {{operating}} system, just a front panel and run and halt switches.The I/O facility allowed for peripherals to directly load programs into memory while the computerwas halted and not executing instructions. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> enter a short loader programthat would <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> bootstrap the desired program from a peripheral such as a teletype orpaper tape reader. Since core memory is non-volatile, shutting off the computer did not resultin data or program loss.|$|R
5000|$|Apparently {{the system}} was popular with journalists who could use the inbuilt [...] "OFFLINE" [...] type-writer mode to create and print simple ad hoc single-page {{documents}} ready for immediate faxing to HQ from their hotel lobby. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> combine the word processing and telecommunications features to create a document using the word processing software and immediately upload the document directly to either an online services such as Compuserve or indeed to another 'waiting' Access Matrix at their head office.|$|R
50|$|Fly control <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>option</b> but <b>is</b> {{difficult}} <b>to</b> implement.|$|R
500|$|The Family Edition adds parental {{controls}}. Parental {{controls are}} {{backed by a}} quality control team of 10 searching the web for inappropriate content. Found content is categorized in subject matter and placed on a blacklist of about 36,000 sites. A designed administrator can add blocked sites, however the pre-supplied blacklist cannot be viewed or edited since it is hard coded. Administrators can block certain subject matters. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> block all sites, then create a whitelist of allowed sites. Family Edition can also block transmission of specified personal information. Such information is replaced with the letter [...] "X". However, CNN noted X-rated sites are retrieved when personal information is queried by a search engine.|$|E
500|$|Yet <b>another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{create the}} UNPA as a nongovernmental {{organization}} of democratically elected legislators. This {{would have the}} advantage of not requiring the cooperation of (sometimes dictatorial) national governments or world parliamentary organizations with dictatorial members, so only democratic legislators, parliaments and countries would be represented. The World Constitution and Parliament Association and other NGOs have attempted to set up workable parliaments. Dieter Heinrich critiqued this approach by saying, [...] "If it did succeed on any scale, it would divert resources from pressuring governments on thousands of specific issues, which citizens are good at, into the operation of a pan-global institutional structure, which citizens' groups are ill equipped to do...And the resulting assembly would always be of doubtful legitimacy (who does it really represent?) and of unlikely value as an evolutionary starting point for a real world parliament." ...|$|E
500|$|Two of {{the lighter}} {{configurations}} (the Zefiro 23 and the H-25) use upper stages mounted {{on top of}} the booster. Due to the lower weight, it might have been necessary to lower the amount of fuel in a booster to ensure that the separation velocity, the flight path, and the reentry do not exceed design bounds. In the case of H-25, it might be necessary to accelerate the fly-back boosters to above [...] to help the upper stage achieve its desired orbit. Consequently, two solutions were proposed to decelerate the boosters after separation. The first option was to actively decelerate them using [...] of fuel and reduce the velocity by [...] However, launch performance would drop below that of the Vega derivative. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use aerodynamic forces to decelerate. However, a hypersonic parachute was deemed too expensive and too complex. As a result, an alternative ballute was proposed. Flight dynamics simulation revealed that a ballute with a cross-section of [...] offered the best compromise between loads on the booster and deceleration by aerodynamic forces. In this configuration, a launch performance of up to [...] could be achieved, partly thanks to a higher separation velocity.|$|E
50|$|Various {{forms of}} {{avoiding}} military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the Code of Hammurabi, {{the hiring of}} substitutes appears <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> practiced {{both before and after}} the creation of the code. Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them. With the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi.|$|R
5000|$|Yet <b>another</b> <b>option</b> would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> {{allow the}} party of the vacant member to {{nominate}} a successor, possibly subject to the approval of the voting population or the rest of the government.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{long-term}} <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use light {{instead of}} electricity for digital logic. In theory, this could run about 30% faster and use less power, and allow a direct interface with quantum computing devices.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{create a}} [...] "turn limit" [...] where if no marble has been knocked {{off the board}} by turn 15, whoever has made the most {{progress}} towards the center line wins. This encourages an aggressive strategy of moving forward and often the rule won't come into play.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use a paid consultant, Independent contractor, and {{third-party}} independent testing laboratory. [...] They {{are commonly}} chosen for specialized expertise, {{for access to}} certain test equipment, for surge projects, or where independent testing is otherwise required. [...] Many have certifications and accreditations: [...] ISO 9000, ISO/IEC 17025, and various governing agencies.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use a {{keyboard}} layout {{that supports the}} Compose key (usually mapped to the right alt or {{to one of the}} windows keys). Then, [...] "compose-u u" [...] will combine the character u with the breve, and [...] "compose-shift-6 s" [...] will combine the character s with the circumflex (assuming [...] "shift-6" [...] is the position of the caret).|$|E
50|$|Finally, <b>another</b> viable <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} {{tax credits}} for low and medium income families. Currently, President Barack Obama has outlined a plan to triple the child tax care credit to $3,000 per young child.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> arm and man decoy {{ships with}} hidden guns, the {{so-called}} Q-ship. A variant {{on the idea}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> equip small vessels with a submarine escort. In 1915, three U-boats were sunk by Q-ships, and two more by submarines accompanying trawlers. In June also [...] was sunk by [...] while attacking Taranaki, and in July U-23 was sunk by C-27 attacking Princess Louise. Also in July U-36 was sunk by the Q-ship Prince Charles, and in August and September [...] and [...] were sunk by Baralong, the former in the notorious Baralong Incident.|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{relocate}} to Anaheim, in the Greater Los Angeles area. The Houston Rockets had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season, with Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now Honda Center) {{as the home}} venue. However, the NHL team then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had an agreement that any other tenant at the Pond should share revenues with their then-owner, The Walt Disney Company, although Disney stated they <b>were</b> willing <b>to</b> negotiate the terms. There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles, the Lakers and the Clippers, which would make the media market small and limit revenue.|$|R
