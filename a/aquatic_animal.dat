5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros {{were more likely to}} be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they {{were more likely to be}} artefacts at the end of their usable life. <b>Aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Each carving {{receives}} a special name, and common motifs are {{animals and plants}} that symbolise some virtue. For example, water plants and animals, such as crabs, tadpoles and water weeds, are commonly found to symbolise fertility. In some areas noble elders claim these symbols refer to strength of noble family, but not everyone agrees. The overall meaning of groups of carved motifs on houses remains debated and tourism has further complicated these debates because some feel a uniform explanation must be presented to tourists. The image to the left shows an example of Torajan wood carving, consisting of 15 square panels. The center bottom panel represents buffalo or wealth, a wish for many buffaloes for the family. The center panel represents a knot and a box, a hope {{that all of the}} family's offspring will be happy and live in harmony, like goods kept safe in a box. The top left and top right squares represent an <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal,</b> indicating the need for fast and hard work, just like moving on the surface of water. It also represents the need for a certain skill to produce good results.|$|E

500|$|The {{first known}} mermaid stories {{appeared}} in Assyria c. 1000 BC. [...] The goddess Atargatis, mother of Assyrian queen Semiramis, loved a mortal (a shepherd) and unintentionally killed him. Ashamed, she jumped into a lake {{and took the}} form of a fish, but the waters would not conceal her divine beauty. Thereafter, she {{took the form of}} a mermaid— human above the waist, fish below— although the earliest representations of Atargatis showed her as a fish with a human head and arm, similar to the Babylonian god Ea. The Greeks recognized Atargatis under the name Derketo. Sometime before 546 BC, Milesian philosopher Anaximander postulated that mankind had sprung from an <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> species. He thought that humans, who begin life with prolonged infancy, could not have survived otherwise.|$|E
500|$|In 1905, Alfred Grandidier's son, Guillaume Grandidier, {{reviewed}} subfossil lemur taxonomy {{and determined}} that too many names had been created. [...] His review established most of the presently known family and genera names for the extinct lemurs. Despite the taxonomic clarification, subfossil postcrania from different genera, particularly Megaladapis, Palaeopropithecus and Hadropithecus, continued to be incorrectly paired and sometimes assigned to non-primates. Since subfossil remains were often dredged from marshes one by one, pairing skulls with other bones was often guesswork based on size-matching, and was not very accurate as a consequence. Even {{as late as the}} 1950s, bones of non-primates were attributed to subfossil lemurs. One reconstruction of the confounded subfossil remains by paleontologist Herbert F. Standing depicted Palaeopropithecus as an <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> that swam near the surface, keeping its eyes, ears, and nostrils slightly above water. Postcranial remains of Palaeopropithecus had previously been paired with Megaladapis by Guillaume Grandidier, who viewed it as a giant tree sloth, which he named Bradytherium. [...] Standing's aquatic theory was supported by Italian paleontologist Giuseppe Sera, who reconstructed Palaeopropithecus as an [...] "arboreal-aquatic acrobat" [...] that not only swam in water but climbed trees and dove from there into the water. [...] Sera took the aquatic theory further in 1938 by including other extinct lemurs, including Megaladapis, which he viewed as a thin ray-like swimmer that fed on mollusks and crustaceans while concealed underwater. It was primarily the paleontologist Charles Lamberton who correctly paired many of the confused subfossils, although others had also helped address problems of association and taxonomic synonyms. [...] Lamberton also refuted Guillaume Grandidier's sloth theory for Megaladapis, as well as the aquatic lemur theory of Standing and Sera.|$|E

"Now," [...] {{says the}} Examiner, [...] "suppose, for instance, the gills of an <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> {{converted}} into lungs, while instinct still compelled a continuance under water, would not drowning ensue?" [...] No doubt. But--simply contemplating the facts, instead of theorizing--we notice that young frogs do not keep their heads under water after ceasing to be tadpoles. The instinct promptly changes with the structure, without supernatural interposition--just as Darwin would have it, if {{the development of}} a variety or incipient species, though rare, were as natural as a metamorphosis.|$|E
60|$|In {{many cases}} we {{are far too}} ignorant to be enabled to assert that a part or organ is so {{unimportant}} {{for the welfare of}} a species, that modifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated by means of natural selection. In many other cases, modifications are probably the direct result of the laws of variation or of growth, independently of any good having been thus gained. But even such structures have often, as we may feel assured, been subsequently taken advantage of, and still further modified, for the good of species under new conditions of life. We may, also, believe that a part formerly of high importance has frequently been retained (as the tail of an <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> by its terrestrial descendants), though it has become of such small importance that it could not, in its present state, have been acquired by means of natural selection.|$|E

60|$|We {{are far too}} ignorant, {{in almost}} every case, to be enabled to assert that any part or organ is so {{unimportant}} {{for the welfare of}} a species, that modifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated by means of natural selection. But we may confidently believe that many modifications, wholly due to the laws of growth, and at first in no way advantageous to a species, have been subsequently taken advantage of by the still further modified descendants of this species. We may, also, believe that a part formerly of high importance has often been retained (as the tail of an <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> by its terrestrial descendants), though it has become of such small importance that it could not, in its present state, have been acquired by natural selection,--a power which acts solely by the preservation of profitable variations in the struggle for life.|$|E
60|$|Organs now of trifling {{importance}} {{have probably}} {{in some cases}} been of high importance to an early progenitor, and, after having been slowly perfected at a former period, have been transmitted in nearly the same state, although now become of very slight use; and any actually injurious deviations in their structure will always have been checked by natural selection. Seeing how important an organ of locomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals, its general presence and use for many purposes in so many land animals, which in their lungs or modified swim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may perhaps be thus accounted for. A well-developed tail having been formed in an <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal,</b> it might subsequently come to be worked in {{for all sorts of}} purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ of prehension, or as an aid in turning, as with the dog, though the aid must be slight, for the hare, with hardly any tail, can double quickly enough.|$|E
60|$|The {{remains of}} these nine great quadrupeds and many {{detached}} bones were found embedded on the beach, within {{the space of}} about 200 yards square. It is a remarkable circumstance that so many different species should be found together; and it proves how numerous in kind the ancient inhabitants of this country must have been. At the distance of about thirty miles from Punta Alta, in a cliff of red earth, I found several fragments of bones, some of large size. Among them were the teeth of a gnawer, equalling in size and closely resembling those of the Capybara, whose habits have been described; and therefore, probably, an <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal.</b> There was {{also part of the}} head of a Ctenomys; the species being different from the Tucutuco, but with a close general resemblance. The red earth, like that of the Pampas, in which these remains were embedded, contains, according to Professor Ehrenberg, eight fresh-water and one salt-water infusorial animalcule; therefore, probably, it was an estuary deposit.|$|E
