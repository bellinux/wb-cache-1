5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds <b>and</b> <b>sacred</b> sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century both choral and organ musical {{components}} {{developed to}} a high standard and were integral to the liturgy at St James'. In addition, music was offered to the wider community {{in the form of}} recitals, often in ways that elucidate the liturgy and take advantage of church acoustics <b>and</b> <b>sacred</b> settings. Weekday recitals, such as the organ recitals given in 1936 of music by Bach, continued in addition to the music played on Sundays.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the related but different {{concepts of the}} uncanny <b>and</b> the <b>sacred.</b> Drawing on two cases - one fictional and one real - and using Zizek 2 ̆ 7 s Symbolic-Real-Imaginary as an organising frame, the paper analyses how the uncanny <b>and</b> the <b>sacred</b> are connected. It then proceeds to examine the role of theorising in sacralising the uncanny <b>and</b> profaning the <b>sacred.</b> Finally, it briefly discusses how theory might be re-enchanted...|$|R

5|$|Formerly {{known as}} the all-boys St. Procopius College and Academy, the school began to offer a {{remedial}} course, or a course designed to bring underprepared students to competency, to only two students on March 2, 1887. Enrollment grew to 30 high school students by 1947. The academy began to operate independently from the college in 1957. The all-girls Sacred Heart Academy, founded in 1926, operated nearby. Due to dwindling enrollment and funding, St. Procopius Academy <b>and</b> <b>Sacred</b> Heart Academy merged in 1967 to form Benet Academy.|$|E
5|$|The first Catholic chapel {{was built}} in Bedford {{on the corner of}} Mather Lane and Chapel Street in 1778 and this lasted until it was {{replaced}} in 1855 by St Joseph's Church by architect Joseph Hansom. A growing Catholic population in the area led to the building of Our Lady of the Rosary in Plank Lane in 1879, Twelve Apostles in 1879 <b>and</b> <b>Sacred</b> Heart in 1929. Other denominations catered for include Wesleyan, Independent, Primitive, Welsh and United Methodists. There are also Unitarian, Baptist and Jehovah's Witness places of worship in the town.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} population was originally animist, {{but while the}} fetishes <b>and</b> <b>sacred</b> groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% {{of the population of}} Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim.|$|E

5|$|Mellor's {{works have}} been {{included}} in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award on several occasions, in 2000, 2001, and every year from 2003 to 2010. In 2003, his mezzotint print Cyathea cooperi, portraying tree ferns native to the Queensland rainforest, was highly commended. Subsequent entries have included Of fragile dreams the heart which nevermore in 2005, Untitled (Ernie Grant in Blackman Street) in 2006, Exotic lies <b>and</b> <b>sacred</b> ties (the heart that conceals, the tongue that never reveals) in 2008, and A Transcendent Vision (of life, death and resurrection) in 2010. Reviewing the 2008 exhibition, academic Sarah Scott expressed surprise that Mellor's 2008 piece had neither attracted an award nor been purchased for the Northern Territory's public collection.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators include wading birds, such as reef egrets, white-faced herons, white ibises and swamp harriers. Other predators include snakes, skinks, red foxes, tortoises, and eels {{and other}} fish, such as redfin perch and European carp, several {{varieties}} of gudgeon, {{and a range}} of invertebrate predators, such as the large brown mantis. Predation on adult frogs has been recorded for the red-bellied black snake, tiger snake, laughing kookaburra, <b>and</b> <b>sacred</b> kingfisher; wading birds and other snakes, such as the green tree snake and the copperhead snake, are also believed to be predators of the frog. The relative magnitude of the various predatorial threats to the frog and its tadpoles is not known. Before the frog became rare, and when subsistence lifestyles were more common, it was hunted and eaten by Australian Aborigines. It was also used in dissection demonstrations in biology classes, and caught by humans for feeding pet reptiles.|$|E

5|$|The Maya {{world was}} {{populated}} {{by a great}} variety of deities, supernatural entities <b>and</b> <b>sacred</b> forces. The Maya had such a broad interpretation of what was sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate. The Maya interpretation of deities was intrinsically tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmovision. The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering. Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour. They also had a dual day-night/life-death aspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{first school}} in Atherton was Chowbent Grammar School founded before 1654 and {{followed}} by Chowbent Chapel School in 1734. Lane Top National School opened in 1840 and Chowbent Unitarian School and Hindsford St Anne's in 1860. Howe Bridge School opened in 1869 and St Philip's a year later. An undenominational school in Lee Street opened in 1871 followed by St George's <b>and</b> <b>Sacred</b> Heart School in Hindsford in 1873. In the 1890s, the technical school originally opened as a school for science and art, followed by St Richard's in 1891 and Flapper Fold Higher Grade School in 1893. Green Hall Special School opened in 1957, and a new infant school was opened on Lodge Lane for Sacred Heart. Meadowbank Primary School {{can also be found}} on Flapper Fold Lane, marking the boundary between Atherton and Hag Fold. Hesketh Fletcher Senior School opened in 1967 and closed on 31 August 2011.

5|$|While {{the other}} three grand pre-Columbian civilisations—the Maya, Aztec and Inca—are known for their grand {{architecture}} {{in the form of}} pyramids, stelae, stone cities and temples, the modest Muisca architecture has left very little traces in the present. The houses (called bohíos or malokas) and temples of the people, where spiritual gatherings took place honouring the gods and sacrificing tunjos, emeralds and children, were made of degradable materials such as wood, clay and reed. The circular structures were built on top of slightly elevated platforms to prevent them from flooding on the frequently inundated plains; small settlements of ten to one hundred houses were surrounded by wooden poles forming an enclosure, called ca in Muysccubun. Two or more gates gave entrance to the villages. The houses and temples themselves were built around a central pole of wood attached to the roof; the temples were constructed using the wood of Guaiacum officinale tree, giving high quality construction. The floors of the open spaced houses were covered with straw or, for the caciques, with ceramic floors. Cloths were attached to the roof and painted with red and black colours. The houses <b>and</b> <b>sacred</b> places were adorned with tunjos and emeralds, and in some cases with the remains of human sacrifices.|$|E
