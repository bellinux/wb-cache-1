At the angles of incidence at which these derivatives are large, errors due to beam deviation and errors due to the use of noncollimated light or due to the use of specimens with rough or irregular surfaces can be significant.

In addition several concepts of reflow soldering configuration were realized. In the first iteration a system with only the alignment of the yaw angle was implemented.

40|$|New color-measuring {{instruments}} {{known as}} multiangle spectrophotometers have been recently created {{to measure and}} characterize the goniochromism of special-effect pigments in many materials with a particular visual appearance (metallic, interference, pearlescent, sparkle, or glitter). These devices measure the gonioapparent color from the spectral relative reflectance factor and the L*a*b* values of the sample with different illumination and observation angles. These angles usually coincide with requirements marked in American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Deutsches Institut Für Normung standards relating to the gonioapparent color, but the results of comparisons between these instruments are still inconclusive. Therefore, {{the main purpose of}} this study is to compare several multiangle spectrophotometers at a reproducibility level according to ASTM E 2214 - 08 guidelines. In particular, we compared two X-Rite multi-gonio spectrophotometers (MA 98 and MA 68 II), a Datacolor multi-gonio spectrophotometer (FX 10), and a BYK multi-gonio spectrophotometer (BYK-mac). These instruments share only five common measurement geometries: 45 ° × − 30 ° (as 15 °), 45 ° × − 20 ° (as 25 °), 45 ° × 0 ° (as 45 °), 45 ° × 30 ° (as 75 °), 45 ° × 65 ° (as 110 °). Specific statistical studies were used for the reproducibility comparison, including a Hotelling test and a statistical intercomparison test to determine the confidence interval of the partial color differences ΔL*, Δa*, Δb*, and the total color difference ΔE*ab. This was conducted using a database collection of 88 metallic and pearlescent samples that were measured 20 times without the replacement of all the instruments. The final findings show that in most measurement geometries, the reproducibility differences between pairs of instruments are statistically significant, although in general, there is a better reproducibility level at certain common geometries for newer instruments (MA 98 and BYK-mac). This means that these differences are due to systematic or bias errors (<b>angle</b> <b>tolerances</b> for each geometry, photometric scales, white standards, etc.), but not exclusively to random errors.

New {{instruments}} named multi-gonio-spectrophotometers {{have appeared}} {{to measure and}} characterize the goniochromatism of special materials like metallic, interference, luster and pearlescent samples. These devices are instruments what can measure the spectrum of the sample with different illumination and observation angles, these angles usually agree with some requirements marked in ASTM and DIN standards related to the gonio colour appearance characterization. On the other hand, the inter-comparison between spectrophotometers, both at repeatability and reproducibility levels, has usually appeared in many contributions in last years. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to compare at reproducibility level two multi-gonio-spectrophotometers according to the ASTM E 2214 - 08 guidelines: one of them, with 5 measurement (directional) geometries, highly recommended by the automotive industry, while the other one is a bench-top instrument, with 10 measurement geometries. Therefore, they only have 5 common measurement geometries: 45 ºx 120 º, 45 ºx 110 º, 45 ºx 90 º, 45 ºx 60 º, and 45 ºx 25 º. For the reproducibility comparison we will also make some statistical studies that include a Hotelling’s test and a statistical test of inter-comparison to know the confidence interval of the partial colour differences ΔL*, Δa*, Δb* and the total colour difference ΔEab. It is done using as database a collection of 91 metallic, interference, luster and pearlescent samples, which were measured 20 times without replacement for both instruments. The final findings show that except the 45 ºx 120 º geometry, which is the nearest to specular direction, the reproducibility differences between both instruments are statistically significant. This means that these differences are due to systematic or bias errors (<b>angle</b> <b>tolerances</b> for each geometry, photometric scales, white standards, etc), but not exclusively to random errors.

However, the fallibility of the tracker in such systems has hindered their practical application {{for more than twenty}} years. The tracker is indispensable for a CPVS since only normal-incident sunlight can be focused on the solar cell chips, even a slight deviation of incident light will result in a significant loss of solar radiation, and hence a distinct decrease in electricity output. Generally, the more accurate the tracker is, the more reliable the system is. However, it is not exactly the case for a CPVS reliability, because the more accurate the tracker is, the better environment it demands. A CPVS is usually has to subjected to harsh environmental conditions, such as strong wind, heavy rain or snow, and huge changes of temperature, which leads to the invalidation of the system's high-accuracy tracker. Hence, the reliability of a CPVS cannot be improved only by enhancing the tracker's accuracy.

Microstrip patch antennas are well known to have positive features for cost-effective, low profile and broadband. This type of antenna can be used in wide range of applications such as in wireless communications, radar systems, and satellites. Inhibiting characteristics of single patch antenna with low gain and narrow band leads to the research area to have array configuration. Beam steering antennas are the ideal solution for various systems such as traffic control and collision avoidance radar systems. The goal of this work is to design and implement a dual-linear polarization stacked microstrip patch phased array antenna. Single stacked microstrip patch antenna fed by microstrip line was designed to have approximately 3 GHz bandwidth in X-band with another ground plane to form a stripline-fed. Stripline-fed design protects feed lines from any outside effects. The array configuration was adapted to design in order to accomplish beam scan angle of /- 30 degrees by /- 15 degrees. Binomial power distribution of 3 x 2 array structure was used in order to reduce grating lobes, and changing length of feed lines was implemented for phase shifting. Bowtie cross shape aperture and dual-offset microstrip feedline was used to feed radiating patches. For the feed network, T-split power divider was implemented and optimized to achieve low loss. The length of microstrip line was adjusted to meet desired phase shift that in wideband application, the length of the line had to be long enough to have similar wavelength response over broad frequency range. The antenna array was designed using standard equations and simulated by electromagnetic analysis software called Zealand's IE 3 D which is method-of-moments based simulator. The resulting measured impedance bandwidth and gain of both microstrip and stripline-fed single antenna are 43 percent and 5 to 10 dBi with low cross polarizations for all frequencies.
