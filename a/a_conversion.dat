5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|After a short gain {{on first}} down, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 13-yard pass to fullback Brian Edmonds. The play {{resulted in a}} first down at the Tech 34-yard line. Two short plays resulted in six yards, setting up a third down and four yards. Rather than attempt <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> prior {{to the end of}} the quarter, the Hokies let the clock roll down with the Longhorns in the lead, 70.|$|E
5|$|Around 1749, Priestley became {{seriously ill}} and {{believed}} he was dying. Raised as a devout Calvinist, he believed <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> experience was necessary for salvation, but doubted he had had one. This emotional distress eventually led him to question his theological upbringing, causing him to reject election and to accept universal salvation. As a result, the elders of his home church, the Independent Upper Chapel of Heckmondwike, refused him admission as a full member.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> loft <b>conversion</b> or <b>an</b> attic <b>conversion</b> is {{the process}} of {{transforming}} an empty attic space or loft into a functional room, typically used as a bedroom, office space, a gym, or storage space. Loft conversions {{are one of the most}} popular forms of home improvement in the United Kingdom as a result of their numerous perceived benefits. The installation of <b>a</b> loft <b>conversion</b> is <b>a</b> complicated process, and whilst it may be possible to attempt <b>a</b> 'DIY' loft <b>conversion,</b> the large amount of work involved often results in many people choosing to contract <b>a</b> specialist loft <b>conversion</b> company to undertake the task.|$|R
5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% {{by the end of the}} fourth century and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics on one end of the scale and illiterate peasants on the other. <b>A</b> <b>conversion</b> so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E
5|$|Following the takeover, HMV {{announced}} {{that they would be}} rebranding every branch of Ottakar's as a Waterstones. In July 2006, <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> programme was initiated and within four months, every Ottakar's store had been relaunched as a Waterstones and had seen the loss of 100 jobs.|$|E
5|$|In Capitalism and Freedom, {{he argued}} that {{conscription}} is inequitable and arbitrary, preventing young men from shaping their lives as they see fit. During the Nixon administration he headed the committee to research <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> to paid/volunteer armed force. He would later state that his role in eliminating the conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment. Friedman did, however, believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time.|$|E

5|$|Iridium {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> target, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.|$|E
5|$|Later in the year, on 15August, he {{took part}} in a Ranfurly Shield challenge, which {{resulted}} in a heavy 24–3 defeat for Wellington at the hands of Auckland. The challengers, away to Auckland, were the underdogs but it was expected to be a close game, and at half-time Auckland were just leading by <b>a</b> <b>conversion,</b> 5–3. In the second half, Auckland's forwards imposed themselves on Wellington, who struggled to maintain the pace and were unable to respond to Auckland's scoring.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game, Tennessee coach Fulmer {{pronounced}} himself unsatisfied {{with the}} Vols' performance in opponents' red zone {{during the regular}} season. Tennessee scored on just 36 of 52 possessions inside the opposition's 20-yard line, <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> rate of 69.2 percent. Fulmer vowed to raise that percentage to {{what it had been}} the previous season, when Tennessee converted 41 of 46 possessions, or 89.1 percent.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{a person}} may forgo <b>a</b> formal <b>conversion</b> to Judaism and adopt some or all beliefs and {{practices}} of Judaism. However, without <b>a</b> formal <b>conversion,</b> many highly observant Jews will reject a convert's Jewish status.|$|R

5|$|So far {{during this}} period, Leeds has seen much development, {{particularly}} in the city centre, most notably the highrise developments such as Bridgewater Place, the developments around Clarence Dock, K2 (albeit <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> from an older building) {{as well as many}} developments incorporating student accommodation. The 2002 redevelopment of Leeds railway station incorporated a notable steel and glass roof covering the main platform hall and providing panoramic views to the south west from the mezzanine level.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw {{additional}} renovations. The auditor's {{office and}} the mayor’s office were both renovated, though work on the mayor's office halted when funds were exhausted. The city expanded {{the office of the}} city's attorney, and in 1982 the Portland Building was finished across the street. This allowed the city to move many city offices into a single location. Work was also completed on the exterior, while a new roof was finished. In 1985, the building began <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> from steam heating.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{professional}} {{board for}} accountants is the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe (ICAZ) with direct relationships with similar bodies in South Africa, Canada, the UK and Australia. A qualified Chartered Accountant from Zimbabwe {{is also a}} member of similar bodies in these countries after writing <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> paper. In addition, Zimbabwean-trained doctors only require one year of residence to be fully licensed doctors in the United States. The Zimbabwe Institution of Engineers (ZIE) is the highest professional board for engineers.|$|E

For the next 30 years, the brigade would continue as a Reserve unit in inactive status and would never be called on to participate in any conflicts. In 1997, the brigade was withdrawn from the Reserve and activated in the Regular Army at Fort Drum, New York, before being inactivated two years later.|$|E
5|$|After a {{succession}} of counterattacks, {{toward the end of}} August the Libyans finally drove the 400 Chadian soldiers out of the town. This victory–the first by Libyan ground forces {{since the start of the}} Toyota War–was apparently achieved through close-range air strikes, which were followed by ground troops advancing cross-country in jeeps, Toyota all-terrain trucks, and light armored vehicles. For the Libyans, who had previously relied on ponderous tracked armour, the assault represented <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> to the desert warfare tactics developed by FANT. To highlight the victory, Gaddafi flew foreign journalists to the region, so the news of his victory could reach the headlines.|$|E
5|$|As with X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter was {{initially}} {{developed for the}} CP System II arcade system board. The game debuted in Japanese and North American arcades in 1997. The game received a port to the Sega Saturn, exclusive to Japan, on October 22, 1998. The Sega Saturn port supported the 4MB RAM expansion peripheral, allowing the developers to create <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> which retained the original frame rates and tag team system. The game was then ported to the PlayStation in February 1999. Due to the console's limited RAM capacity, the tag team format was switched to the more traditional round format used in other fighting game series, such as Street Fighter. To compensate {{for the removal of}} tag team gameplay, several new game modes, such as Hero Battle and Cross Over, were implemented.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, <b>a</b> hard <b>conversion</b> or <b>an</b> {{adaptive}} <b>conversion</b> may not {{be exactly}} equivalent.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of September, Lent's squadron, 7./JG132, relocated to Großenhain near Dresden, in preparation {{and support of the}} annexation of Czechoslovakia. Lent flew a number of operational patrols in this conflict until his Staffel relocated again to Rangsdorf on 29 September 1938. After the tension over the occupation of the Sudeten territories eased, Lent's unit began <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> to the Messerschmitt Bf 108 Taifun. On 1 November 1938 III./JG132 moved to Fürstenwalde, between Berlin and Frankfurt an der Oder, and was renamed II./JG141, and Lent was posted to the 6th Squadron.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the team {{departed}} for Australia in late March they had played 74 matches in Britain, winning 49, losing 20, and drawing 5. However, due to injury, Warbrick only appeared in 14 matches; in contrast David Gage featured in 68, and eight other members played more than 50. Warbrick {{was not the only}} player to experience injury; the taxing schedule of matches took a toll, and he frequently struggled to find a full complement of 15 fit players. On top of playing relatively few matches in Britain, Warbrick scored only once there – <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> against Devon.|$|E
5|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{was first}} {{played at the}} Origins II {{convention}} in 1976, where {{it was used to}} introduce Dungeons & Dragons players to the science fiction game Metamorphosis Alpha. In 1980, TSR published the adventure, updated for first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. The adventure was not updated for later rules systems, but a Wizards.com article did provide <b>a</b> <b>conversion</b> to Future Tech. It included a separate booklet of illustrations, in both color and black and white. The adventure is an old-time favorite of many Dungeons & Dragons fans, including Stephen Colbert. It was ranked the fifth-best Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, and received positive reviews from White Dwarf and The Space Gamer magazines. The other adventures in the S series include S1 Tomb of Horrors, S2 White Plume Mountain, and S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth.|$|E
