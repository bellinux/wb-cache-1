25|$|However, {{the fifth}} episode {{received}} harsh criticism from Japanese and Western audiences {{due to its}} poor animation style compared to the previous four episodes. Dragon Ball Kai and Resurrection 'F producer Norihiro Hayashida felt that the criticism was overblown. He said that people were criticizing the entire series based on <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bad</b> sequences that were done by new animators. He {{went on to explain}} a quality decline in the anime industry that he believes is the result of studios cutting time given for post-production and not allowing for reviews of the final product.

25|$|The {{number of}} points awarded on each hole is {{determined}} based on comparison {{of the number of}} strokes taken to a fixed score, usually par. This fixed score is then adjusted in relation to the player's handicap. Once players have taken two strokes more than the adjusted fixed score, they may abandon the hole and move on to the next, as it is then not possible to score any points on that hole. Because of this, it is still possible to be competitive even allowing for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bad</b> holes. At the end of the round, the {{number of points}} scored on each hole is totaled to give a final score. The winner of a Stableford competition is the player with the highest point total. Final scores may be modified for all players using the Competition Stableford Adjustment system.|$|E

500|$|When Tillman {{spoke at}} Bennettsville, {{he was not}} widely known except as the brother of Congressman George Tillman. Ben Tillman called for the state {{government}} to do more for farmers, and blamed politicians and lawyers in the pay of financial interests for agricultural problems, including the crop lien system that left many farmers struggling to pay bills. He assailed his listeners for letting themselves be duped by hostile interests, and told of the farmer who {{was elected to the}} legislature, only to be dazzled and seduced by the elite. According to an account the next day in the Columbia Daily Register, Tillman's speech [...] "electrified the assembly and was the sensation of the meeting". Lindsey Perkins, in his journal article on Tillman's oratory, wrote that [...] "Tillman's losses in the agricultural depression of 1883–1898 forced him to begin thinking and planning economic reforms. The result was Bennettsville." [...] Tillman later stated that he began his advocacy after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bad</b> years in the early 1880s forced him to sell some of his land.

2500|$|The year 1848 saw {{the close}} of Mexican control over Alta California, this period also marked the {{beginning}} of the rancheros' greatest prosperity. The Californio rancho society before 1848 had few resources except large herds of Longhorn cattle which grew almost wild in California. The Ranchos produced the largest cowhide (called California Greenbacks) and tallow business in North America by killing and skinning their cattle and cutting off their fat. The cowhides were staked out to dry and the tallow was put in large cowhide bags. The rest of the animal was left to rot or feed the California grizzly bears then common in California. The traders who traded for the hides, tallow and sometimes horns hauled them back to the east coast where the hides were used to make a large variety of leather products, most of the tallow was used for making candles and the horns were mostly used for making buttons. A trading trip typically took over two years. The classic book Two Years Before the Mast (originally published 1840) by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. gives a good [...] first-hand account of a two-year sailing ship sea trading voyage to California which he took in 1834-5. Dana mentions that they also took back a large shipment of California longhorn horns. Horns were used to make a large number of items in this time period. (The eBook of Two Years Before the Mast is available at Gutenberg project.) A large part of the Californio diet was beef, but since there was no easy way to preserve it most of the time another animal was killed when fresh meat was needed as when visitors showed up—the hides and tallow could be salvaged and very little was lost. The market for beef dramatically changed with the onset of the Gold Rush, as thousands of miners, businessmen and other fortune seekers flooded into northern California. These newcomers needed meat, and cattle prices soared from the $1.00 to $2.00 per hide to $30.00-$50.00 per cow. From about 1848 to about 1860 the rancheros enjoyed the [...] "golden" [...] days of Hispanic California. The largely illiterate ranchero owners lost nearly all their land to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>bad</b> years for cattle in the 1860s and the many mortgages they had taken out to finance a [...] "prosperous" [...] life style and could no longer pay back. In the early years of the Gold Rush the demand for beef was so great that there are records of about 60,000 longhorns being herded from Texas to California.|$|E
