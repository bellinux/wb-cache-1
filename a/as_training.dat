5|$|Two French-made s were {{commissioned}} in 1928–1929. Both were {{captured by the}} Italians during the April 1941 invasion, after which they were put into service <b>as</b> <b>training</b> and experimentation boats under new names.

5|$|All of the RAAF's Globemasters are {{assigned}} to No. 36 Squadron and are based at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland. The aircraft have supported ADF operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and other locations in the Middle East, as well <b>as</b> <b>training</b> exercises in Australia and the United States. They have also transported supplies and personnel as part of relief efforts following natural disasters in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and several other countries. The C-17s are highly regarded throughout the Australian military {{for their ability to}} carry large amounts of cargo across long distances, and the process through which they were acquired has been identified as an example of good practice in defence procurement.|$|E

5|$|All of the inert {{versions}} {{went from}} the manufacturers directly to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, by rail, where they were used by the 216th Base Unit in flight testing of the bomb. Some test drop missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron <b>as</b> <b>training</b> exercises. The bombs intended as live ordnance were shipped to the Naval Ammunition Depot, McAlester, Oklahoma, for filling with explosives. The Composition B was poured as a slurry, solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours, sealed, and shipped by railroad to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, California, for shipment by sea to Tinian.|$|E
5|$|All three {{ships of}} the Königsberg class served <b>as</b> <b>training</b> cruisers for naval cadets {{throughout}} the 1930s. They conducted numerous cruises in European waters, and both Karlsruhe and Köln traveled to other continents. They were all modified throughout the decade, and had their anti-aircraft armament repeatedly improved, {{along with other}} alterations. The three ships {{took part in the}} non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in 19361939, and after the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, they laid a series of defensive minefields in the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|All three ships {{served in}} the Active Squadron for {{the first decade of}} their careers, which proved to be uneventful. They were {{transferred}} to the Reserve Squadron in 1905, and by the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War in 1911, they were serving <b>as</b> <b>training</b> ships. They provided fire support to Italian troops fighting in Libya during the conflict and took part in the seizure of several Ottoman ports, including Tripoli. During World War I, Sardegna was used as a guard ship in Venice, while Re Umberto served as a floating battery in Brindisi and Sicilia was reduced to a depot ship. All three ships survived the war and were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Although Tolliver had the {{confidence}} of Dan Henning, Chargers general manager Bobby Beathard and owner Alex Spanos were unsatisfied with his production during the 1990 season, and they were looking towards Friesz as the future quarterback. Tolliver was the leading man for the starting quarterback position <b>as</b> <b>training</b> camp for the 1991 season began, with Friesz battling Bob Gagliano for the backup spot. However, after training camp ended, Friesz was named the starting quarterback for the 1991 season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers.|$|E
5|$|Berlin was {{withdrawn}} from service in 1916 and disarmed. München was badly damaged by a British mine in October 1916, and thereafter decommissioned {{for use as}} a barracks ship. Hamburg was also used as barracks ship later in the war, and Leipzig became a training ship in 1917. Danzig was the last ship to leave active service, in late 1917. Of the five surviving ships, Berlin and Hamburg were retained by the newly reorganized Reichsmarine <b>as</b> <b>training</b> ships. The remaining three, Lübeck, München, and Danzig, were surrendered as war prizes to the United Kingdom, which sold them for scrapping in the early 1920s. Hamburg and Berlin soldiered on <b>as</b> <b>training</b> cruisers into the late 1920s and early 1930s; by the mid-1930s, they had again been converted into floating barracks. Hamburg was sunk by British bombers in 1944, and later raised and broken up for scrap in 1949. Berlin survived World War II and was loaded with chemical weapons and scuttled in the Skaggerak after the war to dispose of the munitions.|$|E
5|$|Both vessels were {{involved}} in the operations off Lissa in July 1866, but neither took part in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Formidabile had been damaged by Austrian coastal fortifications the day before, and had withdrawn for repairs; Terribile was ready for action, but had been preparing to attack Lissa and was too far south to {{take an active role in}} the battle. Both ships saw minimal use in the 1870s and 1880s, until both were withdrawn from service for use <b>as</b> <b>training</b> ships. Formidabile and Terribile served in this capacity until 1903 and 1904, respectively, when they were sold and broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|By 1912, {{all three}} ships {{had been reduced}} to the reserve fleet and were {{primarily}} employed <b>as</b> <b>training</b> ships. They continued in this role during World War I, training men to operate the machinery of warships and transports for the war effort. They were all decommissioned by 1920. Illinois was loaned to the New York Naval Militia and was converted into a floating arsenal. Renamed Prairie State in 1941, she was eventually sold for scrapping in 1956. Wisconsin was broken up for scrap in 1922, while Alabama was expended as a target ship in September 1921 in bombing tests with the US Army Air Service.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{participation}} in World War I, the Connecticut-class ships {{were used to}} train sailors for an expanding wartime fleet. In late 1918, they began to escort convoys to Europe, and in September that year, Minnesota was badly damaged by a mine laid by a German U-boat. After the war, {{they were used to}} bring American soldiers back from France and later <b>as</b> <b>training</b> ships. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated major reductions in naval weapons, cut the ships' careers short. Within two years, all six ships had been sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{participation}} in World War I, the Virginia-class ships {{were used to}} train sailors for an expanding wartime fleet. In September 1918, they began to escort convoys to Europe, though Germany surrendered two months later, ending the conflict. After the war, {{they were used to}} bring American soldiers back from France and later <b>as</b> <b>training</b> ships. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated major reductions in naval weapons, cut the ships' careers short. Virginia and New Jersey were sunk in bombing tests in 1923, and the other three ships were broken up for scrap later that year.|$|E

5|$|Following a career-ending {{illness or}} injury (the sources {{disagree}} on the cause), which left him in constant pain, Barbette returned to Texas but continued {{to work as a}} consultant for motion pictures as well <b>as</b> <b>training</b> and choreographing aerial acts for a number of circuses. After years of dealing with chronic pain, Barbette committed suicide on August 5, 1973. Both in life and following his death, Barbette served as an inspiration to a number of artists, including Jean Cocteau and Man Ray.|$|E
5|$|Following the Romanian Revolution, due to {{shortage}} of funds, many units were disbanded and much equipment was phased out. Likewise, Romanian military capability declined {{because of a}} lack of fuel as well <b>as</b> <b>training.</b> However, since the late 1990s, a number of positive changes have come about and the level of combat readiness is growing greatly; since 1996, the military budget has grown more than four times - rising from 636 million dollars to 2.8 billion dollars in 2007. Conscription has been abolished and professionalisation has been completed.|$|E
5|$|From 1915, both boats {{conducted}} reconnaissance cruises out {{of either}} Trieste or Pola. In January 1918, the boats were declared obsolete, but remained in service <b>as</b> <b>training</b> boats at the submarine base at Brioni, {{but at the}} war's end both boats were in Pola, After the war, both boats were ceded to Italy as war reparations and scrapped. Neither boat sank any ships during the war.|$|E
