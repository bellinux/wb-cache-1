40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{study was conducted}} with the aim to investigate whether individuals use <b>a</b> specific <b>conflict</b> strategy when they are in <b>a</b> task <b>conflict</b> or <b>a</b> relationship <b>conflict</b> in their workplace. The study also examined whether individuals experience positive or negative effects of <b>a</b> task <b>conflict</b> or <b>a</b> relationship <b>conflict</b> when <b>a</b> specific <b>conflict</b> strategy have been used. Previous research explains the effects of task conflicts and relationship conflicts at the workplace (De Dreu, 2008) Likewise lifts the effects of the conflict strategies interaction, avoidance, and power and coercion (Hoerr, 2005; Meyer, 2004; Trudel & Reio Jr., 2011). However it does not tie together what the conflicts and conflict strategies have for effects together. This also means {{that it is impossible to}} discern if there is a strategy that is frequently used in <b>a</b> specific <b>conflict</b> type. The study group consisted of 62 participants from different workplaces that responded to a survey. The results showed that the participants have experienced positive and / or negative effects when they are in <b>a</b> task <b>conflict</b> or <b>a</b> relationship <b>conflict</b> and use <b>a</b> specific <b>conflict</b> strategy. The authors could not discern whether individuals use <b>a</b> specific <b>conflict</b> strategy when they are in <b>a</b> task <b>conflict</b> or <b>a</b> relationship <b>conflict...</b>|$|R

Critics charged that Conway had <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> of interest in the matter because his father {{was a member of the}} Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made.
