50|$|The Astra-Protopopescu had a conventional, fixed {{tailskid}} undercarriage. A short V-form strut {{was attached}} to each lower fuselage longeron, joined by a cross-piece at their apexes, above which a single <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> the main wheels was rubber sprung. The wooden tailskid was also rubber sprung.|$|E
50|$|The ratchet mechanism, {{known as}} the freehub body, is still {{replaceable}} on most hubs, but forms a structural part of the hub. Cassette systems have a major advantage in that the drive-side <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> can be out near the frame, rather than being back towards {{the centre of the}} axle behind the freewheel. This greatly reduces the stress on the rear axle, making bent or broken axles extremely rare.|$|E

50|$|C 847 was not {{scrapped}} after withdrawal {{but instead}} remained at Linwood {{as a source}} of spares for C 864. This led to the NZR&LS Wellington Branch making an offer to purchase the relatively complete locomotive. This led to some disapproval from the Canterbury Branch, who had already stripped many good parts from it. The hulk of C 847 was towed to Wellington in 1974, suffering an overheated <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> along the way.|$|E
50|$|While the 2203 looked good, it was {{susceptible}} to rust, {{especially in the}} frame rails, and was unpleasant to drive in bad weather. Quality control of the assembly was also poor. Oil leaks and <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> failures were frequent. It also suffered overheating, serious vibration issues, failures of front suspension parts leading to poor handling, and high fuel consumption. On top of it all, access to the cab was difficult, despite the forward-control position.|$|E
50|$|A {{wheel is}} a {{circular}} component that {{is intended to}} rotate on an <b>axle</b> <b>bearing.</b> The wheel {{is one of the}} main components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines. Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel and flywheel.|$|E
5000|$|A {{labyrinth}} seal {{is a type}} of mechanical seal that provides a tortuous path to help prevent leakage. An example of such a seal is sometimes found within an <b>axle's</b> <b>bearing</b> to help prevent the leakage of the oil lubricating the bearing.|$|R

5000|$|Spherical {{bearings}} {{are used}} in countless applications, wherever rotational motion {{must be allowed to}} change the alignment of its rotation axis. A good example is the drive <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> of a vehicle control arm (or A-arm) suspension. The mechanics of the suspension allow the axle to move up and down (and the wheel to turn in order to steer the vehicle), and the <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> must allow the rotational axis of the axle to change without binding. While in practice, spherical bearings are not used here, it is a simple concept that illustrates a possible application of a spherical bearing. In fact, spherical bearings {{are used in}} smaller sub-components of this type of suspension, for example certain types of constant-velocity joints.|$|R
5000|$|A hot box is {{the term}} used when an <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> overheats {{on a piece of}} railway rolling stock. [...] The term is derived from the journal-bearing trucks used before the mid-20th century. The axle {{bearings}} were housed in a box that used oil-soaked rags or cotton (collectively called [...] "packing") to reduce the friction of the axle against the truck frame. When the oil leaked or dried out, the bearings overheated, often starting a fire that could destroy the entire railroad car (and cars coupled to it) if not detected early enough.|$|E
50|$|Withdrawals of {{the larger}} units accelerated, {{and by the end}} of 1979 only 22, 32, 82, 85 and 91RM were still in service. The latter two of that list were {{withdrawn}} next; 85RM suffered a collapsed <b>axle</b> <b>bearing,</b> and ran on one engine to Ballarat North Workshops; however its body condition was deemed too poor to be worth repairing, so it continued on to Newport and was stored there. 82RM was the last of the 280hp units to go, after running an 8:00 Melbourne to Woodend and return trip on 17 September 1980.|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} of locomotives plays {{a central role}} for the smooth operation of railway systems. Hot-axle failures {{are one of the}} most commonly found problems leading to locomotive accidents. Since the operating status of the locomotive <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> can be distinctly reflected by the axle temperatures, online temperature monitoring has become an essential way to detect hot-axle failures. In this work, we explore the feasibility of predict the hot-axle failures by identifying the temperature from predicted nominal values. We propose a data-driven approach based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict the sensor temperature for <b>axle</b> <b>bearings.</b> The effectiveness of the prediction model was validated with operation data collected from commercial locomotives. With a prediction accuracy is within a few percent, the proposed techniques can be used as a dynamic reference for hot-axle monitoring...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} initial {{results from}} {{a new approach to}} condition monitoring of rail <b>axle</b> <b>bearings,</b> in particular some early-stage failures. Background: premature failure of rail <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> causes a significant increase in train operating costs and can impact on train safety. Rail <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> have an anticipated service life; however, some bearings do not achieve this. A new approach to degradation diagnostics is now in use on Southeastern / Bombardier trains and provides real-time vibration condition monitoring. Each independent wireless sensor unit bolts to a wheel bearing housing. The units are self-powered by vibration harvesting. This emerging methodology has been made possible by the decreasing power budget of sensor and wireless technologies. Methods: in this initial study, real ex-situ examples of failures of bearings have been examined. The damaged regions of the bearings are examined using a suite of non-destructive techniques including optical and scanning electron microscopy, computed tomography (CT) and surface profilometry as well as traditional metallographic sectioning methods. Discussion: a new on-board condition monitoring system has made possible the examination of the onset of in-service bearing degradation, allowing identification well in advance of catastrophic destruction of the evidence. Initial results indicate that the vibration sensors are correctly identifying failing bearings. CT damage maps are allowing targeted metallographic sectioning of the samples. Correlation between vibration data and the bearing damage parameters will improve diagnostic accuracy and ultimately improve train safety<br/...|$|R

50|$|Although wheeltappers still {{operate in}} some eastern European {{countries}}, {{in countries with}} modern planned maintenance procedures and line-side defect detectors, such as hot box detectors, wheeltappers are redundant. The job is mostly associated with the steam age. Wheeltappers were vital to the smooth running of the railways as a cracked wheel or overheated <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> would lead to delays {{and the loss of}} revenue. These were particularly common in the 19th century, when axle bearings were lubricated by grease. At this time, metallurgy was a more haphazard science and thus it was impossible to test steel wheels for cracks: the role of the wheeltapper was of crucial importance.|$|E
50|$|The 1971 Salem, Illinois, {{derailment}} {{occurred on}} June 10, 1971, when Amtrak's City of New Orleans passenger train derailed near Salem, Illinois. It is {{sometimes referred to}} as the Tonti derailment, after the unincorporated community of Tonti, Illinois, which is nearer to the crash site. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the derailment was caused by a false flange on a flat wheel caused by a seized <b>axle</b> <b>bearing.</b> The crash killed 11 people and injured 163. It was Amtrak's first fatal accident since assuming control of most intercity passenger trains in the United States on May 1, 1971.|$|E
50|$|A hub is {{the center}} part of a bicycle wheel. It {{consists}} of an <b>axle,</b> <b>bearings</b> and a hub shell.

In 1934 {{he joined the}} MG works team and in the 1934 BRDC International Trophy Race at Brooklands, Handley drove well until a back axle broke late in the race. Later in 1934 he co-drove Eyston's MG K3 'Magic Magnette', but crashed on the Railway Straight when an <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> seized. It was in September 1934 that he raced an N type MG Magnette in the Ards TT in Northern Ireland in the International RAC Sports Car Race but had to retire with engine trouble. In 1934 and in 1935 he raced MGs in the Isle of Man Mannin Beg 'round the houses' event. In 1934 he led on the first lap with the MG Magnette but had a crash and retired shortly afterwards. In the following year he entered the Mannin Beg with the 745cc MGR but retired with axle failure.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} start a train and {{accelerate}} it to a given speed, the locomotive(s) must develop sufficient tractive force to overcome the train's drag (resistance to motion), which {{is a combination of}} inertia, <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> friction, the friction of the wheels on the rails (which is substantially greater on curved track than on tangent track), and the force of gravity if on a grade. Once in motion, the train will develop additional drag as it accelerates due to aerodynamic forces, which increase with the square of the speed. Drag may also be produced at speed due to truck (bogie) hunting, which will increase the rolling friction between wheels and rails. If acceleration continues, the train will eventually attain a speed at which the available tractive force of the locomotive(s) will exactly offset the total drag, causing acceleration to cease. This top speed will be increased on a downgrade due to gravity assisting the motive power, and will be decreased on an upgrade due to gravity opposing the motive power.|$|E
50|$|The Arrow IIIs {{were given}} a mid-life {{overhaul}} between 1992 and 1995 by ABB. The rebuild replaced the original DC propulsion system with a new solid state AC system that also included higher power traction motors {{with a total of}} about 375 hp per two axle truck. The increased power per motor allowed for motors to be eliminated from the truck located under the pantograph in each of the married pairs, reducing the number of powered axles per pair to 6 although raising horsepower to 1125. Single units retained all 4 powered axles with a total of 750 hp. After the rebuild was completed, problems were encountered with both traction motor and <b>axle</b> <b>bearing</b> overheating which lowered the maximum permitted speed in service to 90 mph from 100 and then ultimately to 80 mph as the problems persisted. In 2011 a single arm TransTech type pantograph was fitted to Arrow III #1463 replacing the original twin-arm Stemmann. By early 2014, all 160 units remaining in revenue service had been fitted with the new pantographs.|$|E

As a result of earlier testing and computer simulations, transverse dampers were stiffened on the power trucks.|$|R

The origin of the power for this technology is found in the concept of energy harvesting, which resources thermal deviation occurring when a train runs. For this, we measured the temperature generated on the <b>axle</b> box <b>bearing</b> from the train’s running environment by using a high-speed train, analyzed the thermal deviation and calculated the estimated energy harvesting power for the sensor network of the railroad system. The thermal deviation occurred in the <b>axle</b> box <b>bearing</b> when a train runs; the deviation was approximately 12. 97 ∼ 14. 68 ℃. We calculated in the assumption of the basic thermo element of the <b>axle</b> box <b>bearing</b> area, which is the area of the temperature sensor attached on the <b>axle</b> box <b>bearing.</b> Theoretically, the energy harvesting power of 63. 8 mW can be obtained and thus by using the energy harvesting power {{it will be possible to}} operate the wireless sensor network for railroad monitoring...|$|R
40|$|The wear of railway <b>axle</b> <b>bearings</b> is an {{important}} phenomenon. Rail companies must keep their rolling stock in a serviceable condition as excessively worn bearings can contribute to safety issues such as vibrations, excessive clearances and possibly even derailments. At present, maintenance scheduling is typically performed at predetermined time intervals. Predicting the wear and degradation of the bearings, would enable operators and bearing manufacturers to 1) optimise the design and maintenance of the bearings, and 2) quantitatively determine {{the best time to}} replace the bearings. This paper presents a model developed for predicting the wear in radially loaded spherical roller railway <b>axle</b> <b>bearings.</b> It uses a slice method to calculate the roller load, traction and creep distribution along the roller for the contact mechanics, and predicts wear using a frictional power model. The model is first validated with the wear in a thrust bearing in the literature and then used to predict wear in the radial bearing. The wear contribution from each roller in the loading zone due to the radial loading is calculated and combined for an overall wear profile. ...|$|R
