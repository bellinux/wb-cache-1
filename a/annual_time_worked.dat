The monthly, seasonal and <b>annual</b> <b>time</b> series of the both databases in most cases show a random behavior and the time series follow a similar pattern with a significant autocorrelation of both databases. Studying cross-correlation between the time series of the two bases indicate that the zero lag significance in the monthly, seasonal and <b>annual</b> <b>time</b> series statistically confirm the coincidence of the peak and fall in the time series of both bases. Wilcoxon Test with 95 % confidence confirms significance of the mean difference of the two series. However, {{there is not enough}} evidence to confirm the null hypothesis suggesting lack of difference between means of the two series. The statistical-objective analysis of the two bases’ time series indicates that although the series follow a similar course, the estimated precipitation quantity in monthly, seasonal and <b>annual</b> <b>time</b> series of APHRODITE base, except in several monthly time series and in trivial quantities, has been less than the estimated precipitation of Asfazari bases, but the amount of the difference was not constant and did not follow a regular pattern, although this difference has been narrowed in recent years. </p...|$|R

The definition methods in the planning progress are as follows: First of all, the history data from all substations including wind power output, PV power output and electrical load in one province should be collected and organized. In the next place, all the historical data above are used to divide the wind power installed capacity, the PV power installed capacity and the maximum load in the corresponding year so that the <b>annual</b> load <b>time</b> sequence output, <b>annual</b> wind power <b>time</b> sequence output and <b>annual</b> PV power <b>time</b> sequence output can be obtained respectively. Finally, the value of wind power output, PV power output and load in the planning year can be calculated by using these normalized time series output multiplied by the predicted wind installed capacity, the predicted PV installed capacity and the predicted maximum load.|$|R
