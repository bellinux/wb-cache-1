25|$|Social Security {{affects the}} saving {{behavior}} {{of the people in}} three different ways. The wealth substitution effect occurs when a person saving for retirement recognizes that the Social Security system will take care of him and decreases his expectations about how much he needs to personally save. The retirement effect occurs when <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer</b> saves more each year in an effort to reduce the total number of years he must work to accumulate enough savings before retirement. The bequest effect occurs when <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer</b> recognizes a decrease in resources stemming from the Social Security tax and compensates by increasing personal savings to cover future expected costs of having children.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThis paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> intention in the way certain transactions will be taxed. The paper will examine the weight accorded to <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> stated intention in different situations (i. e. in what situations/ transactions will <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> intention have comparatively little weight {{when compared to the}} objective facts of the case?) The paper first ascertains the meaning of intention/purpose/motive in terms of the Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962 as amended, (hereafter referred to as “the Act”). The question is whether these words are synonymous or have separate and discrete meanings. The paper then looks at the typical areas of difficulty associated with <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> intention. Share disposals are one example discussed, as {{it is often difficult to}} determine whether these disposals are of a capital or revenue nature. The weight accorded to <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> intention in schemes involving tax avoidance is also discussed. Case law surrounding section 20 A and section 80 A-S 80 L of the Act are reviewed to ascertain how <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> intention is dealt with in these section...|$|R
50|$|Canada child benefit (CCB) is {{non-taxable}} income for taxpayers. It ties to <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> family income, which could include the income for <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> spouse. It requires all tax returns filed for <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer's</b> family before {{the amount of}} benefits could be determined. The rationale is to pay more to low income families so that their kids could grow up healthy. A prescribed form has to be filed to get this benefit. CCB was implemented in July 2016, and combines pre-2016 benefit programs (UCCB and CCTB) {{as well as other}} child-related credits.|$|R

25|$|Until January 1, 2006, Kentucky {{imposed a}} tax on {{intangible}} personal property held by <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer</b> on January 1 of each year. The Kentucky intangible tax was repealed under House Bill 272. Intangible property consisted of any property or investment that represents evidence of value or the right to value. Some types of intangible property included: bonds, notes, retail repurchase agreements, accounts receivable, trusts, enforceable contracts {{sale of real estate}} (land contracts), money in hand, money in safe deposit boxes, annuities, interests in estates, loans to stockholders, and commercial paper.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of a {{consumption}} tax {{argue that the}} income tax system creates perverse incentives by encouraging taxpayers to spend rather than save: <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer</b> is only taxed once on income spent immediately, while any interest earned on saved income is itself taxed. To the extent that this is considered unjust, it may be remedied {{in a variety of}} ways, e.g. excluding investment income from taxable income, making investments deductible and therefore only taxing them when gains are realized, or replacing the income tax by other forms of tax, such as a sales tax.|$|E
25|$|From 1982 to 1987, Cheek {{was also}} {{involved}} in at least four civil cases challenging the Federal income tax. Among the arguments raised in those cases were: (1) the argument {{that he was not}} <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer</b> within the meaning of the law; (2) the argument that wages are not income; (3) the argument that the Sixteenth Amendment does not authorize an income tax on individuals; and (4) the argument that the Sixteenth Amendment is unenforceable. In all four cases, the courts stated that these arguments were erroneous. Cheek also attended two criminal trials of individuals charged with tax crimes.|$|E

25|$|Tax {{choice is}} {{the theory that}} taxpayers should have more control with how their {{individual}} taxes are allocated. If taxpayers could choose which government organizations received their taxes, opportunity cost decisions would integrate their partial knowledge. For example, <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer</b> who allocated more of his taxes on public education would have less to allocate on public healthcare. Supporters argue that allowing taxpayers to demonstrate their preferences would help ensure that the government succeeds at efficiently producing the public goods that taxpayers truly value. This would end real estate speculation, business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz's Henry George Theorem predicts its sufficiency because—as George also noted—public spending raises land value.|$|E
25|$|Since white settlement, about 28 native mammal {{species or}} {{subspecies}} have become extinct from the Australian mainland, the worst rate of continental extinction in the world. Red foxes {{are known to}} be a significant contributing factor to this. Mainland extinctions or near-extinctions include the eastern barred bandicoot, eastern quoll, and Tasmanian pademelon (Thylogale billardierii); all still common in Tasmania. A member of the upper house, the Legislative Council member for Windermere Ivan Dean MLC has been publicly critical of the fox evidence used to obtain funding for <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer</b> funded Fox Eradication Branch of the Tasmanian D.P.I.P.W.E.. Former Tasmanian Police Commander Dean led a Police investigation into the alleged importation and release of foxes into Tasmania. The investigation did not uncover any evidence of illegal importation. He then raised the Tasmanian fox issue in the Tasmanian Parliament on 17 April 2007.|$|E
25|$|One {{contention}} by {{some tax}} protesters is that <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer</b> {{should be allowed}} to introduce, as evidence in court, copies of statutes, cases or other materials to persuade the jury about what the law is. Courts do not allow this procedure as, under the U.S. legal system, the general rule is that neither side in a civil or criminal case is allowed to try to prove to the jury what the law is. For example, in a murder case the defendant is not allowed to persuade the jury that there is no law against murder, or to try to interpret the law for the jury. Likewise, the prosecution is not allowed to do this. Instead, disagreements about what the law is are argued by both sides before the judge, who then makes a ruling. Prior to jury deliberations, the judge instructs the jury on the law. Examples of applications of this rule in tax controversies are United States v. Ambort, United States v. Bonneau, and United States v. Willie.|$|E

25|$|The {{taxpayer}} Robert L. Schulz filed motions in {{a federal}} court to quash administrative summonses issued by the IRS seeking testimony and documents in connection with an IRS investigation. The court in Schulz did not rule that <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer</b> {{has a right to}} have the IRS explain why he or she is subject to taxation, and that issue was not presented to the court. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's motions for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because there was no actual case or controversy as required by Article III of the Constitution. The court reasoned that the summonses posed no threat of injury to the taxpayer, as the IRS had not yet initiated enforcement proceedings against him. In other words, the taxpayer was not entitled to a court order to quash the summonses until the IRS went to court to demand that he comply with the summons or otherwise face sanctions—something the IRS had not yet done. Once the IRS took that action, the taxpayer would then have ample opportunity to challenge the validity of the summonses.|$|E
25|$|We do {{not believe}} that Congress {{contemplated}} that such <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer,</b> without risking criminal prosecution, could ignore the duties imposed upon him by the Internal Revenue Code and refuse to utilize the mechanisms provided by Congress to present his claims of invalidity to the courts and to abide by their decisions. There is no doubt that Cheek, from year to year, was free to pay the tax that the law purported to require, file for a refund and, if denied, present his claims of invalidity, constitutional or otherwise, to the courts. See 26 U.S.C. 7422. Also, without paying the tax, he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in the Tax Court, 6213, with the right to appeal to a higher court if unsuccessful. 7482(a)(1). Cheek took neither course in some years, and, when he did, was unwilling to accept the outcome. As we see it, he is in no position to claim that his good-faith belief about the validity of the Internal Revenue Code negates willfulness or provides a defense to criminal prosecution under 7201 and 7203. Of course, Cheek was free in this very case to present his claims of invalidity and have them adjudicated, but, like defendants in criminal cases in other contexts who “willfully” refuse to comply with the duties placed upon them by the law, he must take the risk of being wrong.|$|E

40|$|The tax gap is a {{phenomenon}} experienced by revenue collection agencies which describes {{the difference between the}} taxes due, as prescribed by legislation, and the actual taxes collected.

Recent theories suggest that <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> social structure is a significant determinant of <b>a</b> <b>taxpayer’s</b> attitude towards tax compliance. This study explores the proposal that social network analysis through decision support systems can facilitate the objective of revenue collection agencies to minimize the tax gap.
