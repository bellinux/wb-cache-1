These firms spend billions of dollars yearly to promote their prescription drugs. This dissertation provides empirical analyses and methods to contribute to several substantial problems on pharmaceutical marketing effectiveness. Using unique data in every essay, it studies {{the role of the}} firm, sales rep and doctor in pharmaceutical marketing. The first essay evaluates the size of the sales force and the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> calls among doctors. In particular, it provides a method to gauge a yet-to-be-enacted firm-initiated policy shift. The second essay studies the effectiveness of the information content provided in sales calls. The main questions evolve around the discussion of positively biased drug information and the responsiveness of doctors to that. In the third essay, the interplay between drug sales, marketing and scientific reviews is studied in detail. The essays reveal important implications for academics and managers. For academics: (i) a new alternative to gauge policy shifts is offered; (ii) a model is offered to analyze the effectiveness of sales message content; and (iii) scientific reviews should be considered to correctly measure pharmaceutical marketing effectiveness. The implications for managers are: (i) the market leader is able to buck the trend in increasing sales forces; (ii) sales reps discuss positively biased information too often, which is counterproductive in the long run; and (iii) scientific reviews on products should be actively considered {{as a part of the}} marketing mix...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} role of legal {{investor}} protection for {{the efficiency of the}} market for corporate control. Stronger legal investor protection limits the ease with which an acquirer, once in control, can extract private benefits at the expense of non-controlling investors. This, in turn, increases the acquirer’s capacity to raise outside funds to finance the takeover. Absent effective competition for the target, the increased outside funding capacity does not make efficient takeovers more likely, however, because the bid price, and thus the acquirer’s need for funds, increase in lockstep with his pledgeable income. In contrast, under effective competition, the increased outside funding capacity makes it less likely that the takeover outcome is determined by the bidders’ financing constraints [...] and thus by their internal funds [...] and more likely that it is determined by their ability to create value. Accordingly, stronger legal investor protection can improve the efficiency of the takeover outcome. Taking into account the interaction between legal investor protection and financing constraints also provides new insights into the optimal <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> voting rights, <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> controlling blocks, and {{the role of}} legal investor protection in cross-border mergers and acquisitions. corporate control; efficiency; investor protection; takeovers...|$|R
40|$|When several {{products}} are marketed {{by the same}} sales force, it frequently becomes impossible or impractical for salesmen to promote all items in the product line extensively in each and every time period. Management 2 ̆ 7 s problem is to decide how the available selling effort should be allocated across products and over time. The opportunity costs associated with using limited selling resources to promote certain products but not others must be evaluated. This paper describes a decision calculus-type modeling system for dealing with this question. The problem is analyzed by a two-step procedure. First, a response function is defined which relates selling effort to sales and profit results in a manner which represents some behavioral phenomena considered to be important. An interactive conversational program elicits judgmental data from managers which are used to parameterize the response model. A separate response function is specified for each product in the firm 2 ̆ 7 s line by this method. The set of response functions so obtained becomes the input for the second component of the system, an allocation heuristic.

40|$|Abstract: Gazprom, the {{dominant}} gas company in Russia, {{is widely believed}} to be the key supplier of gas to Europe in the foreseeable future. However, there are numerous uncertainties and challenges within the Russian and European gas industry that may alter the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> Gazprom´s gas <b>sales</b> between domestic and export markets. In this paper we use both theoretical and numerical models to study potential effects on Russian gas exports from changes in Russian domestic gas prices and the production capacities in 2015. We also investigate whether the liberalization of the European gas markets may provide incentives for Gazprom to induce monopoly power in its export markets. Our main findings suggest that both increased domestic gas prices and sufficient production capacities are vital to maintain Gazprom´s market share in Europe over the next decade. At low domestic prices, Gazprom may even have difficulties to carry out its long-term export commitments. However, if export possibilities are ample due to both lower domestic demand at higher prices and high overall production capacities, a large share of spot trades in Europe may encourage Gazprom to exercise market power in its export markets.

So far, it is not known how family firms formulate or practice their strategic planning. This research aimed to investigate and evaluate the extent and nature of the strategic planning processes in a sample of family firms in Saudi Arabia. Data from six family firms was collected by semi-structured in-depth interviews using open ended questions. The study employed convenience sampling. A total of 16 interviews were made to collect the data and confirm understanding. Secondary data from company documentation and websites were also utilized. Collected data was analysed (qualitatively) to produce observations on family firms‘ strategic planning process. A pilot study was used to confirm suitability of the methodology and data analysis. The idea for this research came from an actual need of the researcher and many of his friends. The study has many practical implications on family firms both locally and internationally. Therefore, it is hoped that family firms can increase their chances of success and continuation to the following generations. The study found that the businesses tended not to have systematic processes and that analysis was typically unsophisticated and often ignored, while implementation in the sense <b>of</b> resource <b>allocation,</b> setting <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> targets, monitoring <b>of</b> performance, and providing incentives was often approached more systematically. Some interesting strategic patterns across firms were identified such as "Sales is king", "Let‘s do it" and "Just grow". Despite geographical and sample limitations, this study has opened many avenues for further research into the strategy process in family business, both in Saudi Arabia and in other countries and cultures.
