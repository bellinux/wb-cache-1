5|$|The main {{problems}} were {{the pressure of}} time and the desire of the U.S. president for secrecy. The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was only two months away. By the order of the president, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders got only two or three days' notice.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} co-written by Nanase Ohkawa and Junichi Fujisaku, who also {{worked on the}} series. According to Fujisaku, the {{narrative}} of The Last Dark focused on Saya both seeking revenge and searching for purpose after discovering she was being used by cruel humans. The process of writing The Last Dark ran parallel to Blood-C, and as Ohkawa was preoccupied with the series, Fujisaku put together a basic story and script draft which he expanded and adjusted based on Shiotani's desires for the movie. When Ohkawa, she and Fujisaku together worked to write and polish the final script. Saya's relationships with others despite her non-human status formed {{a key part of}} the movie's themes. According to Ohkawa, one of her main issues was keeping the storytelling <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> possible within the movie's planned runtime, meaning that some elements of Saya's backstory needed to be cut. While the series took place in a fictional location, the movie used the real-world location of Tokyo, so Ohkawa took extra care to insert realistic details into the script. She found it difficult accommodating the wishes of both Shiotani and Fujisaku's ideas alongside her own in the script.|$|E

Also, materials with good deformation characteristics are necessary for rolling; these materials include softer (more ductile) metals and exclude brittle materials, such as cast iron. Tolerances are typically ±0.001in. (±0.025mm), but tolerances <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> ±0.0006in (±0.015mm) are achievable. Surface finishes range from 6 to 32 micro-inches.|$|E

25|$|With the NBA {{struggling}} {{financially and}} down to just 8 teams Nationals owner during the 1954–55 season, Danny Biasone suggested the league {{limit the amount of}} time taken for a shot thus speeding up a game that often ended with long periods of teams just holding the ball and playing keep away. Biasone and Nats general manager Leo Ferris calculated a 24-second shot clock would allow at least 30 shots per quarter speeding up the game and increasing scoring. The Shot Clock was an instant success as scoring was up 14 points per game league wide. In the first season of the shot clock the Nats would take first place in the East with a 43–29 record. After a first round bye the Nats would beat the Boston Celtics in 4 games to reach the NBA Finals for the 2nd straight season. In the finals the Nats would get off to a fast start, led by forward Dolph Schayes, taking the first 2 games at home against the Fort Wayne Pistons. However, as the series moved to Fort Wayne the Pistons would spark back to life taking all 3 games to take a 3–2 series lead. Back in Syracuse for Game 6 on the Nats kept Championship hopes alive by beating the Pistons 109–104 to force a 7th game at home. Game 7 would be <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> the series as George King sank a free throw to give the Nats a 92–91 lead in the final seconds. King would then steal the inbound pass to clinch the NBA Championship for the Nationals.|$|E
25|$|Thursday {{qualifying}} {{was held}} in similar weather conditions to practice, but {{was interrupted by a}} brief shower of rain close {{to the end of the}} session. Alesi carried his form over from free practice, nudging the crash barriers lining the circuit on more than one occasion to set a provisional pole position time of 1:23.754. Berger was also impressive, power-sliding through Casino Square, to the delight of the crowd, on his way to the third-fastest time, although he complained that Alesi had held him up on what he thought would have been his quickest lap of the session. The form of the Ferraris came as something of a surprise, as the 41T2's unique V12 engine configuration theoretically produced less torque than its rivals, a disadvantage on a circuit <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> Monaco. Alesi said that he believed the results of the session were due to the extreme effort that he and Berger were putting into their driving overcoming any deficiencies with the car. The Ferraris were split by Schumacher, who felt that the rain shower had prevented him from fulfilling his potential, as he did not complete his full quota of 12laps as a result of the track conditions becoming slower. His teammate, Herbert, took provisional sixthplace. Of the Williams drivers, Hill was fourth, but Coulthard admitted that he was still learning the track on his way to 11th, 2.8seconds slower than Alesi's best. Häkkinen continued McLaren's promising form with a provisional fifthplace, but was fined $10,000 for ignoring yellow flags during the season. Blundell was back in eighth after crashing into the barriers in the closing minutes of the session.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{arrangements}} were developed through extensive jamming, with Cox's and Miles' playing influencing Hendrix's ideas. [...] According to biographer Keith Shadwick, Cox explained in later interviews, [...] "the process {{was based on}} building up rhythm patterns and that each pattern dictated the shape and character of {{a portion of a}} song in which it appeared". [...] Record producer Alan Douglas witnessed the approach during a jam at the Record Plant and saw it as inefficient. On the other hand, Shadwick feels that it was necessary: [...] "it seemed the only way available, especially as neither Cox nor Miles, in particular, were exactly swift on the musical uptake". [...] Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray noted, [...] "Cox's funky, uncluttered bass style would give Hendrix's new music a more solid, less frenetic underpinning [...] [...] In every way, Cox's function would be to provide the steadiness Hendrix so urgently required". [...] Soft Machine drummer Robert Wyatt described Miles' style as [...] "pleasantly messy... He wasn't <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> a Stax drummer ... his rolls would clatter about a bit". [...] However, his often described [...] "fatback grooves" [...] lay down a solid rhythmic foundation and the combination of Cox and Miles adds a [...] "heavy, rolling fluidity which brings out a very different dimension in Hendrix's playing".|$|E

5000|$|In American English, the {{difference}} between pantyhose and tights is determined in {{the weight of the}} yarn used and the thickness to which the garment is knitted.

2500|$|There {{were three}} key {{elements}} in the writing process. First, Chibnall largely ignored traditional concepts about narrative structure when writing the teleplay. Instead, he focused on how the murder affected each character, and let each character's responses drive the story. His lone concession to narrative structure was driven {{by the need to}} insert a commercial break every 11 to 12 minutes. He chose to insert a surprising or shocking moment just before each break to encourage viewers to keep watching. This forced Chibnall to [...] "aggressively plot" [...] each episode, keeping the story <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> possible so that he could focus on character development. Second, Chibnall emphasised the role of the local newspaper in the series. Having lived in the small Dorset town of Bridport, Chibnall saw how local newspapers had a major impact on their communities despite the prominence of new media such as the Internet. He created a fictional local newspaper, the Broadchurch Echo, and made it not only an element of the story (revealing information to which characters react) but also a character in the story itself, motivated by the people who work there. Third, Chibnall planned for a visual rather than dialogue-driven finale. Chibnall wanted the final episode of Broadchurch to be different than the typical murder-mystery series. He observed that most finales saved major revelations until the final minutes of the final episode. He felt this led to poor writing, with loose plot threads [...] "hastily" [...] tied up and no way for the audience to adjust emotionally to the new information. Chibnall decided his [...] "reveal" [...] would occur early in the final episode, and more time would be given to depicting the impact of the reveal on the characters. He also wanted to avoid a reveal which was primarily verbal, as occurred in many detective novels. Chibnall wanted his reveal to be visual and highly cinematic, and for time to slow down during the reveal to heighten the audience's tension. This, he felt, would help the audience feel as if they were actually part of the drama, as if they were really experiencing these events themselves.|$|E
