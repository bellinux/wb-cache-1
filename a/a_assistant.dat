40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent secondary assistant principals in large Texas high schools demonstrate behaviors consistent with what the literature describes as instructional leadership. Three hundred seventy principals and assistant principals of large Texas high schools participated in this study. The Principal Instructional Management Rating Scale (Hallinger, 1987) was used to quantify instructional leadership in 10 different job functions. The study found that (<b>a)</b> <b>assistant</b> principals perceive themselves as exhibiting instructional leadership behaviors at a high frequency, (b) principals perceive their assistant principals exhibiting instructional leadership behaviors at a high frequency, (c) the perceptions of the principals and assistant principals were similar, and (d) principals and assistant principals reported more engagement in instructional leadership responsibilities and felt more pressured over the last five years under the new accountability and rating requirements of No Child Left Behind and the state assessments. These findings suggested that the administrative roles and responsibilities in high schools should be restructured to allow assistant principals to focus on instructional leadership...|$|E

The analyses presented here are based on a critical assessment of the explanatory power of these approaches in cross-national and longitudinal comparisons. Instead, a contextual model is presented emphasising the relevance of distinct degrees of politicisation in different societal settings in addition to the traditional sociodemographic factors (education, age, and gender) at the micro-level. The resulting multi-level model combines both individual and contextual factors to explain the cross-national differences and changes in political involvement and apathy in Europe in the last three decades.

40|$|Abstract—By using image {{recognition}} technology, the underground bin level can be detdcted. The bin image is noised by vibration,atomy,backgroun and so on. The image restoration based on neural network are used. A modified Hopfield network is present for image restoration. The greed algorithm with n-simultaneous updates and a partially asynchronous algorithm are combined, improving convergence and avoiding synchronization penalties. The article presents advanced Cellular neural Network. It gives {{the theories of}} MMCNN dynamic extent and stable state. The results of implementation are applied in detecting undergroug bin level. Index Terms—Restoration, Pre-processing Image, neural network, filter The underground environment is wrongly. The underground bin image picked through <b>a</b> <b>assistant</b> optical source is noised by vibration,atomy,backgroun and so on,atomy,backgroun and so on. By various interferes, the edge characteristics of bin image are not determined,so the image restoration and image mathematical morphology based on neural network are proposed for processing image. The problem of restoring noisy-blurred image {{is very important for}} many application[1]. The image degradation can be adequately modeled,the degradation model is gived by z = Dx + η (1) Where x,z an represent,respectively,the original,degraded images and the additive noise. The matrix D represents the linear spatially invariant or spatially varying distortion. The purpose of digital image restoration is to operation on the degraded image z to obtain an improved image that is close to a suitable optimality criterion [1]. The optimality criterion is described by mininize 1 T T f (x) = x Tx − b x (2) 2 subject to 0 ≤...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{progress in}} gas-surface reaction dynamics, a field relevant to heterogeneous catalysis, is described. One {{of the most}} fundamental reactions, the dissociative chemisorption of H 2 on metal surfaces, can now be treated accurately using quantum mechanics. Density functional theory is used to compute the molecule-surface interaction, and the motion of the hydrogen atoms is simulated using quantum dynamics, modeling all six molecular degrees of freedom. Theory is in good quantitative agreement with molecular beam experiments, offering useful interpretations, and allowing reliable predictions. The success of the approach calls for extensions to larger systems, such as dissociative chemisorption of polyatomic molecules. Reactions at surfaces often correspond to rather complicated multistep processes, which hampers their theoretical modeling. For improved understanding of the overall reaction, a bottom-up approach has frequently been employed, involving atomistic studies of elementary reaction steps at well-defined single crystal surfaces. This approach has recently resulted in some remarkable successes. One study combined atomistic experimental and theoretical methods to establish that at elevated oxygen pressures, CO can be oxidized on ruthenium in a mechanism in which CO reacts with oxygen incorporated in the oxidized ruthenium surface. 1 In another example, the Geert-Jan Kroes obtained his Ph. D. in chemistry in 1990 at the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. He currently works as <b>a</b> <b>Assistant</b> Professor in the theoretical chemistry group of Leiden University.
