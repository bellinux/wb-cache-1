5|$|Dysprosium is used, in {{conjunction}} with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials and commercial lighting. Because of dysprosium's high thermal-neutron <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section,</b> dysprosium-oxide–nickel cermets are used in neutron-absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors. Dysprosium–cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation, which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data-storage applications, such as in hard disks. Dysprosium is increasingly in demand for the permanent magnets used in electric car motors and wind turbine generators.|$|E

Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.|$|E

40|$|Mid-IR <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections</b> are {{measured}} for methane, ethane, ethylene and methanol over 2800 - 3400 cm- 1 (2. 9 - 3. 6 μm) spectral region. Measurements {{are carried out}} using a Fourier-Transform-Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer with temperatures ranging 296 - 1100 K and pressures near atmospheric. As temperature increases, the peak cross-sections decrease but {{the wings of the}} bands increase as higher rotational lines appear. Integrated band intensity is also calculated over the measured spectral region and is found to be a very weak function of temperature. The <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections</b> of the relatively small fuels studied here show dependence on the bath gas. This effect is investigated by studying the variation of <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections</b> at 3. 392 μm using a HeNe laser in mixtures of fuel and nitrogen, argon, or helium. Mixtures of fuel with He have the highest value of <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections</b> followed by Ar and N 2. Molecules with narrow absorption lines, such as methane and methanol, show strong dependence on bath gas than molecules with relatively broader absorption features i. e. ethane and ethylene. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> of elements and compounds.

An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.|$|E

The newly commissioned B Reactor at the Hanford Site had run into an unexpected problem, starting up and shutting down at regular intervals. John Archibald Wheeler suspected that a fission product, xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.4 hours, was the culprit, and might be a neutron poison. Segrè then remembered the work that Wu had done at Berkeley on the radioactive isotopes of xenon. The paper on the subject was still unpublished, but Wu and Nichols went to her dorm room, and collected the typewritten draft prepared for the Physical Review. Xenon-135 was indeed the culprit; {{it turned out to}} have an unexpectedly large neutron <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section.</b>|$|E
