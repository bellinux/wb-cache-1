Young women who desire to serve as missionaries can serve starting at the age of nineteen, for one and a half years. Retired couples also have the option of serving a mission.

Delbarton students have also traveled to Spain on several organized summer trips and to Germany for World Youth Day with the school's religious educator David Hajduk. The school has also sent several students to help assist in Operation Smile Missions in China, Honduras, and Thailand. The most recent established trip overseas was a mission trip to Nairobi, Kenya, and Hanga, Tanzania, where students donated money and aid to several schools.

500|$|In 2009, Aronofsky {{reflected}} on the reception of The Fountain, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} Fountain-haters out [...] The film's about the fact that it's OK that we die, and we should come to terms with it. But many, many people don't want to think about that, so why pay money for a meditation on losing someone you love? Everything about western culture denies that." [...] He also believed the film was released at the wrong time, [...] "It was pre-Obama, {{smack in the middle of}} Paris Hilton time. But there has been a serious turn now, people are starting to realise that the party's over, finally.

500|$|As July {{approached}} {{and came to}} its close, Tancredo's standing improved somewhat with the looming Ames Straw Poll.

[...] Interviewed supporters were asked why they supported the candidate, they replied, [...] "He really has the concerns of America at heart, he's concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> of America itself.

500|$|Together, the Workmans {{explored}} {{the world and}} co-wrote eight travel books that describe the people, art, and architecture of the areas they journeyed through. [...] The Workmans were aware of their contribution to the genre of travel writing, as they commented on other writers in their own works. Their mountaineering narratives said little <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> of those remote and sparsely inhabited regions; they included both lyrical descriptions of the sunset, for example, for their popular audience and detailed explanations of geographical features, such as glaciers, for their scientific readership. [...] Fanny and William added scientific elements to their writings to appeal to authoritative {{organizations such as the}} Royal Geographical Society; Fanny also believed the science would make her more legitimate {{in the eyes of the}} climbing community, but it cost her readers. In general, their bicycling tour narratives were better received than those about their mountaineering exploits. Fanny wrote the majority of these travel books herself, and in them she commented extensively on the plight of women wherever she traveled.|$|E
500|$|The Workmans' trip to India, Burma, Ceylon, and Java lasted {{two and a}} half years, {{beginning}} in November 1897, and covered [...] At the time, Fanny was 38 and William 50.

To ensure they had access to supplies, they rode along major thoroughfares near railways, and were sometimes forced to sleep in railway waiting rooms if no other accommodation was available. They carried minimal supplies, including tea, sugar, biscuits, cheese, tinned meats, water, pillows, a blanket for each of them, writing materials, and medical and repair kits. They dispensed with their bicycles at the northern end of their trip and hiked over passes between [...] and [...] The trip was grueling. They often had little food or water, dealt with swarms of mosquitoes, fixed as many as 40 bicycle tire punctures per day, and slept in rat-infested quarters. Fanny Workman's book, written after the trip, highlighted the ancient architecture that they had seen rather than the contemporary local cultures. Mrs Workman mentions in [...] "My Asiatic Wanderings" [...] about India [...] "I have wheeled through much enchanting scenery, in the palm and banyan grooves of Orissa, Over the green and scarlet slopes of the Terai... But I have never cycled 1200 miles in a country so continuously beautiful." [...] The Workmans possessed an unusual amount of historical knowledge about India for Westerners of the time and had read the Jakata, Mahabharata, and Ramayana before their trip. They were eager to learn <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> that had produced these epics and spent more time learning about ancient history than interacting with living people.|$|E
