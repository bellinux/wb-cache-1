50|$|The {{book was}} {{partially}} translated into English by <b>Alexander</b> <b>Dow</b> in 1768 or 1769, and Jonathan Scott translated it completely in 1799. The Persian text was also lithographed {{several times in}} the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Younge's next {{parts were}} Jane Shore in The Tragedy of Jane Shore by Nicholas Rowe and Ovisa in the première of <b>Alexander</b> <b>Dow's</b> Zingis. This play {{was not well}} received, and Younge was hissed by the audience. On 7 April 1769, she played Perdita in Florizel and Perdita, Garrick's {{adaptation}} of The Winter's Tale. That summer, she worked at Richmond with James Love, but in the autumn she returned to Drury Lane and on 2 October, she played Juliet in Romeo and Juliet.|$|R
50|$|He was {{a native}} of Crieff, Perthshire. <b>Alexander</b> <b>Dow's</b> father worked at the Customs at Dunbar. The younger Dow was educated in Dunbar for a time, and, in {{conjunction}} with his father's job, this would suggest that he lived in the area for a time. Dow {{was in the process of}} being educated for a mercantile career in Eyemouth, when he abruptly left aboard the King of Prussia as a Midshipman. The reason for this turn of events is not known, but one reason posited for this was that he was involved in a fatal duel. Dow then worked his way to Bencoolen. There he became secretary to the Governor, and was commended to the patronage of the officials of the East India Company at Calcutta. He joined the army there as an ensign in the Bengal infantry on 14 September 1760, and was rapidly promoted lieutenant on 23 August 1763, and captain on 16 April 1764.|$|R
50|$|John <b>Dow</b> <b>Alexander</b> (born August 22, 1903, date {{of death}} missing) was a Canadian politician. He served in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1960 to 1963 as member of the Liberal party.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Alexander</b> <b>Dow</b> (1735/6-79), a Scottish orientalist and playwright, {{wrote the}} tragedy Sethona, set in ancient Egypt. The lead part of Menes is {{described}} in the dramatis personæ as [...] "next male-heir to the crown" [...] now worn by Seraphis, and was played by Samuel Reddish in a 1774 production by David Garrick at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.|$|E
5000|$|John (Alastair) <b>Alexander</b> <b>Dow</b> {{was educated}} at Strathallan School and {{graduated}} from St John's College, Cambridge in 1939. [...] He served as a lieutenant with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during World War II around the English Channel and Western Approaches. [...] As with Samuel he {{became president of the}} Scottish Wine and Spirit Merchants' Benevolent Institution.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} year, <b>Alexander</b> <b>Dow</b> and Allen Gilles of O'Keefe's Ranch in the Okanagan {{decided to}} use her on Okanagan Lake for freight, especially for shipping wheat, and B. F. Young from Armstrong, British Columbia hauled the hull {{to the head of}} Okanagan Lake. It was then taken to the shipyard at Okanagan Landing and lengthened by 20 ft and refitted as a screw steamer with new boilers and engine, provided by Nicholles and Renouf of Victoria. The twenty feet were never updated in the register, which continued to show her length as 33 ft. Red Star, then known as Okanagan, became the first serious competitor to the boat service run by Captain Thomas Shorts on Okanagan Lake upon her arrival in 1888.|$|E

He {{is the author of}} The Lusaka Years: The ANC in Exile in Zambia, 1963-94; An African Trading Empire: The story of Susman Brothers & Wulfsohn, and of Zion in Africa: The Jews of Zambia (with Frank Shapiro). He is also the co-editor with Shula Marks of Africa and Empire: W.M. Macmillan, historian and social critic. His elder daughter, Lindsay, married <b>Alexander</b> Arthur <b>Dow,</b> and had a career as a teacher in Zambia and Scotland. His younger daughter, Catriona, married Colonel Alistair Miller, Queen's Irish Hussars, and had a career as a hotelier in Dorset.

5000|$|Her first {{exhibition}} of paintings was in 1925 at the Seattle Art Museum {{as part of}} their Northwest Annual Show. From the 1930s through the 1950s, Kerns made a name for herself in the world of abstract art, painting in what was called at the time the [...] "non-objective" [...] art movement, being widely known for modernist landscapes. She exhibited work at the Museum of Non-Objective Painting in New York. A spiritual woman, she embraced the art-as-spiritual expression philosophy of Wassily Kandinsky. She was also influenced by Asian art. She was an innovative teacher, being a mentor to University of Oregon professors, she would do things like have her class paint to music to try new styles. Working with Arthur Wesley <b>Dow,</b> <b>Alexander</b> Archipenko contributed to her interest in color and shape relationships. She was also an associate to Albert Patecky. Her paintings were recognized and championed by Hilla von Rebay, chief advisor to Solomon R. Guggenheim, who purchased a number of her paintings, along with art from other standouts in the early American abstract art scene, for his Museum of Non-Objective Painting (later renamed Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) in New York City. Kerns died in 1965, and later The Eugene Art Center (1950), to which she was a major donor and founder of, was renamed The Maude Kerns Art Center in her honor and served to promote her passion for contemporary art. The art center holds a variety of paintings, mixed media, ceramics, and many other modern forms of art.|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} at Surat he had enough free time to become keenly {{interested}} in Persian culture, collecting manuscripts and studying its historical classics, including the Akbarnama by Abu'l-Fazl, though he also rose to become the Bombay Army's judge-advocate-general from 1795 to 1805. A brevet captain by 1795, {{he was promoted to}} full captain two years later. He also served as military secretary and interpreter to Colonel <b>Alexander</b> <b>Dow</b> in Malabar (1797-8) and then as Persian translator to General James Stuart, commander of the Bombay Army (1799), being present at Seringapatam's capture and acting as the army's prize agent (thus making his own fortune). Next he returned to Bombay to continue his studies of Persia, being promoted to major in March 1804 before finally returning to Britain in February 1805, though he only retired from the Company in October 1807, on his marriage to a relative.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{religions}} he wrote Brahmanism, a work directed against {{the writings of the}} Englishmen Z. Howell and <b>Alexander</b> <b>Dow.</b> Others of his writings were on Indian polytheism, Indian asceticism, the religion of the Parsees, Islam, the relation of these religions to one another, etc. His writings in the department of the natural sciences are: astronomical observations on the sunspots and Zodiacal light, studies on Hindu astronomy, astrology, and cosmology, and descriptions and observation's of the flora and fauna of India. He also wrote in Latin on the origin of Hindus and of their religion, an account in German of the expeditions of Nadir Shah to India, the deeds of the Mughal Shah Alam in Persian, and in French in incursions of the Afghans and the conquest of Delhi, and the contemporary history of India, 1757-64. In linguistics he wrote a Sanskrit-Parsee lexicon, treatises in Latin on the language of the Parsees, on the proper pronunciation of Latin, etc.|$|E

40|$|The {{figures in}} the paper by <b>Alexander</b> <b>Dow</b> and Catherine Kirk are indeed a disappointment. They reflect the serious debate on Scotland's {{progress}} towards the Business Birth Rate Strategy's objectives that began after we published our own "Five Years On" report on the Strategy's progress in 1998.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an approach {{for building a}} statistical model for the structural uncertainties in Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models. This approach solves an inference problem {{by comparing the results}} of RANS calculations to direct numerical simulation. The adjoint method is used to efficiently solve an inverse problem to determine the RANS turbulent viscosity field that most accurately reproduces the mean flow field computed by direct numerical simulation. The discrepancy between the inferred turbulent viscosity and the turbulent viscosity predicted by RANS is modeled as a Gaussian random field. Finally, the uncertainty in the turbulent viscosity field is propagated to the quantities of interest. Results are first presented for turbulent flow through a straight channel. To model the uncertainty in more complex flows, the procedure is repeated for a collection of flows through randomly generated geometries. by Eric <b>Alexander</b> <b>Dow.</b> Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Variations in the {{geometry}} of compressor blades can be introduced by variability in the manufacturing process or by in-service erosion. Recent research efforts have focused on characterizing the impacts of this geometric variability on turbomachinery performance and designing blade geometries whose performance is robust to this variability. Relatively little {{work has been done}} to specify the appropriate level of variability by designing the manufacturing tolerances. This thesis presents new approaches for optimizing tolerances that can be applied to compliment existing geometry optimization techniques. Building upon previous research, a Gaussian random field model of manufacturing variability is developed and used to estimate the statistical performance impacts of geometric variability on compressor blade performance. Flow mechanisms that deteriorate the mean performance in the presence of geometric variability are analyzed for design and off-design conditions. A probabilistic, gradient-based optimization framework is presented and applied to optimize the tolerances of compressor blades, as well as to optimize the tolerances and blade geometry simultaneously. The effectiveness of simultaneous optimization of {{the geometry}} and manufacturing tolerances is compared to a sequential procedure where the nominal blade geometry is optimized first, followed by the tolerances. Single-point optimization, where the performance at a single flow incidence is optimized, is found to produce geometries that are not robust to manufacturing variations. Adopting a multi-point design strategy results in blades that are robust to both variations in the geometry and incidence, allowing a sequential design strategy to be used. by Eric <b>Alexander</b> <b>Dow.</b> Thesis: Ph.

40|$|In {{the heart}} of the 'age of reason' there is a hunger for transcendence, for the {{experience}} of unity of the mind and spirit of man with the Divine, both within nature and beyond. The sublime was the socially acceptable mode in which the man of reason abandoned the rules and anxiously sought to experience the transcendental. The sublime was not an aberration of the age but an inevitable outcome of the new awareness of the infinite resulting from various causes including the seventeenth-century scientific advances, the work of Newton and of Locke. The desire of the age for integration and wholeness is elucidated through examination of the work of sixteen writers. Beginning with the third Earl of Shaftesbury and ending with William Law, this thesis intends to show, first, that there was a significant amount of mystical literature written in eighteenth-century England and, secondly, that there was a vital mystical dimension {{in the spirit of the}} age. The writers examined are not part of one or two large groups atypical against the background of their century. They come from different traditions and are diffused throughout the period. The writers studied are as well-known as Christopher Smart and George Berkeley and as little known as James Usher and <b>Alexander</b> <b>Dow.</b> The oneness of mystical experience, which, to various degrees, all of the writers demonstrate in their mystical insights, impelled them to write of the oneness of internal and external reality, and of the human and Divine. They all testify, in different ways and with various emphases, that there is a divine, creative force in man which unifies all the disparate elements of self, and unites the self with God, but only when one gives all to this divine fire in the soul...|$|E
