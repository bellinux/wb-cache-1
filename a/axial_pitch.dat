40|$|ABSTRACT: Worm gears are {{commonly}} used in windshield wipers and power windows of automobiles. The goal of this work is to study several material problems, such as production bottlenecks and excessive scrap, resulting from the production of steel worm shafts. A possible solution is explored in this work by characterizing material properties of a promising candidate (glass reinforced acetal copolymer) that can replace steel in worm gears. Finite element analysis of the worm thread under static loading and constant temperature is performed in order to calculate {{the size of the}} new composite part. The results obtained in this work support the possibility of manufacturing composite worm shafts that could operate at elevated temperatures without sacrificing part performance, while reducing part weight leading to improved fuel economy, noise reduction, and manufacturing problems associated with the steel part. The finite element analysis shows that compared to a steel gear, the <b>axial</b> <b>pitch</b> of a composite worm gear must be increased by 250 % in order for it to operate without failure for 10 years at a constant temperature of 23 C.

40|$|The {{demand for}} weight {{reduction}} in automobiles {{to reduce fuel consumption}} pushed the spring manufacturer to choose higher-strength martensitic steels {{to reduce the}} resisting section of the wire, and for this reason the weight of the spring. The traditional approach in forming such materials is based on the hot coiling of the wire at high temperature to increase material formability and to reduce the required forming forces. Another approach is the cold forming process wherein the wire is heat treated before the spring is formed to improve its formability. In both cases the coiled spring has to be hardened and tempered to reach the target strength. Energy and time consumption due to the final heat treatment slow production and increase the manufacturing cost of the spring. The two-fold target of shortening the process cycle and reducing the weight of the spring was met successfully in cold forming the material in its final condition (hardened and tempered). In this case the coiling process becomes more critical because the formability of these high-strength martensitic steels is not very high. The trend of using high-strength steels (between 1800 and 2100 MPa) increases the difficulties in the cold forming of such wires and can lead to the failure of the coiled wire caused by the breakage of the spring. 1 - 3 The forming forces required in the coiling of the wire increase with the high strength of the material causing the feeding force to also increase. The feeding rolls should provide enough force to avoid the slip of the wire between the rolls. For this reason the friction between the wire and the feeding rolls should be at a high level to provide enough tangential force to avoid any slip of the wire. On the other hand, high friction increases the required forming force due to the higher contribution of friction forces developing in the stationary dies where the wire slides as in the guiding plate, in the bending die and in the bar controlling the <b>axial</b> <b>pitch</b> of the spring. The contribution made by the bending die can be reduced using two bending rolls where the sliding friction is substituted by a prevalent rolling friction. This solution has been successfully used by spring manufacturers, who still face the problem of friction in the remaining components of the coiling machine: in the feeding system the friction should be high and elsewhere should be low. The insertion of a lubricating station between feeding and forming can solve the problem, but can be difficult in the industrial application, generating a dirty area of the press and requiring a cleaning step after coiling to remove residual lubricant from the spring’s external surface. For these reasons, the spring manufacturer asks for a wire with an external oxide, which should act as a thin solid lubricant layer. If this layer is too thin, it can be broken when the wire is passing between the feeding rolls, causing a possible slip of the wire and an increase of friction in the forming section of the press. Slipping in the feeding rolls can be eliminated by increasing the radial pressure of the rolls on the wire, but this action can introduce damage to the wire and eventually can lead to failure in the coiling of the spring. The investigation has been focused on the effect of friction {{as well as on the}} set-up of the coiling machine, and it is based on a preliminary experimental analysis of different wires. Different samples of the same steel with different Fe-oxide layers have been tested in the coiling machine. Most of them allow the correct manufacture of the spring, but some result in the breakage of the spring during coiling. The samples have been characterized in the laboratory relative to mechanical properties, microstructure, thickness of the oxide layer and its morphology and type of oxide and its adherence to the steel underneath. Afterwards, a numerical model of the spring coiling process has been developed introducing the description of the Lemaitre damage model in the material properties. Relative damage has been used as the index to estimate the risk of failure when different friction and process parameters are used...|$|E
