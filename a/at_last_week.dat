40|$|BACKGROUND: Low {{birth weight}} (LBW) {{is a major}} public health problem in many {{developing}} countries, especially so in India. Although {{we do not know}} all the causes of LBW, maternal and environmental factors appear to be significant risk factors in its occurrence. OBJECTIVES: To know the factors affecting the birth weight of a newborn and to estimate the prevalence of LBW. METHODS: The present study was carried out amongst 1138 pregnant women and their newborns residing in area covered by Kinaye Primary Health Centre in rural Karnataka, India. The study was conducted from 1 (st) June 2008 to 31 (st) December 2009. RESULTS: The mean birth weight of newborns was 2. 6 kg with a range of 1. 2 to 3. 8 kg. The prevalence of LBW was 22. 9 %. Among the studied risk factors, 25 of them were significantly associated with the birth weight of a newborn on univariate logistic regression analysis. Maternal education [Odds Ratio (OR) 3. 2], exposure to passive smoking [OR 2. 3], age at first pregnancy ≥ 25 years [OR 3. 6], birth interval < 2 years [OR 2. 4], previous history of LBW baby [OR 3. 3], weight gain ≤ 4 kg during pregnancy [OR 7. 0], maternal weight <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of gestation ≤ 45 kg [OR 2. 3], pregnancy induced hypertension [OR 3. 3], high risk pregnancy [OR 3. 6] and late antenatal registration [OR 3. 6] emerged as significant risk factors on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The problem of LBW is multidimensional, and hence, we need an integrated approach incorporating medical, social, economical and educational measures to address this issue...|$|E
40|$|Among my {{many other}} {{activities}} these days, I 2 ̆ 7 m {{working on a}} new book … or something like that. That qualification reflects the uncertainty of the times. As volumes printed on paper evolve to newer media – at some point, a printed volume seems likely to become a luxury item – we 2 ̆ 7 re obliged to think about what constitutes a book in the digital age. I used to think I knew the answer, but I 2 ̆ 7 m no longer remotely sure. Two recent events have not cleared things up. After listening to smart and well-informed speakers at a "Future of Publishing" panel in California late last year, as well as <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> 2 ̆ 7 s "O 2 ̆ 7 Reilly Tools of Change for Publishing" conference in New York City, I found myself, if anything, less certain. It was easy, not so long ago, to say, "This is a book, and this isn 2 ̆ 7 t. " From the early Codex to hand-penned Bibles (created by "scribes"), Gutenberg 2 ̆ 7 s printing press through the late 20 th century, a book was a collection of bound pages. But as has happened with other media forms, digital technology has blurred the lines we once took for granted. On the internet, media formats easily cross boundaries – something we 2 ̆ 7 ve all seen in recent times. In the news business, for example, what were once print-only newspapers now create videos, and television channels have added articles that could easily appear in print. Everyone is using new tools, such as map/sensor mashups, to create a vast variety of forms that are native to the online world. We can still identify a newspaper if it 2 ̆ 7 s dropped at our doorstep – and some of us still get the New York Times delivered on Sundays – but take it online and it 2 ̆ 7 s clearly something else. The book 2 ̆ 7 s boundaries have moved as well, but not as far. It still functions as a linear, self-contained unit. It has a beginning, a middle and and end.

40|$|Aim and Background: Strenuous {{endurance}} training induces {{oxidative stress}} in athletes' body. Therefore, {{this study was}} designed to investigate the effects of curcumin supplementation and light resistance training during endurance training on soleus muscles antioxidant capacity (SOD) and lipid peroxidation (MDA) of serum in male Wistar rats. Material and Methods: For this experimental study, 36 healthy male Wistar rats, after 1 -week familiarization (age: 9 weeks and weights: 255. 62 ± 19. 99), were divided randomly into 6 groups: control (N= 6), curcumin (N= 6), endurance (N= 6), endurance+resistance (N= 6), endurance+curcumin (N= 6) and endurance+curcumin+resistance (N= 6). Incremental endurance training (8 weeks and 5 session a week) carried out on an animal treadmill. The speed and duration of running reached to 35 m/min for 70 min <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>week.</b>  Resistance training (8 weeks and 2 session a week) carried out on vertical ladder with extra weight (30 - 70 % BW) fixed on tail. The animals received curcumin supplement by intraperitoneal injection (8 weeks, 3 times per week, 30 mg/kg. Bw). SOD enzyme activity of skeletal muscle and serum MDA level was measured by ELISA and TBARS methods respectively. One way ANOVA were used for analysis of data.  Results: SOD enzyme activity of soleus muscle in endurance training group (1. 58 ± 0. 222 u/mg protein) was significantly (p= 0. 043) lower than control group (2. 22 ± 0. 481). Also SOD activity of soleus muscle in End+Res (1. 87 ± 0. 172; p= 0. 044), End+Cur (2. 14 ± 0. 229; p= 0. 039) and End+Cur+Res (2. 21 ± 0. 155; p= 0. 020) groups were significantly higher than endurance group. MDA level of serum in endurance training group (4. 27 ± 0. 438 nmol/mg protein) was significantly (p= 0. 031) higher than control group (3. 42 ± 0. 350) and MDA level of serum in End+Res (3. 04 ± 0. 342; p= 0. 023), End+Cur (2. 73 ± 0. 342; p= 0. 000) and End+Cur+Res (3. 27 ± 0. 349; p= 0. 008) groups were significantly lower than endurance group. Conclusion: Based on our results, the prolonged strenuous endurance training can induce oxidative stress and curcumin supplementation and light resistance training alone (Curcumin: SOD 35 % increase and MDA 50 % decrease; Resistance training: SOD 18 % increase and MDA 40 % decrease) and together (SOD 39 % increase and MDA 30 % decrease) could improve SOD enzyme activity and decrease the MDA levels. Thus, for those athletes who use strenuous endurance training, it could be suggest use from these supplements.  ...|$|E
