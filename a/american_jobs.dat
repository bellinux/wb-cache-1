50|$|Smith {{completed}} his first film, <b>American</b> <b>Job,</b> while attending the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Graduate Film Program. He {{was nominated for}} an Independent Spirit Awards Someone to Watch Award. Chris met Mark Borchardt (the subject of American Movie) while editing <b>American</b> <b>Job,</b> and began filming a documentary about the making of Mark's psychological thriller Coven. Both films played at the Sundance Film Festival, and American Movie was bought by Sony Pictures for $1 million.|$|R

25|$|He advocates US {{withdrawal}} from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) because, in his view, it causes the loss of more <b>American</b> <b>jobs</b> than it creates, and does not provide adequate protections for worker rights and safety and environmental safeguards. He is against the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) for the same reason.|$|E
25|$|On February 9, 2011 in {{a hearing}} before the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce Republican Congressmen said the science {{underpinning}} the EPA's regulatory effort was a hoax, questioned the EPA's interpretation of Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, and said the Obama administration would cost <b>American</b> <b>jobs.</b> EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said cleaning up the environment would improve health and create jobs.|$|E
25|$|Senators Boxer and John Ensign (R-NV) are {{the authors}} of the Invest in the USA Act. This legislation, which was signed into law in October 2004 as {{a small part of the}} more {{comprehensive}} <b>American</b> <b>Jobs</b> Creation Act, is intended to encourage American companies to bring overseas profits back to the United States, to create jobs in the U.S., and stimulate domestic economic growth.|$|E

25|$|As a {{constant}} critic of overfishing, Wilder has drawn {{the ire of}} fishermen throughout his career. Wilder believes in greater restrictions to prevent overfishing, saying that overfishing has kept fish stocks from naturally replenishing themselves and has decreased {{the quantity and quality}} of stocks. Wilder claims that as of 1998, overfishing in United States water has cost an estimated $8 billion loss in annual revenues and lost 300,000 <b>American</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{expatriation}} tax {{is a tax}} {{on individuals}} who renounce their citizenship or residence. The tax is often imposed based on a deemed disposition of all the individual's property. One example is the United States under the <b>American</b> <b>Jobs</b> Creation Act, where any individual who has a net worth of $2 million or an average income-tax liability of $127,000 who renounces his or her citizenship and leaves the country is automatically assumed to have done so for tax avoidance reasons and is subject to a higher tax rate.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the return}} of high fuel prices in the 2000s and 2010s, GM's {{interest}} in truly small-car programs for the U.S. market has been renewed. As part of General Motors Company development, GM revived one of its idled U.S. factories {{for the production of}} a small car in Orion, Michigan, with the creation of 1,200 <b>American</b> <b>jobs.</b> This {{will be the first time}} ever that a large manufacturer produces a supermini vehicle in the United States. This retooled plant will be capable of building 160,000 cars annually, including both small and compact vehicles. Production started in late 2011 with the Chevrolet Sonic.|$|E
50|$|In 1994 Gutiérrez was a vocal {{opponent}} of NAFTA and ultimately {{voted against the}} measure because of the legislation's failure to provide for worker retraining, protect against <b>American</b> <b>job</b> loss, and protect Mexican workers' collective bargaining rights.|$|R

50|$|One-stop career centers (or <b>American</b> <b>Job</b> Centers) {{are public}} {{employment}} {{offices in the}} United States. They are workforce information and education offices set up by Workforce Investment Boards as directed by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. One-stop career centers are implemented in all US States {{under a variety of}} different local names.|$|R
25|$|China's {{trade surplus}} is {{considered}} by some in the United States as threatening <b>American</b> <b>jobs.</b> In the 2000s, the Bush administration pursued protectionist policies such as tariffs and quotas to limit the import of Chinese goods. Some scholars argue that China's growing trade surplus {{is the result of}} industries in more developed Asian countries moving to China, and not a new phenomenon. China's trade policy, which allows producers to avoid paying the Value Added Tax (VAT) for exports and undervaluation of the currency since 2002, has resulted in an overdeveloped export sector and distortion of the economy overall, a result that could hamper future growth.|$|E
25|$|During the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney {{criticized the}} Obama Administration for holding General Motors stock {{for longer than}} he thought prudent. He said that the {{government}} should sell its General Motors stock holdings quickly and should seek alternatives to what he called excessive automotive industry regulation. He also said that fuel economy standards should be determined by market forces rather than by government mandates, and he called electric vehicles “a technology that people aren’t interested in.” GM and Chrysler have denied that their post-bailout returns to the Chinese market are attempts to outsource <b>American</b> <b>jobs,</b> as Romney claimed from a since corrected report by Bloomberg News.|$|E
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{came under}} heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA {{resulted in a}} loss of <b>American</b> <b>jobs.</b> NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding {{a situation in which the}} president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change. While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President Clinton would go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in 1993. NAFTA remains controversial for its impact on wages, jobs, and overall economic growth.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{directly}} {{inspired by the}} 1987 magazine [...] "American Job" [...] created by Randy Russell, which was a collection of job stories from low-wage workers around the United States. <b>American</b> <b>Job</b> was produced by Chris Smith, edited by Sarah Price and Chris Smith, and written by Doug Ruschaupt, Randy Russell, and Chris Smith.|$|R

50|$|Lower {{unemployment}} rates were another {{large part of}} Clinton’s macroeconomic policies. Many argue that Clinton cost many <b>Americans</b> <b>jobs</b> because he supported free trade, which some argue caused the U.S. to lose jobs to countries like China (Burns and Taylor 390). Even if Clinton did cost <b>Americans</b> some <b>jobs</b> because of free trade support, he allowed for more jobs than were lost because the unemployment rate of his presidency, and especially his second term, were the lowest {{they had been in}} thirty years (Burns and Taylor 390). Others attribute this to sustained declines in interest rates, which fueled a booming stock market and job growth in a booming technology sector.|$|R
500|$|Debate over tariffs {{would come}} to play a much larger role in the campaign. During the Civil War, Congress raised {{protective}} tariffs to new heights. This was done partly {{to pay for the}} war, but partly because high tariffs were popular in the North. [...] A high tariff meant that foreign goods were more expensive, which made it easier for American businesses to sell goods domestically. Republicans supported high tariffs as a way to protect <b>American</b> <b>jobs</b> and increase prosperity. Democrats, generally, saw them as making goods unnecessarily expensive and adding to the growing federal revenues when, {{with the end of the}} Civil War, that much revenue was no longer needed. Many Northern Democrats supported high tariffs, however, for the same economic reasons that their Republican neighbors did, so while Democratic platforms called for a tariff [...] "for revenue only," [...] their speakers avoided the question as much as possible.|$|E

A high tariff meant that foreign goods were more expensive, which made it easier for American businesses to sell goods domestically.

5000|$|Eli Broad {{was named}} by the California {{attorney}} general as a contributor to <b>Americans</b> for <b>Job</b> Security, a Virginia trade association. The money sent to <b>Americans</b> for <b>Job</b> Security was intended for [...] "issue advocacy," [...] meaning advertising that doesn't expressly urge Californians to vote one way or another. However, <b>Americans</b> for <b>Job</b> Security sent some of their donations to a Phoenix group, Americans for Responsible Leadership, which provided it to a small business action committee that opposed Proposition 30. It is unclear whether Eli Broad was aware that his donation would be used in this way, since he has stated that he supports higher taxes on the wealthy.|$|R
50|$|<b>American</b> <b>Job</b> is a 1996 {{independent}} film directed by Chris Smith. Shot in a satirical pseudo-documentary style, the film follows Randy, {{a young man}} living in a Midwestern US town, as he tries one mundane job after another, including monitoring a machine at a plastics factory, working as a clean-up person at a fast-food restaurant, cleaning motels, and becoming a telephone solicitor.|$|R
50|$|Erika James finds through {{studies and}} {{analysis}} {{that in general}} blacks have been promoted {{at a slower pace}} than whites.
