5|$|Wakeley saw Blast Corps as {{a puzzle}} game at its core. He was {{influenced}} by the 1994 Donkey Kong, in which the player begins each level with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> they need to finish but must learn how to use them. Wakeley said this was Blast Corp core game mechanic. He was also inspired by the Super Mario 64 demo at the 1995 Space World, which introduced him to the 3D analog stick and spurred him achieve something similar. The team's technical accomplishments included character and environment models composed completely of polygons and the absence of distance fog to obscure the draw distance.|$|E

25|$|A {{large number}} of variant {{annotation}} tools are available for variant annotation {{but in some cases}} the prediction by the tools does not agree since the way the rules have been defined differ slightly between each application. It is frankly impossible to perform a perfect comparison of the tools. Not <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> have same input and output and function. Here is a table of major annotation tools and it's functional area.|$|E

To monitor possible terrorist activity on the internet, he proposed better cyber-training to identify and track extremists, such as the couple behind the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. “We need to ensure that those on the frontlines protecting us have <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> they need to respond to threats, and to root out these terrorists at home and abroad,” Brown said.|$|E
25|$|Below the gun deck was {{the cargo}} hold where the {{passengers}} kept {{most of their}} food stores and other supplies. Other items included most of their clothing and bedding. The hold also stored the passengers' personal weapons and military equipment – armor, muskets, gunpowder, and shot, as well as swords and bandoliers. It also stored <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> that the Pilgrims would need, {{as well as all}} the equipment and utensils needed to prepare meals in the New World. It is also known that some Pilgrims loaded trade goods on board, including Isaac Allerton, William Mullins, and possibly others; these also most likely were stored in the cargo hold.|$|E
25|$|Current {{evidence}} suggests that the South Tomb was finished before the pyramid. The symbolic king’s inner palace, decorated in blue faience, is much more complete than that of the pyramid. Three chambers of this substructure are decorated in blue faience to imitate reed-mat facades, just like the pyramid. One room is decorated with three finely niche reliefs of the king, one depicting him running the Heb-sed. Importantly, Egyptian builders chose to employ their most skilled artisans and depict their finest art in the darkest, most inaccessible place in the complex. This highlights the fact that this impressive craftsmanship was not meant {{for the benefit of the}} living but was meant to ensure the king had <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> necessary for a successful afterlife.|$|E

25|$|During flight day 4, the MPLM Leonardo was berthed to the Nadir (the Earth-facing port on Harmony) {{using the}} Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS). Once it was berthed, the crews {{activated}} it {{and opened the}} hatch for ingress. Some more items were transferred from the shuttle mid-deck including the MDS experiment and the space suits Danny Olivas and Nicole Stott would use during EVA 1. The pair also prepared <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> {{that would be used}} during the EVA with some help from Tim Kopra. Later during the night when the crews were asleep, the team of ground controllers vented the Port 1 (P1) Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA) Nitrogen Vent lines in preparation for the ATA to be removed during EVA 1.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} deliver the {{developed}} product to the customer, the vendor needs to package the different components of its product into a package. By doing this, the customer will receive all the information and software components at once fulfilling all its needs. After combining all elements into one package the software vendor will carefully have to check if the package is complete. The package will have to provide the customer with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> and information to use the product. When {{this is not the}} case the software vendor will get a lot of questions from its customers which will consume a lot of time. It is therefore very important that the package is checked carefully before it is shipped. The package can be a physical combination of different elements packed into for example a box, but it can also be a digital combination of files which contain all the elements. Within the CCU process it is stated that a package will consist of five elements, being: software package, system description, manual, and license and management information. In the following paragraphs is explained how these elements fit into the CCU delivery phase.|$|E
25|$|Flight day 4 saw Nick Patrick and Bob Behnken get <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> {{they need}} ready for their spacewalk on flight day 5. While Patrick and Behnken were getting the tools ready, {{commander}} George Zamka and ISS flight engineer Soichi Noguchi swapped out the Hard Upper Torso (HUT) on Bob Behnken's suit, since the original HUT {{had developed a}} problem with a wire harness and was not powering the Wireless Video System (WVS) or the heaters in his gloves and boots. Once the swap was complete, Zamka and Noguchi tested the suit successfully. The crew also performed a number of transfer related activities during the morning of their work day. After a joint meal together, the crew of STS-130 and ISS commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer T.J. Creamer conducted a PAO event with T.V. stations in Sacramento, California, Mobile, Alabama and a radio station in St. Louis, Missouri. Once the PAO event was finished, the joint crews had some off duty time {{for the rest of the}} day. Before the two crews went to bed they conducted a spacewalk procedures review, then got Nick Patrick and Bob Behnken into the Quest Airlock. Behnken and Patrick spent the night there at 10.2 psi instead of at the station's 14.6 psi, breathing pure oxygen for an hour before and after their sleep period in order to prevent decompression sickness.|$|E

25|$|Public {{commercial}} {{use of the}} Internet began in mid-1989 with the connection of MCI Mail and Compuserve's email capabilities to the 500,000 users of the Internet. Just months later on 1 January 1990, PSInet launched an alternate Internet backbone for {{commercial use}}; one of the networks that would grow into the commercial Internet we know today. In March 1990, the first high-speed T1 (1.5 Mbit/s) link between the NSFNET and Europe was installed between Cornell University and CERN, allowing much more robust communications than were capable with satellites. Six months later Tim Berners-Lee would begin writing WorldWideWeb, the first web browser {{after two years of}} lobbying CERN management. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> necessary for a working Web: the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 0.9, the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the first Web browser (which was also a HTML editor and could access Usenet newsgroups and FTP files), the first HTTP server software (later known as CERN httpd), the first web server, and the first Web pages that described the project itself. In 1991 the Commercial Internet eXchange was founded, allowing PSInet to communicate with the other commercial networks CERFnet and Alternet. Since 1995 the Internet has tremendously impacted culture and commerce, including the rise of near instant communication by email, instant messaging, telephony (Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP), two-way interactive video calls, and the World Wide Web with its discussion forums, blogs, social networking, and online shopping sites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s, 10-Gbit/s, or more.|$|E

On September 20, 2000, Eidos Interactive and Ion Storm announced in a press release that they would be releasing the software development kit (SDK), which included <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> used to create the original game. Several team members, as well as project director Warren Spector, stated that they were [...] "really looking forward to seeing what [...] does with our tools". The kit was released on September 22, 2000, and soon gathered community interest, followed by the release of tutorials, small mods, up to announcements of large mods and conversions. While ION Storm did not hugely alter the engine's rendering and core functionality, they introduced role-playing elements.|$|E

[...] He further stated that [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] is a step [...] "bluesier and evil-er, sounding more from the legacy of Howlin’ Wolf and Screamin’ Jay Hawkins—not quite as guttural, but Ush still uses <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> at his disposal, even breaking out the fake voodoo accent, and more than gets the point across." ...|$|E
