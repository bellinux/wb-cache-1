40|$|The {{development}} of a technology for building electrically alterable read only memories (EAROMs) or reprogrammable read only memories (RPROMs) using a single level metal gate p channel MOS process with all conventional processing steps is outlined. Nonvolatile storage of data is achieved {{by the use of}} charged floating gate electrodes. The floating gates are charged by <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection</b> of hot electrodes through gate oxide, and discharged by <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection</b> of hot holes through gate oxide. Three extra diffusion and patterning steps are all that is required to convert a standard p channel MOS process into a nonvolatile memory process. For identification, this nonvolatile memory technology was given the descriptive acronym DIFMOS which stands for Dual Injector, Floating gate MOS...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hydration}} and ion penetration in silicon dioxide {{has been studied}} by fabricating metal oxide semiconductor capacitors on oxide exposed to acidic solutions with and without bias. Changes in oxide properties due to exposure have been probed using <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection.</b> Oxide charge build-up and interface state generation in the capacitors have been monitored. The measurements show that before <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection</b> the capacitance voltage plots for the various electrolyte exposure conditions are similar. However, oxide integrity degradation is different for cathodic bias compared with anodic bias or no bias. This is due to penetration of protons or hydroxyl ions in the oxide, producing hydrogen-related defects that affect trapping and interface state generation...|$|R

40|$|Electrically alterable {{read-only}} memories (EAROM's) or reprogrammable read-only memories (RPROM's) can be fabricated using a single-level metal-gate p-channel MOS {{technology with}} all conventional processing steps. Given the acronym DIFMOS for dual-injector floating-gate MOS, this technology utilizes the floating-gate technique for nonvolatile storage of data. <b>Avalanche</b> <b>injection</b> of hot electrons through gate oxide from a special injector diode in each bit {{is used to}} charge the floating gates. A second injector structure included in each bit permits discharge of the floating gate by <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection</b> of holes through gate oxide. The overall design of the DIFMOS bit is dictated by the physical considerations required {{for each of the}} avalanche injector types. The end result is a circuit technology which can provide fully decoded bit-erasable EAROM-type circuits using conventional manufacturing techniques...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation of}} hole trapping in 20 - 30 nm nitrided oxides {{as a function}} of the nitridation conditions were performed using the <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection</b> technique. Nitridation carried out at relatively low temperatures (700 - 800 °C) and for short times brings about an increase of hole traps. Hole trapping reduction can only be achieved for more severe nitridation conditions. The effect of postnitridation annealing in oxygen was also studied...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an {{implementation of a}} novel fatigue monitoring sensor based on integration of piezoelectric transduction with floating gate <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection.</b> The miniaturized sensor enables continuous battery-less monitoring and time-to-failure predictions of biomechanical implants. Measured results from a fabricated prototype in a 0. 5 μm CMOS process indicate that the device can compute cumulative statistics of electrical signals generated by piezoelectric transducer, while consuming less that 1 μW of power. The ultra-low power operation makes the sensor attractive for integration with poly-vinylidene diflouride (PVDF) based transducers that have already proven to be biocompatible. I...|$|R
30|$|Several {{analytical}} {{techniques have}} been used for determination of copper, including atomic absorption spectrometry, atomic emission spectrometry, electroanalytical techniques, spectrophotometry, inductive coupled plasma-emission spectrometry, inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, flow <b>injection</b> <b>diode</b> array spectrophotometry and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (Pinto et al. 2004; Kruanetr et al. 2008; Gouda and Amin 2014; Nalawade et al. 2015; Tarighat 2016). However, spectrophotometry methods are often preferred, as they involve inexpensive instrument, less labor-intensive, and provide comparable sensitivity when appropriate chromogenic reagents are available (Dalman et al. 2002; Fu and Yuan 2007; Sabel et al. 2010; Kamble et al. 2011).|$|R

The action {{described by a}} production rule is realized {{by means of the}} decoder in which a pattern of connections coreesponds to that of stimuli. According to "S. Karasawa,(Proc. of CCCT, Vol. 5, pp. 194 - 1999, Austin, Texas, August, 2004) ", each program mable controllable connection among inputs is realized by a floating gate <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection</b> MOS FET, where inverted signals are used at writing, and the detection of matching between inputs and connections is carried out by using the signal source in which low level signal is provided via comparatively smaller resistance than high level...|$|R

40|$|Thermal noise calculations, {{based on}} the Langevin procedure, are given for a double <b>injection</b> <b>diode</b> {{operating}} in the insulator regime. The frequency range is restricted to frequencies smaller than the reciprocal free carrier transit times. It turns out that at high frequencies the spectral density of the ac short circuit current fluctuations can be described by Nyquist's formula. At low frequencies an additional term, proportional to (1 +ω 2 τ 2) − 1 was found, where τ is the hole life time. The low frequency thermal noise level may be some orders of magnitude larger than the level at high frequencies. It is shown that in general the frequency dependent term will be masked by generation recombination noise. A special case is indicated where those contributions become comparable...|$|R

40|$|An isothermal, {{two-dimensional}} {{numerical calculation}} of the potential and current distribution in an n(2 ̆ 7 +) -p-n-n(2 ̆ 7 +) bipolar power transistor driving an inductive load during its turnoff transient has been carried out. The transistor is initially considered {{to be in a}} heavily saturated 2 ̆ 7 on 2 ̆ 7 state and is then turned off by extracting a constant base current. The simulation shows that during the turnoff transient, current constriction {{to the center of the}} emitter together with the increasing collector-emitter voltage produces a high electric field near the collector n-n(2 ̆ 7 +) junction which can initiate <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection.</b> It has been found that the collector current density is not uniform vertically (from collector to emitter) due to the current spread-out in the collector n-region. Previous one-dimensional analytical analyses of second breakdown did not consider this important effect. Thus, for an accurate prediction of reverse second breakdown voltage, the two-dimensional current flow should be considered. ...|$|R
40|$|Topics {{related to}} {{processing}} and hardness assurance are considered, {{taking into account}} the radiation hardening of CMOS technologies, technological advances in the manufacture of radiation-hardened CMOS integrated circuits, CMOS hardness assurance through process controls and optimized design procedures, the application of operational amplifiers to hardened systems, a hard off-the-shelf SG 1524 pulse width modulator, and the gamma-induced voltage breakdown anomaly in a Schottky diode. Basic mechanisms are examined, giving attention to chemical and structural aspects of the irradiation behavior of SiO 2 films on silicon, experimental observations of the chemistry of the SiO 2 /Si interface, leakage current phenomena in irradiated SOS devices, the <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection</b> of holes into SiO 2, the low-temperature radiation response of Al 2 O 3 gate insulators, and neutron damage mechanisms in silicon at 10 K.

40|$|In recent years, {{a growing}} number of {{applications}} demand better timing resolution from single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). The challenge is pursuing improved timing resolution without impairing other device characteristics such as quantum efficiency and dark count rate. This task requires a clear understanding of the statistical phenomena involved in the avalanche current growth in order to drive the device engineering process. Past studies state that in Si SPADs the <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection</b> position statistics is the main contribution to the photon-timing jitter. However, in recent re-engineered devices, this assumption has been questioned. To address this issue, we developed an experimental setup capable of characterizing the photon-timing jitter {{as a function of the}} injection position by means of a laser focused on the device active area. The results not only confirmed that the injection position statistics is not the main contribution to photon-timing jitter, but also evidenced interesting dependences of the timing performances on the injection position. Furthermore, we found a relationship between the photon-timing jitter and the specific resistance of the devices, which has been investigated by means of photoluminescence measurements...|$|R

Past studies state that in Si-SPADs the <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection</b> position statistics is the main contribution to the photon-timing jitter.

For the purpose of assessing for good this contribution we developed an experimental setup in order to characterize the photontiming jitter {{as a function of the}} injection position by means of TCSPC measurements with a laser focused on the device active area. Results confirmed not only that the injection position is not the main contribution to the photon-timing jitter but also evidenced a radial dependence never observed before. Furthermore we found a relation between the photon-timing jitter and the specific resistance of the devices. To characterize the resistances we studied the avalanche current density distribution in the device active area by imaging the photo-luminescence due to hot-carrier emission...|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} of damping {{relaxation}} oscillations in <b>injection</b> laser <b>diodes</b> is described. This method involves {{the operation of}} the laser {{as a part of a}} bipolar transistor, and the damping is accomplished by reducing the carrier lifetime in the laser active region only at frequencies near resonance.

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} {{breakdown}} and charge trapping in silicon dioxide (SiO 2) have been studied. Firstly, {{the locations of}} charge trapped immediately prior to breakdown and of defects created under the high field stress were established using the photo I-V and <b>avalanche</b> <b>injection</b> techniques. Both positive and negative charge was found and in all cases charge build-up under high field conditions was at the interfaces, not in {{the bulk of the}} SiO 2. Electron trap creation occurred predominantly near to the non-injecting interface, Qbd, the total charge which can be injected prior to breakdown, was examined under different current injection conditions. It was found to be strongly dependent on the duty cycle, the temperature and the gate electrode and to vary as 1 /Eox, where Eox is the average field across the oxide. The Weibull distribution was found to describe well the statistics of breakdown in both wearout and dielectric strength measurements. It was shown that the Weibull parameters a and b have the same values whichever of these methods is used to measure them. The breakdown mechanism is probably the same in both wearout and dielectric strength measurements, therefore. Oxide degradation was also examined under the less severe conditions of bias-temperature strength (BTS). It was shown, using <b>avalanche</b> hole <b>injection</b> before and after negative BTS, that the positive charge generated during negative BTS is due to trapping of holes in intrinsic hole traps. This is accompanied by interface state generation across the whole band gap. The density of these states is linearly proportional to the number of holes trapped. On subsequent application of a positive BTS, the holes were all detrapped or neutralised. At this time a peak also appeared in the interface state density at - 0. 2 eV above midgap. This may be due to a redistribution of previously generated states rather than to the creation of new states. The charge pumping technique was used to show that the peak is in fact due to interface states and not to lateral non-uniformities in the surface potential...|$|R

40|$|The {{calibration}} {{of radio}} antenna performance is a well-understood process. For system noise measurements {{in the current}} Deep Space Network (DSN), a noise diode is used along with an ambient absorber that is placed over the feed to make a direct measurement of the system noise {{as well as to}} characterize the diode. For future arrays, consisting {{of a large number of}} antennas, it will be necessary to min-imize the amount of hardware, electronics, and time spent on each antenna. This work describes an effort to use the moon as the standard calibrator for the system noise <b>injection</b> <b>diode.</b> This work was inspired by the recent demonstration of con-sistency of very accurate pre-existing lunar brightness temperature maps, physical optics characterization of the 34 -m beam-waveguide antenna patterns, and Moon-centered measurements at the DSN’s research and development antenna, DSS 13. The brightness temperature maps and antenna patterns were convolved to yield ex-pected antenna temperatures for comparison with the Moon-centered observations. Due to limitations caused by atmospheric effects, the absolute calibration of the system diode will have larger error bounds as compared with the use of an ambient aperture load. However, results are very adequate for rapid, ongoing checks of the health and noise level of the receiving system. We describe the proposed method as used on the DSN Array breadboard antennas, with results and error analyses. I...|$|R
