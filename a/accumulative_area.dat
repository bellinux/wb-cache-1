I t is smaller than other ones in Chile, but - at the same time - better conserved,offering good conditions for genetic, kinematic and geochronologic studies,respecting volcanic mudflows. From the genetic and kinematic point of view, the longitudinal lahar profile maybe in two parts: a) An upper and middle <b>accumulative</b> <b>area,</b> with concavetransverse profile; b) A low accumulative area; whose transverse profile is convexe. These two profiles could be explained by means of braking process inlateral parts, related to central parts, as a function of longitudinal distoncesfrom the origin. From the geochronologic point of view, the lahar was between theLast Glaciation and Late Glacial times. Therefore, i t is more recent than otherones. ...|$|E

Within {{the framework of}} this method, the interconnected multi-area electric energy system is decomposed into several subsystems, {{each of which is}} controlled separately by a decentralised regulator. An especially attractive feature of the proposed control scheme is that it requires as input signals <b>accumulative</b> quantities of <b>area</b> control error. An additional feature is that it needs no information exchanges (telemeterings) among areas. The realization of such a regulator may be easy and of low cost because of its simple construction. In this paper, we apply the above method to 2 ～ 5 area systems provided with nonreheat type turbines. The results show that the proposed decentralised discrete-type regulator can act satisfactorily for improving dynamic responses of the load-frequency control...|$|R

40|$|Rainfall {{caused by}} typhoon {{is not only}} the {{important}} income of water resources, but also the key factor of disturbing the spatial distribution of soil and water resources in Taiwan. It will be help to realize the spatial distribution of soil and water resources and movement of sedimentation for our homeland by studying the spatial variations of typhoon rainfall. Watershed is a unit of topography and an elementary area that applied for the topics of spatial hydrology and sediment movement. This study first used the first law of geography and nonparametric statistics test, and then chose 19 rain gauge stations to analyze the spatial variations of typhoon rainfalls by areal reduction factor curves in the Nam Shih Creek watershed of Northern Taiwan for different durations and return periods. The results of typhoon rainfall spatial distribution from semivariograms analysis of different durations and return periods showed that the range is about 7. 4 km, and the spatial variation increasing by durations and return periods under the range in this site. The semivariogram models built by former analysis used as the input functions for Kriging that making isohyetal maps by integrating GIS. From the isohyetal maps, we can display the spatial distribution of rainfall caused by typhoons in Nan Shih Creek watershed. The spatial distributions of typhoon rainfall lessen gradually from east to west and south to north in this area. Such being the cases, the apparent spatial variations of typhoon rainfall is in the eastern and southern parts of this watershed. For the sake of understanding the relationship between typhoon rainfall degradation and area of distribution, this study applied the isohyetal maps that drawn in the former part to extract areal reduction factors of different durations and return periods, and forming the areal reduction factor curves. As a result of areal reduction factor curves, the areal reduction factors of typhoon rainfalls decayed with <b>accumulative</b> <b>areas</b> of spatial distribution by the power law. The areal reduction factor curves decrease mildly with the rainfall durations on increasing in the fixed return period. In the condition of fixed durations, the areal reduction factor curves also grow less mildly with the return periods extend. In previously description, it shows that the spatial variations of typhoon rainfall trend unvarying in Nan Shih Creek watershed. 颱風為台灣夏秋兩季常見的天氣現象，其所引發之大量降雨除了為台灣地區每年重要之水資源收獲外，亦為擾動該區水土資源空間分布之主因，同時也是此區域大規模土砂災害如山崩、土石流之啟動因子。故探討並瞭解颱風降雨之空間分布的變異性質，對於台灣水土資源之空間分配，以及土砂運動之掌握皆會有所助益。 集水區為地形劃分之單元，常被作為水文、土砂運動分析等研究之單位區域，故本研究亦以集水區為對象，進行颱風降雨空間變異特性之探討。本研究選擇位於台灣北部地區的南勢溪集水區，並依地理學第一定律，挑選鄰接本區之雨量站，以無母數統計進行檢定篩選後，計選取 19 個雨量站，以其所紀錄之歷年 1 小時最大颱風降雨量為基準，推求 2 、 6 、 12 、 18 及 24 小時等不同延時之最大颱風降雨量，再應用甘保氏極端值第一類分布分析重現期距為 5 、 10 、 25 及 50 年等不同頻率年之降雨量，所得結果以地理統計進行分析並建立區域型降雨面積遞減因子曲線，藉以探討集水區颱風降雨量空間分布之變異特性。 由地理統計之半變異函數分析結果顯示，南勢溪集水區颱風降雨空間分布之影響範圍為 7. 4 公里，即各雨量站彼此間的距離如超過此範圍，其雨量資料之空間變異性不隨距離增加而變化；而在影響範圍之內，本區之颱風降雨空間分布會隨降雨延時及重現期距的增加而加大其空間變異程度。 為具體表現本區之颱風降雨空間分布之情形，遂以前項所得之半變異函數作為克利金推估之輸入函數，並應用地理資訊系統建立等雨量線分布圖。由等雨量線圖顯示，南勢溪集水區颱風降雨之分布分別由東向西以及南向北之方向遞減；颱風降雨中心多發生於福山雨量站所在之區域，降雨量則由福山雨量站向東朝下盆雨量站方向遞減；另外，位於本區北端之大桶山雨量所處之區域，則是另一處發生明顯降雨空間變化的地區，故颱風降雨在南勢溪集水區內的分布具有空間變異之特性。 有關颱風降雨量遞減程度如何隨降雨分布面積的改變而變化，遂以所得之等雨量線圖進行不同延時及重現期距之颱風降雨面積遞減因子分析，並建立其隨累積分布面積百分比而變化之降雨面積遞減因子曲線。結果顯示颱風降雨面積遞減因子會隨累積分布面積之增加，依冪定律模式呈現曲線型態之衰減。目次 圖目次	III 表目次	V 摘要	VII 第一章 前言	 1 1. 1 研究緣起	 1 1. 2 研究動機與目的	 3 第二章 文獻回顧	 5 2. 1 空間降雨分析	 5 2. 2 降雨面積遞減因子曲線 	 7 第三章 研究資料與方法 12 3. 1 研究流程	 12 3. 2 南勢溪集水區及其雨量站概況 14 3. 3 無母數統計之檢定	 18 3. 4 水文頻率分析－甘保氏極端值第一類分布	 20 3. 5 地理統計	 22 3. 6 圖層套疊分析	 40 3. 7 降雨面積遞減因子 41 第四章 結果與討論	 43 4. 1 雨量站挑選檢定作業	 43 4. 2 颱風降雨頻率分析	 49 4. 3 半變異函數模式分析與等雨量圖	 52 4. 4 降雨面積遞減因子曲線	 74 第五章 結論與建議	 85 5. 1 結論	 85 5. 2 建議	 87 參考文獻 	 89 附錄	 94 A. 拉格蘭日(LAGRANGIAN) 函數法	 94 B. 共變異數與半變異數之關係	 9...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the southwestern}} Fujian metallogenic belt, {{one of the}} {{important}} Fe polymetallic belts in southern China, was chosen as a case study area to evaluate the uncertainty due to missing evidence in mineral prospectivity mapping. Four geological features were considered important for mineral prospectivity mapping based on the geological model for skarn deposits in the belt: (1) the Yanshanian granitic intrusions, because they provided energy, fluids, and part of the metal budget; (2) faults, because they served as pathways for hydrothermal fluids; (3) the Carboniferous–Permian carbonate sequences, because they supplied part of the metal budget and served as host rocks for ore deposition; and (4) geochemical anomalies, because they indicate presence of skarn-type alteration and mineralization. Four separate predictive evidence layers depicting each the above geological features were extracted from relevant geoscience data and were integrated using a modified fuzzy weights-of-evidence model, which retains the advantages of both fuzzy weights-of-evidence and logistic regression modeling. The results show that most of the known Fe deposits occur in or near, and thus have strong correlation with, areas of high posterior probabilities, as indicated by the delineated prospective areas that occupy only 4. 6 % of the studied region but contain 88. 5 % {{of the total number of}} known Fe deposits. Different combinations of predictive evidence layers were used to examine prediction uncertainty related to missing evidence. Plots of accumulative number of Fe deposits versus <b>accumulative</b> prospective <b>areas</b> show that the order of the most to the least important evidence of mineral prospectivity in the studied region is: favorable rock types > geochemical anomalies > intrusive rocks > faults. Results of blind testing the prospectivity models indicate that the geological model of Fe mineralization in the belt is suitable for predicting exploration target areas for skarn-type Fe deposits, and suggest that the highest risk in follow-up exploration is related to sequences of carbonates in the Carboniferous–Permian formations that were likely either not mapped or not represented at the present regional scale of mapping...|$|R
