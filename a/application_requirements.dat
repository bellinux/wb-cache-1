The <b>application</b> <b>requirement</b> may vary over time depending on many factors (for instance load on the application); user may run different types of application (a simple MS word to complex HPC application) in a VM. In such cases if the VM instance capacity is fixed there is a high possibility of mismatch between the VM capacity and <b>application</b> resource <b>requirement.</b> If the VM capacity is more than the <b>application</b> resource <b>requirement</b> then resource will be wasted; if the VM capacity is less than the <b>application</b> resource <b>requirement</b> then the <b>application</b> performance will degrade.
