50|$|The {{relationship}} between the limitanei, of the border <b>armies,</b> <b>and</b> the pseudocomitatenses, the lowest-ranking units of the field armies, remains unclear. Theodor Mommsen proposed that the pseudocomitatenses were former units of limitanei incorporated into the mobile field <b>armies,</b> <b>and</b> most authors since have followed his theory. E.C. Nischer proposed the alternate theory that the pseudocomitatenses were positional garrison units which were independent of the border <b>armies</b> <b>and</b> thus placed under the same command as the field armies.|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} {{military}} units {{available to the}} empires vary. Germany, Russia, Italy, and France get eight <b>armies</b> <b>and</b> eight fleets each.

The new regime, known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. It had been imposed by a foreign invading <b>army</b> <b>and</b> destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French satellite state. The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the French <b>Army</b> <b>and</b> the local population's resistance to the occupation.|$|E
