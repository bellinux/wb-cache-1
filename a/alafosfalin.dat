40|$|A new phosphonopeptide, <b>alafosfalin,</b> was {{evaluated}} for in vitro antibacterial activity and for synergism with beta-lactams, using 475 Japanese clinical isolates from urinary tract infections. <b>Alafosfalin</b> {{was found to}} be highly active against Escherichia coli and moderately active against Serratia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter, but less active against gram-positive organisms than were beta-lactams such as cephazolin or ampicillin and inactive against indole-positive Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter. Potentiation with the two beta-lactams (fractional inhibitory concentration {{less than or equal to}} 0. 5) was found in 10 to 40 % of susceptible strains in 4 : 1 and 1 : 4 combinations, and to a lesser extent in those species or genera that were insensitive to <b>alafosfalin</b> alone. No cross resistance was seen between <b>alafosfalin</b> and the beta-lactams or any other commonly used antibacterial agents tested. Effect on selected ampicillin-resistant strains, differential sensitivity to <b>alafosfalin</b> among resistant strains of various types, and sensitivity of alafosfalin-insensitive E. coli and Klebsiella to other antibiotics are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alafosfalin,</b> an {{antibacterial}} phosphonodipeptide requiring peptide transport for activity, {{was tested}} for activity against clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria in peptide-free Roche Sensitivity Test Medium no. 5 agar. It was active against Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Clostridium perfringens but not against Clostridium difficile. <b>Alafosfalin</b> activity was antagonized by appropriate peptides. Synergy was obtained with other cell wall-active antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|The phosphonopeptide <b>alafosfalin</b> (L-alanyl-L- 1 -aminoethylphosphonic acid) {{exhibited}} synergy {{in vitro}} and in animal studies against {{a range of}} bacterial genera when combined with cephalexin. <b>Alafosfalin</b> also showed synergy with mecillinam and, to a much lesser extent, with ampicillin. Synergy with cephalexin was more pronounced when the bacteria were relatively insensitive to the beta-lactam component. The action of this combination involved both an inhibitory and a bacteriolytic mechanism which was abolished by concurrent treatment with the aminopeptidase inhibitor, bestatin. Regrowth of subpopulation resistant to either component was markedly reduced by the combination. The potential of <b>alafosfalin</b> combined with cephalexin for use in therapy is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Potentiating {{activity}} of <b>alafosfalin</b> was examined in detail with 8 cephalosporins and mecillinam against 164 urinary bacteria representing 8 genera. <b>Alafosfalin</b> was generally comparable in activity to cefamandole and mecillinam but superior to other cephalosporins tested. When the minimal fractional inhibitory concentration indices were compared, synergism was observed {{with all of}} the beta-lactams tested for all species except Streptococcus faecalis. Marked synergism was observed with Escherichia coli, Citrobacter, and enterobacter and, among the drugs tested, with cefamandole and mecillinam. Although <b>alafosfalin</b> is inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, potentiation was seen with cefsulodin. The most favorable combination ratio of alafosfalin/cephalosporin to elicit potentiation was determined for each species and occurred in a rather narrow range of combinations (1 : 4 to 4 : 1 in general) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} and pharmacokinetics of a synthetic antibacterial phosphonodipeptide, <b>alafosfalin,</b> {{have been studied}} in rats, baboons, and human volunteers. The compound was rapidly absorbed from the injection site after subcutaneous and intramuscular administration and gave peak plasma concentrations at 15 to 20 min after dosing. Distribution studies showed that high drug concentrations were produced in inflammatory exudates and most tissues except brain. <b>Alafosfalin</b> was rapidly cleared from the general circulation, mainly by the kidney. Plasma half-lives were 20 min in rats and approximately 1 h in baboons and humans. <b>Alafosfalin</b> was well absorbed after oral administration, but was extensively hydrolyzed to alanine and L- 1 -aminoethylphosphonic acid before it reached the general circulation. This first-pass metabolism was less marked in humans than in animals. Administration of 200 -mg intramuscular and 500 -mg oral doses produced concentrations of intact phosphonodipeptide in human plasma and urine which were {{in excess of the}} in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations for many pathogenic organisms. The rate of absorption and elimination of <b>alafosfalin</b> in humans were also very similar to published data on beta-lactam antibiotics. This suggests that the pharmacokinetics can be matched to provide synergistic combinations for clinical use...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alafosfalin</b> is a phosphonodipeptide with {{significant}} activity as an antibacterial agent {{and as a}} potentiator of beta-lactam antibiotics. Studies in humans showed that oral doses of 50 to 2, 500 mg were well absorbed, but some metabolic hydrolysis occurred before the drug reached the general circulation. Oral bioavailability was approximately 50 % and was largely independent of dose. <b>Alafosfalin</b> has an elimination half-life of about 60 min and does not accumulate during chronic administration. Healthy volunteers excreted intact phosphonodipeptide in the urine. The recovery was dose dependent and increase from 6 +/- 1 % after 50 -mg doses to 17 +/- 1 % after 2, 500 -mg doses. This change with dose occurred because the human kidney has a small, saturable capacity for reabsorbing the phosphonopeptide. Less <b>alafosfalin</b> was excreted in the urine of subjects with impaired glomerular function. When <b>alafosfalin</b> was coadministered with cephalexin, both compounds wer absorbed, distributed, and eliminated at virtually identical rates. Oral administration of 500 mg of the phosphonodipeptide plus 250 mg of the beta-lactam antibiotic gave approximately equal concentrations of the drugs in plasma, with a fourfold excess of cephalexin in the urine. This 2 : 1 combination is being tested in the clinic...|$|E
40|$|The {{selectivity}} of a {{range of}} culture media for the detection of Salmonella was assessed using 435 strains of gram-negative bacteria. These media showed limited ability to inhibit non-Salmonella strains found in stool samples. We report the evaluation of <b>alafosfalin</b> as a selective agent for isolation of Salmonella from stool samples. Susceptibility studies with this agent showed that non-typhi Salmonella strains were relatively resistant (mean MIC, 10. 2 mg/liter) compared to many coliforms including Escherichia coli (mean MIC, 0. 7 mg/liter). A chromogenic medium, ABC medium, was modified to incorporate <b>alafosfalin</b> and was compared with standard ABC medium and Hektoen enteric agar for the isolation of Salmonella from 1, 000 stool samples. On direct culture, modified ABC medium showed higher recovery of Salmonella (53. 6 %) compared with either ABC medium (35. 7 %) or Hektoen enteric agar (48. 2 %). We conclude that <b>alafosfalin</b> is a useful selective agent for the isolation of Salmonella from stool samples...|$|E
40|$|Of {{the three}} {{bacterial}} peptide transport systems only one, the oligopeptide permease, {{has been characterized}} in any detail. We have now isolated Salmonella typhimurium mutants deficient in a second transport system, the tripeptide permease (Tpp), using the toxic peptide <b>alafosfalin.</b> <b>Alafosfalin</b> resistance mutations map at three loci, the gene encoding peptidase A (pepA) and two transport-defective loci, tppA and tppB. Locus tppA has been mapped to 74 min on the S. typhimurium chromosome, cotransducible with aroB, and is a positive regulator of tppB. Locus tppB maps at 27 min in the cotransduction gap between purB and pyrF. We cloned tppB, the structural locus for the tripeptide permease. Two simple methods are described for mapping the location of cloned DNA fragments on the chromosome of S. typhimurium...|$|E
40|$|Dipeptide {{variants}} of <b>alafosfalin</b> (L-alanyl-L- 1 -aminoethylphosphonic acid) with substantial differences in potency and antibacterial spectrum in vitro and in vivo have been synthesized. Certain dipeptides with {{alternatives to the}} L-alanyl residue had broader antibacterial spectra; activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was included. Some compounds had better in vivo activity than <b>alafosfalin</b> when introduced into infected rodents orally, but {{for the majority of}} the more active phosphonodipeptides, parenteral administration was more effective. Certain oligopeptides derived from the more active phosphonodipeptides possessed good in vitro activity against an extended range of organisms; they included Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vivo activity of some of these phosphono-oligopeptides was significantly greater than that of the parent dipeptide and correlated well with the in vitro results. This indicates that phosphono-oligopeptides exert part of their in vivo action directly, in addition to that arising from smaller peptides produced by peptidase cleavage...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of novel molecular tools {{has provided the}} scientific community with quick, easy, and scientifically sound ways of identifying individual strains belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc). Bcc strains isolated from the sputum of 44 patients attending the Freeman Hospital Cardiopulmonary Transplant Unit were genotyped using recA PCR-RFLP analysis, and a clonality study performed using PFGE analysis. It was found that B. cenocepacia and B. multivorans were the predominant colonizing strains in these patients, and that infection with the ET- 12 epidemic clone was the most prevalent strain amongst B. cenocepacia- infected patients. It was also found that pre-transplant strains remained responsible for post-transplant infections. Phenotypic methods for the identification of Bcc strains and closely related organisms {{have been difficult to}} develop. A collection of 493 strains including Burkholderia cepacia (genomovars I- IX), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other closely related organisms, were investigated for their abilities to produce a wide range of peptidases, glycosidases, esterases and other miscellaneous enzymes using both chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates. The 312 Bcc strains within the collection were also screened for their capacity to oxidise a number of carbohydrates. The heterogeneous nature of all nine Bcc species was confirmed by this study, as was the close phenotypic relationship of B. cepacia and B. cenocepacia. Some substrates, however, were shown to have some taxonomic utility for the differentiation of species within the Bcc and also for closely related organisms. Metabolic activities that showed diagnostic potential included production of 13 -ribosidase, 13 -xylosidase and 13 -glucosidase, as well as oxidation of cellobiose, maltose and trehalose. Screening for palmitate esterase and a or 13 -trypsin production was useful for the differentiation of Pandoraea sp. and Ralstonia picketti respectively. CF infections caused by P. aeruginosa and Bcc strains, are most successfully treated using two or three drug combinations. A number of cell wall-acting antibiotics were tested in combination with the phosphonopeptide <b>alafosfalin</b> for synergistic effects against Bcc and P. aeruginosa strains. <b>Alafosfalin</b> was most effective in combination with ceftazidime against Bcc strains, and in combination with tobramycin and ceftazidime as a triple combination against P. aeruginosa...|$|E
40|$|The ydgR gene of Escherichia coli encodes {{a protein}} of the proton-dependent {{oligopeptide}} transporter (POT) family. We cloned YdgR and overexpressed the His-tagged fusion protein in E. coli BL 21 cells. Bacterial growth inhibition {{in the presence}} of the toxic phosphonopeptide <b>alafosfalin</b> established YgdR functionality. Transport was abolished {{in the presence of}} the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone, suggesting a proton-coupled transport mechanism. YdgR transports selectively only di- and tripeptides and structurally related peptidomimetics (such as aminocephalosporins) with a substrate recognition pattern almost identical to the mammalian peptide transporter PEPT 1. The YdgR protein was purified to homogeneity from E. coli membranes. Blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy of detergent-solubilized YdgR suggest that it exists in monomeric form. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a crown-like structure with a diameter of approximately 8 nm and a central density. These are the first structural data obtained from a proton-dependent peptide transporter, and the YgdR protein seems an excellent model for studies on substrate and inhibitor interactions as well as on the molecular architecture of cell membrane peptide transporters...|$|E
40|$|Peptide {{transport}} and peptidase susceptibility of the antibacterial agent <b>alafosfalin</b> and other phosphonopeptides have been characterized in Escherichia coli. Phosphonodipeptides were accumulated {{by a process}} which appeared to involve multiple permeases; saturation was not achieved even at concentrations of 128 microM. Competition studies showed that these compounds had only a low affinity for the system transporting phosphonooligopeptides and were rapidly taken up by and were inhibitory to E. coli mutants unable to transport the toxic peptide triornithine. Phosphonodipeptides containing D-residues were not appreciably transported. By contrast, phosphonooligopeptides were generally transported by a distinct saturable permease system for which they had a high affinity. This system was identical to that utilized by triornithine. Phosphonooligopeptides with simple monoalkyl substituents at the amino terminus were also transported except {{in the case of}} a t-butyl substituent. The oligopeptide permease was also able to transport certain derivatives which contained some residues having D rather than L stereochemistry. Intracellular metabolism of phosphonooligopeptides was initiated almost exclusively by hydrolysis from the N terminus by an L-specific peptidase. This initial hydrolytic activity was unaffected by the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin, unlike the final hydrolysis step which yields L- 1 -aminoethylphosphonic acid from the phosphonodipeptide intermediate...|$|E
40|$|Phosphonopeptides {{based on}} aminomethylphosphonic acid as the C-terminal residue linked to L-amino acids possessed {{antibacterial}} activity in vitro and in vivo. Analogs {{in this series}} were generally less potent than corresponding compounds based on L- 1 -aminoethylphosphonic acid such as <b>alafosfalin</b> (L-alanyl-L- 1 -aminoethylphosphonic acid). Significant differences in antibacterial spectra were observed. The mechanism of action involved active transport of the peptide mimetics into the bacterial cells, followed by intracellular release of high concentrations of aminomethylphosphonic acid which inhibited bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. Aminomethylphosphonic acid behaved as a mimetic of both D- and L-alanine and inhibited D-Ala-D-Ala synthetase (EC 6. 3. 2. 4.), alanine racemase (EC 5. 1. 1. 1.), and UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine synthetase (EC 6. 3. 2. 8.). The minimal inhibitory concentration of L-norvalyl-aminomethylphosphonic acid was essentially unaffected {{by the presence of}} D-alanine, whereas the activity of the corresponding L-norvalyl derivative of L- 1 -aminoethylphosphonic acid was markedly decreased. Substantial differences in the inhibitory and lytic activity of the L-norvalyl derivatives of aminomethylphosphonic and L- 1 -aminoethylphosphonic acids were also observed when these agents were combined with other inhibitors of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Proton-dependent {{oligopeptide}} transporters (POTs) {{are major}} facilitator superfamily (MFS) proteins that mediate the uptake of peptides and peptide-like molecules, using the inwardly directed H(+) gradient across the membrane. The human POT family transporter peptide transporter 1 {{is present in}} the brush border membrane of the small intestine and is involved in the uptake of nutrient peptides and drug molecules such as β-lactam antibiotics. Although previous studies have provided insight into the overall structure of the POT family transporters, the question of how transport is coupled to both peptide and H(+) binding remains unanswered. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structures of a bacterial POT family transporter, including its complex with a dipeptide analog, <b>alafosfalin.</b> These structures revealed the key mechanistic and functional roles for a conserved glutamate residue (Glu 310) in the peptide binding site. Integrated structural, biochemical, and computational analyses suggested a mechanism for H(+) -coupled peptide symport in which protonated Glu 310 first binds the carboxyl group of the peptide substrate. The deprotonation of Glu 310 in the inward open state triggers the release of the bound peptide toward the intracellular space and salt bridge formation between Glu 310 and Arg 43 to induce the state transition to the occluded conformation...|$|E
40|$|The genome of Escherichia coli {{contains}} four genes {{assigned to}} the peptide transporter (PTR) family. Of these, only tppB (ydgR) has been characterized, and named tripeptide permease, whereas protein functions encoded by the yhiP, ybgH and yjdL genes have remained unknown. Here we describe the overexpression of yhiP as a His-tagged fusion protein in E. coli and show saturable transport of glycyl-sarcosine (Gly-Sar) with an apparent affinity constant of 6. 5 mm. Overexpression of the gene also increased the susceptibility of cells to the toxic dipeptide <b>alafosfalin.</b> Transport was strongly decreased {{in the presence of}} a protonophore but unaffected by sodium depletion, suggesting H(+) -dependence. This was confirmed by purification of YhiP and TppB by nickel affinity chromatography and reconstitution into liposomes. Both transporters showed Gly-Sar influx {{in the presence of a}}n artificial proton gradient and generated transport currents on a chip-based sensor. Competition experiments established that YhiP transported dipeptides and tripeptides. Western blot analysis revealed an apparent mass of YhiP of 40 kDa. Taken together, these findings show that yhiP encodes a protein that mediates proton-dependent electrogenic transport of dipeptides and tripeptides with similarities to mammalian PEPT 1. On the basis of our results, we propose to rename YhiP as DtpB (dipeptide and tripeptide permease B), by analogy with the nomenclature in other bacteria. We also propose to rename TppB as DtpA, to better describe its function as the first protein of the PTR family characterized in E. coli...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{in the field of}} phosphonic acid antibiotics At the present time, three phosphonic acid antibiotics have been developed: fosfomycin, fosmidomycin (FR- 31564) and <b>alafosfalin.</b> The first two have in common a similar mechanism of action, through the inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate transferase, one of the initial steps of the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Fosfomycin. This was the first phosphonic acid antibiotic to be developed and used in a parenteral form, especially in Europe. Recently the indications for its use have increased. Until now, the oral form, the calcium or lysine salt, has not been very suc-cessful, due to limited intestinal absorption, with low blood and urinary levels. A new water-soluble, monobasic salt of fosfomycin with trometamol (tromethamine), has improved oral availability. In healthy volunteers, the rate and extent of the absorption of this tremethamine salt of fosfomycin from the gut is faster and several times greater than that of calcium fos-fomycin and with less individual variability (Ferrari et ai, 1981). The average (±S. D.) serum peak levels after 2 g and 3 g doses (the latter unpublished) are about 21 ± 0 - 7 and 33 ± 0 - 9 mg/ 1, compared with 5 - 6 mg/l after a 2 -g dose of calcium fosfomycin, and the area under the serum concentration curve (AUC) is greater. The consequence is an enhanced urinary recovery of fosfomycin with high urinary concentrations (about 3000 mg/ 1). This concentration—coupled with high dif-fusion throughout the body tissues—could possibly allow short course therapy in the treatment of simple urinary tract infection. We are now doing a clinical trial of the tromethamine salt of fosfomycin in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection, using a single daily dose of 3 g for one or two days. Another unexpected fact is the recent dem-onstration of a diminished nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides, when fosfomycin is co-administered. There is also an additive or synergistic antibacterial activity of the com-bination. This protective effect of fosfomycin on the nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides has been demonstrated both experimentall...|$|E
