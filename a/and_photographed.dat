5|$|After {{travelling}} to the Himalaya {{the first}} time, the Workmans became entranced with climbing and mountaineering. Over {{a span of}} 14 years, they traveled eight times to the area, {{which at the time}} was almost completely unexplored and unmapped. Their trips were made without the benefit of modern lightweight equipment, freeze-dried foods, sunblock, or radios. On each expedition, they explored, surveyed, <b>and</b> <b>photographed,</b> ultimately reporting on their findings and creating maps. The couple shared and alternated responsibilities; one year Fanny would organize the logistics of their journey and William would work on the scientific projects and the next year they would reverse roles.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{discovery}} of the wreck site, Ballard returned to Titanic in July 1986 aboard the research vessel RV Atlantis II. Now the deep-diving submersible DSV Alvin could take people back to Titanic {{for the first time}} since her sinking, and the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Jason Jr. would allow the explorers to investigate the interior of the wreck. Another system, ANGUS, was used to carry out photo surveys of the debris field. Jason Jr. descended the ruined Grand Staircase as far as B Deck, <b>and</b> <b>photographed</b> remarkably well preserved interiors, including some chandeliers still hanging from the ceilings.|$|E
5|$|Green {{also took}} photos of a {{prepared}} list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes {{such as those}} belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion <b>and</b> <b>photographed</b> her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. The look of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E

5|$|The Smithsonian {{hoped to}} salvage Langley's {{aeronautical}} reputation by proving the Aerodrome could fly; Curtiss {{wanted to prove}} {{the same thing to}} defeat the Wrights' patent lawsuits against him. The tests had no effect on the patent battle, but the Smithsonian made the most of them, honoring the Aerodrome in its museum and publications. The Institution did not reveal the extensive Curtiss modifications, but Orville Wright learned of them from his brother Lorin and a close friend of his and Wilbur's, Griffith Brewer, who both witnessed <b>and</b> <b>photographed</b> some of the tests.|$|E
5|$|The various rebel {{movements}} eventually {{succeeded in}} ousting the government altogether {{in the ensuing}} civil war that reached a climax in January 1991. Amid the chaos that surrounded Barre's flight from the capital, {{the remnants of the}} Somali National Armed Forces dissolved. In 1992, the 15-member Security Council imposed an arms embargo via United Nations Security Council Resolution 733 in order to stop the flow of weapons to feuding militia groups. Much equipment was left in situ, deteriorating, and was sometimes discovered <b>and</b> <b>photographed</b> by intervention forces in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Fred Gildersleeve, a Waco-based {{professional}} photographer, {{arrived at}} city hall shortly before the lynching, possibly at the mayor's request, <b>and</b> <b>photographed</b> the event. His photographs provide rare depictions of a lynching in progress, rather than typical lynching photography, which only shows dead victims. Gildersleeve's photographs include views of the crowd shot from a building and close images of Washington's body; some may have been taken by an assistant. Gildersleeve produced postcards featuring images of adolescents, some as young as twelve, gathered around Washington's body. The individuals in the photographs made no attempts to hide their identities. Berg believes that their willingness to be photographed indicates that they knew {{that no one would}} be prosecuted for Washington's death. Although some Waco residents sent the cards to out-of-town relatives, several prominent local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them, fearing that the images would come to characterize the town.|$|E

40|$|The work {{describes}} {{history and}} development of Collection of Prints, Drawings <b>and</b> <b>Photographs</b> in Dresden in the years 1720 - 1780. Collection of Prints, Drawings <b>and</b> <b>Photographs</b> in Dresden was established in 1720 by Frederick Augustus I, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland (as Augustus II the Strong). The first director of Collection of Prints, Drawings <b>and</b> <b>Photographs</b> in Dresden Johann Heinrich Heucher bought a large Gottfried Wagner collection of drawings from Leipzig in 1728. Carl Heinrich Heinecken, the second director of Collection of Prints, Drawings <b>and</b> <b>Photographs,</b> cooperated with the art connoisseur and art collector Pierr Mariette from France. Collection of Prints, Drawings <b>and</b> <b>Photographs</b> in Dresden was avaible for {{the public in the}} second half of the 18. century. At the end of this work there is supplemented brief catalog of selected Drawings of the Italian masters of the 15 th century from Collection of Prints, Drawings <b>and</b> <b>Photographs</b> in Dresden. These Italian drawings were a part of collection in Dresden already also in the years 1720 - 1780. Drawings are descripted and characterized there.

5|$|In 1884, {{after four}} years in the workhouse, Merrick {{contacted}} a showman named Sam Torr and proposed that Torr should exhibit him. Torr agreed and arranged for a group of men to manage Merrick, whom they named the Elephant Man. After touring the East Midlands, Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a penny gaff shop on Whitechapel Road which was rented by showman Tom Norman. Norman's shop, directly {{across the street from the}} London Hospital, was visited by a surgeon named Frederick Treves, who invited Merrick to be examined <b>and</b> <b>photographed.</b> Soon after Merrick's visits to the hospital, Tom Norman's shop was closed by the police, and Merrick's managers sent him to tour in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 {{plans were}} {{announced}} {{to create a}} stud book for the breed, a collaborative venture between the Marwari Horse Society of India and the Indian government. A registration process was initiated in 2009, {{when it was announced}} that the Marwari Horse Society had become a government body, the only government-authorized registration society for Marwari horses. The registration process includes an evaluation of the horse against the breed standards, during which unique identification marks and physical dimensions are recorded. After the evaluation, the horse is cold branded with its registration number <b>and</b> <b>photographed.</b> In late 2009 the Indian government announced that the Marwari horse, along with other Indian horse breeds, would be commemorated on a set of stamps issued by that country.|$|E
5|$|One bank {{employee}} {{testified that}} Shakur {{was one of}} the bank robbers, but three other bank employees (including two tellers) testified that they were uncertain. The prosecution showed surveillance photos of four of the six alleged robbers, contending that one of them was Shakur wearing a wig. Shakur was forcibly subdued <b>and</b> <b>photographed</b> by the FBI on the judge's order, after having refused to cooperate, believing that the FBI would use photo manipulation; a subsequent judge determined that the manners in which the photos were obtained violated Shakur's rights and ruled the new photos inadmissible. In her autobiography, Shakur recounts being beaten, choked, and kicked on the courtroom floor by five marshals, as Williams narrated the events to ensure they would appear on the court record. Shortly after deliberation began, the jury asked to see all the photographic exhibits taken from the surveillance footage. The jury determined that a widely circulated FBI photo allegedly showing Shakur participating in the robbery was not her.|$|E

40|$|Supporting users’ {{navigation}} is {{a fundamental}} feature of mobile guides. This paper presents an experimental evaluation comparing three different ways of providing navigation guidance by combining visual and audio directions during guided city tours. The three considered solutions differ in the way audio directions are augmented with visual directions: a traditional map-based solution, {{a combination of a}} map <b>and</b> <b>photographs</b> of the area, a combination of large arrows <b>and</b> <b>photographs.</b> The results of our evaluation show that when the map is combined with photographs that clearly indicate the direction to the user or when the map is replaced by a combination of directional arrows <b>and</b> <b>photographs,</b> users’ performance is significantly better. Moreover, the combination of map <b>and</b> <b>photographs</b> was highly preferred by users...|$|R
5|$|Rossier was in Hong Kong in 1858, and he {{soon began}} taking photographs, mostly {{in and around}} Canton (now Guangzhou). In November 1859 Negretti and Zambra {{published}} a set of fifty of Rossier's views, including stereographs. These received favourable reviews in photographic periodicals of the day. In 1858 or 1859 Rossier travelled to the Philippines where he visited <b>and</b> <b>photographed</b> the Taal Volcano. Rossier was in Japan by 1859, producing photographs first in Nagasaki, then in Kanagawa, Yokohama and Edo (now Tokyo); {{he was the first}} professional photographer to arrive in Japan. One of the photographs Rossier took during the summer of 1859, while in Nagasaki, was a portrait of Philipp Franz von Siebold's son Alexander and a group of samurai from the Nabeshima clan.|$|E
5|$|The {{nematode}} worm Caenorhabditis elegans, like Drosophila, {{has been}} studied largely because of its importance in genetics. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development. One {{of the advantages of}} working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped: the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm. Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections <b>and</b> <b>photographed</b> each one under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body. The complete neuronal wiring diagram of C.elegans – its connectome was achieved. Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{power of}} Alfano reached {{as far as}} politics. Together with his {{right-hand}} men, the priest Ciro Vitozzi and his associate Giovanni Rapi, Alfano {{was said to be}} the man behind the election in 1904 of the Count Vincenzo Ravaschieri Foschi to parliament {{to the detriment of the}} incumbent socialist deputy Ettore Ciccotti. The night before the election dissident voters were intimidated, assaulted, beaten, and sustained knife injuries by ruffians hired and encouraged by both the Camorra and the police, since the authorities equally disapproved of a socialist candidate. Alfano, Rapi and Vitozzi were seen <b>and</b> <b>photographed</b> while actively directing the vote in favour of Count Ravaschieri in the Camorra controlled district of Vicaria in which Ciccotti surprisingly had won in 1900. Ravaschieri won the 1904 election.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes in}} Chicago were mostly shot on location, as Bay {{believed}} the plates had {{to really be}} shot in the actual city. Farrar was always fascinated {{with the idea of}} shooting on location, and then blending the film with computer-generated imagery. The visual effects team used aerial plates of the city's actual buildings and added destruction elements such as smoke, fire, debris, fighter planes, war, battles, and torn up streets. Four ILM employees also travelled to Chicago <b>and</b> <b>photographed</b> buildings from top to bottom at six different times of the day {{in order to create a}} digital model of the city to be used in certain scenes. ILM's crew designed many major action scenes, with many of the Chicago battle concepts coming from the helicopter shooting of the aerial plates.|$|E
5|$|This too {{was intercepted}} <b>and</b> <b>photographed</b> but, {{as it was}} a {{relatively}} harmless letter, it was forwarded on while the British authorities continued to monitor Lody's communications in the hope of finding out more about the German espionage network. The day after sending it, on 15 September, Lody travelled to London to reconnoitre the city's war preparations. Travelling light, he stayed for two nights at the Ivanhoe Hotel in Bloomsbury (now the Bloomsbury Street Hotel) and set to work finding information about the security measures at public buildings. He said later that he had not actually observed the buildings himself but had obtained cuttings from newspapers, which he intended to send to Berlin. He also wrote a report on 16 September, but claimed that he had never sent it– it was never found by the British– as he felt that it was poorly written.|$|E
5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page {{a slow and}} difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention of}} the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with a metal detector discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it {{was on its way to}} the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out <b>and</b> <b>photographed.</b> On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E
