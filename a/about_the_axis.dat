25|$|A {{revolute}} pair, or hinged joint, {{requires a}} line, or axis, in the moving body to remain co-linear {{with a line}} in the fixed body, and a plane perpendicular to this line in the moving body maintain contact with a similar perpendicular plane in the fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom, which is pure rotation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> of the hinge.|$|E
25|$|If {{an insect}} wing is rigid, for example, a Drosophila wing is {{approximately}} so, its motion {{relative to a}} fixed body can be described by three variables: {{the position of the}} tip in spherical coordinates, (Θ(t),Φ(t)), and the pitching angle ψ(t), <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> connecting the root and the tip. To estimate the aerodynamic forces based on blade-element analysis, it is also necessary to determine the angle of attack (α). The typical angle of attack at 70% wingspan ranges from 25° to 45° in hovering insects (15° in hummingbirds). Despite the wealth of data available for many insects, relatively few experiments report the time variation of α during a stroke. They include wind tunnel experiments of a tethered locust and a tethered fly, and free hovering flight of a fruit fly.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of angular momentum for a point particle is a pseudovector r×p, the cross {{product of the}} particle's position vector r (relative to some origin) and its momentum vector p = mv. This definition {{can be applied to}} each point in continua like solids or fluids, or physical fields. Unlike momentum, angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen, since the particle's position is measured from it. The angular momentum of an object can also be connected to the angular velocity ω of the object (how fast it rotates about an axis) via the moment of inertia I (which depends on the shape and distribution of mass <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> of rotation). However, while ω always points {{in the direction of the}} rotation axis, the angular momentum L may point in a different direction depending on how the mass is distributed.|$|E

25|$|One can {{visualize}} {{the case of}} linear birefringence (with two orthogonal linear propagation modes) with an incoming wave linearly polarized at a 45° angle to those modes. As a differential phase starts to accrue, the polarization becomes elliptical, eventually changing to purely circular polarization (90° phase difference), then to elliptical and eventually linear polarization (180° phase) perpendicular to the original polarization, then through circular again (270° phase), then elliptical with the original azimuth angle, and finally {{back to the original}} linearly polarized state (360° phase) where the cycle begins anew. In general the situation is more complicated and can be characterized as a rotation in the Poincaré sphere <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> defined by the propagation modes. Examples for linear (blue), circular (red), and elliptical (yellow) birefringence are shown in the figure on the left. The total intensity and degree of polarization are unaffected. If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, the two polarization components of a collimated beam (or ray) can exit the material with a positional offset, even though their final propagation directions will be the same (assuming the entrance face and exit face are parallel). This is commonly viewed using calcite crystals, which present the viewer with two slightly offset images, in opposite polarizations, of an object behind the crystal. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{perception}} of surface slant is more sensitive <b>about</b> <b>the</b> horizontal <b>axis</b> than it is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> vertical <b>axis.</b> This study investigates the anisotropy of slant perception by applying the approach of natural scene statistics, which measures various physical properties to find probability regularities in the environment. We sampled 17 environments (2 indoor and 15 outdoor ones) from those routinely experienced by the first author. In each environment, a 3 D laser scanner measured the spatial layout by collecting the radial distances to the surrounding surfaces. On {{the basis of the}} measurements, we analyzed the probability distribution of the magnitude of surface slant <b>about</b> both <b>the</b> horizontal and vertical axes. Consequently, the probability of <b>the</b> slant <b>about</b> <b>the</b> horizontal <b>axis,</b> compared to that <b>about</b> <b>the</b> vertical <b>axis,</b> shows a remarkably high and narrow peak around 0 ° (i. e., the vertical plane).

2500|$|The {{most common}} imaging mode {{collects}} low-energy (<50 eV) secondary electrons that are {{ejected from the}} k-shell of the specimen atoms by inelastic scattering interactions with beam electrons. Due to their low energy, these electrons originate within a few nanometers from the sample surface. The electrons are detected by an Everhart-Thornley detector, which {{is a type of}} scintillator-photomultiplier system. The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or scintillator positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the scintillator to emit flashes of light (cathodoluminescence), which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a light pipe and a window in the wall of the specimen chamber. The amplified electrical signal output by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional intensity distribution that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue video display, or subjected to analog-to-digital conversion and displayed and saved as a digital image. This process relies on a raster-scanned primary beam. The brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the detector. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the activated region is uniform <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> of the beam and a certain number of electrons [...] "escape" [...] from within the sample. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume increases and the [...] "escape" [...] distance of one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample.
