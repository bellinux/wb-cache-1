5|$|Electronics {{deals with}} {{electrical}} circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, sensors <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components {{and their ability}} to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{work was}} {{influenced}} by his passions in life: architecture, nature, and religion. He considered every detail of his creations <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> into his architecture such crafts as ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry. He also introduced new techniques {{in the treatment of}} materials, such as trencadís which used waste ceramic pieces.|$|E

Michael Ely directed the Secret Project movies and cast the faction leaders. 25 volunteers participated in Firaxis' first public beta test. The beta testers suggested the Diplomatic and Economic victories and the Random Events.|$|E
40|$|What idea or {{theory has}} the {{greatest}} potential to stimulate <b>and</b> <b>integrate</b> the development of organizational communication? This essay seeks {{to answer this question}} by dividing the issues the question raises into three parts. First, I explore the criteria and operations by which one can judge an idea or theory’s potential to stimulate <b>and</b> <b>integrate</b> the development of organizational commu-nication. Second, I present one such theory for consideration, the high-speed management theory of organizational communication. Third, I investigate the evidence available that this theory has the potential to stimulate <b>and</b> <b>integrate</b> organizational communication...|$|R

By September 1945, there were 72 African-American women in the WAVES <b>and</b> <b>integrated.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Morgan {{trotting}} stallion Shepherd F. Knapp was {{exported to}} England in the 1860s, where his trotting ability influenced the breeding of Hackney horses. During this period, numerous Morgan mares {{may have been}} brought west <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> into Texan horse herds, which influenced {{the development of the}} American Quarter Horse breed. The Morgan horse also was an ancestor of the Missouri Fox Trotter. By the 1870s, however, longer-legged horses came into fashion, and Morgan horses were crossed with those of other breeds. This resulted in the virtual disappearance of the original style Morgan, although a few remained in isolated areas.|$|E

5|$|The city's first {{stone was}} laid by Grand Master Jean de Valette on 28 March 1566, {{and the new}} city was called Valletta in his honour. The city walls {{were among the first}} {{structures}} to be built within the city, and were largely complete by the 1570s. Some changes were made to the design while the city was being constructed, and only two cavaliers were constructed, while the arsenal and Manderaggio were never built. Fort St. Elmo, which had been severely damaged in the 1565 siege, was also rebuilt <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> in the city walls.|$|E

Theune was responsible for three European Championship titles in 1997, 2001 and 2005. During her time as head coach, Germany won the bronze medal at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics. Her biggest success was the 2003 Women's World Cup title. Theune is the most successful national coach to date. She benefited from an effective youth programme <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> several Under-19 players into the nation team. Theune stepped down after winning the European Championship in 2005.|$|E

5|$|With {{the fall}} of the Han, I Ching {{scholarship}} was no longer organized into systematic schools. The most influential writer of this period was Wang Bi, who discarded the numerology of Han commentators <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> the philosophy of the Ten Wings directly into the central text of the I Ching, creating such a persuasive narrative that Han commentators were no longer considered significant. A century later Han Kangbo added commentaries on the Ten Wings to Wang Bi's book, creating a text called the Zhouyi zhu. The principal rival interpretation was a practical text on divination by the soothsayer Guan Lu.|$|E

5|$|A comet-impact {{mission was}} first {{proposed}} to NASA in 1996, {{but at the}} time, NASA engineers were skeptical that the target could be hit. In 1999, a revised and technologically upgraded mission proposal, dubbed Deep Impact, was accepted and funded as part of NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost spacecraft. The two spacecraft (Impactor and Flyby) and the three main instruments were built <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. in Boulder, Colorado. Developing the software for the spacecraft took 18 months and the application code consisted of 20,000 lines and 19 different application threads. The total cost of developing the spacecraft and completing its mission reached US$330million.|$|E
5|$|Each sensory system {{begins with}} {{specialized}} receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear. The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into {{the spinal cord}} or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> with signals coming from other sensory systems.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{emergence}} of the Polish state, a series of rulers converted the population to Christianity, created a kingdom of Poland in 1025 <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> Poland into the prevailing culture of Europe. Mieszko's son Bolesław I the Brave established a Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Gniezno, pursued territorial conquests and was officially crowned in 1025 as the first king of Poland. The first Piast monarchy collapsed with the death of Mieszko II Lambert in 1034, followed by its restoration under Casimir I in 1042. In the process, the royal dignity for Polish rulers was forfeited, and the state reverted to the status of a duchy. Duke Casimir's son Bolesław II the Bold revived the military assertiveness of Bolesław I, but became fatally involved in a conflict with Bishop Stanislaus of Szczepanów and was expelled from the country.|$|E
