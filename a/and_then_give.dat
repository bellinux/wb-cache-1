25|$|Her life {{career is}} full of controversy. According to the Roman {{historian}} Justin, Eurydice conspired with her son-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros to kill Amyntas, then marry Ptolemy, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>give</b> the throne to her lover. But the queen’s daughter, Eurynoe, foiled the plot by revealing it to her father, Amyntas, who, nevertheless, spared Eurydice from punishment because of their common children. Eventually in 370/369 BC, Amyntas III died, and his eldest son, Alexander II succeeded him. In 368 BC, Ptolemy of Aloros killed Alexander II, despite an earlier settlement between them, worked out by Pelopidas, a Theban statesman and general. Then Ptolemy was forced by Pelopidas to agree merely to be regent for Alexander’s two younger brothers, Perdiccas III and Philip II.|$|E

25|$|The waitresses were a major {{attraction}} for the saloons and were nicknamed the pretty waiter girls, {{though they were}} not always attractive or young. They were scantily clothed in gaudy outfits while they sold drinks and danced with customers for money. The saloons hired women to exploit the men, instructed to pick customers' pockets <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>give</b> half that money back to the management. The pretty waiter girls earned about $20 per week plus a commission on any drinks and dances that they sold. Small grog houses and deadfalls hired only handful of pretty waiter girls, but the larger dance halls and concert saloons employed up to fifty women. However some of the concert saloons, like the Eureka and Bella Union, {{made an effort to}} have notable Barbary Coast performers appear in their shows and actually had attractive women for their pretty waiter girls.|$|E
25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would let him do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>give</b> lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E

Sadly it falters with repeated level design and a moderately troublesome camera; but {{in the grand scheme}} of things, these are only minor flaws." [...] PSM3 gave the game an 80 out of 100. The magazine discussed the difficulty of the game, saying, [...] "Most games these days tend to hold your hand all the way through...Devil May Cry is not like that. It'll throw a million demons at you because it wants to, put in half a dozen arbitrary fights in a 30-foot stretch of map, force you to survive for ages on a tiny sliver of health... <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>give</b> you a D at the end of the level because you weren't doing enough combos." ...|$|E

500|$|Winkelman had not {{intended}} to own Wimbledon F.C. himself; his plan had been to work alongside it while the stadium was built in Denbigh <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>give</b> the ground to the club in exchange for shares and {{a place on the}} board. He had not expected it to go into administration. With the move threatened and the club facing liquidation, he made [...] "the life-defining decision", to quote Conn, [...] "of taking it on himself". He secured funds from his consortium for the administrators to pay the players' wages, keep the club operating, and pay for the necessary renovations for the National Hockey Stadium to host League football. He made clear that his group's interest was conditional on the club moving to Milton Keynes. In late July Winkelman and the club's administrators concluded a deal with the Hockey Stadium's owners to carry out conversion work and play there from October—Wimbledon F.C. would return to Selhurst Park in the meantime. Meanwhile, Milton Keynes City F.C. went out of business {{before the start of the}} season following an unsuccessful drive for new directors and investors.|$|E

2500|$|Much of Can's {{music was}} based on free {{improvisation}} and then edited for the studio albums.

This assisted in the improvised soundtrack being successful {{both inside and outside the}} film's context. Also, the epic [...] "Cutaway" [...] from Unlimited Edition demonstrates how tape editing and extensive jamming could be used to create a sound collage that doesn't gel perfectly, and how a track could be constructed from the more inspired moments from extended jams.|$|E

2500|$|The {{judges are}} {{assisted}} by eleven Advocates General, whose number {{may be increased}} by the Council if the Court so requests. The Advocates General are responsible for presenting a legal opinion on the cases assigned to them.

The intention behind having Advocates General attached is to provide independent and impartial opinions concerning the Court's cases. Unlike the Court's judgments, the written opinions of the Advocates General are the works of a single author and are consequently generally more readable {{and deal with the}} legal issues more comprehensively than the Court, which is limited to the particular matters at hand.|$|E
2500|$|King {{has been}} {{involved}} in many litigation cases with boxers that were focused on fraud. In 1982 he was sued by Muhammad Ali for underpaying him $1.1 million for a fight with Larry Holmes. King called in an old friend of Ali, Jeremiah Shabazz, and handed him a suitcase containing $50,000 in cash and a letter ending Ali's lawsuit against King. He asked Shabazz to visit Ali (who was in the hospital due to his failing health) and get him to sign the letter <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>give</b> Ali the $50,000. Ali signed. The letter even gave King the right to promote any future Ali fights. According to Shabazz, [...] "Ali was ailing by then and mumbling a lot. I guess he needed the money."
