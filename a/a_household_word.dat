5|$|The Jameson Raid ruined Rhodes's {{political}} {{reputation in}} the Cape and lost him his longstanding support from the Afrikaner Bond; he resigned as Prime Minister of the Cape Colony on 12 January. Kruger's handling of the affair made his name <b>a</b> <b>household</b> <b>word</b> across the world and won him much support from Afrikaners in the Cape and the Orange Free State, who began to visit Pretoria in large numbers. The President granted personal audiences to travellers and writers such as Olive Schreiner and Frank Harris, and wore the knightly orders of the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium and France on his sash of state. Jameson was jailed by the British but released after four months. The republic made armament one of its main priorities, ordering huge quantities of rifles, munitions, field guns and howitzers, primarily from Germany and France.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} scientifique {{nomenclature}} {{offered to}} the spectator (the relativity of simultaneity), that artists themselves, art critics and art historians have not failed to notice. Some have attempted to refute such connections and others have embraced them. Though the name Einstein was not yet <b>a</b> <b>household</b> <b>word</b> in 1912, {{there has been a}} rapprochement of the concept of multiplicity described above and the concept of relativity in the Einsteinian sense. While, as Einstein writes, the physicist can generally limit herself to one system of coordinates for the description of physical reality, the Cubist (particularly Gleizes and Metzinger) attempted to show the simultaneity of several such views, or, at the very least, they were unwilling to commit themselves to a single coordinate system.|$|E

These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E
5000|$|Boatmen's {{families}} originally lived ashore, {{but in the}} 1830s as canals {{started to}} suffer competition from the burgeoning railway system, families (especially those of independent single boat owner/skippers) began to live on board, partly because {{they could no longer}} afford rents, partly to provide extra hands to work the boats harder, faster and further, partly to keep families together.

25|$|In 1967 Vactec {{introduced}} a compact RO branded as Vactrol. Unlike the tube-coupled ROs of Fender and Gibson, Vactrols were sealed and sturdy devices. In the early 1970s, Vactec replaced incandescent bulbs by LEDs. This increased the switching speed, {{but not to}} the level required for digital devices. Therefore, the introduction of the faster photodiodes and phototransistors in the 1970s pushed out ROs from the market. ROs retained narrow application niches in sound equipment and some industrial automation devices that did not require high speeds. Vactec did not extend their rights to the trademark Vactrol, and it has become <b>a</b> <b>household</b> <b>word</b> in the English language for any RO used in audio equipment, including the ROs of Fender and Gibson.

[...] Perhaps the most successful industry that grew up out of the business of patent medicine advertisements, though, was founded by William H. Gannett in Maine in 1866.

Before the 19th century, the word 'mascot' was associated with inanimate objects that would be commonly seen such as a lock of hair or a figurehead on a sailing ship.

His patronage was exercised, not from vanity or a mere dilettante love of letters, but {{with a view to}} the higher interest of the state. He recognized in the genius of the poets of that time not only the truest ornament of the court, but the power of reconciling men's minds to the new order of things, and of investing the actual state of affairs with an ideal glory and majesty. The change in seriousness of purpose between the Eclogues and the Georgics of Virgil was in a great measure the result of the direction given by the statesman to the poet's genius. A similar change between the earlier odes of Horace, in which he declares his epicurean indifference to affairs of state, and the great national odes of the third book has been ascribed by some to the same guidance. [...] However, since the organization of the Odes is not entirely chronological, and their composition followed both books of Satires and the Epodes, this argument is plainly specious; but doubtless the milieu of Maecenas' circle influenced the writing of the Roman Odes (III.1-6) and others such as the ode to Pollio, Motum ex Metello (II.1).|$|E
