The groove in the drum for the chain/rope was lined with wooden blocks with the grain facing outwards to increase the friction. Above this groove there was an integral brake wheel about 5 in wide. A wrought iron (or steel) band brake encircled this, which almost made a 360° <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> with the brake wheel, and this was lined with wooden blocks with the grain facing inwards to increase the friction. The band brake was anchored to the back wall of the pit and at the front, one end was cranked upwards and the other end was cranked downwards. The upward crank was attached above the fulcrum of the brake lever and the downward crank was attached below the fulcrum. The brake lever was about 15 ft long and it extended into the hut at {{the top of the}} tower. In spite of the large mechanical advantage provided by the brake lever, the brakeman was unable to apply the brake unaided. To further increase the mechanical advantage, a pulley block was fitted to the lever and the brakeman used this to apply the brake.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} the tamponade effect of air and silicone oil we examined the contact angles subtended by ex vivo human retina, Teflon and Perspex to find a suitable experimental material which would mimic the surface properties of the retina at a three-phase interface. Using the captive bubble technique to measure the contact angle, {{it was found that}} air subtended a larger contact angle (38. 8 °) with the retina than did silicone oil (18. 2 °). On coating the Perspex surface with protein (PCP), it was observed that the surface properties were modified such that PCP subtended contact angles with air (43. 0 °) and silicone oil (16. 4 °) similar to those subtended by ex vivo human retina.

40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} whether ocular axial length influences the tamponade efficacy of three commonly used agents: gas, silicone oil, and heavy silicone oil. Methods: A series of filling experiments was conducted using 19 -mm and 25 -mm surface-modified spherical model eye chambers {{to mimic the}} vitreous cavity. For each agent, tamponade efficacy was assessed {{across a range of}} percentage fills, and comparison was made between the two model eye chambers. The behavior of each tamponade agent was quantified by measuring (1) the maximum height of the tamponade bubble, and calculating (2) the <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> retinal <b>contact</b> subtended by the tamponade bubble. Results: Polynomial regression analysis found no statistically significant difference between the regression models for the different-sized model eye chambers for bubble height or <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> retinal <b>contact</b> subtended. This applied to all of the tamponade agents under investigation. Conclusions: Across the range of cavity sizes under investigation, no significant difference in tamponade efficacy (as reflected by the measured dimensions of the tamponade bubble) was identified. © 2010 The Author(s). published_or_final_versionSpringer Open Choice, 21 Feb 201...|$|R

The simulation-based optimization can lead to a drastic reduction of grinding cycle time. Moreover, the limitation of maximum grinding zone temperature rise below the transitional temperature can help to avoid generation of workpiece thermal damage, which includes thermal softening, residual tensile stress, and rehardening burn.

40|$|Better {{precision}} {{at lower}} costs {{is a major}} force in design and manufacturing. However, this is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve as the demands of many location applications are surpassing the practical performance limit (~ five microns) of low-cost couplings. The absence of a means to meet these requirement has motivated the development of the Quasi-Kinematic Coupling (QKC). This thesis covers the theoretical and practical considerations needed to model and design QKCs. In a QKC, one component is equipped with three spherical protrusions while the other contains three corresponding conical grooves. Whereas Kinematic Couplings rely on six points <b>of</b> <b>contact,</b> the six <b>arcs</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> between the mated protrusions and grooves of QKCs result in a weakly over-constrained coupling, thus the name Quasi-Kinematic. QKCs are capable of sub-micron repeatability, permit sealing contact as needed in casting, and can be economically mass produced. The design and application of a QKC is demonstrated via a case study on the location of two engine components. Integration of the QKC has improved coupling precision from 5 to 0. 7 microns. In addition, this QKC uses 60 % fewer precision features, 60 % fewer pieces, costs 40 % less per engine, and allows feature placement tolerances which are twice as wide as those of the previous dowel-pin-type coupling. by Martin L.

On the other hand, the belt equilibrium conditions {{are similar to the}} steady case, as the inertia forces due to the shifting motion are negligible with respect to the other forces. Assuming a onedimensional belt model, it is shown that adhesive regions may appear inside the <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact,</b> where the belt sticks to the pulley flanges along spiral-shaped paths. It is demonstrated that this type of contact may occur only for the closing pulleys, differently from the steady drives and from the opening pulleys, where only quasiadhesive internal subregions may be observed at most, where the sliding velocity turns out to be quite small along a more or less extended portion of the <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> Numerical solutions are calculated for all types of conditions, and their characteristics are widely described...|$|E

The grindability of high speed steel (HSS) is presented in terms of specific grinding energy versus undeformed chip thickness and maximum temperature rise versus specific material removal rate. It is shown that for a given specific material removal rate lower temperatures are achieved when grinding fast and shallow. Higher temperatures, characteristic for slow and deep grinding, soften the material leading to a lower specific grinding energy, especially if grinding is timid. Lowest values of specific grinding energy can be achieved in fast and shallow grinding at aggressive grinding conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{transverse}} {{elastic deflection}} of a traction belt along the free span depends {{mainly on the}} flexural stiffness, but may be significantly influenced by the distributed weight and the shear compliance, which affect together {{the width of the}} <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact.</b> In particular, the shear compliance yields a virtual decrease of the flexural stiffness, flattens the free span and increases the wound regions, to the advantage of the transmissible torque. Moreover, the tensioning of a given belt may be somewhat larger, in comparison with the ideal circular-straight path with the same centre distance, because of the increased length of the deflected belt trajectory due to gravity. The present paper addresses all these effects, solving for the span deflection line by a second-order approach based on the approximation called WKB by the mathematicians, after Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin.

The duration time to complete the squeeze process compared with the running time the pin takes to cover the entire <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> is fundamental to determine what actually is the lubrication regime at the interface. Taking into account that for normal CVT operations the time the pin spends in contact with the pulley groove is of about 0. 01 s (traveling time), we show that rms surface roughness less than 0. 1 μm and squeezing load of about 1 kN acting on the pin, corresponding to values adopted in such systems, guarantee a fully lubricated EHL regime at the interface. We also show that during low-velocity CVT operations, the lubrication regime at the interface is determined by a succession of hydrodynamic and mixed lubrication stages in an order strictly related to the squeezing load history. © 2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering...|$|E

40|$|A {{continuum}} {{method of}} analysis is {{presented in this paper}} for the problem of a smooth rigid pin in a finite composite plate subjected to uniaxial loading. The pin could be of interference, push or clearance fit. The plate is idealized to an orthotropic sheet. As the load on the plate is progressively increased, the contact along the pin-hole interface is partial above certain load levels in all three types of fit. In misfit pins (interference or clearance), such situations result in mixed boundary value problems with moving boundaries and in all of them the <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> and the stress and displacement fields vary nonlinearly with the applied load. In infinite domains similar problems were analysed earlier by ‘inverse formulation’ and, now, the same approach is selected for finite plates. Finite outer domains introduce analytical complexities in the satisfaction of boundary conditions. These problems are circumvented by adopting a method in which the successive integrals of boundary error functions are equated to zero. Numerical results are presented which bring out the effects of the rectangular geometry and the orthotropic property of the plate.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five patients were operated on (3 for oblique superior palsy, 1 for orbital floor fracture, 1 for partial IIIrd cranial nerve palsy). Oblique retroequatorial fixation was applied on 4 inferior recti and on 1 superior rectus.

40|$|The steady {{theory of}} V-belt {{mechanics}} {{is well established}} [1, 2, 3]. Owing to the side compression of the pulley walls, the belt penetrates into the groove a depth variable along the <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> and is subject to radial components of the friction forces. Nevertheless, the operative conditions of mechanical variators are seldom steady (see cars and motorcycles), because alternating phases of shift up and down of the speed ratio are continuously requested by the driver. Very few theoretical approaches to this topic are reported in the literature. They generally assume an ideal inextensible-incompressible belt and find out the path of each belt element by simple geometrical analyses. The "rigid belt " hypothesis is certainly acceptable for metal V-belts (e. g. Van Doorne) and rapid ratio changes, but become inappropriate for rubber V-belt or slow shifts. In the rubber belt case, the longitudinal elongation and the radial penetration influence the sliding direction of the single belt elements {{in conjunction with the}} overall inside/outside motion due to the opening/closing of the pulley.
