5000|$|Tony {{began to}} be humanized in the 1970s; he was given an Italian-American {{nationality}} and consumers were briefly introduced to more of Tony's family including Mama Tony, Mrs. Tony, and a daughter, Antoinette. Tony was a popular figure among the young Italian-American population and it showed in 1974, where he was deemed [...] "Tiger of the Year" [...] in an <b>advertising</b> <b>theme</b> taken from the Chinese Lunar Calendar. The <b>advertising</b> <b>theme</b> declared, [...] "This is the Year of the Tiger and Tony is the Tiger of the Year." [...] Later that year, Tony graced the covers of Italian GQ and Panorama. In addition to Tony's success, during this decade, son Tony Jr. was even given his own short-lived cereal in 1975, Frosted Rice. Provensen's original art design for the tiger has changed significantly over the years, as Tony the whimsical, cereal-box-sized tiger with a teardrop-shaped head was replaced by his fully-grown son Jr., {{who is now a}} sleek, muscular sports enthusiast—he was a coach for the Monster Wrestlers in My Pocket and a referee for the Monster Sports Stars in My Pocket (see Monster in My Pocket).

50|$|By the 1970s, GE {{had shifted}} {{once again to}} a focus to the service and {{high-tech}} fields. In this increasingly diversified market, the company saw that a more comprehensive advertising strategy was needed. Prior to 1979, GE’s image was primarily that of an appliance company. Each one of the company’s products and services used its own <b>advertising</b> <b>theme,</b> not an overall company slogan. To remedy the situation, the advertising agency BBDO began to develop the “We Bring Good Things to Life” campaign to create a unified brand image.|$|E
50|$|Rebranding is a {{marketing}} strategy {{in which a}} new name, term, symbol, design, or combination thereof is created for an established brand {{with the intention of}} developing a new, differentiated identity in the minds of consumers, investors, competitors, and other stakeholders. Often, this involves radical changes to a brand's logo, name, legal names, image, marketing strategy, and <b>advertising</b> <b>themes.</b> Such changes typically aim to reposition the brand/company, occasionally to distance itself from negative connotations of the previous branding, or to move the brand upmarket; they may also communicate a new message a new board of directors wishes to communicate.|$|R
40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. The {{increase}} of globalization has prompted {{questions about the}} shift in local values and customs in countries around the globe, possibly creating a global consumer culture. This study investigated the degree of change between the <b>advertising</b> <b>themes</b> and cultural values that were portrayed in Japanese and American print advertisements in the 1970 s and the current <b>advertising</b> <b>themes</b> in these countries. By continuing a study on data from the 1970 s, this investigation analyzed the current advertising for similar cultural value themes and compared the results with the original study. The results of the Japanese advertising sample do not show the effects of globalization as the current results reflect consistent cultural values with the 1970 s. The traditional cultural values in Japanese advertisements remain consistent over the decades, particularly with the status appeal, which remains a dominant cultural value portrayed in their advertising. The American advertising appeals changed considerably over the decades. The practical appeal surpassed the luxury appeal as a dominant theme. Furthermore, the themes of "being" and "doing" drastically decreased in American advertising, while the materalistic theme of "having" remained consistent. Common cultural values across borders that would be expected in a global consumer culture were not apparent in this study; instead, the differences were more evident between the Japanese and American advertising in the 2000 s than the 1970 s...|$|R

50|$|People {{engaged in}} {{branding}} seek to develop or align the expectations behind the brand experience, creating {{the impression that}} a brand associated with a product or service has certain qualities or characteristics that make it special or unique.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{was to investigate the}} attitudes of business and advertising executives, civic leaders, and individuals towards the perceived role of standardized or adapted international advertising appeals in promoting the 1996 Atlanta Centennial Olympic Games. The study was descriptive in design and used both secondary and primary data. The findings suggest that the 1996 Olympic Games should be advertised in other countries using culturally meaningful themes adapted to reflect the aesthetics, language, customs and educational level of the target audience. Conversely, Olympic <b>advertising</b> <b>themes</b> should not contain religious messages or be standardized. These findings carry implications for the International Olympic Committee, the World Cup Soccer Federation, Tourists Boards, Convention Bureaus, Chambers of Commerce, as well as scholars and practitioners who wish to advocate employing adapted or standardized advertising messages to culturally diverse target audience...|$|R
