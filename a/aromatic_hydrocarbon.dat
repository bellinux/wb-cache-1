30|$|Moreover, {{the loading}} amount and loading {{order of the}} {{catalyst}} with γ-alumina played {{a vital role in}} the formations of aromatics. Despite the loading order of the catalyst with γ-alumina, the total aromatic yields for both groups had an upward trend with the increase of the catalyst with γ-alumina. And the gasoline compositions for both groups demonstrated that the increased aromatics were at the expense of paraffins, olefins, and naphthenes. Besides, be compared with the Group I, the Group II had a larger range of aromatic yield from 12.28 to 20.27  wt%.

ABSTRACT: The {{biodegradability}} of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> such as naphthalene, fluorene, anthracene and phenanthrene by a halotolerant bacterial consortium {{isolated from}} marine environment was investigated.

The consortium potently degraded polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (> 95 %) at 30 g/L of sodium chloride concentration in 4 days. The consortium {{was able to}} degrade 39 to 45 % of different polycyclic hydrocarbons at 60 g/L NaCl concentration. Due to increase in salinity, the percent degradation decreased.

Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell, and is responsible for the aroma around petrol stations.

Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} the DNA damage theory of aging {{it is important}} to distinguish between DNA damage and mutation, the two major types of errors that occur in DNA. Damage and mutation are fundamentally different. DNA damage is any physical abnormality in the DNA, such as single and double strand breaks, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine residues and polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> adducts. DNA damage can be recognized by enzymes, and thus can be correctly repaired using the complementary undamaged sequence in a homologous chromosome if it is available for copying. If a cell retains DNA damage, transcription of a gene can be prevented and thus translation into a protein will also be blocked. Replication may also be blocked and/or the cell may die. Descriptions of reduced function, characteristic of aging and associated with accumulation of DNA damage, are given later in this article.|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that Soderberg {{aluminum}} smelters are a large source of anthropogenic polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the environment. The atmospheric fate of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> is of importance to the aluminum industry in Canada due to their environmental persistence and potential health effects. For Soderberg smelters, the fate of facility emissions is of concern due to the involuntary nature of exposure by the general public in the surrounding regions. Excellent relationships between benzo[a]pyrene and polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> between different types of Soderberg facilities and raw material formulations were found in the occupational environment during this investigation. This was followed by the comparison of emission profiles of a horizontal stud Soderberg aluminum smelter with profiles measured in a network of sampling stations in the adjacent community. The results suggested that benzo[a]pyrene may be less stable than the majority of the polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> An analysis of different sampling sites across Canada revealed that station profiles in the vicinity of Soderberg facilities were different from those found for sites impacted by steel plants, traffic and domestic heating.

25|$|Low {{molecular}} weight PAHs, with 2 to 4 <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> rings, are more potent as co-carcinogens during the promotional stage of cancer. In this stage, an initiated cell (i.e., a cell that has retained a carcinogenic mutation {{in a key}} gene related to cell replication) is removed from growth-suppressing signals from its neighboring cells and begins to clonally replicate. Low {{molecular weight}} PAHs that have bay or bay-like regions can dysregulate gap junction channels, interfering with intercellular communication, and also affect mitogen-activated protein kinases that activate transcription factors involved in cell proliferation. Closure of gap junction protein channels is a normal precursor to cell division. Excessive closure of these channels after exposure to PAHs results in removing a cell from the normal growth-regulating signals imposed by its local community of cells, thus allowing initiated cancerous cells to replicate. These PAHs {{do not need to}} be enzymatically metabolized first. Low molecular weight PAHs are prevalent in the environment, thus posing a significant risk to human health at the promotional phases of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Biodegradation {{can be seen}} in {{some studies}} that {{biodegradation}} accounts for the absence of creosote preservatives on the initial surface of the sediment. In a study from Pensacola, Florida, PAHs were not detected on the surface on the aquatic sediment, but the highest concentrations were detected at a depth of 8-13 centimeters. A form an anaerobic biodegradation of m-cresol was seen in a study using sulfate-reducing and nitrate-reducing enriched environments. The reduction of m-cresol in this study was seen in under 144 hours, while additional chemical intermediates were being formed. The chemical intermediates were formed in the presence of bicarbonate. The products included 4-hydroxy-2-methylbenzoic acid and acetate compounds. Although the conditions were enriched with the reducing anaerobic compounds, sulfate and nitrate reducing bacteria are commonly found in the environment. For further information, see sulfate-reducing bacteria. The type of anaerobic bacteria ultimately determines the reduction of the creosote preservative compounds, while each individual compound may only go through reduction under certain conditions. BTEX is a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, that was studied in the presence of four different anaerobic-enriched sediments. Though the compound, BTEX, is not found in creosote preservatives, the products of creosote preservatives' oxidation-reduction reactions include some of these compounds. For oxidation-reduction reactions, see the following section. In this study, it was seen that certain compounds such as benzene were only reduced under sulfate-enriched environments, while toluene was reduced under a variety of bacteria-enriched environments, not just sulfate. The biodegradation of a creosote preservative in an anaerobic enrichment depends not only on the type of bacteria enriching the environment, but also the compound that has been released from the preservative. In aerobic environments, preservative compounds are limited in the biodegradation process by the presence of free oxygen. In an aerobic environment, free oxygen comes from oxygen saturated sediments, sources of precipitation, and plume edges. The free oxygen allows for the compounds to be oxidized and decomposed into new intermediate compounds. Studies have shown that when BTEX and PAH compounds were placed in aerobic environments, the oxidation of the ring structures caused cleavage in the aromatic ring and allowed for other functional groups to attach. When an <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> was introduced to the molecular oxygen in experimental conditions, a dihydrodiol intermediate was formed, and then oxidation occurred transforming the aromatic into a catechol compound. Catechol allows for cleavage of the aromatic ring to occur, where functional groups can then add in an ortho- or meta- position.|$|E
