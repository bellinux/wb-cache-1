5|$|Some Black Hebrews renounced their American {{citizenship}} {{to try to}} prevent more deportations. In 1990, Illinois legislators helped negotiate an agreement that resolved the Black Hebrews' legal status in Israel. Members of the group are permitted to work and have access to housing <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> The Black Hebrews reclaimed their American citizenship and have received aid from the U.S. government, which helped them build a school and additional housing. In 2003 the agreement was revised, and the Black Hebrews were granted permanent residency in Israel.|$|E
5|$|The O Act {{achieved}} {{what the}} previous legislation {{had failed to}} do: provide a stable revenue to the counties. This revenue became {{a vital part of}} the budgets of the O counties, paying for county-provided services such as law enforcement and corrections and health <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> With this funding seemingly guaranteed, the counties kept other taxes much lower than other counties in the state, increasing their dependence on the timber payments. For example, the property tax in Curry County is 60 cents per $1,000 of assessed value, far below the state average of $2.81 per $1000.|$|E

5|$|The first {{legislative}} session of Breathitt's administration {{was a disappointment}} to his faction. His youth and narrow margin of victory in the election undermined his authority. Further, the unexpected death of Richard P. Moloney, a key legislative leader, was a blow to Breathitt's ability to push his agenda through the General Assembly. The major accomplishment of the 1964 session was the approval of a $176million bond issue to increased funding for roads, public education, the state park system, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> Other minor accomplishments included passing a purchasing law, strengthening strip mining regulations, and improving benefits for teachers.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of the Great Depression, {{employment}} within the Rhondda Valleys continued to fall. This in turn led to a decline in public <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> as people struggled to pay rates and rents. One of the outcomes of a lack of funds was a fall in health provisions, which in Rhondda lead to a lack of medical and nursing staff, a failure to provide adequate sewage works and a rise in deaths from tuberculosis. By 1932 the long-term unemployment figure in the Rhondda was recorded at 63%, and in Ferndale the unemployment figure for adult males rose as high as 72.85%.|$|E
5|$|Baird {{served in}} the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2005 for the riding of Nepean—Carleton (part of Nepean until 1999), and was a cabinet {{minister}} in the Progressive Conservative governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. He served as the Minister for Children, Community <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Services,</b> Energy and Francophone Affairs {{in addition to being}} the Government's Chief Whip. After the Conservatives' defeat by Dalton McGuinty's Ontario Liberal Party, he was the party's critic for key portfolios including finance, culture and health. Baird {{had been a member of}} the Conservatives since 1985, when he was the youngest delegate at that time and was also a political aide for the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the late 1980s.|$|E

5|$|By the 1850s, New School Presbyterians in the North {{had moved}} to more {{moderate}} positions and reasserted a stronger Presbyterian identity. This was helped in 1852 when the Plan of Union between the New School Church and the Congregationalists was discontinued. Northern Presbyterian's of both the Old and New School participated in the Christian Commission that provided religious <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services</b> to Union soldiers during the Civil War. Furthermore, both schools boldly proclaimed the righteousness of the Union cause and engaged in speculation {{about the role of}} a newly restored America in ushering in the millennium. This was, in effect, the Old School's repudiation of its teaching against involving the church in political affairs.|$|E
5|$|The {{job market}} is {{knowledge}} and service based {{and the largest}} employment sectors are healthcare <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> trade, education, consulting, research, industry and telecommunications. The municipality has more high and middle income jobs, and fewer low income jobs, than the national average. Today {{the majority of the}} largest companies in the municipality are in the sectors of trade, transport and media. The wind power industry has strong roots in Aarhus, and the larger region of Midtjylland, and nationally most of the revenue in the industry is generated by companies in the greater Aarhus area. The wind industry employs about a thousand people within the municipality making it a central component in the local economy. The biotech industry is well established in the city with many small and medium-sized companies mainly focused on research and development.|$|E

5|$|Baird {{was criticized}} in late 1999 {{for refusing to}} cancel a five-year {{contract}} that had been signed between his department and the Bermuda-based private firm Andersen Consulting (later Accenture), worth up to $180 million. The contract, signed when Janet Ecker was Community <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Services</b> minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province's welfare management system. The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General Erik Peters, who observed {{that there was nothing}} in the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates. A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at $51 per hour. Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of savings. In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate. Baird opposed the Harris government's plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities, which was approved by the legislature in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{timber and}} education, Missoula's {{economic}} mainstay {{has been of}} one as a regional trade center. Missoula has an immediate trade area of approximately 180,000 residents. The Missoula is the hub of its Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Economic Area, which includes the Montana Counties of Flathead, Lake, Lincoln, Mineral, Missoula, Ravalli, and Sanders. , the BEA listed the economic area population at 306,050. Key businesses sectors serving the area include health care, retail shopping, transportation, financial services, government <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services,</b> education, events, arts and culture. Health care in particular is one of Missoula's fastest growing industries with St. Patrick Hospital (western Montana's only LevelII Trauma center) and the Community Medical Center already the city's second and third largest employers behind the university. 55% of employment in Missoula {{is made up of}} the service and retail sectors. Export industries are concentrated in heavy and civil engineering, construction, beverage production, technical services, truck transportation, and forestry-, logging-, and wood-related industries. In addition to nearly 4million out-of-state visitors annually, which makes tourism a significant aspect of the Missoula economy, Missoula also is home to a vibrant sector of alternative healthcare.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of centralized government, much {{of the legal system}} and most of the educational institutions <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>services</b> fell under the control of religious institutions, which often received significant funding and support from international charities. In 2005, some of these clerical organizations united to form the Islamic Courts Union, after the secular rebel leaders began to challenge the sharia-based judicial institutions. Wary of Islamist paramilitaries {{in the age of the}} War on Terror, the CIA funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to secular rebel leaders inside Somalia in 2006, intending thereby to neutralize the threat of suspected members of Al Qaeda they believed to be sheltered by the ICU. This was cited by experts as a factor in the resurgence of Islamic militias in the country, prompting the latter to engage in pre-emptive strikes which routed the rebel leaders and led to the seizure of Ford by the ICU. The ICU gained control of Mogadishu and its surrounding districts in June 2006, after the Second Battle of Mogadishu. The ICU was later overthrown by the Ethiopian military with the support of the United Nations, African Union, and the United States government. After the ICU forces were chased from Mogadishu, the leaders of the Transitional Federal Parliament entered Somalia declaring themselves the rightful governors of Somalia. As of October 2007, there was still widespread opposition within Somalia to the TFG, and the TFG's leaders and their allies were still attempting to suppress a strong insurgency. In January 2009 politician Abdirahman Ahmed was executed for alleged apostasy by a Sharia court.|$|E
