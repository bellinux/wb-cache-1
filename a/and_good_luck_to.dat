5|$|The Mounties arrive {{the next}} morning, in hot pursuit. Kripik {{prevents}} {{his eldest son}} from killing the Mounties, and says he will leave and never come back. Kripik departs on foot, but Iva professes her love and goes with him. The Mounties pursue them on foot across the ice, which is breaking up. Sergeant Hunt takes aim at Kripik with his rifle, but cannot shoot him because Kripik has saved their lives and exhibited more honor and decency than white men have. Kripik and Iva escape on an ice floe, Hunt calling out goodbye <b>and</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> them. Hunt tells Balk that the ice will take Kripik and Iva across the inlet, and that the adults {{will be able to}} return to Orsodikok and the other children next spring.|$|E

500|$|Lewis blamed a [...] for {{the mistake}} that {{resulted}} in the goal, saying that the wool was greasy and allowed the ball to slip from his grip. As tradition ever since, Arsenal goalkeepers have always washed their jerseys before each game. The Arsenal captain, Buchan, praised the Cardiff team saying [...] "My congratulations to Cardiff City on being the first club in history to take the Cup out of England. We did our very utmost to prevent them from doing so, but we did not succeed. As, however, the trophy is gone to Cardiff, there is no one who more heartily congratualtes them than the captain of the losers. Cardiff played an honest, clean game, each member of the team obviously striving to do his utmost and my final works are Good luck to the City <b>and</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> Wales and its Association football now that they have the Cup." ...|$|E

500|$|On 10 December 2014, {{despite having}} been named in England's 30-man {{provisional}} 2015 Cricket World Cup squad, Kieswetter {{revealed that he}} was still suffering vision problems. He announced that he would not play in the 2015 season and would seek further treatment. The following June, he announced his retirement from professional cricket, saying that, although he was still capable of playing, he could not play to the standard he wanted: [...] "In the end I just thought, there are too many mediocre players in county cricket– <b>and</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> them– but I don't want to be another one." [...] He found batting in floodlit conditions particularly difficult, and described the vision in his right eye as being [...] "only at 80 or 85 percent". He finished his career with similar statistics in first-class and one-day cricket; in both he averaged just under 40 and had scored eleven centuries. In Twenty20 cricket, his highest score was 89 not out, and he averaged just over 30. In an interview with ESPNcricinfo shortly after his retirement, Kieswetter said that he would be interested in working in the media, perhaps as part of a commentary team for Twenty20 matches.|$|E

2500|$|Murrow {{achieved}} great {{celebrity status}} {{as a result of}} his war reports. They led to his second famous catchphrase. At the end of 1940, with every night's German bombing raid, Londoners who might not necessarily see each other the next morning often closed their conversations with [...] "good night, and good luck." [...] The future British monarch, Princess Elizabeth, said as much to the Western world in a live radio address at the end of the year, when she said [...] "good night, <b>and</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> you all". So, at the end of one 1940 broadcast, Murrow ended his segment with [...] "Good night, and good luck." [...] Speech teacher Anderson insisted he stick with it, and another Murrow catchphrase was born.|$|E

5000|$|A short snorter is a {{banknote}} inscribed {{by people}} traveling together on an aircraft. The tradition {{was started by}} Alaskan Bush flyers in the 1920s and spread through the military and commercial aviation.

Friends would take the local currency and sign each other's bills creating a [...] "keepsake of your buddy's signatures".|$|R

5000|$|White Plume was a {{prominent}} personality on the frontier in the 1830s and travelers often called on him.
