40|$|In arecent {{debate in}} {{political}} science, the terms "bargaining <b>and</b> <b>arguing</b> " have been construed as semantic opposites. The present article rejects this dichotomy {{and offers a}} new theoretical approach to clarify the logical and pragmatic relationship of bargaining <b>and</b> <b>arguing</b> as modes of the resolution of conflicts through communi-cation. On the basis of speech act theOlY, a method for the empirical analysis of bargaining <b>and</b> <b>arguing</b> is developed (md demanstrated wirh an example of conflict resolution by mediation. Four conclusions can be drawn. First, in empirical pro-cesses of communicative conflict resolution, in almost all cases both <b>arguing</b> <b>and</b> bargaining will be present.

Third, wirhin {{the context of an}} interest conflict, arguing is not an alternative to bargaining, but a means for bargaining. Fourth, although bargaining <b>and</b> <b>arguing</b> have the potential to resolve certain types of conflicts, their success is difficult to predict and cannot be taken for granted...|$|R
