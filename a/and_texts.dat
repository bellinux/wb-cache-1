5|$|The Renaissance {{began in}} Florence, in the 14th century.

5|$|Although {{perhaps not}} as {{prolific}} as {{other areas of}} Greece in regards to technological innovations, there are some inventions that may have originated in Macedonia aside from siege engines and artillery. The rotary-operated olive press for producing olive oil may have been invented in ancient Macedonia or another part of Greece, or even as far east as the Levant or Anatolia. Mold-pressed glass first appeared in Macedonia in the 4thcenturyBC (although it could have simultaneously existed in the Achaemenid Empire); the first known clear, translucent glass pieces of the Greek world have been discovered in Macedonia and Rhodes and date to {{the second half of}} the 4thcenturyBC.

5|$|Another {{way that}} machinima {{demonstrates}} intertextuality {{is in its}} tendency to make frequent references to texts, works, and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might do. For example, the machinima series Freeman's Mind, created by Ross Scott, is filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining it with a voiceover (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an inner monologue of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman. Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, sociopathic character who makes frequent references to works <b>and</b> <b>texts</b> including science fiction, horror films, action movies, American history, and renowned novels such as Moby Dick. These references to works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.|$|E
5|$|Attempts by fans {{to write}} in Quenya began in the 1970s, when the total corpus of {{published}} Elvish comprised {{only a few hundred}} words. Since then, the use of Elvish has flourished in poems <b>and</b> <b>texts,</b> phrases and names, and even tattoos. But Tolkien himself never made his languages complete enough for conversation. As a result, newly invented Elvish texts require conjecture and sometimes the coinage of new words. The use of Quenya has expanded over the years as new words have been created, forming a Neo-Quenya language that is based on Tolkien's original Quenya but incorporates many new elements.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Weimar, but the composition history is complicated {{and not at}} all stages certain. Findings by Martin Petzoldt suggest that the cantata began with the later movements 2–6 and 9, most of them on biblical text, performed at a memorial service of Aemilia Maria Haress, the wife of a former prime-minister of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, at the church St. Peter und Paul in Weimar on 8 October 1713. Bach may then have expanded it and presented it for his application in December 1713 at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. The performance material of this event, the only surviving source, shows on the title page the designation , indicating that the cantata with its general readings <b>and</b> <b>texts</b> is suitable for any occasion.|$|E
5|$|In the north, Coba on {{the eastern}} side of the Yucatán Peninsula raised at least 23 large stelae. Although badly eroded their style <b>and</b> <b>texts</b> link them to cities from the Petén Basin. At the {{southern}} periphery of the Maya region, Copán developed a new high-relief style of stelae and in 652 the twelfth king ChanImixK'awiil arranged a series of these stelae to define the sacred geometry of the city, and to celebrate his royal rule and his ancestors. His son and successor UaxaclajuunUb'aahK'awiil further developed this new high-relief style of sculpture and erected a series of intricately decorated stelae in the city's Great Plaza that brought the carving of stelae close to full in-the-round three-dimensional sculpture. Both of these kings focused on their own images on their stelae and emphasised their place in the dynastic sequence to justify their rule, possibly linked to a break in the dynastic sequence with the death of the eleventh king of Copán.|$|E

The various dualistic and monist Shiva-related ideas were welcomed in medieval southeast Asia, inspiring numerous Shiva-related temples, artwork <b>and</b> <b>texts</b> in Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, with syncretic integration of local pre-existing theologies.|$|E

The two main contributions of this work lie on the support and the evaluation of several techniques for visual <b>and</b> <b>text</b> feature descriptor extraction, for visual <b>and</b> <b>text</b> feature descriptor integration, and for data clustering in the extraction of perceptual concepts; and on proposing novel ways for discovering perceptual relationships among concepts.

30|$|The {{similarity}} in {{the shapes of}} the call <b>and</b> <b>text</b> signatures of each ego would be expected if their call <b>and</b> <b>text</b> networks were similar and included the same alters with similarly ranked weights. However, this is not the case: the call <b>and</b> <b>text</b> networks of an ego are typically different. Instead of the same alters appearing in both networks, many alters are only called or <b>texted,</b> <b>and</b> therefore included in one network only.

5|$|The Church of Scientology depicts Hubbard in hagiographic {{terms and}} draws on his legacy as its {{ultimate}} source of doctrine and legitimacy. The Danish historian of religions Dorthe Refslund Christensen notes that {{many aspects of}} the official version of Hubbard's early life parallel more conventional religious narratives, notably the life of Jesus. Many details of Hubbard's early life remain disputed; critics of Scientology cast doubt on whether he had the educational and personal background claimed by the Church. According to James R. Lewis and Olav Hammer, in Scientology, this hagiographic “construction of Hubbard as a religious ideal implies the construction of Scientology’s texts as humanity’s most important treasure and vice versa.” Religious tradition in Scientology is based on two essential things, Hubbard’s individuality <b>and</b> <b>texts</b> written by him.|$|E
