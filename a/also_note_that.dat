5|$|It is {{important}} to <b>also</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> images of the family depend upon the specific source in which the image is found {{and the type of}} audience that the source aims to reach. For example, in a women’s magazine such as Good Housekeeping, one can expect to find women in the family portrayed solely as domestic housewives.|$|E
5|$|Historians Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully {{believe that}} by {{combining}} the surviving aircraft and pilots from Shōkaku and Zuikaku, {{it is likely that}} Zuikaku could have been equipped with almost a full composite air group. They <b>also</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> doing so would have violated Japanese carrier doctrine, which stressed that carriers and their airgroups must train as a single unit (in contrast, American air squadrons were considered interchangeable between carriers). In any case, the Japanese apparently made no serious attempt to get Zuikaku ready for the forthcoming battle.|$|E

5|$|The Tempest {{is thought}} by most {{scholars}} {{to have been}} written in 1610–11, and is generally accepted as the last play that Shakespeare wrote alone, although some have questioned either or both assertions. Scholars <b>also</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> {{it is impossible to}} determine if the play was written before, after, or {{at the same time as}} The Winter's Tale, the dating of which has been equally problematic. Edward Blount entered The Tempest into the Stationers' Register on 8 November 1623. It was one of 16 Shakespearean plays that Blount registered on that date.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} chronicles that mention Breton's death <b>also</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> {{he was the}} author of a legal {{treatise}} entitled le Bretoun, but this cannot be the surviving work called Britton, {{at least not in the}} current form, as that work discusses laws composed 15 years after Breton's death. It is unclear why he was credited with the work, and whether this attribution is just a confusion of Breton with the real author or if he did in fact author the work, which was later revised. The fact that the Britton is written in French, not Latin, and that it contains little information about the theory of law, being mostly concerned with the practical application of laws, points rather strongly to an author who was a royal justice, which Breton was.|$|E

C., Elavarthi Sathya Prakash and Jananie Kalyanaraman mention the soft drinks that are satirised include Coca-Cola and Pepsi. The two are called Akka Mala and Gup-C respectively. They <b>also</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> Pulikecei and Ukraputhan have {{contrasting}} differences {{with respect to}} attitude towards women, education, governance, and demonstration of both skill in weaponry and physical prowess. Kalyanaraman compares Vadivelu's balancing of both his comic and heroic abilities through the roles of Pulikecei and Ukraputhan to Nagesh's roles in Server Sundaram (1964) and Ethir Neechal (1968), where Nagesh plays more serious roles.|$|E

5|$|Several Psilocybe {{species have}} an {{appearance}} roughly similar to P.allenii, but these {{can usually be}} distinguished by differences in morphology or distribution. The European species P.serbica var. moravica has a similar cap and stipe, but is generally more slender than P.allenii. The closely related P.cyanescens is indistinguishable by microscopic characteristics, but features a wavy cap in maturity, a longer fruiting season (from late September through April), and lacks a ring zone on the stipe often seen in P.allenii. P.azurescens has a broader cap, an umbo that may be broad or acute, a longer stipe up to , and a growing season {{similar to that of}} P.cyanescens. The authors <b>also</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> the Australian P.subaeruginosa is similar (including three taxa that have since been synonymized: P.australiana, P.eucalypta, and P.tasmaniana) but suggest that further research is required to better understand the delimitation of this species complex.|$|E
5|$|General Dynamics and BAE Systems, who {{received}} contracts in the Ground Combat Vehicle program, criticized the CBO report, saying {{they used the}} wrong vehicle in its analysis. Officials from both companies said they used the wrong notional model of the GCV that did {{not account for the}} change in requirements made by the Army or the advancements made in the technology development phase of the program. They also criticized the comparisons of the other vehicles. The report factored cost, survivability, mobility, and lethality, ranking the GCV's capabilities as lower than all others. The Army questioned the suitability of existing design. An Army test of currently fielded vehicles in 2012 revealed that some met critical GCV requirements, but none met enough without needing significant redesign. They <b>also</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> lethality was judged with a 25mm cannon for analysis, before the Army planned to mount a 30mm cannon. The CBO report did give credit to cost, assuming the Army's goal of $13 million per vehicle. However, Pentagon cost assessments estimated the price at $16–$17 million per vehicle.|$|E
