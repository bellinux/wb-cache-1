5|$|As {{a result}} of the company's deteriorating {{financial}} situation, Nakayama resigned as president of Sega in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri. Stolar would subsequently accede to become CEO and president of Sega of America. Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to a 54.8% decline in consumer product sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million). Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. This decision effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Rumors <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>upcoming</b> Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, the Democrats {{selected}} Breathitt and Benjamin Taylor {{as their}} candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. They faced a Whig (formerly National Republican) ticket of Richard Aylett Buckner and James Turner Morehead. Buckner was hurt by his extremely religious ideals, including opposition to handling mail on Sunday, {{and failed to}} garner the support {{of some of his}} own party's newspapers. Breathitt defeated Buckner by a small margin, but Morehead defeated Taylor, Breathitt's little-known running mate. Breathitt's election marked the first time a Democrat had ascended to the governorship of Kentucky. The election was marred by fraud, however. In Oldham County, the number of votes tallied represented 162.9% of the eligible voters in the county, and these votes broke two-to-one in favor of Breathitt. Most Kentuckians were more concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>upcoming</b> presidential election, hoping Whig and native son Henry Clay would defeat Democrat Andrew Jackson. Because of this, most of the other state offices went to Whig candidates.|$|E

5|$|Although Joachim von Ribbentrop {{had been}} named Foreign Minister in February 1938, Göring {{continued}} to involve himself in foreign affairs. That July, he contacted the British government {{with the idea that}} he should make an official visit to discuss Germany's intentions for Czechoslovakia. Neville Chamberlain was in favour of a meeting, and there was talk of a pact being signed between Britain and Germany. In February 1938, Göring visited Warsaw to quell rumours <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>upcoming</b> invasion of Poland. He had conversations with the Hungarian government that summer as well, discussing their potential role in an invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the Nuremberg Rally that September, Göring and other speakers denounced the Czechs as an inferior race that must be conquered. Chamberlain met with Hitler in a series of meetings that led to the signing of the Munich Agreement (29 September 1938), which turned over control of the Sudetenland to Germany. In March 1939, Göring threatened Czechoslovak president Emil Hácha with the bombing of Prague. Hácha then agreed to sign a communique accepting the German occupation of the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia.|$|E

5|$|Around 2012, {{development}} of The Witness for the next-generation of consoles with improved hardware capabilities became a possibility, and Blow {{and his team}} started looking at this opportunity. They had discounted the Wii U, again citing low specs, and decided {{to choose between the}} PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One platform. At the time of this decision, Sony was able to provide hardware information and development kits. Sony has also sought out independent developers like Blow to learn <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>upcoming</b> PlayStation 4 in preparation for its launch, while Microsoft had not yet released firm specifications for their console. Blow opted to go with the PlayStation platform; this decision was also aided by representatives from Sony that were interested in bringing the game to their system, and a larger trend of Sony to bring more downloadable and independently-developed games to their next console in contrast to Microsoft's tighter controls. Blow affirmed that there was no monetary deal involved with this decision. Blow also later acknowledged that he has had difficulties working with Microsoft in the past, and had previously explained several of the issues he had to go through with Microsoft to release his earlier game, Braid. The Witness had been planned as a launch-window title for the PlayStation 4 in 2013, a time-limited console exclusive. The Windows and iOS versions, at this point, were planned to be released alongside the PlayStation 4 version, barring any development delays that Blow and his team encountered. Other console versions would come later, if they opted to develop for them.|$|E

Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. Only 12 Saturn games were released in North America in 1998 (Magic Knight Rayearth being the final official release), compared to 119 in 1996. The Saturn would last longer in Japan and Europe. Rumors <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>upcoming</b> Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—were leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released. The Dreamcast was released on November 27, 1998 in Japan and on September 9, 1999 in North America. The decision to abandon the Saturn effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Sega suffered an additional ¥42.881 billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 1999, and the company announced plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, or nearly one-fourth of its workforce.|$|E
