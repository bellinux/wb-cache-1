He also developed <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> opera and classical music, on which he recalled spending quite a disproportionate amount of his scholarship's allowance, eventually building a collection of 317 records.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1920, Guinness {{export sales}} were mostly to ethnic Anglo Saxons and Celts. From the 1920s onwards this changed, {{and among the}} first natives to develop <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> the drink were the ethnic Chinese of the Malay Peninsula. In 1924, a global Guinness {{salesman}} was appointed by the company, and sales began to be pursued among native populations.|$|E
5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E

5|$|Both {{families}} were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> {{natural history and}} collecting {{when he joined the}} day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.|$|E
5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of whiskey {{was certainly not}} a norm in the colonies in the early years. The upper echelon of colonial society looked down upon American whiskey up until {{the time of the}} American Revolution. Some even saw the harsh spirit as a bastion of debauchery in the American colonies. Whatever the sentiment, the Scottish, Irish, and Germans brought <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> hard spirits from their homelands to the American colonies in the 1730s. These groups continued to produce hard spirits in imported stills, or stills based on Old World designs, in retaliation against the English economic controls.|$|E

5|$|Trollope {{expected}} his {{depiction of}} a fallen woman to be controversial, and unusually for him wrote a preface defending it. But the anticipated controversy never materialised, and contemporary reviewers tended to ignore that subplot, focussing instead on the courtship in the novel. Reviews were generally less than positive; many reviewers and readers who had acquired <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> Trollope from the 1850s60s Barchester novels were unhappy about the darker tone of later novels such as this one.|$|E
5|$|As a self-taught {{composer}} and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences {{led him to}} create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> 20th-century classical composers such as Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, and Anton Webern, along with 1950s rhythm and blues and doo-wop music. He began writing classical music in high school, {{while at the same}} time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands; later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Prince Sadruddin had <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> culture, {{including}} music, art and literature. He was {{a familiar}} figure at music festivals and other cultural events, both in Europe and overseas. His {{concern for the environment}} was complemented by his enjoyment of the outdoors; he was a keen skier and an accomplished sailor. While still at Harvard in 1953, Prince Sadruddin became the founding publisher of the Paris Review, which was established with the aim of bringing original creative work to the fore. Every year the Review awards the Aga Khan Prize for Fiction (established by his father) for the best short story that it published in the past year.|$|E
5|$|Richard John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan (18 December 1934 – {{disappeared}} 7 November 1974), {{commonly known}} as Lord Lucan, was a British peer suspected of murder who disappeared in 1974. He was an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, the eldest son of George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan, by his wife Kaitlin Dawson. An evacuee during the Second World War, Lucan returned to attend Eton College, and then from 1953 to 1955 served with the Coldstream Guards in West Germany. He developed <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> gambling and, skilled at backgammon and bridge, became an early member of the Clermont Club. Although his losses often exceeded his winnings, he left his job at a London-based merchant bank and became a professional gambler. He was known as Lord Bingham from April 1949 until January 1964, during his father's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} publisher, Waugh {{was educated}} at Lancing College and then at Hertford College, Oxford, and briefly worked as a {{schoolmaster}} {{before he became a}} full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends, and developed <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> country house society. In the 1930s, he travelled extensively, often as a special newspaper correspondent in which capacity he reported from Abyssinia {{at the time of the}} 1935 Italian invasion. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War (1939–1945), first in the Royal Marines and then in the Royal Horse Guards. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown, which occurred in the early 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Byzantines were avid {{players of}} tavli (Byzantine Greek: τάβλη), a game known in English as backgammon, {{which is still}} popular in former Byzantine realms, and still known by the name tavli in Greece. Byzantine nobles were devoted to horsemanship, {{particularly}} tzykanion, now known as polo. The game came from Sassanid Persia in the early period and a Tzykanisterion (stadium for playing the game) was built by Theodosius II (r. 408–450) inside the Great Palace of Constantinople. Emperor Basil I (r. 867–886) excelled at it; Emperor Alexander (r. 912–913) died from exhaustion while playing, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) was injured while playing with Tatikios, and John I of Trebizond (r. 1235–1238) died from a fatal injury during a game. Aside from Constantinople and Trebizond, other Byzantine cities also featured tzykanisteria, most notably Sparta, Ephesus, and Athens, an indication of a thriving urban aristocracy. The game {{was introduced to the}} West by crusaders, who developed <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> it particularly during the pro-Western reign of emperor Manuel I Komnenos.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s Dublin {{received}} occasional {{visits from}} international stars, and Stanford {{was able to}} hear famous performers such as Joseph Joachim, Henri Vieuxtemps and Adelina Patti. The annual visit of the Italian Opera Company from London, led by Giulia Grisi, Giovanni Matteo Mario and later Thérèse Tietjens, gave Stanford <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> opera that remained with him all his life. When he was ten, his parents took him to London for the summer, where he stayed with his mother's uncle in Mayfair. While there he took composition lessons from the composer and teacher Arthur O'Leary, and piano lessons from Ernst Pauer, professor of piano at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM). On his return to Dublin, his godmother having left Ireland, he took lessons from Henrietta Flynn, another former Leipzig Conservatory pupil of Moscheles, and later from Robert Stewart, organist of St Patrick's Cathedral, {{as well as from}} a third Moscheles pupil, Michael Quarry. During his second spell in London two years later, he met the composer Arthur Sullivan and the musical administrator and writer George Grove, who later played important parts in his career.|$|E
5|$|The prince found {{fulfillment}} {{in activities}} that required physical skills, {{rather than in the}} classroom. At his father's Santa Cruz farm, Pedro trained unbroken horses, and became a fine horseman and an excellent farrier. He and his brother Miguel enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even at night or in inclement weather. He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts, applying himself to wood carving and furniture making. In addition, he had <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> music, and under the guidance of Marcos Portugal the prince became an able composer. He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with several musical instruments (including piano, flute and guitar), playing popular songs and dances. Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of white cotton trousers, striped cotton jacket and a broad-brimmed straw hat, or a frock coat and a top hat in more formal situations. He would frequently take time to engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.|$|E
