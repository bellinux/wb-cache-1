40|$|Background: Many sport {{activities}} are {{a sequence of}} jumps (running, jumping, hurdling etc.). Each jump flight phase is <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous support phase. Objective: <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research was to identify differences in <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support lower limb and differences in take-off kinematics in specific take-off movement task. Methods: 14 male athletes (22. 6 &#x 202 F;±&#x 202 F; 4. 4 &#x 202 F;years; 182. 4 &#x 202 F;±&#x 202 F; 5. 3 &#x 202 F;cm; 74. 7 &#x 202 F;±&#x 202 F; 6. 2 &#x 202 F;kg) {{took part in a}} laboratory experiment. Each athlete performed five different take-off movements (running, acceleration running - second step, long jump take-off, high jump take-off and take-off to the hurdle). System Qualisys was used to analyze <b>the</b> kinematics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support limb. Dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support phase was monitored via force plate. ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc test were used to measure <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> differences between different take off tasks. Results: Dynamic characteristic showed significant differences in take-off (p&#x 202 F;<&#x 202 F;. 001). This variability is caused by differences in kinematic parameters at <b>the</b> instant <b>of</b> touch-down, minimum joint angles and take-off. The most important finding was different variability in range of motion in eccentric or concentric phases of each jump. Vertically orientated jumps are terminated in a higher degree of extension. Horizontal take-off types are characterized by <b>the</b> highest ranges <b>of</b> motion especially in <b>the</b> ankle <b>joint.</b> Conclusions: <b>The</b> support lower limb compliance is adjusted to the required task, which is related to lower limb kinematics during the support phase. High range of motion in each joint refers to more compliant <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for computing joint state, smoothed, density estimates for non-linear dynamical systems in a Bayesian setting. Many visual tracking {{problems can be}} formulated as probabilistic inference over time series, {{but we are not}} aware of mixture smoothers that would apply to weakly identifiable models, where multimodality is persistent rather than transient (e. g. monocular 3 D human tracking). Such processes, in principle, exclude iterated Kalman smoothers, whereas flexible MCMC methods or sample based particle smoothers encounter computational difficulties: accurately locating an exponential number of probable joint state modes representing high-dimensional trajectories, rapidly mixing between those or resampling probable configurations missed during filtering.

40|$|An {{innovative}} computer-aided {{method to}} plan and execute long bone fracture reduction using Dynafix™ unilateral external fixator (EF) is presented and validated. A matrix equation, which represents a sequential transformation from proximal to distal ends, was derived and solved for <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> rotation and translation required at each EF joint to correct for a displaced fracture using a non-linear least square optimization method. Six polyurethane-foam models of displaced fracture tibiae were used to validate the method. The reduction accuracy was quantified by calculating the residual translations (x r, y r, z r), the residual displacement (d r), and the residual angulations (α r, β r, γ r) based on the X-Y-Z Euler angle convention. The experiment showed that <b>the</b> mean±S.

(Chiropractic) Purpose: To {{establish}} <b>the</b> {{immediate effect}} <b>of</b> sacroiliac joint <b>adjustment</b> on functional leg length Method: Seventy participants were randomly divided in two equal groups. Participants of Group A (n= 35) leg length was measured pre and immediately post <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> dysfunctional sacroiliac joint. Group B (n= 35) {{received the same}} assessment protocol with no adjustment being administered. <b>The</b> trial consisted <b>of</b> one treatment session only in which all data was obtained. Objective data consisted of measuring participant’s leg length from the anterior superior iliac spine to <b>the</b> apex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medial malleolus using the standardized tape measure method. Subjective data was obtained through performing four sacroiliac joint orthopaedic tests or each participant’s and recording the results. Results: The subjective results showed positive results {{in at least three}} out <b>of</b> four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orthopedic tests for <b>the</b> participants <b>of</b> both groups. <b>The</b> sacral thrust technique and sacroiliac joint compression showed a greater percentage positive result in Group A at 91. 4 % where as <b>the</b> sacroiliac <b>joint</b> distraction was positive in 94. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants in Group B. Gaenslen’s showed the least accuracy with a positive result in 82. 9 % of participants in Group A and 74. 3 % in Group B.

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to develop an FE crash test dummy model to be used for safety {{evaluation}} <b>of</b> lying truck-occupants. <b>The</b> model was to be included in an available model of a truck sleeper section for simulations of a truck frontal impact using the Radioss finite element solver. The work began with a literature study in order to find out which kind of occupant model would be useful for the purpose. An available FE model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US SID, a crash test dummy used as an occupant substitute in car side impact testing, was chosen to be a platform for further development and adjustment to supine posture, i. e. lying position. The choice was motivated by the resemblance in load cases experienced by a passenger lying in <b>the</b> bunk <b>of</b> a truck during frontal impact and a seated passenger in car side impact, both being impacted laterally. <b>The</b> primary adaptation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dummy included development of a new, straight hip part and <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower-limb <b>joint</b> properties. <b>The</b> simulations made implied a need for further tuning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dummy model {{in order to make it}} work properly for the loading case in question. Comparisons have been made between the FE simulations and physical sled tests, having similar configuration, except for the occupant substitute used. For the physical tests a pedestrian Hybrid III dummy was used, designed primarily for frontal impact and therefore having different lateral responses. The main difference is <b>the</b> thorax region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dummies, where the Hybrid III is significantly stiffer than the US SID, which in its turn is supposed to be stiffer than a human.

The third group. Group C (control) received detuned ultrasound over <b>the</b> SI <b>joint.</b> Each patient received only one treatment. The inclusion criteria required that the patient had to be male, fall inside the above age range, and presented with asymptomatic sacroiliac joint dysfunction. This was determined either by diversified chiropractic motion palpation or SOT category analysis. Only category one patients were used in this study. The objective data was collected using an isometric dynamometer. The gastrocnemius muscle strength was measured with the dynamometer before and after the treatment. The objective results indicated that there was a statistically significant increase in gastrocnemius muscle strength in both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimental groups.

40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) Problem Statement: Ankle sprains are one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{most common}} acute {{injuries}} treated by physicians (Pellow & Brantingham, 2001). Most ankle sprains involve the lateral ankle ligaments, with the anterior tibiotalar ligament {{being the most}} commonly affected in injuries involving plantarflexion and inversion. These injuries often result in restriction of movements that will limit gait (Crosbie, Green, Refshauge, 1999). Even in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> injury to one ankle, the sensorimotor and postural deficits can be bilateral due to central processing of motor control information (Munna et. al., 2010, Monaghan et. al., 2006). <b>The</b> primary aim <b>of</b> a chiropractic <b>adjustment</b> is to increase joint range of motion (Fryer, Mudge, McLaughlin, 2002) and to correct local joint dysfunction (Pellow & Brantingham, 2001). No prior {{research has been done}} using the Zebris FDM-system to analyze changes in gait after ankle adjustment. Method: Sixty participants between <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 15 and 45 years were recruited. The participants were asked to sign a consent form after which a thorough case history, full physical exam and foot and ankle regional examination were performed. Participants were included in the study if they were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> correct age, had a chronic history of minor ankle sprain and had palpable motion restrictions of ankle joint range of motion. Participants were excluded if they had a history of severe ankle injury or ankle surgery, had any contraindications to chiropractic adjustment or were currently undergoing any other treatment that could interfere with the study, including <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> certain medications. Each participant underwent a gait assessment before and after they received a chiropractic adjustment to <b>the</b> restricted ankle <b>joint.</b> Procedure: Objective measurements were obtained using the Zebris FDM-system before and after participants received one chiropractic adjustment using a long axis distraction technique. The Zebris FDM-system uses capacitive force sensors arranged on a platform in a high density. The measuring plate allows dynamic force distribution to be analysed during gait. <b>The</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zebris platform allowed successive footfalls to be captured and measurements taken during three full gait cycles were used in the analysis. All data was processed using the WinFDM program to produce a gait report (Zebris Medical GmbH, 2008) Results: A statistically significant change was seen in the single support line on the non-adjusted side. Changes were measured in the other gait parameters although they were not statistically significant. Conclusion: This study has shown that chiropractic <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ankle <b>joint</b> has an effect on <b>the</b> path <b>of</b> centre of pressure and foot rotation during gait. It also helps clinicians to see that the adjustment has a bilateral effect. Future studies will be able to determine whether this is a positive or a negative outcome as <b>the</b> limits <b>of</b> normal and pathological gait using these parameters have not yet been set. Chiropractors can treat patients with a history of chronic ankle sprain more effectively if they {{have a better understanding of}} residual motion restrictions and movement patterns after acute ankle sprain.

Thirty participants from <b>the</b> surrounding community <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Johannesburg were randomly divided into one of three groups, with an equal male to female ratio within each group. Group A received a strength training protocol directed at the Gastrocnemius muscles. Group B received Chiropractic adjustment therapy directed at <b>the</b> Tibiotalar <b>joints</b> and Group C received a combination of a strength training protocol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gastrocnemius muscles in addition to Chiropractic adjustment therapy directed at <b>the</b> Tibiotalar <b>joints.</b> All three groups received 6 treatments on alternate days over a two week period. Objective data was collected by means of a surface Electromyograph (sEMG) taken pre- and post-treatment on the 1 st, 3 rd and 6 th appointments, and muscle strength testing was measured using an Isometric Dynamometer post-treatment on the 1 st, 3 rd and 6 th appointments. Demographic data was collected and evaluated from the Case History, Pertinent Physical Examination, Demographic Data Questionnaire and Physical Assessment Form. In executing the comparison, it was anticipated that all three groups would be effective, but the group undergoing the combination treatment would have the best improvement on the Gastrocnemius strength overall, followed by the adjustment group and then the strengthening group. It could then be concluded that Chiropractic adjustment therapy would provide a safe, cost effective treatment and preventative measure <b>of</b> injury to <b>the</b> Gastrocnemius muscles. Treatment proposed in this research could thus serve as an adjunct and preventative therapy in current rehabilitation treatment protocols in athletes as well as in the general public. The results obtained from the study demonstrated that there was no statistically significant improvement in either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groups however, there was a definite effect from the treatment protocols in each group that would warrant further investigation. There is a definite link between adjusting <b>the</b> Tibiotalar <b>joint</b> and affecting <b>the</b> Gastrocnemius muscle. Therefore, treating <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> can help <b>the</b> Gastrocnemius muscle to reach its optimal functionality. In conclusion, the study showed that Chiropractic <b>adjustment</b> therapy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tibiotalar <b>joint</b> and strengthening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gastrocnemius muscles had a combination effect on its strength and endurance that was greater than either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treatments alone.

40|$|Dexterous {{manipulation}} of large classes of objects demands large capacities from robotic systems. Most important are versatility, adaptability, and sensitivity. Robots comprised of two arms with two-jaw grippers as end-effectors {{have been used}} widely to solve various tasks. Recently, systems equipped with dexterous hands were developed, which exhibit a greater adaptability and promise a wider range <b>of</b> applications. <b>The</b> increased sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dexterous hand together with its lower joint friction compared to arm joints is expected to enhance <b>the</b> overall functionality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-handed system. Previous works on <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> two-handed systems consisting of two arms equipped with dexterous hands was mostly restricted to <b>the</b> independent control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arm and the hand subsystems. The coordination between fingers and arms has been barely studied. When studying the work related to the object level control of robotic hands {{it can be seen}} that several publications deal with <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> hand object systems, but the practitioners typically use pure stiffness controllers ignoring all the dynamic effects. In order to further develop <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> dynamic dexterous manipulation in theory and practice, this thesis is concerned with concepts to model and control a robot consisting of an upper body with two arms equipped with dexterous hands. For such a two-handed robot, <b>the</b> equations <b>of</b> motion are derived and compliant grasping controllers for various tasks are proposed. In particular, the object level impedance control was studied in more detail and a novel controller - the static intrinsically passive controller (IPC) - was proposed. In the literature, a systematic comparison of such controllers, in particular with experimental validation is missing. In <b>the</b> experiments <b>of</b> this thesis it could be shown that dynamic effects indeed are not negligible. The developed object level impedance controller is used in <b>the</b> synthesis <b>of</b> an impedance controller for two-handed compliant manipulation, which includes the finger arm coordination. This is the first time that such an impedance control law was successfully implemented on a two-handed robotic system - the DLR robot Justin. In view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new DLR (integrated) Hand Arm System, <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> tendon driven systems with inherent mechanically varying, respectively nonlinear, stiffness was investigated. In <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> control of variable stiffness actuators many approaches have been proposed in the literature in the last decade. However, only a few research groups are working on the control design for tendon-driven robotic hands with variable stiffness. In this context, this thesis contributes to the derivation and analysis of a controller based on motor side measurements with feed forward terms. <b>The</b> stability proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> closed loop system extends <b>the</b> seminal work <b>of</b> Tomei (Tomei, 1991) to <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> tendon controlled robots with variable joint stiffness. This thesis provides a large toolbox of high-level impedance behaviors for twohanded compliant manipulation. They range from reduced complexity (synergy) coordinates to the dexterous manipulation, which is the coordinated object level control using <b>the</b> fingertips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hands combined with <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arms and the torso. These tools offer interfaces in generalized - mostly Cartesian - coordinates to specify the motion, the internal forces, and the closed loop behavior in terms of compliance and damping coefficients. The controllers devoted to the variable stiffness system allow in addition <b>the</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanical <b>joint</b> stiffness, which can be advantageously used to optimize additional performance criteria demanded by a given task. This toolbox is highly relevant for <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> space robotics and service robotics applications. Furthermore, robots designed as production assistants can benefit from these developments. The presented controllers form a control framework applicable also to the commercially available DLR-HIT Hand II, which is supported by the EU Project ECHORD, the DLR Dexhand, and the DLR crawler. The synergy controller serves as a versatile testbed to study reduced complexity concepts within the EU FP 7 project THE - The Hand Embodied. The concepts related to the two-arm controllers can be used on two KUKA robot arms. The proposed impedance behaviors are useful to synthesize whole-body controllers...|$|R
