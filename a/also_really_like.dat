40|$|From a {{young age}} Pat Owens had a strong {{interest}} in nursing, and as a high school student she was even the President of her school’s Future Nurses Club. However, she <b>also</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> home economics so when she went to college she decided to pursue home economics rather than nursing. After working as at the Dairy Council as a nutrition consultant and later at Campbell’s Soup in their test kitchen, Ms. Owens decided that she wanted to instead pursue a career in nursing. After looking into different programs in the Philadelphia area, she chose Jefferson, entering in 1990 and graduating in 1992 with her BSN. After graduation she worked in the intermediate neuro intensive care unit at Jefferson before getting her Master’s degree as a gerontological nurse practitioner at the University of Pennsylvania. When she graduated in 1997 she left Jefferson to accept a job at the geriatric primary care clinic at the Veteran’s Hospital in Philadelphia. Though now retired she still works part-time as a legal nurse consultant. [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|In {{entertainment}} culture {{the crossing}} of the gender, for example cross-dressing, was a popular way of attracting the audience. One of the performers, ‘impersonators’ known in Europe, whose act was dancing as the opposite gender, started his career at the local opera in Riga in 1903. Since that time Kārlis Lencs, as he was called in Latvian press, had performed in Berlin, Paris, London, America, but in the Autumn of 1934 had arrived in a tour to Riga land also had performed in other places in Latvia - Vecauce, Durbe, Saldus. Such entertainment was available in Riga not only in 1903, but also in 1911. Intersex actor, Jespe (hermaphrodite), performed in cafe [...] "Šata". [...] "The actor sings very well, he <b>also</b> <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> young junkers and {{he is ready to}} do anything for them. The best idea isto dine with him and in the most critical moment to leave, he will be distraught, but that’s nothing," [...] in a private letter one junker of Polotsk cadet corps advised to another.|$|R
5000|$|Lisa Babick from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.5 {{star rating}} out of 5.0, stating: [...] "For all its ridiculousness, {{there were some}} moments I really enjoyed this hour. The fight scene between Mr. Freeze and Firefly was pretty cool. Even though I thought the whole Firefly taking on Selina as an {{assistant}} thing was goofy, I liked how {{she was willing to}} fight to protect her friend. It made me wonder if the real Bridgit was still alive underneath all of Strange's experiments. I <b>also</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> the whole bomb thing. It was fun because it was so over-the-top silly and was made even better by Lucius' facial expressions when he saw exactly what they were facing. I still don't get what Lucius was thinking when he agreed to accompany Bruce on this trip, but I'm glad he was there. [...] " [...] Karmen Fox of The Baltimore Sun wrote positively about the episode, [...] "'Transference' was a far superior ending to the season than last year's finale. But that’s not saying much. I'm still bitter that they rushed Barbara's descent into madness (Really? She goes to go from traumatized PTSD victim to Stockholm syndrome hostage to maniacal killer in three episodes?). Plus, Fish Mooney's death in last year's finale was weak. That's why I'm not even mad that they brought her back and are letting her stay around next season. Not to mention that I like Fish, even if Jada Pinkett Smith (a Baltimore native) can be a smidge melodramatic. But back to this year's finale. Though somewhat rushed, 'Transference' was an action-packed ending, wrapping up several plotlines while only keeping a few questions unanswered." ...|$|R

60|$|There is {{something}} mournful in the breaking up of an agreeable party, and few are the roofs {{in which one}} has sojourned, which are quitted without some feeling of depression. The sudden cessation of all those sources of excitement which pervade a gay and well arranged mansion in the country, unstrings the nervous system. For a week or so, we have done nothing which was not agreeable, and heard nothing which was not pleasant. Our self-love has been respected; {{there has been a}} total cessation of petty cares; all the enjoyment of an establisnment without any of its solicitude. We have beheld civilization only in its favoured aspect, and tasted only the sunny side of the fruit. Sometimes there are associations with our visit of a still sweeter and softer character, but on these we need not dwell: glances that cannot be forgotten, and tones that linger in the ear; sentiment that subdues the soul, and flirtation that agitates the fancy. No matter, whatever may be the cause, one too often drives away from a country-house, rather hipped. The specific would be immediately to drive to another, and it is a favourite remedy. But sometimes it is not in our power; sometimes for instance we must return to our household gods {{in the shape of a}} nursery; and though this was not the form assumed by the penates of Lord Marney, his presence, the presence of an individual so important and so indefatigable, was still required. His Lordship had passed his time at Mowbray to his satisfaction. He had had his own way in everything. His selfishness had not received a single shock. He had lain down the law and it had not been questioned. He had dogmatised and impugned, and his assertions had passed current, and his doctrines been accepted as orthodox. Lord Mowbray suited him; he liked the consideration of so great a personage. Lord Marney <b>also</b> <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> pomp; a curious table and a luxurious life; but he liked them under any roof rather than his own. Not that he was what is commonly called a Screw; that is to say he was not a mere screw; but he was acute and malicious; saw everybody's worth and position at a glance; could not bear to expend his choice wines and costly viands on hangers-on and toad-eaters, though at the same time no man encouraged and required hangers-on and toad-eaters more. Lord Marney had all the petty social vices, and none of those petty social weaknesses which soften their harshness or their hideousness. To receive a prince of the blood or a great peer he would spare nothing. Had he to fulfil any of the public duties of his station, his performance would baffle criticism. But he enjoyed making the Vicar of Marney or Captain Grouse drink some claret that was on the wane, or praise a bottle of Burgundy that he knew was pricked.|$|R
