5|$|Like Angelou's {{previous}} volumes, {{the book}} {{has been described as}} autobiographical fiction, though most critics, as well as Angelou, have characterized it as autobiography. Although most critics consider Angelou's first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings more favorably, The Heart of <b>a</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>has</b> received positive reviews. It was chosen as an Oprah's Book Club selection in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Travel is {{a common}} theme in American {{autobiography}} as a whole; McPherson writes that it {{is something of a}} national myth to Americans as a people. This is also the case for African-American autobiography, which {{has its roots in the}} slave narrative. The Heart of <b>a</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>has</b> three primary settings—the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Egypt—and two secondary ones—London and Accra.|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive sponges {{combine a}} barrier with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates {{during the first year}} depend on whether or not <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E

5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her {{white blood cell count}} halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E

25|$|If <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> {{one or more}} small prolactinoma, {{there is}} no reason that she cannot {{conceive}} and have a normal pregnancy after successful medical therapy. The pituitary enlarges and prolactin production increases during normal pregnancy in women without pituitary disorders. Women with prolactin-secreting tumors may experience further pituitary enlargement and must be closely monitored during pregnancy. However, damage to the pituitary or eye nerves occurs in {{less than one percent of}} pregnant women with prolactinoma. In women with large tumors, the risk of damage to the pituitary or eye nerves is greater, and some doctors consider it as high as 25%. If <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> completed a successful pregnancy, the chances of her completing further successful pregnancies are extremely high.|$|E

25|$|The {{second stage}} of birth will vary by factors {{including}} parity (the number of children <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> had), fetal size, anesthesia, {{and the presence of}} infection.

In the town square, Canales gave a speech and declared Puerto Rico a free Republic. The town was attacked from the air with P-47 U.S. bomber planes and on land with heavy artillery. The town was held by the Nationalists for three days.|$|E

Here, she stores her personal belongings such as clothes, jewelry, money and some food. <b>A</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> a degree of economic independence, and earnings and things related to her merchandise are stored in her personal granary. She can for example make cotton or pottery. The number of female granaries is an indication {{for the number of}} women living in the guinna.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{violence}} {{committed by}} men is {{to a large}} extent rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement. These belief systems grant women extremely few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances. Some men thus simply exclude the possibility that their sexual advances towards a woman might be rejected or that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> the right to make an autonomous decision about participating in sex. In some cultures women, as well as men, regard marriage as entailing the obligation on women to be sexually available virtually without limit, though sex may be culturally proscribed at certain times, such as after childbirth or during menstruation.|$|E

25|$|Historically, abortions {{have been}} done using herbal medicines, sharp tools, with force, or through other {{traditional}} methods. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest. In many places there is much debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion. Those who oppose abortion often maintain that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life and may compare abortion to murder. Those who favor the legality of abortion often hold that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> a right {{to make decisions about}} her own body.|$|E
25|$|Menopause, {{also known}} as the climacteric, is the time in most women's lives when menstrual periods stop permanently, and they are no longer able to bear children. Menopause {{typically}} occurs between 49 and 52 years of age. Medical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> not had any vaginal bleeding for a year. It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries. In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have ovaries, menopause may be viewed to have occurred {{at the time of the}} surgery or when their hormone levels fell. Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms typically occur earlier, at an average of 45 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Autoimmunity is {{possible}} cause of recurrent or late-term miscarriages. In {{the case of}} an autoimmune-induced miscarriages the woman's body attacks the growing fetus or prevents normal pregnancy progression. Autoimmune disease may cause genetic abnormalities in embryos which in turn may lead to miscarriage. As an example, Celiac disease increases the risk of miscarriage by an odds ratio of approximately 1.4. A disruption in normal immune function can lead to the formation of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. This will effect the ability to continue the pregnancy and if <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> repeated miscarriages, she can be tested for it. Approximately 15% of recurrent miscarriages are related to immunologic factors. The presence of anti-thyroid autoantibodies is associated with an increased risk with an odds ratio of 3.73 and 95% confidence interval 1.8–7.6. Having Lupus also increases the risk for miscarriage.|$|E
