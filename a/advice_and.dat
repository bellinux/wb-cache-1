50|$|Råd og Spørgsmål (<b>Advices</b> <b>and</b> Queries) is the <b>Advices</b> <b>and</b> Queries of Denmark Yearly Meeting, being a Danish {{translation}} {{based on}} the 1994 <b>Advices</b> <b>and</b> Queries of Britain Yearly Meeting.|$|R
50|$|The first chapter, <b>Advices</b> <b>and</b> Queries, {{originated}} from queries asked by London Yearly Meeting (the predecessor to Britain Yearly Meeting) to the quarterly meetings {{about the state}} of their meetings, <b>and</b> <b>advices</b> {{originated from}} the original Christian <b>and</b> brotherly <b>advices</b> given forth from time to time by the Yearly Meetings in London, alphabetically digested under proper heads. Until 1994, there were separate General <b>Advices</b> <b>and</b> Queries, which tended to be related to each other - the advices giving advice on Christian living, and the queries being questions which asked Friends how they were living their lives, and could be used for personal reflection or discussion in groups. There was a requirement that all the <b>advices</b> <b>and</b> queries were read in each meeting {{over the course of a}} year. Since 1994, the <b>advices</b> <b>and</b> queries have been mixed together, so that each paragraph has both <b>advices</b> <b>and</b> queries within it. There is also no longer a requirement that they are read in each meeting, although some meetings do continue this practice. This chapter is published as a separate free booklet and is published in both English and Welsh.|$|R

40|$|Across 8 experiments, the {{influence}} of anxiety on <b>advice</b> seeking <b>and</b> <b>advice</b> taking is described. Anxious individuals {{are found to be}} more likely to seek <b>and</b> rely on <b>advice</b> than are those in a neutral emotional state (Experiment 1), but this pattern of results does not generalize to other negatively valenced emotions (Experiment 2). The relationships between anxiety <b>and</b> <b>advice</b> seeking <b>and</b> anxiety <b>and</b> <b>advice</b> taking are mediated by self-confidence; anxiety lowers self-confidence, which increases <b>advice</b> seeking <b>and</b> reliance upon <b>advice</b> (Experiment 3). Although anxiety also impairs information processing, impaired information processing does not mediate the relationship between anxiety <b>and</b> <b>advice</b> taking (Experiment 4). Finally, anxious individuals are found to fail to discriminate between good <b>and</b> bad <b>advice</b> (Experiments 5 a– 5 c), <b>and</b> between <b>advice</b> from advisors with and without a conflict of interest (Experiment 6) ...|$|R
