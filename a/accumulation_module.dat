40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{for the first}} phase of a photovoltaic-module soiling study that was carried out with NASA participation to investigate the problem of the electrical performance degradation of flat-plate photovoltaic modules exposed at outdoor sites that is due to the accumulation of airborne particulates on sensitive optical surfaces. The results were obtained in both field and laboratory soiling experiments, as well as in materials field experiments using candidate encapsulants and top covers. It is concluded that: (1) the electrical performance degradation shows a significant time and site dependence, ranging from 2 % to 60 % power loss; (2) the rate of particulate accumulation appears to be largely material independent when natural removal processes do not dominate; (3) the effectiveness of natural removal processes, especially rain, is strongly material dependent; (4) top-cover materials of glass and plexiglass retain fewer particles than silicone rubber; and (5) high module voltages relative to ground do not appear to affect the rate of dirt <b>accumulation</b> on <b>modules...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Marine Spill Simulation Software Set {{is based}} on {{physical}} and information theoretical components. The physical component of the simulation model consists {{of a system of}} differential and algebraic equations that describe processes which influence the motions and characteristics of oil at sea. This report deals especially with the information theoretical components of the simulation model. At the beginning of this report the motivations in choosing a microcomputer for this application - instead of a mainframe - are explained. Thereupon attention is transferred from hardware to software. The reasons for selecting Fortran 77 as programming language are stated and the user-friendly elements of the model are discussed and illustrated with a few examples. The simulation software structure clearly shows that the model is divided in three major modules namely a data <b>accumulation</b> and processing <b>module,</b> an actual simulation module and an output module. All input data are summed up and the way these data are handled is discussed. The present-day required processing of input data and future input possibilities bring the survey of the data <b>accumulation</b> and processing <b>module</b> to a close. Efficient integration methods for the simulation processes are selected to improve run speed. The handling of output data and the recommended future output presentation are discussed next. Finally, simulation runs are done with test data to check is the model functions correctly. Furthermore run time, accuracy, efficiency and stability are determined and assessed.

40|$|Numerical and {{analytical}} models {{of sand and}} dust particle <b>accumulation</b> on photovoltaic <b>modules</b> in dry regions are presented and supported by a laboratory investigation of sand particle accumulation on a glass surface. Both models and the experimental data indicate that {{the reduction in the}} free fractional area can be described by an exponential decay resulting from the formation of clusters of particles. Such clusters can support particles in upper layers which reduce the available area for photon capture by a much smaller amount than particles resting directly on the glass surface. The results qualitatively describe existing field data beyond the linear regime and are developed to account for field conditions, including analysis of photovoltaic module tilt, humidity and wind speed. This investigation is intended as a basis of an engineering design tool to assess the case for including photovoltaics in dry regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} soiling on PV systems impacts {{negatively}} the energy production. This phenomenon is highly dependant {{on the environmental}} context and conditions of operation. Indeed dirt, dust, and other air contaminants are site-specific and their <b>accumulation</b> on PV <b>modules</b> depends on the installation configuration. This study, conducted in Santiago de Chile {{over a period of}} two and half years, focuses on analyzing power production and soiling losses of three photovoltaic technologies, monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film Si. We present the method used for analyzing time series of production data, and demonstrate the seasonality of soiling rates in Santiago city. Indeed, soiling rate values for winter season, where contamination is high, are three times higher than values for summer season, where contamination is low. A yearly trend of soiling is determined and used to study the link between economical parameters and cleaning pattern applied. The results allow us to define an optimal cleaning period depending on the period of the year...|$|R

These dependencies can have different curvatures, showing that the modulus of elasticity of the blends can exceed the average values for different blends. The authors made a dynamic mechanical analysis of incompatible blends of polydimethylsiloxane and polyisoprene, the measured temperature dependence of <b>modules</b> <b>accumulation</b> and loss [3]. They detected two relaxation mechanisms, which can be suppressed by using computerization representing the diblock copolymers of the same components. The possibility of calculating elasticity modulus is presented for different situations: the dispersion of solid polymer in the viscoelastic matrix, dispersion of solid polymer 1 in solid polymer 2; dispersion of solid partially crystalline polymer in solid polymer 2. The dependence of the modulus of elasticity on molar and volume fraction have different forms, depending on Van der Waal component volume, the molecular weight of the recurring units, component density, domain volume, etc. The very form of the dependency {{is determined by the}} physical state (rubber elasticity polymer, crystalline polymer, solid amorphous polymer) of the blend components...|$|R
40|$|Here a snow <b>accumulation</b> and melt <b>module</b> {{implemented}} in the GEOTOP model is presented and tested. GEOTOP is a distributed model of the hydrological cycle, based on digital elevation models (DEMs), which calculates the discharge at the basin outlet and estimates the local and distributed values of several hydro-meteorological quantities. It solves the energy and the mass balance jointly and deals accurately {{with the effects of}} topography on the interactions among radiation physics, energy balance and hydrological cycle. Soil properties are considered to depend on soil temperature and moisture and the heat, and water transfer in the soil is modeled using a multi-layer approach. The snow module solves for the soil–snow energy and mass exchanges, and, together with a runoff production module, is embedded in a more general energy balance model that provides all the boundary conditions required. The snowpack is schematized as a single snow layer where a limited number of physical processes are described. The module can be seen essentially as a parameter-free model. The application to an Alpine catchment (Rio VALBIOLO – Trentino – Italy), monitored by an in-situ snow depth sensor, is here discussed and shown to give results comparable to those of more complex models...|$|R
40|$|Dust <b>accumulation</b> on PV <b>module</b> {{surface or}} known as soiling {{phenomenon}} {{is one of}} the environmental factors that contribute to PV module performance reduction. Its presence will reduce the absorbance of sunlight and the energy being converted into electricity. This issue has been discussed in various studies to highlight its impact on PV system performance and reliability when exposed under actual operating conditions. In addition, the surrounding environment, climate behaviour and rise in module temperature are other factors affect the PV energy output and these factors are unpredictable and difficult to justify. This paper presents an experimental-based approach to investigate the effect of soiling on PV module performance in a laboratory condition. The indoor experiment involved with accelerated artificial dust loading for testing dust physical property which is the density of dust accumulation, relative size and dust colour. The findings show that proliferation of soiling density has severe effect to the short circuit current (Isc) but minimal to open circuit voltage (Voc) reduction. On the dust particle relative size, the result has proven that the finer dust particle in soiling can reduce the PV module performance more than the coarser particle. Meanwhile, the brighter dust tones and colours are found to reduce module performance more than the darker one...|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} model of pigeonpea is described {{that is designed}} to simulate the development, growth, nitrogen accumulation and yield {{of a wide range of}} maturity types from extra-short to medium-duration in response to weather, soil conditions and agronomic management. Parameters of the model for phenological development, leaf area expansion, radiation interception, biomass accumulation and partitioning, crop water use, root growth and water extraction, and nitrogen accumulation are derived from published studies. In addition, the calibration exercise is described to derive the parameters accounting for the effect of plant population density on leaf area expansion. The model was tested on 38 data sets, not previously used to derive model parameters, collected at Patancheru, India. Data sets encompassed a wide range of plant type, sowing density, and seasons, grown on Alfisol and Vertisol soil types under dryland and irrigated conditions. The time to flowering and maturity from the extra-short to medium-duration types were simulated well, explaining 96 and 92 % of the variance (RMSD= 4. 3 and 9. 8 days), respectively. Total aboveground biomass was simulated with less accuracy, explaining 74 % of the variance (RMSD= 2056 kg ha- 1) and grain yield was simulated explaining 76 % of the variance (RMSD= 332 kg ha- 1). There remains scope for model improvement in the areas of waterlogging and testing on crop N <b>accumulation.</b> This pigeonpea <b>module,</b> when coupled with other crop, soil and management modules can be used to address a range of cropping systems issues...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe energy {{strategy}} of Algeria {{is based on}} the acceleration of the development of solar energy. The strategic choice is motivated by the availability of a huge potential in solar energy. This energy is the major focus of the energetic program where the photovoltaic (PV) solar systems constitute an essential part. The photovoltaic energy fully meets the needs of facilities in remote desert areas where connection to the grid is too expensive. However, the southern Algerian regions are generally characterized by frequent sandstorms. This natural phenomenon causes the dust <b>accumulation</b> on PV <b>modules.</b> Consequently, this may reduce the efficiency of PV array. The objective of this research is to study the effects of the dirt accumulation on the optical transmittance of a PV array glazing in desert regions of Algeria. Firstly, we have validated our model of irradiance on tilted plane, which was the result of Hottel model improvement for Algerian sites. Secondly, the experiments have been conducted on the effect of the dust particle accumulation on the PV modules glazing. The tests were performed with the PVPM 2540 C in natural conditions to determine the current/voltage characteristics and see the resulting efficiency. It was found in this study, that the dust accumulation on the PV generator glazing surface tilted at 32 ° can significantly decrease the irradiance transmittance during the day by an average between 0 % and 8 % after an exposure period of several months...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{utilization of}} lignin for fungible fuels and products {{represents one of}} the most imminent challenges in modern biorefinery. My research thesis has mainly focused on developing and optimizing the lignin-to-lipid conversion route. Advanced ^ 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) lignin characterization technology, laccase based lignin pretreatment technology, proteomics and synthetic biology tools were applied to this study. First, the study demonstrated that the enzymes and microbes synergized to degrade different functional groups of lignin to promote the bioconversion. The Rhodococcus opacus cell growth increased exponentially in response to the level of laccase treatment, indicating the synergy between laccase and bacterial cells in lignin degradation. NMR analysis suggested that laccase, R. opacus cell and Fenton reaction reagents promoted the degradation of different types of lignin functional groups, elucidating the chemical basis for the synergistic effects. The cell-laccase fermentation led to a 17 -fold increase of lipid production. Second, the study showed that enhanced electron transfer via electron mediators can promote the redox reaction to catalyze the lignin bioconversion by laccase. NMR analysis revealed that an efficient enzyme-mediator system can promote the cleavage of most intramolecular and intermolecular cross-links including the condensed chemical linkages, leading to the degradation of lignin to a large extent. The R. opacus PD 630 growth was increased by 10 ^ 6 fold and the simple batch fermentation could achieve lipid titer at more than 1 g/L. Third, through systems biology-guided biodesign, I have optimized multiple steps of lignin degradation towards to lipid production. An efficient laccase secretion system was established in PD 630 for lignin depolymerization through different molecular levels including transcription, translation, signal peptide secretion efficiency and transporters. Moreover, lipid biosynthesis pathway of R. opacus PD 630 was optimized based on the proteomics analysis, which led to significantly increased lipid <b>accumulation.</b> The two <b>modules</b> of lignin depolymerization and lipid biosynthesis were then integrated for efficient lignin conversion into lipid. In summary, these studies enabled more efficient conversion of lignin and biorefinery waste to fungible products. The fundamental understanding of chemical and biological processes in lignin conversion can be exploited in different ways to enable various biorefinery product streams from biorefinery waste streams...|$|R
30|$|TiO 2 {{is widely}} used as a {{photocatalyst}} {{and it can be}} applied in environmental and energy fields, including self-cleaning surfaces, air and water purification systems, anti-fogging surfaces, among others [1]. The self-cleaning property of TiO 2 is provided by two photo-induced phenomena [2]. The first one is the photocatalysis, wherein organic contaminants adsorbed on film surface are decomposed under ultraviolet light [3]. This property allows TiO 2 to be applied in air and water purification systems as well as for self-cleaning surfaces. The second one is the photo-induced superhydrophilicity, wherein contaminants and dirt are washed off the surface by the film of water on it [4]. On the superhydrophilic surface, a very small water contact angle is formed (θ[*]≤[*] 5 °), as the water tends to spread completely across the surface rather than forming droplets. This makes the surface anti-fogging and easy- washing [1, 3]. Commercial self-cleaning and anti-fogging surfaces are usually made of TiO 2 thin films [5]. However, TiO 2 thin films have some limitations, for example, they reduce the glass transmittance due to the high refractive index of TiO 2 [6]. Moreover, in dark environments TiO 2 films have a rapid reestablishment of hydrophobicity, which affects negatively the self-cleaning efficiency [7]. TiO 2 /SiO 2 composite films can circumvent these limitations, slowing down the increase of water contact angle in dark environments and presenting higher transmittance with respect TiO 2, which is essential for the application as a self-cleaning surface in solar energy area [2, 6, 7]. Self-cleaning surface are indeed important for PV application, since the dust, pollution, and other particles accumulation reduce the transparency of the PV module cover glasses and consequently decrease the electrical performances of the modules. In particular for CPV modules, the soling effect is particularly severe, since such modules mainly collect the sun direct light which can be strongly reduced by the dust <b>accumulation</b> on the <b>module.</b> Performance degradation up to 30 % has been measured [8]. Several studies have been made to address the severity of deposited particles (like dust, water stains, carbon from smoke, and pollen from agricultural regions) on the efficiency reduction of solar devices, which results in additional costs either from oversizing the system or from cleaning them [9]. For photovoltaic application, besides the self-cleaning properties, the coating should present adequate adhesion and transparency in the wavelength region 300 – 1800  nm. Several techniques have been reported for the deposition of TiO 2 and SiO 2 thin films, like CVD [10], sputtering [11 - 13], electron beam evaporation [14] and sol–gel process [2, 6, 7, 15]. Sol–gel method has the advantage of offering small and large area deposition at a low cost [15]. In literature, however, detailed analyses of the anti-soling film in term of structural properties, transparency, robustness and cost are still missing. In this work, pure TiO 2 and TiO 2 /SiO 2 composite films containing different titanium content have been deposited over glass substrates by sol–gel dip-coating method aiming at obtaining super hydrophilic, adherent and transparent coating. The influence of the titanium content and the calcination temperature has been evaluated. The coatings have been compared and characterized regarding their optical, mechanical and microstructural properties.|$|R
40|$|The {{state-owned}} enterprise, Statskog SF, is {{the largest}} landowner in Norway. Currently, Statskog owns a property lacking the infrastructure for water and electricity in Sør-Trøndelag County, Norway. In this area, Statskog plans to develop a small community of environmental friendly cabins that are sustained by renewable energy technologies. This thesis investigated the possibilities of energy generation from solar cell (Photovoltaics), wind turbine and thermoelectric generator for teh proposed development, Nognillosen. Also. estimates were made {{for the amount of}} electricity needed to power the cabin, depending upon the diverse energy consumption of cabin users. During periods of low temperatures, freezing problems may occur when water is stored inside the cabin. Therefore, a low-energy solution to protect the cabins from frost was also presented. The goal was to explore an autonomous solution in each cabin in contrast to looking at a common solution for the whole community. The energy consumption for high demand users at a cabin was estimated to be 19 kWh during a week. For lower demands, the energy consumption is estimated to be 6 kWh for the same period of time. A common demand of a cabin users is to have easy-access throughout the year, without being concerned that the water is frozen. It has been evaluated that off-grid cabins cannot be frost protected by electric power. As a solution, this thesis proposed using geothermal energy to collect heat by water and circulating the water through pipes inside the walls of an insulated room. To keep the temperature at 5 inside the room, the required water flow was calculated to be 0, 88 l/min. Due to natural convection the low water flow will provide an automatic circulation in the water well. A pump should be used to start the circulation in the well, and was calculated to have minimum consumption of 2, 29 mW. To pump water through pipes inside the walls of the room, a minimum of 5, 56 mW would be required. In order to calculate power generation from solar cells and wind turbines at Nognillosen, solar radiation data was extracted from PVGIS and wind measurements is provided by Kjeller Vindteknikk. Solar radiation on a horizontal surface at Nognillosen is measured to 890 kWh/m^ 2 for a whole year. It was suggested to place solar modules with 90 declination angle on the south-end wall of the cabin for optimal power generation during winter. This would decrease the power loss from snow <b>accumulation</b> on the <b>modules.</b> The power production was calculated to be 385, 5 kWh for a whole year with 690 Wp solar modules. Average wind velocity at Nognillosen in 2013 was 5, 28 m/s in a height of ten meters above the ground. During April, a 500 W wind turbine is calculated to generate 251 kWh of energy. A thermoelectric generator uses heat from a heated source to generate electricity. By placing it on a wood stove, a small but steady power production could be provided, irrelevant of climatic conditions. Because of high power consumption during winter, a thermoelectric generator was determined as an asset to wind and solar generation. Lead-acid batteries were suggested as an energy storage because of high capacity and low cost. To keep the storage autonomous for a week, it was estimated that seven batteries for high-energy consumption and three for low-energy consumption. In the light of the solutions mentioned, the thesis presents the possibilities for an off-grid cabin to be self-sustaining, and have low-carbon footprint, at the same time. Furthermore, it shows a solution of frost protection that will provide high comfort and low maintenance. M-M...|$|R
3000|$|One of {{the major}} impacts of dust {{deposition}} is observed on the transmittance of solar modules. Transmittance is generally known by the degree of solar radiation passing through a module encapsulation (generally made of plastic or glass). The transmittance reduction due to dust deposition eventually leads to reduction on power generation from modules. Different studies have shown large performance variations from location to location {{as a function of}} exposure time (Siddiqui and Bajpai 2012; Aassem et al. 2012). El-Shobokshy and Hussein (1993), covered PV module surfaces with different dust types (i.e. limestone, cement, carbon) and found the short-circuit current was reduced to 20 % of its initial value for the carbon accumulation with only 28  g/m 2, whereas same reduction was accounted with 73  g/m 2 deposition for cement, 125  g/m 2 for 50  µm, 168  g/m 2 for 60  µm and 250  g/m 2 for 80  µm limestone dust. It was specifically noted that the material composition of dust also affects PV performance. From the results, carbon particles absorb solar radiation more readily than the other dust types. Mailuha et al. (1994) focused the study on the effects of dust-deposited layer density and included tilt angle and solar intensity, and found that with the increment of solar intensity, the PV performance degraded due to decrement in dust accumulation. At 700  W/m 2, the reduction in power output was almost negligible; however, when the intensity dropped to 400  W/m 2, the reduction was nearly 25 % of the initial power output. Continuous humid environment causes degradation in solar cell efficiency and causes the transmittance to decrease (Mekhilef et al. 2012). The results of study by Jiang et al. (2011), to investigate the output degradation of different types of PV modules with different surface materials caused by airborne dust pollution experimentally, indicated that dust pollution has a significant impact on PV module output. With dust deposition density increasing from 0 to 22  g/m 2, the corresponding reduction in PV output efficiency grew from 0 to 26 %. The reduction in efficiency was found to have a linear relationship with the dust deposition density, and the difference caused by cell types was not obvious. Also the reduction in output power at relatively higher solar densities is much more severe. This phenomenon is probably attributed to relatively higher reflection effect of the deposited dust to light. Sometimes PV modules of same and different technologies are known to have a different power rating, so performance ratio could be the best platform for power rating comparison. An experiment found the performance ratio decreasing with the dust accumulation, and the ratio is expected to substantially improve once the modules were cleaned (Adinoyi and Said 2013). From various studies, the dust accumulated on the PV module surface is found to decrease the transmittance of incident light and ultimately decrease the solar energy received by the solar cells in PV modules. In a study conducted in Baghdad Saidan et al. (2015), the experimental results show that dust considerably reduces the maximum current from 6.9 to 16.4 % depending on the time period of PV panels’ exposure in dust-affected environment, i.e. from one day to one month. Elminir et al. (2006) in Egypt investigated the effect of dust on the transparent cover of solar sensor using several sensors and concluded that soiling on glass inclined of an angle of 0 ° and 90 ° from horizontal causes a reduction in the corresponding transmittance by approximately 52.54 and 12.38 %, respectively. This shows that the tilt angle plays one {{of the major}} roles in determining the performance of PV modules. Hegazy (2001) studied dust deposition on glass plate surfaces with various tilt angles and also measured the transmittance of plate under different weather conditions and concluded that the degradation in solar transmittance primarily depends upon the tilt angle. Dust accumulation on a tilted glass plate located in Kuwait City was found to reduce the transmittance of the plate from 64 to 17 % for the tilt angles ranging from 0 ° to 60 °, respectively, after 38  days of outdoor environment exposure (Sayigh et al. 1985). Soiling on a glass plate tilted at 45 ° angle decreased transmittance by an average of 8 % after an exposure period of 10  days in a research performed in India (Garg 1973). A study by Cano (2011) on the effect of tilt angle of PV modules on dust deposition in Arizona found that during the period of January through March 2011 there was an average loss due to soiling of approximately 2.02 % for 0 ° tilt angle. Modules at tilt angles 23 ° and 33 ° also have some irradiance losses but do not come close to the module at 0 ° tilt angle. Tilt angle 23 ° has approximately 1.05 % monthly irradiance loss, and 33 ° tilt angle has an irradiance loss of approximately 0.96 %. The effect of dust deposition is evident at any tilt angle, but the magnitude is different with the solar module with low tilt angle being bound to more energy losses. Al-Hasan (1998) investigated the effect of the amount of accumulated dust on the efficiency of a PV module in the Kuwait climate on almost similar latitude to Kathmandu (latitude 30 °). A linear relation has been proposed to correlate the degradation in efficiency with the amount of sand dust accumulated on the module surface. Paudyal and Shakya (2016) on the similar research have derived another regression equation relating the impact of various meteorological parameters as well as dust deposition density for Kathmandu. This relation could help PV system designers to reliably predict the effect of dust <b>accumulation</b> on PV <b>module</b> efficiency under real environmental conditions. Ndiaye et al. (2013) on their investigation on the effect of soiling in the performance of PV modules have highlighted the impact of dust on the current–voltage and power–voltage characteristics of PV modules {{with the advent of the}} mismatch effect.
