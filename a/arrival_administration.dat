40|$|Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of adult {{neurologic}} disabilityin Canada, which costs the Canadian economy at least$ 3 billion annually. 1 Every year, more than 50 000 Canadians experience a stroke and more than 300 000 live with the ongoing effects. 1, 2 Over the next 10 years, the incidence of stroke is expected to increase with the growing elderly popula-tion and with the rising prevalence of diabetes and obesity. 3 It has been suggested in the literature that integrated and co-ordinated stroke care, including prevention, acute manage-ment, rehabilitation, recovery and reintegration in the com-munity, will save lives. 4 Canadian projections based on a recently developed economic model for stroke care suggest that, over a 20 -year period, organized stroke care, including specialized units and teams and access to acute interventions, could prevent 160 000 strokes and achieve a projected $ 8 bil-lion in net savings to the Canadian health care system. 5 A system-wide evaluation of stroke care in the province of Ontario, Canada, revealed significantly improved outcomes following a 6 -year period of implementation of an organized stroke care program. 6 Despite the strength of this evidence, significant gaps in translation of this knowledge into action remain among physicians, nurses, rehabilitation therapists and other health care professionals in Canada. 7 Data from the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network, which included in-formation from 21 hospitals in 8 provinces from June 2001 to February 2002, indicated variations in the time from stroke onset to hospital <b>arrival,</b> <b>administration</b> of acute thromboly-sis, admission to units specializing in stroke care and use of anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation. 7 Population-based chart audits from across Canada 8 – 12 indicated consider-able variations in stroke care across geographic regions and across hospitals based on their size and designation as...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives. Clinical care protocols, such as CODITOX {{for severe}} acute poisonings, attempt to codify and {{coordinate}} care processes to prevent delays {{in situations where}} timing is a key factor. This study aimed to measure the degree of adherence to CODITOX and compare patterns of activation of the protocol over time. Methods. Noninterventional, retrospective, analytical study of CODITOX activations in 2012. We compared poisonings attended according to the CODITOX protocol to those attended without CODITOX activation in the emergency department's resuscitation unit. Results. Out of 90 poisoning cases, 12 were attended following the CODITOX (group A). In 36 cases (group B), patients were not attended according to protocol even though they presented with criteria that should have activated it; in the remaining 42 cases, criteria for activating the protocol were not present {{and it was not}} used. Complications developed in 75 % of group-A cases and 28 % of group-B cases (P=. 006). In group A, 41. 7 % of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (25 % in group B); mortality was 4. 4 % and there were no significant between-group differences. The times between <b>arrival</b> and <b>administration</b> of charcoal and between <b>arrival</b> and <b>administration</b> of an antidote tended to be shorter in group A, but again the between-group differences were not statistically significant and did not affect duration of hospital stay. Conclusions. The CODITOX protocol is not used in all cases that meet the activation criteria. Although the cases treated according to protocol were more serious, no clinical, therapeutic, or outcome differences could be identified between patients treated or not treated according to the CODITOX. The protocol-treated patients developed more complications, however...|$|R
40|$|Background: Anaphylaxis, {{a severe}} {{systemic}} allergic reaction, can be fatal. However, its prevalence has been underestimated especially in biphasic phase, {{due to a}} lack of case awareness. This study aimed to determine the rate of anaphylaxis, describe clinical manifestations and management, and identify the causative agents and risk factors of biphasic anaphylactic reaction. Methods: An observational study was conducted at the Emergency Department of Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, during the period 2004 – 2008. Results: Of total 208 cases of anaphylaxis identified, the median age was 20. 67 years; 52. 9 % were male. The anaphylaxis rate was 49 per 100, 000 patient-years. No fatal case was found; 58. 7 % had a history of atopy, and 38. 5 % had experienced a previous allergic reaction, of whom 8. 8 % had had a previous anaphylactic reaction. The causative allergens were identified in 82. 2 % of cases; food allergy was most common. Urticaria was the most common presentation (87 %). Among 6. 3 % of the patients who developed biphasic reaction, a significantly longer time from onset of symptoms to administration of epinephrine was detected, with a median of 240 minutes for those with biphasic anaphylaxis, versus 70 minutes for those without (p = 0. 002). The median times from onset to hospital arrival and the <b>arrival</b> to <b>administration</b> of epinephrine were also significantly longer in the biphasic group than the non-biphasic patients (p = 0. 002 and p = 0. 001, respectively). In multivariable regression models, the time intervals from onset and hospital <b>arrival</b> to <b>administration</b> of epinephrine continued to predict biphasic phase occurrence (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Anaphylaxis predominantly occurs among children and young adults. Delayed administration of epinephrine was associated with the occurrence of biphasic anaphylaxis...|$|R
40|$|Background. Coronary {{heart disease}} (CHD), {{the leading cause}} of death in the United States, {{accounted}} for approximately 490, 000 deaths in 1993. Angina pectoris, a manifestation of CHD, accounted for 13, 586 Medicare discharges in 1993 in Texas. A pilot project showed aspirin prophylaxis that reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in individuals with acute angina is underused. Texas Medical Foundation collaborated with 10 acute-care facilities to improve aspirin prophylaxis. Methods. Collaborators assessed processes of care and implemented clinical pathways to improve aspirin administration.

40|$|Background and Aims: Post-operative {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} (PONV) {{is a common}} and distressing complication after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of intravenous (IV) dextrose administration for the prophylaxis of PONV after LC. Methods: In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial, a total of 150 female patients who were scheduled for elective LC were randomly assigned into two groups (A and B). Thirty minutes before induction of anaesthesia, patients received an infusion of 500 cc lactated Ringer's solution (Group A) and 5 % dextrose in lactated Ringer's solution (Group B) and over a period of 30 min. All patients rated their nausea and vomiting intensity using the verbal rating scale immediately at post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) arrival; 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after arriving at the PACU and 6, 12 and 24 h after surgery. Results: There was a statistically significant time trend and group effect along with significant differences in time/group interaction effect in both groups for nausea and vomiting scores (P < 0. 05). A low negative correlation coefficient was found (r = − 0. 394, P < 0. 001) between blood glucose levels and nausea scores upon PACU <b>arrival.</b> Dextrose <b>administration</b> reduced the odds of vomiting events compared to placebo (estimate: − 0. 87, odds ratio = 0. 42, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 28 – 0. 64). Conclusion: Administration of IV dextrose before anaesthesia induction may be recommended as an effective, and safe method for the prophylaxis of PONV after LC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Introduction: Acute {{myocardial}} infarction {{is one of}} the major causes of mortality in developing countries such as Iran. One of the most important progresses in acute {{myocardial infarction}} is early administration of therombolytic agents such as streptokinase. This study was performed to determine the time interval from patients’ referral to the emergency wards to the introduction of thrombolytic therapy and the factors associated with delay in drug administration. Methods: In a period of 8 months, 130 patients with presumed acute myocardial infarction were investigated. In order to determine the causes of delay in streptokinase administration, duration of symptoms onset to drug administration was divided into 4 specified periods and measured in minutes. Results were analyzed using ANOVA and t-test. Results: Findings showed a mean elapsed time of 298 minutes between pain onset and referring to the emergency ward, 73 minutes between patient’s <b>arrival</b> and streptokinase <b>administration.</b> Mean time from symptom onset to drug infusion was 370 minutes. There was a delay of 2 hours in drug administration in 18...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe Early Retavase-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (ER-TIMI) 19 trial {{tested the}} {{feasibility}} of prehospital initiation of the bolus fibrinolytic reteplase (rPA) and determined the time saved by prehospital rPA {{in the setting of}} contemporary emergency cardiac care. BackgroundNewer bolus fibrinolytics have undergone only limited evaluation for prehospital administration. In addition, as door-to-drug times have decreased, the relevance of findings from prior trials of prehospital fibrinolysis has become less certain. MethodsPatients (n = 315) with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were enrolled in 20 emergency medical systems in North America. The time from emergency medical service (EMS) <b>arrival</b> to <b>administration</b> of a fibrinolytic was compared between study patients receiving prehospital rPA and sequential control patients from 6 to 12 months before the study who received a fibrinolytic in the hospital. ResultsAcute myocardial infarction was confirmed in 98 %. The median time from EMS arrival to initiation of rPA was 31 min (25 th to 75 th percentile, 24 min to 37 min). The time from EMS arrival to in-hospital fibrinolytic for 630 control patients was 63 min (25 th to 75 th percentile, 48 min to 89 min), resulting in a time saved of 32 min (p < 0. 0001). By 30 min after first medical contact, 49 % of study patients had received the first bolus of fibrinolytic compared with only 5 % of controls (p < 0. 0001). In-hospital mortality was 4. 7 %. Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 1. 0 %. ConclusionsPrehospital administration of rPA is a feasible approach to accelerating reperfusion in patients with STEMI. Valuable time savings can be achieved in the setting of contemporary transport and door-to-drug times and may translate into an improvement in clinical outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The purpose o f {{this study}} was to compare the pain {{management}} o f acute adult trauma patients during the first hour of resuscitation at a Level I Trauma Center versus non Level 1 Trauma Center Emergency Departments. A descriptive two group comparison design was used for this study. The sample consisted o f 74 patients at the Level I Center and 65 patients at the non Level I Centers. Data was obtained through a retrospective chart review. Type, route, dose of analgesic, time from admission to first dose, and number o f consecutive doses were determined and analyzed by chi-square and independent t-test. At the Level I Trauma Center only intravenous narcotics were administered in comparison to intravenous and intramuscular narcotics and noon-steroidal anti-inflammatories administered at the non Level 1 Centers. Time from <b>arrival</b> to the <b>administration</b> of the first dose was significantly shorter and quantity of medication was significantly greater at the Level 1 Trauma Center than at the non Level 1 emergency departments supporting the hypothesis that the Level I Trauma Center is more aggressive in the management of pain for acute adult trauma patients...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{characterize}} {{the extent of}} delay in administration of thrombolytic therapy to patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Canada, to examine patient-specific predictors of such delay and to measure the effect of delay on short-term nonfatal cardiac outcomes. DESIGN: Secondary cohort analysis of data from the first international Global Utilization of Streptokinase and tPA for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO-I) trial. SETTING: Sixty-three acute care hospitals across Canada. SUBJECTS: All 2898 Canadian patients with an AMI enrolled in GUSTO-I. MAIN OUTCOMES: Time before arrival at a hospital ("symptom-to-door" time) and time from <b>arrival</b> to <b>administration</b> of therapy ("door-to-needle" time) for patients who had an AMI outside of a hospital, in clinically relevant categories; proportions of patients with nonfatal, serious cardiac events, including shock, sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and asystole. RESULTS: Of {{the total number of}} patients enrolled, records were complete for 2708; 2542 of these patients (93. 9 %) had an AMI outside of a hospital. These 2542 patients presented a median 81 (interquartile range 50 to 130) minutes after the onset of symptoms, and the median time to treatment in hospital was 85 (interquartile range 61 to 115) minutes. Whereas a greater proportion of Canadian patients than of patients enrolled in GUSTO-I in other countries reached hospital within 2 hours of symptom onset (71. 5 % v. 61. 2 %, p < 0. 001), a greater proportion of Canadian patients experienced in-hospital treatment delays of more than 1 hour (75. 3 % v. 57. 1 %, p < 0. 001). In an analysis of all 2708 patients with complete records, both the unadjusted and adjusted odds of nonfatal cardiac events for those treated 4 to 6 hours after symptom onset were significantly higher than for those treated within 2 hours (odds ratio 1. 60, 95 % confidence interval 1. 09 to 2. 37). CONCLUSION: After arrival at a hospital, Canadian patients enrolled in GUSTO-I received thrombolytic therapy more slowly than trial enrollees in other countries. Such delays are already known to decrease the rate of short-term survival after AMI. The findings further show that long time to treatment also increases the odds of nonfatal, serious cardiac events. Hospitals and physicians caring for patients with AMI should routinely assess whether and how they can improve door-to-needle times...|$|R
40|$|Background: Stroke {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} {{disability}} and caregiver dependency in the United States. Alteplase is the only FDA approved drug to treat acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The benefits of alteplaseinclude improved functional outcome and reduction in dependency or disability, but these benefits are time dependent. National guidelines recommend a 60 minute door-to- needle (DTN) time for alteplase administrations for patients with AIS. Purpose: The purpose of this project is to establish a collaborative and seamless process that enables timely triage, diagnostic assessment, and treatment of a patient with AIS. The goal of this project was to achieve a DTN within 60 minutes of hospital arrival in at least 50 percent ofeligible patients to receive alteplase. Methods: A retrospective data review of stroke protocol applications to alteplase-eligible patients in the emergency department (ED) from 2014 to 2016 was performed. Data were gathered through the organization’s electronic medical record to evaluate time intervals from patient <b>arrival</b> to alteplase <b>administration.</b> A review of measurable and immeasurable initiatives designed to achieve DTN within 60 minutes was conducted. External data were obtainedfrom the GetWithThe Guidelines (GWTG) StrokeRegistry. Results Summary: From 2014 to 2016 DTN time within 60 minutes of hospital arrival for alteplase eligible patients averaged 45 percent. For 2016, the average was 40 percent. This project highlighted that while process measures are critical to achieving the desired DTN time goal, other incalculable issues such as ED physician’s comfort with alteplase therapy, patient education and other factors can have a major influence on performance. Conclusion: Despite numerous efforts, the organizationfailed to achieve a DTN time within 60 minutes of hospital arrival for alteplase eligible patients in 50 percent of cases. Achieving an acceptable DTN time requires a complex clinical process that involves a high-performing, cross-functional team. Achieving a DTN time within 60 minutes in stroke care requiresin-depth analysis of bothmeasurable process metrics and other non-measurable factors. Presentation: 29 : 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Dyspnea {{is among}} the most common reasons for {{emergency}} department (ED) visits by patients with cardiopulmonary disease who are commonly asked to recall the symptoms that prompted them to come to the ED. The reliability of recalled dyspnea has not been systematically investigated in ED patients. Methods Patients with chronic or acute cardiopulmonary conditions who came to the ED with dyspnea (N [*]=[*] 154) completed the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) several times during the visit and in a follow-up visit 4 to 6 [*]weeks later (n [*]=[*] 68). The MDP has 12 items with numerical ratings of intensity, unpleasantness, sensory qualities, and emotions associated with how breathing felt when participants decided to come to the ED (recall MDP) or at the time of administration (“now” MDP). The recall MDP was administered twice in the ED and once during the follow-up visit. Principal components analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was used to assess domain structure of the recall MDP. Internal consistency reliability was assessed with Cronbach’s alpha. Test–retest reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for absolute agreement for individual items and domains. Results PCA of the recall MDP was consistent with two domains (Immediate Perception, 7 items, Cronbach’s alpha[*]=[*]. 89 to. 94; Emotional Response, 5 items; Cronbach’s alpha[*]=[*]. 81 to. 85). Test–retest ICCs for the recall MDP during the ED visit ranged from. 70 to. 87 for individual items and were. 93 and. 94 for the Immediate Perception and Emotional Response domains. ICCs were much lower for the interval between the ED visit and follow-up, both for individual items (. 28 to. 66) and for the Immediate Perception and Emotional Response domains (. 72 and. 78, respectively). Conclusions During an ED visit, recall MDP ratings of dyspnea at the time participants decided to seek care in the ED are reliable and sufficiently stable, both for individual items and the two domains, that a time lag between <b>arrival</b> and questionnaire <b>administration</b> does not critically affect recall of perceptual and emotional characteristics immediately prior to the visit. However, test–retest reliability of recall over a 4 - to 6 -week interval is poor for individual items and significantly attenuated for the two domains. </p...|$|R
