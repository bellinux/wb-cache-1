25|$|The {{classification}} of text {{as belonging to}} the triple tradition (or for that matter, double tradition) is not always definitive, depending rather {{on the degree of}} similarity demanded. For example, Matthew and Mark report the cursing of the fig tree, clearly a single incident, despite some substantial differences of wording and content. Searching Luke, however, we find only the parable of the barren fig tree, in <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the narrative. Some would say that Luke has extensively adapted an element of the triple tradition, while others would regard it as a distinct pericope.|$|E

In this branch the seeker {{experiences}} divine attraction (jadhba), {{and is able to}} enter the order with a glimpse of its endpoint, of direct apprehension of the Divine Presence towards which all spiritual striving is directed. This does not replace the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply stems from <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> entry into the path.

Many results known for smooth surfaces and their geodesics, such as Birkhoff's method of constructing geodesics by his curve-shortening process or van Mangoldt and Hadamard's theorem that a simply connected surface of non-positive curvature is homeomorphic to the plane, are equally valid in this more general setting.|$|E

Floudas, of Hughes Hall, Cambridge, {{a leading}} {{commentator}} on the naming dispute from the Greek side, sums up this nationalistic reaction as follows: the Republic of Macedonia {{was accused of}} usurping the historical and cultural patrimony of Greece [...] "in order to furnish a nucleus of national self-esteem for the new state and provide its citizens with a new, distinct, non-Bulgarian, non-Serbian, non-Albanian identity". The Republic emerged thus to Greek eyes as {{a country with a}} personality crisis, [...] "a nondescript parasitic state" [...] that lived off the history of its neighbours, because it allegedly lacked an illustrious past of its own, for the sake of achieving cohesion for what Greeks regarded as an [...] "unhomogeneous little new nation".

Raiden's inclusion remained a secret to gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked his character.

500|$|Cooder's displeasure {{with the}} Republican Party and its {{financial}} supporters, particularly the Koch Brothers, also inspired his songwriting.

Everything is a distraction from the core truths which are, first of all, that corporations have taken over the country." [...] He viewed that his songs for the album provide a more convenient alternative for citizens who do not research politicians, saying that [...] "I don't write books and give speeches but with a four-minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view.

500|$|Despite {{the only}} {{surviving}} eyewitnesses to these events being from the Indian {{side and the}} passage of time since the battle, many of the details given by the Indian participants were still controversial and not believed (Custer's widow Libbie, who had dedicated her life to enshrining the memory of her husband as a hero and who attacked anyone offering <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, was still alive). [...] Special exception is taken to the claim that many of Custer's men committed suicide when defeat seemed inevitable. [...] The claim that Tom Custer's body was decapitated by the Indians is also disputed for reasons that are not made clear. [...] The identification of the headless body as Tom Custer is not from Wooden Leg, who {{at the time of the}} battle knew nothing of either Custer or his brother Tom, but is information provided by Marquis. Wooden Leg had merely described the markings he saw on the body. [...] Tom Custer's biography describes the decapitation as indisputable fact, as the body was identified from tattoos.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} he wrote Connotations, Copland {{had come to the}} view that serial {{composition}} was [...] "like looking at a picture from <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view" [...] and used it [...] "with the hope that it would freshen and enrich my [...] technique." [...] Part of that changed viewpoint, Copland said, [...] "was that I began to hear chords that I wouldn't have heard otherwise. Heretofore, I had been thinking tonally, but this was a new way of moving tones about." [...] Serialism also allowed Copland a synthesis of serial and non-serial practices that had long concerned Copland and he had previously felt impossible to attain. One challenge Copland said he faced while he composed Connotations was [...] "to construct an overall line that had continuity, dramatic force and an inherent unity." [...] He stated that he had faced a similar challenge in his Orchestral Variations (his orchestration of the Piano Variations). He added that while dodecaphonic techniques supplied [...] "the building blocks" [...] for Connotations, it was up to him to supply [...] "the edifice" [...] that these blocks would eventually form.|$|E
500|$|Critics gave mixed {{opinions}} to the team-up dynamic. Nich Maragos from 1UP.com celebrated that Sonic Team had [...] "finally [...] {{up with a}} way {{of introducing}} teamwork and variance between characters that doesn't overwhelm Sonic's bread-and-butter gameplay." [...] Maragos singled this out as the main divider between Advance 3 and Sonic Heroes, a game that he found surprisingly linear in level design considering that it, unlike Advance 3, was in 3D. Maragos, GameSpot's Frank Provo, IGN's Craig Harris, and Game Informers Lisa Mason appreciated the increase in replayability Sonic's friends brought. However, Mason, as well as reviewer Stardingo from GamePro, thought that they played too much like Sonic and did not add much to the experience. Darryl Vassar of GameSpy took <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> criticism: he acknowledged the presence of genuinely different character abilities, but perceived that their only purpose was to find Chao, whom he called [...] "pointless". Maragos noted that the [...] "mid-air trick" [...] system from Advance 2 was optional in Advance 3, but spoke positively about its usefulness in locating [...] "hidden areas". Harris argued that such varying team abilities contributed to occasional [...] "cheapness" [...] in the level design, because [...] "most of the characters have absolutely no defense when hopping off items like springboards".|$|E

The song was not originally meant for Cyrus to perform, but, once it reached Cyrus, the writing team reworked the lyrics, intending to write an accompanying theme for the clothing line. In order to please audiences, Dr. Luke, Kelly, and Cornish fixated on composing a fun, upbeat song that narrated reflections of Cyrus' personality. To write his contributions to the song, Kelly said he tried to mimic Cyrus' songwriting: [...] "It’s the same song from <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, {{you just have to}} find that unique perspective." [...] Cyrus was pleased with the song and selected it partially due to the need for tracks to appear on The Time of Our Lives. [...] "When I Look at You", written by Shanks and Hillary Lindsey, was initially to be included on Cyrus' succeeding album; it was eventually chosen to promote the 2010 film The Last Song after Cyrus recognized that it fit the film's concept well. According to Cyrus, when she sings [...] "When I Look at You", she thinks of family and love. [...] "It's kind of what this movie is all about", she said. The title track, [...] "The Time of Our Lives", was composed by Dr. Luke, Kelly, Kesha Sebert (known as Ke$ha), and Pebe Sebert. Kesha co-wrote her contributions to [...] "The Time of Our Lives" [...] with the ideal of constructing a party anthem for young audiences, based on her first impression of Cyrus' personality; comedic and likable.|$|E

She explained, [...] "And I remember thinking this song is amazing, but I don't know if it's me 110 percent, you know. You can kind of feel it." [...] The song reached Cyrus while she was creating an EP with Dr. Luke. The writing team then reworked the lyrics, intending to write an accompanying theme for Cyrus' joint clothing line with Max Azria, exclusively sold in Wal-Mart stores. In order to please audiences, Dr. Luke, Kelly and Jessie J fixated on composing a fun, upbeat song that narrated reflections of Cyrus' personality. [...] "They feel they're buying into a great experience but also buying into the artist," [...] Kelly said of the song's fans. To write his contributions to the song, Kelly said he desired to mimic Cyrus' songwriting: [...] "It's the same song from <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, you just have to find that unique perspective." [...] To record the song's instrumentation, they decided to mingle computerized sound with [...] "the warmth of live instrumentation", using live electric guitars and drums. Cyrus was pleased with the song and selected it partially due to a need of tracks for The Time of Our Lives. This is the first of two collaborations between Dr. Luke and Cyrus.
