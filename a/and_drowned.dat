5|$|Constantine {{deployed}} his own forces {{along the}} whole length of Maxentius' line. He ordered his cavalry to charge, and they broke Maxentius' cavalry. He then sent his infantry against Maxentius' infantry, pushing many into the Tiber {{where they were}} slaughtered <b>and</b> <b>drowned.</b> The battle was brief: Maxentius' troops were broken before the first charge. Maxentius' horse guards and praetorians initially held their position, but broke under {{the force of a}} Constantinian cavalry charge; they also broke ranks and fled to the river. Maxentius rode with them, and attempted to cross the bridge of boats, but he was pushed by the mass of his fleeing soldiers into the Tiber, <b>and</b> <b>drowned.</b>|$|E

The Mexican government allocated about $ (1995USD, $ 1995 MXN, $ USD) in funds for the restoration of houses and the overall infrastructure. Officials distributed 4,800 sheets, 500 cushions, and 1,500 blankets to hurricane victims. All sunken ships <b>and</b> <b>drowned</b> bodies were ultimately recovered by divers.|$|E

5|$|Al-Rahba {{came under}} Hamdanid rule {{a few years}} later, {{becoming}} part of the Euphrates district (tariq al-Furat) of the Mosul-based emirate. At the time, the town was described by the Persian geographer al-Istakhri, as being larger than the ancient Circesium {{on the opposite side of}} the Euphrates. The lord of al-Rahba, Jaman, rebelled against the Hamdanid emir of Mosul, Nasir al-Dawla (r. 929–967). Jaman fled the town <b>and</b> <b>drowned</b> in the Euphrates but not before al-Rahba was heavily damaged in the rebellion's suppression. Nasir al-Dawla granted his favored son, Abu'l Muzzafar Hamdan, control of al-Rahba, its district of Diyar Mudar, and the district's revenues.|$|E
5|$|Exeter {{had been}} {{stripped}} of his armour and left for dead on the battlefield at Barnet, but he was alive—though gravely injured.

5|$|After a brief {{military}} standoff, Constantine confronted {{and defeated}} Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge outside Rome on October 28, 312; Maxentius {{retreated to the}} Tiber river <b>and</b> <b>drowned.</b> Constantine entered the city the next day, but declined {{to take part in}} the traditional ascent up the Capitoline Hill to the Temple of Jupiter. Constantine's army had advanced on Rome under a Christian sign. It had become, officially at least, a Christian army. Constantine's apparent conversion was visible elsewhere, too. Bishops dined at Constantine's table, and many Christian building projects began soon after his victory. On November 9, 312, the old headquarters of the Imperial Horse Guard were razed to make way for the Lateran Basilica. Under Constantine's rule, Christianity became the prime focus of official patronage.|$|E
5|$|At the Horn Island {{lighthouse}}, {{the lighthouse}} keeper was killed {{along with his}} wife and daughter due to the hurricane. In addition to the death of the three at the lighthouse, it was noted that the schooner Daisy had been dismantled there, with one person killed. A person who was climbing a small tree was thrown away by the wind <b>and</b> <b>drowned.</b> Several people were trapped in their homes after a creek topped its banks. A warehouse and four other buildings were destroyed, while a bank's roof was blown off. A train near Brookhaven was washed away along the tracks of the Mississippi Central Railroad, resulting in the injury of five people. 25 schooners along the Mississippi coastline were completely destroyed. Two barks, the Nurnberg and Hercules were destroyed during the hurricane. Mandeline, owned by Norway, was filled with water, while Sigrav suffered severe damage, completely torn apart. A boat known as the Florine was washed ashore. A total of 78fatalities occurred.|$|E

5|$|Himmler {{notified}} Fegelein by telegram on 1 August {{that the}} numbers killed were far too low. A few days later, Himmler issued regimental order no. 42, which called for all male Jews {{over the age of}} 14 to be killed. The women and children were to be driven into the swamps <b>and</b> <b>drowned.</b> Thus Fegelein's units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities. As the water in the swamps was too shallow and some areas had no swamps, it proved impractical to drown the women and children, so they were shot. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.|$|E
5|$|In Florida, {{above normal}} tides in the panhandle caused erosion, damaged several boats, <b>and</b> <b>drowned</b> two people. Tropical storm force winds left about 20,000people without electricity, while {{flooding}} from heavy rainfall damaged vehicles and roads. Property {{damage in the}} state reached about $5.9million (1994USD). Farther inland, Beryl spawned many tornadoes and resulted in flooding as far north of New England. In South Carolina, the state suffering the most damage, a total of 23tornadoes were spawned, including three rated F3 on the Fujita scale. One tornado in Lexington damaged or destroyed 200homes and 40 to 50buildings and caused about 15,000people to lose power after damaging five electrical substations. The state of New York experienced {{the worst of the}} flooding, with flash flooding in the Susquehanna and western Catskills regions. Two deaths and $12million in damage occurred in New York. Overall, Beryl left five fatalities and at least $74.22million in damage.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{crocodilians}} are stalk-and-ambush predators, though hunting strategies {{vary depending}} on the individual species and the prey being hunted. Terrestrial prey is stalked from the water's edge and then grabbed <b>and</b> <b>drowned.</b> Gharials and other fish-eating species sweep their jaws sideways to snap up prey, and these animals can leap out of the water to catch birds, bats, and leaping fish. Small animals can be killed by whiplash as the predator shakes its head. Caimans use their tails and bodies to herd fish into shallow water. They may also dig for bottom-dwelling invertebrates, and the smooth-fronted caiman will even hunt on land. Some crocodilian species have been observed to use sticks and branches to lure nest-building birds. Nile crocodiles are known to hunt cooperatively, and several individuals may feed on the same carcass. Most species will eat anything suitable that comes within reach and are also opportunistic scavengers.|$|E
