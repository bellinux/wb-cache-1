25|$|She {{was dressed}} for {{traveling}} and for cold weather. Her hood {{was large and}} round and red but not smooth, — it was corrugated; that is to say, it consisted {{of a series of}} rolls nearly as large as my arm, passing over her head sidewise, growing smaller toward the back until they terminated in a big button that was embellished with <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> <b>of</b> green ribbon. Its general appearance was not unlike that of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally. The broad, white ruffle of her lace cap projected several inches beyond the front of the hood and waved back and forth like the single leaves of a great white poppy, as she nodded emphatically in her discourse.|$|E

500|$|Drosera anglica is a {{perennial}} herb which forms an upright, stemless rosette of generally [...] leaves. As is typical for sundews, the laminae are densely covered with stalked mucilaginous glands, each tipped {{with a clear}} droplet of a viscous fluid used for trapping insects. The lamina, which is [...] long, is held semi-erect by a long petiole, bringing the total leaf size to 30–95mm. Plants are green, coloring red in bright light. In all populations except those in Kaua'i, D. anglica forms winter resting buds called hibernacula. These consist of <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> <b>of</b> tightly curled leaves at ground level, which unfurl in spring {{at the end of}} the dormancy period. The root system is weak and penetrates only a few centimeters, serving mainly as an anchor and for water absorption. Nitrogen is in short supply in bogs and trapping and digesting insects provides an alternate source.|$|E

2500|$|While these customs were {{unique to}} Russian culture, {{they were not}} {{exclusive}} to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism {{in other parts of}} the world. The Chinese concept of chi, a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices. [...] The western concept of an [...] "evil eye" [...] or a [...] "hex" [...] was translated to Russia as a [...] "spoiler". A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> <b>of</b> the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler. [...] The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.|$|E
