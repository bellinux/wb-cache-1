5|$|Two-page book embeddings with a fixed {{partition}} of the edges into pages {{can be interpreted}} as a form of clustered planarity, in which the given graph must be drawn in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> parts of the graph (the two subsets of edges) are placed in the drawing in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> reflects their clustering. Two-page book embedding has also been used to find simultaneous embeddings of graphs, in which two graphs are given on the same vertex set and one must find a placement for the vertices in which both graphs are drawn planarly with straight edges.|$|E

5|$|A matroid is a {{mathematical}} structure in which certain sets of elements are defined to be independent, in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> the independent sets satisfy properties {{modeled after the}} properties of linear independence in a vector space. One of the standard examples of a matroid is the graphic matroid in which the independent sets are the sets of edges in forests of a graph; the matroid structure of forests is important in algorithms for computing the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Analogously, we may define matroids from pseudoforests.|$|E
5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> mimics greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts are arranged in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> makes them complicated to analyze.

5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for that tradition, he always maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work {{is a model of}} all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E
5|$|Any {{athlete who}} jostles or obstructs another athlete, in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> impedes his progress, should be disqualified from that event.

5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} to the group.

Lalich sees this as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E

5|$|As a {{classical}} singer, Turunen sings with classical vocal technique. She explained {{that in the}} early days of Nightwish, it was difficult to combine classical technique with the metal sound in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> gave her liberty of action without damaging her vocal cords. Classical techniques helped her to play with her voice, so she decided not to pursue extra training in rock/pop singing.|$|E

5|$|Both non-selective {{glucocorticoids}} {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists work by binding to and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).
