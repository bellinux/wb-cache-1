5|$|In 1964 Hindley, her grandmother, and Brady were rehoused {{as part of}} {{the post-war}} slum {{clearances}} in Manchester, to 16Wardle Brook Avenue in the new overspill estate of Hattersley. Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12Wardle Brook Avenue. Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to Saddleworth Moor to collect peat, something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder's rubble. She remained unharmed; living only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.|$|E
5|$|Isa ibn Musa, the Caliph's nephew, {{was sent}} against Medina with 4,000 men, but Muhammad refused {{to abandon the}} holy city and insisted on meeting the Abbasid attack there. In the meantime, he imitated the actions of Muhammad, like {{restoring}} the famous ditch around the city. Muhammad's supporters nevertheless began deserting him. When Isa appeared before the city, he waited {{a few days before}} the ditch and repeatedly offered amnesty. Then his troops laid <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> over the ditch and entered Medina, where Muhammad and his remaining 300 supporters fell fighting on 6 December 762. Muhammad's corpse was beheaded and his head dispatched to the Caliph.|$|E

25|$|The Hotel Chelsea, New York City's first co-op {{apartment}} complex, {{was built}} at 222 West 23rd Street in 1883. The Emunah Israel synagogue, {{built in the}} 1860s as a Presbyterian church, is located <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> to the west at 236 West 23rd.|$|E
25|$|Jeff Townes and Will Smith were {{introduced}} to each other by chance in 1985. One night, Townes was performing at a house party only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> down from Smith's residence, and he was missing his hype man. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally {{made it to the}} party.|$|E
25|$|Further to the southwest, Narrow Street, Limehouse's {{historic}} spine, {{which runs}} {{along the back of}} the Thames wharves, boasts one of the few surviving early Georgian terraces in London. Next to the terrace is the historic Grapes pub, rebuilt in 1720 and well-known to Charles Dickens, featuring as the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters in Our Mutual Friend. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> along was Booty's Riverside Bar but this closed down in 2012. Almost every building {{on the other side of}} Narrow Street was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War, including hundreds of houses, Taylor Walker & Co's Barley Mow Brewery and a school. One notable exception is a former public house, known locally as 'The House They Left Behind', because it was the only Victorian terrace to survive. It still stands today, with the aid of three large supporting pillars.|$|E

5000|$|In Angola in {{the early}} 21st century, some prisoners argue that the prison {{administration}} uses the magazine for propaganda. Scholar Kalen Mary Ann Churcher of Pennsylvania State University described it in 2008 as [...] "a pseudo-pacifier for {{a select group of}} men who 'sold out' to the state and now get to walk through <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more <b>doors</b> unsupervised." ...|$|R
500|$|After Elizabeth Craigie's death, {{the entire}} {{property}} was leased by Joseph Emerson Worcester from her heirs; he in turn rented {{the eastern half}} of the house to Longfellow. In 1843, the house was purchased by Nathan Appleton, who gave the house to Longfellow as a gift when Longfellow married Nathan's daughter Frances. He paid $10,000 for the home. Frances wrote to her brother Thomas Gold Appleton on August 30, 1843: [...] "We have decided to let Father purchase this grand old mansion", especially after Longfellow's friend George Washington Greene reminded them [...] "how noble an inheritance this is — where Washington dwelt in every room". Longfellow was proud of the connection to Washington and in 1844 purchased a bust of the home's former occupant, a copy of the sculpture by Jean-Antoine Houdon. [...] Worcester and his wife became tenants under Longfellow in the western half of the house until their new home <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> down was completed that spring. Mrs. Longfellow wrote on May 5, 1844, [...] "Worcester family left us in complete possession , with rooms nicely cleaned, and uncarpeted stairs and entries".|$|E

[...] He had obtained work in the leather district and having acquired a little experience and a modest capital he launched the firm of H.B. Endicott & Co. [...] The company, which dealt in sheepskins, was headquartered at 27 High Street in Boston, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> down from {{the offices of the}} later Endicott Johnson Corporation 10 High Street. He became treasurer of the Commonwealth Shoe & Leather Company, and it was through his connection with this firm that he entered the shoe manufacturing business.|$|E

50|$|Padthaway is {{also the}} name of a wine region {{surrounding}} the town. It is home to several large commercial vineyards. The oldest vineyard was established in 1964 by Seppelts, with Lindeman's, Hardys and Wynns also establishing vineyards in the 1960s. The wine region is 62 km long and 8 km wide with over 4000 ha of vineyards. There are only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cellar <b>doors</b> operating in the region.|$|R
2500|$|Henderson Street {{once had}} its own cinema, [...] at no.91 behind the {{building}} where The Raj Indian restaurant (i) is [...] today. It was listed in the Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directories as the 'Empire Picture House' and was definitely active in the late 1920s and early 1930s, though by the 1950s, it had been closed down and boarded up. In more recent times The Raj restaurant also used part of their premises to show films, though they no longer do so. Just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> away, however, Sofi's Swedish Bar (vi) now hosts regular film nights in their back room, keeping cinema nights on Henderson Street an option in the present day.|$|E
2500|$|Constance Harker and Marjorie Jarrett {{purchased}} {{the school in}} 1909, and so began their partnership as co-Principals. The two women had met while teaching at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney, where Harker was senior English and classics mistress. Following their purchase of the school, they searched for a site in Brisbane that could house the day and boarding schools under one roof, and in 1912, settled on [...] "Erneton" [...] on Wickham Terrace, which was located {{next door to the}} boarders previous residence, [...] "Garth House". A paddock at the rear of Garth House was rented for a netball court. As time went on, space became limited at the new site, and so Athol Place, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> away on the Terrace was rented for extra Boarders and two primary classes.|$|E
2500|$|Keyboard player Peter Bardens lived only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>doors</b> {{away from}} Fleetwood's first home in London, and upon {{hearing of the}} {{proximity}} of an available drummer, Bardens gave Fleetwood his first gig in Bardens' band 'The Cheynes' in July 1963, thus seeding the young drummer's musical career. It would take him from The Cheynes – with whom he supported early gigs by the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds – to stints in The Bo Street Runners, where he replaced original drummer Nigel Hutchinson, who had enjoyed brief television fame on Ready Steady Go!. However by April 1965, when Fleetwood joined the band, it was fading into obscurity. By February 1966 Bardens, who had left the group, called on Fleetwood to join his new band, the 'Peter Bs', which soon expanded to become 'Shotgun Express' (with Rod Stewart). Peter Green, who was a guitarist in the Peter Bs, [...] left to [...] join John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, followed [...] by [...] Fleetwood in April 1967. His [...] new [...] band already featured John McVie.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1979, a crowd crush at a Who gig at the Riverfront Coliseum, Cincinnati killed 11 fans. This {{was partly}} due to the festival seating, where the first to enter get the best positions. Some fans waiting outside mistook the band's soundcheck for the concert, and {{attempted}} to force their way inside. <b>As</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> entrance <b>doors</b> were opened, a bottleneck situation ensued with thousands trying to gain entry, and the crush became deadly.|$|R
60|$|In <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes, the <b>door</b> opened, and {{an elderly}} gentleman, with grayish hair, and a mild and {{pleasant}} expression of countenance, came in.

50|$|The Paul Gauguin Cultural Center at Atuona has a {{reconstruction}} of the Maison du Jouir. The original house stood empty for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years, the <b>door</b> still carrying Gauguin's carved lintel.
