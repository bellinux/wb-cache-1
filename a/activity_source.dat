30|$|The total {{bone marrow}} absorbed dose is {{composed}} of different contributions originating from various <b>activity</b> <b>source</b> regions: (1) the bone marrow self-absorbed dose including the active bone marrow cells, the extracellular fluid, and the blood cells; (2) activity accumulations in the remaining skeleton composed of compact bone or fatty tissue (yellow or inactive marrow); (3) the cross-absorbed dose by major organs or tumours; and (4) the cross-irradiation coming from {{the remainder of the}} body (ROB; whole body minus specific or unspecific accumulations in the other source regions) [11]. Each absorbed dose component requires a dedicated measurement procedure to derive its respective time-activity curve (TAC) and the source-specific time-integrated activity. The cumulated actvity-to-absorbed-dose conversion is usually performed via pre-calculated and standardised organ-level S values [11].|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Historically HDR {{brachytherapy}} treatment {{planning systems}} ignore the transit dose in the computation of patient dose. However, the total radiation dose delivered during each treatment cycle {{is equal to}} the sum of the static dose and the transit dose and every HDR application therefore results in two radiation doses. Consequently, the absorbed dose to the target volume is more than the prescribed dose as computed during treatment planning. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the magnitude of the transit dose component of two 192 Ir HDR brachytherapy units and assess its dosimetric significance. Materials and Methods: Ionization chamber dosimetry systems (well-type and Farmertype ionization chambers) were used to measure the charge generated during the transit of the 192 Ir source from a GammaMed and a Nucletron MicroSelectron HDR afterloader using single catheters of lengths 120 cm. Different source configurations were used for the measurements of integrated charge. Two analysis techniques were used for transit time determination: the multiple exposure technique and the graphical solution of zero exposure. The transit time was measured for the total transit of the radioactive source into (entry) and out of (exit) the catheters. Results: A maximum source transit time of 1. 7 s was measured. The transit dose depends on the source <b>activity,</b> <b>source</b> configuration, number of treatment fractions, prescription dose and the type of remote afterloader used. It does not depend on the measurement technique, measurement distance or the analysis technique used for transit time determination. Conclusion: A finite transit time increases the radiation dose beyond that due to the programmed source dwell time alone. The significance of the transit dose would increase with a decrease in source dwell time or a higher <b>activity</b> <b>source...</b>|$|E

40|$|Characterizations {{of unknown}} {{groundwater}} pollution sources {{in terms of}} source location, source flux release history and <b>sources</b> <b>activity</b> initiation times, from sparse observation concentration measurements are a challenging task. Optimization-based methods are often applied to solve groundwater pollution source characterization problem. These methods are effective only when the starting times of <b>activity</b> of the <b>sources</b> are precisely known, or the possible time window within which the <b>sources</b> <b>activity</b> actually start is known with a fair degree of certainty. However, in real life scenarios, the starting time of the <b>activity</b> of the <b>sources</b> is either unknown or can lie anywhere within a time window of years or decades. Absence of any prior information about the span of time window, within which the sources become active, makes existing source identification methodologies inefficient. As an alternative, an optimization-based source identification model is proposed, to simultaneously estimate source flux release history and <b>sources</b> <b>activity</b> initiation times. The method considers source flux release history and <b>sources</b> <b>activity</b> initiation times as explicit decision variables, optimally estimated by the decision model. Performance of the developed methodology is evaluated for an illustrative study area having multiple sources with different <b>source</b> <b>activity</b> initiation times, missing observation data and transient flow conditions.

40|$|AbstractEstimating the {{precision}} or uncertainty associated with sensory signals {{is an important}} part of perception. Based on a previous computational model, we tested the hypothesis that increasing visual contrast increased {{the precision}} encoded in early visual areas by the gain or excitability of superficial pyramidal cells. This hypothesis was investigated using electroencephalography and dynamic causal modelling (DCM); a biologically constrained modelling of the cortical processes underlying EEG <b>activity.</b> <b>Source</b> localisation identified the electromagnetic sources of visually evoked responses and DCM was used to characterise the coupling among these sources. Bayesian model selection was used to select the most likely connectivity pattern and contrast-dependent changes in connectivity. As predicted, the model with the highest evidence entailed increased superficial pyramidal cell gain in higher-contrast trials. As predicted theoretically, contrast-dependent increases were reduced at higher levels of the hierarchy. These results demonstrate that increased signal-to-noise ratio in sensory signals produce (or are represented by) increased superficial pyramidal cell gain, and that synaptic parameters encoding statistical properties like sensory precision can be quantified using EEG and dynamic causal modelling...|$|E
40|$|Approach, {{avoidance}} and the {{supervisory control}} system are fundamental to human behavior. Much past research has examined the neurophysiological models relating trait approach and avoidance. Using measures of electroencephalographic (EEG) frontal asymmetry, trait approach {{has been associated with}} greater left-frontal activity and trait avoidance has been associated with greater right-frontal activity. However, traits related to the {{supervisory control system}} have not been previously associated with frontal asymmetry. The current study sought to test whether trait positive urgency, measuring the tendency towards rash action in response to extreme positive emotional states, would relate to frontal alpha asymmetry. One hundred twenty-six individuals completed a measure of positive urgency and resting EEG recordings. Greater positive urgency was associated with greater relative left-frontal EEG <b>activity.</b> <b>Source</b> localization revealed that this relationship appeared to originate from reduced right-frontal activity in the inferior frontal gyrus. These results clarify that the link between frontal asymmetry and positive urgency is related to reduced right-frontal activity. Reduced right-frontal activity may be a potential neurobiological trait related to the supervisory control system...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} ocular drug {{delivery}} systems {{has been one}} of the most covered topics in drug delivery research. One potential drug carrier solution is the use of materials that are already commercially available in ophthalmic lenses for the correction of refractive errors. In this study, we present a diffusion-based mathematical model in which the parameters can be adjusted based on experimental results obtained under controlled conditions. The model allows for the design of multi-layered therapeutic ophthalmic lenses for controlled drug delivery. We show that the proper combination of materials with adequate drug diffusion coefficients, thicknesses and interfacial transport characteristics allows for the control of the delivery of drugs from multi-layered ophthalmic lenses, such that drug bursts can be minimized, and the release time can be maximized. As far as we know, this combination of a mathematical modelling approach with experimental validation of non-constant <b>activity</b> <b>source</b> lamellar structures, made of layers of different materials, accounting for the interface resistance to the drug diffusion, is a novel approach to the design of drug loaded multi-layered contact lenses. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

The theory of international production underlines the importance of strategic and regional level variables. However, existing empirical approaches omit by and large regional level factors. We employ survey evidence from the "FDI micro database" of the IWH, that was only recently made available, to conduct our analyses. We find that foreign subsidiaries are above average technologically active in comparison to the whole East German manufacturing. This can be partially explained by the industrial structure of foreign direct investment. However, only a limited share of foreign subsidiaries with R&D and/or innovation <b>activity</b> <b>source</b> technological knowledge from the East German innovation system. If a subsidiary follows a competence augmenting strategy or does local trade, it is more likely to source technological knowledge locally. The endowment of a region with human capital and a scientific infrastructure has a positive effect too. The findings suggest that foreign subsidiaries in East Germany are only partially linked with the regional innovation system. Policy implications are discussed...|$|E

30|$|High-resolution imaging is {{achieved}} by the unique design of the detector ring of the InSPira HD (Fig. 1). The detector ring consists of two clamshells, each containing 12 fanbeam collimators. At start position, the two clams touch and the collimators are focused {{at the center of}} the ring, achieving a focal point of 3  mm in diameter. During acquisition, the gantry rotates and simultaneously the two clams are moved outward leading the two focal points of the clam’s collimators to follow spiral trajectories over the field of view (FOV). The spatial resolution in the resulting image slice is therefore determined by the speed at which the clams move outward. After acquiring the first slice, the camera moves in axial direction to the position for acquiring the adjacent slice, and so on. A proprietary iterative reconstruction algorithm tailored to this unique method of spatial sampling is used to reconstruct the data into 3 D images. This iterative reconstruction algorithm is based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. It includes a point spread function (PSF), which is defined as the detector response to an impulse <b>activity</b> <b>source</b> point placed in the scanner FOV. Attenuation correction is performed using either a CT previously obtained from the patient/phantom or a deformable CT template. Scatter correction was not available on the system and therefore not performed.|$|E
40|$|Surface {{deformation}} in volcanic areas usually indicates {{movement of}} magma or hydrothermal fluids at depth. Stratovolcanoes tend to exhibit a complex relationship between deformation and eruptive behaviour. The characteristically long time spans between such eruptions requires {{a long time}} series of observations to determine whether deformation without an eruption is common at a given edifice. Such studies, however, are logistically difficult to carry out in most volcanic arcs, as these tend to be remote regions {{with large numbers of}} volcanoes (hundreds to even thousands). Here we present a satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) survey of the remote central Andes volcanic arc, a region formed by subduction of the Nazca oceanic plate beneath continental South America. Spanning the years 1992 to 2000, our survey reveals the background level of activity of about 900 volcanoes, 50 of which have been classified as potentially active. We find four centres of broad (tens of kilometres wide), roughly axisymmetric surface deformation. None of these centres are at volcanoes currently classified as potentially active, although two lie within about 10 km of volcanoes with known <b>activity.</b> <b>Source</b> depths inferred from the patterns of deformation lie between 5 and 17 km.

40|$|Monolithic {{scintillation}} detectors for positron {{emission tomography}} and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging have many advantages over pixelated detectors. The use of monolithic crystals allows for reducing the scintillator cost per unit volume and increasing the sensitivity along with the energy and timing resolution of the detector. In addition, on thick detectors the depth-of-interaction can be determined without additional hardware. However, costly and complex calibration procedures have been proposed to achieve optimal detector performance for monolithic detectors. This hampers their use in commercial systems. There is thus, a need for simple calibration routines that can be performed on assembled systems. The main goal of this work {{is to develop a}} simplified calibration procedure based on acquired training data. In comparison with other methods that use training data acquired with beam sources attached to robotic stages, the proposed method uses a static un-collimated <b>activity</b> <b>source</b> with simple geometry acquiring in a reasonable time. Once the data are acquired, the calibration of the detector is accomplished in three steps: energy calibration based on the k-means clustering method, self-organization based on the self-organizing maps algorithm, and distortion correction based on the Monge-Kantorovich grid adaptation. The proposed calibration method was validated for 2 D positioning using a SPECT detector. Similar results were obtained by comparison with an existing calibration method (maximum likelihood estimation). In conclusion, we proposed a novel calibration method for monolithic scintillation detectors that greatly simplifies their use with optimal performance in SPECT systems...|$|E
