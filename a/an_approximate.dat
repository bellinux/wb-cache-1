Approximately US$100,000 worth of fish were caught in the lake from 1900 to 1915. Nevertheless, the lake bed remained dry for extended periods and vegetation covered certain areas. Local residents soon began to use the bed to grow cotton.|$|E
40|$|Models {{provide the}} {{foundation}} to statistics and are generally viewed as approximations {{to the underlying}} true state of nature. Data are used to estimate parameters in these approximating models. Assuming there exists a true underlying model, the parameters in the models used for data analysis are actually functions of the parameters of an underlying true model. Therefore, in order to fully understand what a proposed model actually represents, {{it is useful to}} examine how the parameters in <b>an</b> <b>approximating</b> model relate to the parameters in the true model. That is, given a statistic, this paper seeks to determine what the statistic is actually estimating in terms of an underlying true model. Examples and illustrations of the meaning of parameters in <b>an</b> <b>approximating</b> model to <b>a</b> true underlying model are provided. This is accomplished by fitting <b>an</b> <b>approximating</b> model to <b>an</b> assumed true model, similar to the way <b>an</b> <b>approximating</b> model is fit to a data set.
