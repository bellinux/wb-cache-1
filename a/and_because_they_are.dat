5|$|Sites {{at which}} manta rays congregate attract tourists, and manta viewing generates {{substantial}} annual revenue for local communities. Tourist sites {{exist in the}} Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Spain, the Fiji Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, Hawaii, Western Australia and the Maldives. Mantas are popular because of their enormous size <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> easily habituated to humans. Scuba divers may {{get a chance to}} watch mantas visiting cleaning stations and night dives enable viewers to see mantas feeding on plankton attracted by the lights.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are used}} widely as model organisms in animal testing. Albino mutant rats were first used for {{research}} in 1828 and later became the first animal domesticated for purely scientific purposes. Nowadays, the house mouse is {{the most commonly used}} laboratory rodent, and in 1979 it was estimated that fifty million were used annually worldwide. They are favored because of their small size, fertility, short gestation period and ease of handling <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> susceptible to many of the conditions and infections that afflict humans. They are used in research into genetics, developmental biology, cell biology, oncology and immunology. Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the late 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the United States {{for research in}} the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. In 2007, they constituted about 2% of all laboratory animals. Guinea pigs {{played a major role in}} the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch. They have been launched into orbital space flight several times—first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961, with a successful recovery. The naked mole rat is the only known mammal that is poikilothermic; it is used in studies on thermoregulation. It is also unusual in not producing the neurotransmitter substance P, a fact which researchers find useful in studies on pain.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} understand, it is immensely {{important}} {{for the person who}} understands to be located outside the object of his or her creative understanding—in time, in space, in culture. For one cannot even really see one's own exterior and comprehend it as a whole, and no mirrors or photographs can help; our real exterior can be seen and understood only by other people, because they are located outside us in space, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> others.|$|E
25|$|One-quarter of the Soviet Union {{consisted}} of mountains or mountainous terrain. With the significant exceptions of the Ural Mountains {{and the mountains}} of eastern Siberia, the mountains occupy the southern periphery of the Soviet Union. The Urals, because they have traditionally been considered the natural boundary between Europe and Asia <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> valuable sources of minerals, were {{the most famous of}} the country's nine major ranges. In terms of elevation (comparable to the Appalachians) and vegetation, however, they are far from impressive, and they do not serve as a formidable natural barrier.|$|E

25|$|All of the {{atypical}} antipsychotics warn {{about the}} possibility of tardive dyskinesia in their package inserts and in the PDR. It is not possible to truly know the risks of tardive dyskinesia when taking atypicals, because tardive dyskinesia can take many decades to develop and the atypical antipsychotics are not old enough to have been tested over a long enough period of time to determine all of the long-term risks. One hypothesis as to why atypicals have a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia is because they are much less fat-soluble than the typical antipsychotics <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> readily released from D2 receptor and brain tissue. The typical antipsychotics remain attached to the D2 receptors and accumulate in the brain tissue which may lead to TD.|$|E
25|$|Pharaoh hounds, being {{somewhat}} uncommon {{outside of}} the Maltese Islands of Malta and Gozo, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not profitable for commercial breeding, have not been subjected to as much irresponsible breeding as some more popular breeds. Breeders try hard to prevent hereditary diseases from entering the gene pool {{and according to the}} American breed club, Pharaohs are virtually free from genetic diseases. Reputable breeders continue to test their breeding stock for genetic conditions such as hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and myriad eye conditions just to ensure that these disorders do not become a problem. Reputable breeders should be able to show documentation of health screening performed on their breeding dogs. Note that Pharaohs, like most sighthounds, are sensitive to barbiturate anaesthetics. Their ears are thin and prone to frostbite when in cold climates.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} smaller size and {{relatively}} faster growth rates, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more evenly distributed throughout {{more of the}} world's oceans, copepods almost certainly contribute far more to the secondary productivity of the world's oceans, and to the global ocean carbon sink than krill, and perhaps more than all other groups of organisms together. The surface layers of the oceans are currently {{believed to be the}} world's largest carbon sink, absorbing about 2 billion tons of carbon a year, the equivalent to perhaps a third of human carbon emissions, thus reducing their impact. Many planktonic copepods feed near the surface at night, then sink (by changing oils into more dense fats) into deeper water during the day to avoid visual predators. Their moulted exoskeletons, faecal pellets, and respiration at depth all bring carbon to the deep sea.|$|E

25|$|Harvests of P. clarkii {{account for}} a large {{majority}} of the crayfish produced in the United States and elsewhere. Crayfish farming began in Louisiana in the 18th century, taking place in rice fields in a concurrent or alternate culture system. The concurrent culture of rice and crayfish makes good use of land, resources, equipment, and infrastructure already being used for rice production. However, crawfish production has decreased in recent years due to an increase of imports from China, which is now the world's leading producer of crawfish and is also using a rice-based system. A number of species of crustaceans were introduced to China to create markets for aquaculture <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> better adapted to growing in a rice field than native fish species. Rice-fish farming originated in China and is once again growing as the yields from Green Revolution practices used to grow rice are no longer increasing, and resources such as land and water are becoming more limited.|$|E
25|$|Planktonic copepods are {{important}} to the carbon cycle. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on earth. They compete for this title with Antarctic krill. Because of their smaller size and relatively faster growth rates, however, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more evenly distributed throughout more of the world's oceans, copepods almost certainly contribute far more to the secondary productivity of the world's oceans, and to the global ocean carbon sink than krill, and perhaps more than all other groups of organisms together.

25|$|Pure {{plastics}} {{have low}} toxicity {{due to their}} insolubility in water <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> biochemically inert, due to a large molecular weight. Plastic products contain a variety of additives, some {{of which can be}} toxic. For example, plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging, toys, and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other phthalates in some applications, and the United States has limited the use of DEHP, DPB, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP in children's toys and child care articles with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens. Other chemicals of potential concern include alkylphenols.|$|E

25|$|Sand {{filters are}} a {{variation}} of the infiltration trench principle and operate in a way similar to bioretention systems. Stormwater is passed through them for treatment prior to discharge to the downstream stormwater system. Sand filters are very useful in treating runoff from confined hard surfaces such as car parks and from heavily urbanised and built-up areas. They usually do not support vegetation owing to the filtration media (sand) not retaining sufficient moisture <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> usually installed underground. The filter usually consists of a sedimentation chamber as pre-treatment device to remove litter, debris, gross pollutants and medium-sized sediments; a weir; followed by a sand layer that filters sediments, finer particulates and dissolved pollutants. The filtered water is collected by perforated underdrain pipes in a similar manner as in bioretention systems. Systems may also have an overflow chamber. The sedimentation chamber can have permanent water or can be designed to be drained with weep holes between storm events. Permanent water storage however, can risk anaerobic conditions that can lead to the release of pollutants (e.g. phosphorus). The design process should consider the provision of detention storage to yield a high hydrologic effectiveness, and discharge control by proper sizing of the perforated underdrain and overflow path. Regular maintenance is required to prevent crust forming.|$|E

500|$|Advances in gene {{targeting}} technologies which hijack the homologous recombination mechanics of cells are now {{leading to the}} development of a new wave of more accurate, [...] isogenic human disease models. These engineered human cell models are thought to more accurately reflect the genetics of human diseases than their mouse model predecessors. This is largely because mutations of interest are introduced into endogenous genes, just as they occur in the real patients, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> based on human genomes rather than rat genomes. Furthermore, certain technologies enable the knock-in of a particular mutation rather than just knock-outs associated with older {{gene targeting}} technologies.|$|E

500|$|One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing critiques in the Rights of Woman is {{of false}} and {{excessive}} sensibility, particularly in women. She argues {{that women who}} succumb to sensibility are [...] "blown about by every momentary gust of feeling" [...] <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> [...] "the prey of their senses" [...] they cannot think rationally. In fact, she claims, they do harm not only to themselves but to the entire civilization: these are not women who can help refine a civilization—a popular eighteenth-century idea—but women who will destroy it. Wollstonecraft does not argue that reason and feeling should act independently of each other; rather, she believes that they should inform each other.|$|E
500|$|Saturn is {{the most}} distant of the five planets easily {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth, the other four being Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. (Uranus and {{occasionally}} 4 Vesta are {{visible to the naked eye}} in dark skies.) Saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright, yellowish point of light with an apparent magnitude of usually between +1 and 0. It takes approximately 29.5 years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac. Most people will require an optical aid (very large binoculars or a small telescope) that magnifies at least 30 times to achieve an image of Saturn's rings, in which clear resolution is present. [...] Twice every Saturnian year (roughly every 15 Earth years), the rings briefly disappear from view, due to the way in which they are angled <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> so thin. Such a [...] "disappearance" [...] will next occur in 2025, but Saturn will be too close to the Sun for any ring-crossing observation to be possible.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Christopher Lennertz officially {{signed on}} to compose for the series, having {{previously}} composed the Agent Carter One-Shot. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. In his research of {{the music of the}} time period, Lennertz learned that jazz was shifting from big band to smaller ensembles, and bebop was being introduced. This allowed him to incorporate trumpets in his scores, to harken to the time period <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> [...] "also very sneaky, and it lends itself to espionage". Lennertz used the alto flute to capture [...] "Carter's aura", saying, [...] "It feels like a strong woman's voice, especially as she's sneaking around....it also has that spy quality." [...] Additionally, Lennertz was able to reorchestrate [...] "" [...] for the season, which is originally by Alan Menken for Captain America: The First Avenger, and introduced a folk choral piece performed by a Russian men's choir during [...] "The Iron Ceiling".
