40|$|Driving on-the-road {{has more}} {{frequent}} and prompt acceleration/decelerations than in the type-approval light-duty test conditions (NEDC), with Real Driving Emissions (RDE) of CO 2 and NOX known to be considerably higher. Despite permissible limits of NOX emissions at type approval reducing significantly, in-service emissions from diesel vehicles have, in reality, not reduced at all through the Euro 1 – 5 / I–V emission standards. TfL commissioned a programme of laboratory testing {{to better understand the}} in-service emission performance of Euro 6 /VI vehicles over the TfL London Drive Cycle (LDC). This cycle was constructed from instrumented car data making repeated circuits of a set route at different times of day. Twelve Euro 6 passenger cars were tested over the entire 140 kms of the LDC from a warm-start. Three HGVs were tested over the suburban sub-cycle (40 kms) in laden and un-laden condition. NOX emissions from the petrol cars were at a low level and below, or at, their type <b>approval</b> <b>limit</b> of 0. 06 g. km- 1. Only one SCR equipped diesel car achieved NOX emissions close to their 0. 08 g. km- 1 type <b>approval</b> <b>limit.</b> NOX emissions from diesel cars with only LNT NOX controls were between 3 and 13 times higher than their type <b>approval</b> <b>limit</b> (conformity factors).

40|$|Real world {{emissions}} of {{oxides of nitrogen}} (NOx) often greatly exceed those achieved in the laboratory based type approval process. In this paper the real world emissions from a substantial sample of the latest Euro 6 diesel passenger cars are presented {{with a focus on}} NOx and primary NO 2. Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) data is analysed from 39 Euro 6 diesel passenger cars over a test route comprised of urban and motorway sections. The sample includes vehicles installed with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), lean NOx traps (LNT), or selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The results show wide variability in NOx emissions from 1 – 22 times the type <b>approval</b> <b>limit.</b> The average NOx emission, 0. 36 (sd. 0. 36) g km- 1, is 4. 5 times the Euro 6 limit. The average fraction primary NO 2 (fNO 2) is 44 (sd. 20) %. Higher emissions during the urban section of the route are attributed to an increased number of acceleration events. Comparisons between PEMS measurements and COPERT speed dependent emissions factors show PEMS measurements to be on average 1. 6 times higher than COPERT estimates for NOx and 2. 5 times for NO 2. However, by removing the 5 most polluting vehicles average emissions were reduced considerably...|$|E
40|$|Diesel {{cars have}} been {{emitting}} four to seven times more NOx in on-road driving than in type approval tests. These ‘excess emissions’ are {{a consequence of}} deliberate design of the vehicle’s after-treatment system, as investigations during the ‘Dieselgate’ scandal have revealed. Here we calculate health and environmental impacts of these excess NOx emissions in all European countries for the year 2013. We use national emissions reported officially under the UNECE Convention for Long-range Transport of Atmospheric Pollutants and employ the EMEP MSC-W Chemistry Transport Model and the GAINS Integrated Assessment Model to determine atmospheric concentrations and resulting impacts. We compare with impacts from hypothetical emissions where light duty diesel vehicles are assumed to emit {{only as much as}} their respective type <b>approval</b> <b>limit</b> value or as little as petrol cars of the same age. Excess NO 2 concentrations can also have direct health impacts, but these overlap with the impacts from particulate matter (PM) and are not included here.

40|$|The {{time taken}} to approve {{residential}} development by local councils {{has long been}} identified as a central factor in debates centred on housing affordability. Many argue that delays in <b>approval</b> <b>limit</b> housing supply and thereby place upward pressure on prices. This paper explores two significant changes to the policy framework directing development assessment in NSW over the past 5 years: the implementation of Part 3 A within the NSW Environmental Planning and Assessment Act, 1979; and, a series of reforms implemented under the Improving the NSW Planning System agenda. According to the Minister for Planning these reforms will significantly decrease the average time taken for assessment. Unsurprisingly, local government claims that these reforms will: reduce the amount of funds made available for services/infrastructure; reduce local autonomy; and, change the local character of neighbourhoods. However, from a planning/development assessment perspective, these opinions are far from universal. In the context of this changing policy environment, this paper explores the experiences and opinions of councils from across NSW. The paper presents the results of interviews conducted with senior officials responsible for development assessment. Each of these policy changes is discussed {{in the context of the}} diverse populations and development pressures facing councils across NSW. 25 page(s...|$|E

40|$|As one {{input to}} the {{revision}} of the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution, this report presents an in-depth analysis {{of the factors that}} determine the evolution of emissions from mobile sources in Europe. In 2005, emissions from mobile (road and non-road) sources contributed about 60 % to total NOx emissions in the EU, 20 % to total PM 2. 5, and 30 % to total VOC emissions. Road vehicles emitted more than 70 % of NOx and VOC of all mobile sources, and more than 60 % of PM 2. 5. From 2005 to 2010, implementation of EU legislation has reduced NOx from mobile sources by 18 %, PM by 21 % and VOC by 34 %. For NOx, the decline is lower than the corresponding reductions from stationary sources (. 26 %), so that the relative importance of the transport sector has increased despite the EURO legislation. Especially for NOx, the recent drop in emissions is less than what was anticipated by the 2005 Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution. The major reason for this shortfall are problems in the implementation of NOx limit values for light duty diesel vehicles, where changes in real-life emissions did not follow the improvements in the type <b>approval</b> <b>limit</b> values. As a consequence, by 2015 NOx emissions from light duty diesel vehicles will be a factor two higher compared to a situation where real-life emissions of the EURO 2 to EURO 5 standards would have followed the trends in the type <b>approval</b> <b>limit</b> values. It is estimated that successful implementation of the EURO 6 standards for diesel vehicles (assuming 50 % higher real-life emissions than the type approval value to allow for degradation over time and uncertainties in the driving cycles) should lead to a rapid drop of NOx emissions in the next few years. Up to 2020, NOx emissions from road transport would decline by 65 % compared to 2005, by 80 % in 2025, and by 87 % in 2030. PM emissions from road transport would fall by 62 % in 2020 and by 70 % in 2030, and VOC by up to 80 % until 2030. For PM, the majority of emissions will be caused by non-exhaust sources (tyre and brake wear, road abrasion). For non-road mobile machinery, implementation of the agreed emission controls according along the current schedule should cut NOx emissions in 2020 by 40 % and in 2030 by 60 % compared to 2005. Emissions from PM 2. 5 are projected to drop by 55 % in 2020 and by 70 % in 2030; the reduction for VOC emissions is estimated at 50 % by 2020 and 60 % until 2030. Least changes are expected from ships due to their long lifetime and the slow penetration of new technology. If these changes materialize, emissions from mobile sources would decline faster than those of stationary sources. Especially road transport would lower its share in total emissions, e. g., for NOx from 44 % in 2005 to 17 % in 2030, for PM from 14 % to 7 % and for VOC from 23 % to 9 %. There is a potential for further emission reductions also for non-road mobile machinery, where the introduction of Stage V controls (equivalent to the EURO VI level for NOx and the EURO V for PM emissions from heavy duty vehicles) in 2020 could cut NOx emissions from NRMM by 15 % in 2030 and PM 2. 5 emissions by 26 %. For further reductions ships and aircraft would need to contribute more. For road vehicles, the introduction of hypothetical EURO 7 /VII standards after 2020, with real-world emission factors around 20 % below the EURO 6 /VI limit values could reduce NOx emissions from road vehicles by 13 % below the baseline projection for 2030. As a big caveat, emission projections for road transport are particularly sensitive against assumptions on the effectiveness and timing of new legislation, especially for NOx from light duty diesel vehicles. For instance, if real-life emissions comply with the EURO 6 type approval values only by 2018 instead of 2015, NOx emissions from diesel light duty vehicles would be 40 % higher in 2020. If the type <b>approval</b> <b>limit</b> values were fully achieved in real-life driving cycles, NOx emissions from this source would be 40 % lower after 2030. If however, real-world emissions of EURO 6 vehicles would only follow the reduction rate in type approval values relative to real-life EURO 5 emissions, NOx emissions might be by 270 kt and 470 kt above the baseline in 2020 and 2030, respectively, and total NOx emissions would increase by 5 % and 13 %, respectively. For PM, non-exhaust emissions (road abrasion, brake and tyre wear) will become the major source in the future, and total mass of PM emissions will critically depend on the development of these sources. Implications of these further measures on air quality at urban hot spots will be reported in Part 2 of this report at a later stage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of the evaporative emissions control systems of European passenger cars on the basis of real-world activity data. The study relies on two large datasets of driving patterns from conventional fuel vehicles collected by means of on-board GPS systems, consisting of 4. 5 million trips and parking events recorded by monitoring 28, 000 vehicles over one month. Real world evaporative emissions are estimated using a model that associates a carbon canister desorption event to each trip and a fuel vapour generation event to each parking. The mass of volatile organic compounds released into the air is calculated taking into account the hot-soak, permeation and breathing emission mechanisms. The analysis is based on 36 scenarios, defined by varying the climate conditions, the fuel vapour pressure, the tank material, the tank headspace volume, the purging volume flow rate and the mass of the activated carbon contained in the canister. The results show that in May 4 out of the 18 scenarios considered for Modena and 6 out of the 18 scenarios considered for Firenze lead to evaporative emissions values above the current type <b>approval</b> <b>limit</b> (i. e. 2 [g/day] per vehicle). In July, these numbers increase to 10 out of the 18 scenarios for Modena and to 12 out of the 18 scenarios for Firenze. Looking at the fleet distribution a share of approximately 20 % of the fleet is characterised by evaporative emissions higher than the limit in May, increasing to 48 % in July, with a peak value of 98 %. The emission peak value is estimated to be approximately 4 [g/day] in May and 8 [g/day] in July, while the time-dependent results show emission rates up to nearly 15 [g/s] in Modena and 30 [g/s] in Firenze, with a respective cumulative value in July up to 0. 4 and 0. 8 tons of VOCs per day.

40|$|A {{large number}} of people in Sweden use {{chainsaws}} and injuries are unfortunately common. To decrease the number of injuries a voluntarily ’chainsaw driver license’ has been developed, and is awarded individuals who through theoretical and practical examinations have proved their skills in safe chainsaw work. To get prepared for the examinations, educations are available either as courses or as study circles. Study circles are signified by the lack of formal tutor and are therefore based on participatory learning. The study circle based education is mainly aimed for the {{large number of}} non-professional chainsaw users. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the study circle education’s short and medium term effects on theoretical knowledge in safe chainsaw work. Moreover, it aimed for identifying demands, drivers and obstacles for chainsaw education among self-employed forest owners. The theoretical examination was redone by 31 unprepared individuals a little more than one year after they had undergone study circle education and approval for the B-level chainsaw driver license. The test results was on average one point lower (6 %) and 74 % of the individuals did still pass the <b>approval</b> <b>limit.</b> To take the chainsaw driver license through study circle education implies, hence, that the participants more than a year after the examination still remembers and consequently have the possibility to employ the theoretical knowledge that is considered necessary for safe and efficient chainsaw work. Study circle participants were generally very satisfied with the education and felt that they had reached the educational goals. Long-lasting knowledge and pleased participants indicates the appropriateness of study circles for chainsaw education. How well the education’s practical elements are managed and applied after the examination is, however, unknown for both study circles and other educational forms. Hence, further research on the topic is recommended. The opinion to chainsaw education was investigated among visitors to the forest fair SkogsNolia 2007 and among persons recommended by those who redid the theoretical examination. Drivers for educational interest were connected to both work safety and efficiency, but the willingness to pay was very low. Neither age, sex nor forest ownership affected the interest or the willingness to pay. Relatively un-experienced chainsaw users seem to be easiest to recruit for chainsaw education. However, for novices the requirement of own equipment might be repelling while most experienced individuals not are likely to consider the education useful. The education was preferred to be given intensively during nights and week-ends, which is a combination of the set-up of study circles and courses. Consequently, both educational forms seem to be needed...|$|E
