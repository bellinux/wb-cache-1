5|$|It {{has already}} proven {{difficult}} {{to be recognized as}} having standing when <b>a</b> <b>fix</b> is not used for a controversial appointment.

Black and Mikva were members of Congress (Black of the Senate, Mikva of the House of Representatives) prior to appointment were appointed without a Saxbe fix. In both cases, the courts held that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the appointment. Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.|$|E

The city would try repeatedly to acquire water rights to Hetch Hetchy, including in 1901, 1903 and 1905, but was continually rebuffed because of conflicts with irrigation districts that had senior water rights on the Tuolumne River, and because of the valley's national park status.|$|E

Capone reportedly bet $50,000 on Dempsey for the rematch, which fueled false rumors of <b>a</b> <b>fix.</b> Dempsey was favored by odds makers in both fights, largely because of public betting which heavily tilted towards Dempsey.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} criticised for some {{negative}} issues, {{such as the}} aiming system in gunplay. The developer had initially countered complaints that the game's aiming was inaccurate in a blog post on its official site. However, after complaints continued on the Naughty Dog forum and NeoGAF, a patch to address concerns about the game's aiming system was impending after developer Naughty Dog invited a couple of fans to its HQ to discuss the problem. On November 27, 2011, Naughty Dog released a patch that offered <b>a</b> <b>fix</b> for those unhappy with the game's refined aiming controls. The update offers the option of toggling between the new controls and a set-up {{more in line with}} that found in Uncharted 2. Despite being addressed in the previous games in the series, another minor issue raised was that of the game's linearity. Amy Hennig, in an interview with GameTrailers, defended this aspect by arguing that too little linearity in the series would have affected the game's narrative.|$|E
25|$|On March 11, NASCAR lifted Busch's {{indefinite}} suspension after {{prosecutors in}} Delaware determined {{there was not}} enough evidence to bring a criminal case against Busch, making him eligible to compete again, starting with the CampingWorld.com 500 at Phoenix. Driscoll is now under federal indictment for fraud and misusing charitable donations for personal gain. Additionally, Busch was granted a waiver by NASCAR, making him still eligible for the Chase if he won a race between then and the autumn Richmond event. In his first race back from suspension, Busch finished fifth. At Auto Club, Busch won the pole and led the most laps (65), before being bumped back to third due to a last lap pass by Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. The race ended in controversy as, according to an online poll, 69% of the fans suspected <b>a</b> <b>fix</b> in the waning laps on NASCAR's part.
