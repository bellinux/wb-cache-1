2500|$|Emanuel Bowen {{reproduced}} Thévenot's map in his Complete System of Geography (London, 1747), re-titling it A Complete Map of the Southern Continent {{and adding}} three inscriptions promoting {{the benefits of}} exploring and colonizing the country. One inscription said: [...] "It is impossible to conceive <b>a</b> <b>Country</b> <b>that</b> <b>promises</b> fairer from its Situation than this of TERRA AUSTRALIS, no longer incognita, as this Map demonstrates, but the Southern Continent Discovered. It lies precisely in the richest climates of the World... and therefore whoever perfectly discovers and settles it will become infalliably possessed of Territories as Rich, as fruitful, and as capable of Improvement, as any that have hitherto been found out, either in the East Indies or the West." [...] Bowen’s map was re-published in John Campbell’s editions of John Harris's Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels (1744-1748, and 1764). When drawing up the territorial boundaries of the colony of New South Wales, established in 1788, the British government set its western boundary at the meridian of 135° East of Greenwich, as it appeared on Thévenot's chart.|$|E

5000|$|In 1664 the French geographer, Melchisédech Thévenot, {{published}} in Relations de Divers Voyages Curieux {{a map of}} New Holland. Thévenot divided the continent in two, between Nova Hollandia {{to the west and}} Terre Australe to the east. Emanuel Bowen reproduced Thevenots map in his Complete System of Geography (London, 1747), re-titling it A Complete Map of the Southern Continent and adding three inscriptions promoting the benefits of exploring and colonising the country.

50|$|From {{the late}} 1950s {{and into the}} 1970s, more than 90,000 of the Korean {{residents}} in Japan emigrated to North Korea, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> them affluence, justice {{and an end to}} discrimination. Our Homeland tells the story of one of their number, who returns for just a short period. Yoon Seong-ho (Arata Iura) was sent to North Korea as a teen by his fervently North-supporting father. Returning to Tokyo for medical treatment after 25 years, he finds it difficult to open up to his family, including his passionately anti-North sister Rie (Sakura Ando). Seong-ho and Rie are two people handed radically different life perspectives by the course of history. While Seong-ho's path is sketched out for him, Rie recognizes that a whole world of opportunities is open to her. Including the chance to rebel against her own family.|$|R

60|$|We had, however, no remedy but patience; {{and having}} killed some fowls and dried some fish, as much as, with short allowance, we {{reckoned}} would last us five days, we resolved to venture, and venture we did; {{nor was it}} without cause that we were apprehensive of the danger, for we travelled the five days and met neither with fish nor fowl, nor four-footed beast, whose flesh was fit to eat, {{and we were in}} a most dreadful apprehension of being famished to death. On the sixth day we almost fasted, or, as we may say, we ate up all the scraps of what we had left, and at night lay down supperless upon our mats, with heavy hearts, being obliged the eighth day to kill one of our poor faithful servants, the buffaloes that carried our baggage. The flesh of this creature was very good, and so sparingly did we eat of it that it lasted us all three days and a half, and was just spent; and we were on the point of killing another when we saw before us <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> <b>promised</b> better, having high trees and a large river in the middle of it.|$|R

5000|$|Bülow {{assured the}} British {{ambassador}} {{that he was}} pleased to see Britain and France settling their differences. He informed the Reichstag that Germany had no objections to the deal and no concerns about German interests in Morocco. Holstein had a different view: intervention in Moroccan affairs was governed by the [...] Holstein argued that Germany had been sidelined by not being included in the negotiations and <b>that</b> Morocco was <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> showed <b>promise</b> for German influence and trade, which must eventually suffer if it came under French control. Previously he had dismissed any possibility of agreement between France and Britain. France now offered military assistance to Morocco to improve order in the country. [...] Bülow responded by supporting the position of an independent Morocco, encouraging the United States to become involved and threatened war if France intervened. He was now convinced that the new friendliness between France and Britain was a threat to Germany, particularly should the accord deepen; but France was ill-prepared-for war. Despite possible risks of assassination, Bülow persuaded Wilhelm to make a visit to Tangier in 1905, where he made a speech supporting Morocco's independence, but his presence there simultaneously demonstrated Germany's determination to maintain its own influence.|$|R
