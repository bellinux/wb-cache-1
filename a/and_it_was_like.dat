[...] Nader also taped his scenes out of sequence while dealing with sixteen different scripts from different points in the story. To keep each scene straight he gave them each a name that described the scene's main action. After those scenes were taped, they were spliced into the otherwise completed episodes. This went on for two weeks until the episodes were all caught up. Another complication Nader dealt with was the wardrobe. He said, [...] "They had devised this sort of 'tapestry' layered look for Dimitri <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> doing scenes inside a sauna."
