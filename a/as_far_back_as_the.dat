5|$|Mechanical gun games {{existed before}} the {{emergence}} of electronic video games, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 1920s. The first light guns appeared in the 1930s, with the Seeburg Ray-O-Lite. Games using this toy rifle were mechanical and the rifle fired beams of light at targets wired with sensors. These evolved throughout subsequent decades, culminating in games such as Sega's electro-mechanical arcade game Periscope, the company's first successful game, released in 1966. It required the player to target cardboard ships.|$|E

In the 6th century B.C., Etruscan writing was introduced in the province of Cadore, in whose possession is remained until the early 15th century.

5|$|The first large Maya cities {{developed}} in Petén <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Middle Preclassic (c.600–350BC), and Petén formed {{the heartland of}} the ancient Maya civilization during the Classic period (c.AD250–900). The great cities that dominated Petén had fallen into ruin {{by the beginning of}} the 10th century AD with the onset of the Classic Maya collapse. A significant Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{influence}} of the Church during the Middle Ages gradually turned Aarhus, with its bishopric, into a prosperous religious centre. Many public and religious buildings were built {{in and around the}} city; notably Aarhus Cathedral was initiated in the late 12thcentury by the influential bishop Peder Vognsen. In 1441, Christopher III issued the oldest known charter granting market town status although similar privileges may have existed <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 12thcentury. The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a regional power and is by some considered Aarhus' birth certificate.|$|E

The ritual included scattering a large amount of rubbish in front of the south entrance to the building and then possibly burning the building itself. The rubbish is presumed to have come from the area of Group D itself and included some items associated with weaving and the manufacture of paper.|$|E

5|$|There are {{different}} theories {{about where the}} ancestors of the Arabian originally lived.

This hypothesis has gained renewed attention following a 2010 discovery of artifacts dated between 6590 and 7250 BCE in Al-Magar, in southwestern Saudi Arabia, that appeared to portray horses.|$|E
