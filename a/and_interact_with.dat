5|$|Life Is Strange is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} played from a third-person view. The mechanic of rewinding time allows the player to redo any action {{that has been}} taken. The player can examine <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> objects, which enables puzzle solving {{in the form of}} fetch quests and making changes to the environment. Items that are collected before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact.|$|E
5|$|The player {{constructs}} {{and manages}} a dungeon, recruiting and catering for minions {{to run it}} and defend it from enemy invaders. The primary method of control is the hand, used to pick up creatures and objects in the dungeon, carry them around, and drop them. The hand allows the player to 'slap' creatures and objects, <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> them. Dungeon Keeper gameplay exemplifies a dark sense of humour.|$|E

5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} {{by one or}} more friendly non-player characters, who will follow the player and provide assistance in combat against enemies. As they are often key to the story, friendly characters must not be killed in combat except during scripted events. In between combat missions, the player can move around the USS Voyager <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> other members of its crew, often performing non-combat tasks to progress the story.|$|E

5|$|Diving {{medicine}} {{deals with}} medical research {{on issues of}} diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accident injuries and diving fitness. The field includes {{the effect on the}} human body of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure, and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety. In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and first aid and recognition of symptoms of diving disorders are important parts of diver education.|$|E

5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
5|$|Later Myst titles {{improved}} on {{the integration}} of live action sequences in the prerendered environments of the games. s developers filmed all the scenes using standard definition cameras, which producer Dan Irish would look back on as a mistake; without using high definition video cameras, the video did not look crisp at high resolutions. For the next game, , Ubisoft allowed players to move the game camera <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> the video while it is playing {{through the use of}} the ALIVE game engine.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Legendia is a console {{role-playing}} game set in {{a fantasy}} world featuring three-dimensional characters and environments. The game is presented from a top-down perspective, and players must move their character {{through a number of}} locales, battle monsters, <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> non-player characters to advance the story. Unlike previous games in the series where monsters were visible before being encountered, Tales of Legendia features randomized battles that occur every few steps while inside dungeons or other hostile areas.|$|E

50|$|This gene encodes an {{essential}} component of the peroxisomal import machinery. The protein is integrated into peroxisome membranes with its C-terminus exposed to the cytosol, <b>and</b> <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> the cytosolic receptor for proteins containing a PTS1 peroxisomal targeting signal. The protein also functions as a transcriptional corepressor <b>and</b> <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> a histone deacetylase. A mutation in this gene results in one form of Zellweger syndrome.|$|R
5|$|The NCHS-NYP Science and Technology Research Programme is a collaborated {{initiative}} between Nanyang Polytechnic and Nan Chiau High School for {{upper secondary}} levels {{with the aim}} of providing opportunities for capable science students to acquire science knowledge beyond academic syllabus, carry out research modules using contemporary technology, <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> specialists in the relevant fields of Sciences and Information Technology. The research projects are presented {{in the form of an}} annual symposium hosted by Yishun Town Secondary and Nan Chiau High alternately, which serves as a platform for students involved to showcase their work to fellow schoolmates and counterparts from other schools.|$|E
5|$|The novel—Grossman's first—was written {{during his}} tenure as a video game designer. The book uses characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} associated with comic books and superhero fiction, but is written entirely in prose. The story explores how superheroes cope with their powers <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> one another. The potential motivations and perspectives of supervillains are also examined. Grossman's book has been variously described as clever, engaging, and fun—but overstuffed with comic book tropes. An audiobook was released along with the hardcover edition, while a movie has been in development since 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary cause}} of lead's {{toxicity}} is its interference {{with a variety of}} enzymes because it binds to sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes. Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act. Lead is able to bind to <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.|$|E

5|$|In Abzû, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of a diver in a vast ocean—after waking up {{floating}} on the ocean's surface, the diver begins exploring the surrounding underwater environments filled with plant and animal life, in addition to uncovering ancient technology and submerged ruins. In a few areas, the diver is also able to explore land-based environments above the water. As the game progresses, the diver unlocks new areas and pursues the secrets behind the forces harming the local environment. The diver's course through the game follows a linear path through interconnected areas filled with marine life. The player directs the diver through the environments using full analogue control, able to interact with the environment to solve switch or item-based puzzles, and sit on pedestals within each area to observe the surrounding sea life. The diver can accelerate, <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> marine life using sonar chimes. The diver can grab onto the bodies of larger marine animals and ride on them. Each area sports hidden collectables for the diver to find.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy IV, {{the player}} {{controls}} a large {{cast of characters}} and completes quests to advance the story. Characters move <b>and</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> people and enemies on a field map, which may represent a variety of settings, such as towers, caves, and forests. Travel between areas occurs on a world map. The player can use towns to replenish strength, buy equipment, and discover clues about their next destination. Conversely, the player fights monsters at random intervals on the world map and in dungeons. In battle, the player has the option to fight, use magic or an item, retreat, change character positions, parry, or pause. Certain characters have special abilities. The game {{was the first in}} the series to allow the player to control up to five characters in their party; previous games had limited the party to four.|$|E
