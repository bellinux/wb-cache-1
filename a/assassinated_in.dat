5|$|Justin and Diodorus {{both say}} that Philip also invaded Thessaly in 358 BC. In the years up to 370 BC, Thessaly had enjoyed a brief {{ascendancy}} in the Greek world, after being unified under Jason of Pherae, {{who was appointed}} Tagus (chief magistrate) of Thessaly. However, Jason was <b>assassinated</b> <b>in</b> 370 BC, and his son Alexander became Tagus. Alexander ruled harshly, and other states of the Thessalian League therefore withdrew their support for him, resulting in a desultory conflict in which both Macedon (under Alexander II) and eventually Thebes became embroiled. This conflict eventually ended in 364 BC when the Thebans were victorious over Alexander, and imposed a peace settlement on Thessaly. However, with the weakening of Thebes {{in the aftermath of}} Mantinea, on-off conflict within Thessaly continued. Alexander was himself <b>assassinated</b> <b>in</b> 358 BC, by his wife's brothers Lycophron and Tisiphonus, who became tyrants in his place. According to Diodorus, the Aleuadae, the noble family which dominated politics in the northern Thessalian city of Larissa, were opposed to these new tyrants, and requested aid from Philip.|$|E
