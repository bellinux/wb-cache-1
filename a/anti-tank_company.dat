500|$|Constituted in March 1942, the 1st Filipino Infantry Battalion was {{activated}} in April at Camp San Luis Obispo, {{to liberate}} the Philippines. [...] Colonel Robert Offley {{was selected as the}} unit's commanding officer, as he spoke Tagalog and had spent time on Mindoro in his youth.

In July 1942, the battalion was elevated to a regiment at the California Rodeo Grounds in Salinas, California.

The Poles did not, however, occupy Point 262S. Although Lieutenant-Colonel Zdzisław Szydłowski, commanding the 9th Infantry Battalion, was given orders to take the southern peak, with darkness falling and thick smoke from the burning German column in the pass obscuring the battlefield this was deemed too hazardous to attempt before next light. The Poles spent the night fortifying Point 262N and entrenching the southern, southwestern, and northeastern approaches to their positions.|$|E

500|$|Observing the {{build-up}} {{of shipping}} off the beach, {{and in an}} attempt to contain what were regarded as minor penetrations at Omaha, a battalion was detached from the 915th Regiment being deployed against the British to the east. Along with an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>company,</b> this force was attached to the 916th Regiment and committed to a counterattack in the Colleville area in the early afternoon. It was stopped by [...] "firm American resistance" [...] and reported heavy losses. The strategic situation in Normandy precluded the reinforcement of the weakened 352nd Division. The main threat was felt by the Germans to be the British beachheads to the east of Omaha, and these received the most attention from the German mobile reserves in the immediate area of Normandy. Preparations were made to bring up units stationed for the defense of Brittany, southwest of Normandy, but these would not arrive quickly and would be subject to losses inflicted in transit by overwhelming Allied air superiority. The last reserve of the 352nd Division, an engineer battalion, was attached to the 916th Regiment in the evening. It was deployed to defend against the expected attempt {{to break out of the}} Colleville-St. Laurent beachhead established on the 16th RCT front. At midnight General Dietrich Kraiss, commander of the 352nd Division, reporting the total loss of men and equipment in the coastal positions, advised that he had sufficient forces to contain the Americans on D+1 but that he would need reinforcements thereafter, to be told that there were no more reserves available.|$|E
