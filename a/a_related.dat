5|$|<b>A</b> <b>related</b> {{argument}} against evolution {{is that most}} mutations are harmful.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>related</b> {{issue to}} the classic horizon problem arises because in most {{standard}} cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before electroweak symmetry breaking occurs, so inflation should {{not be able to}} prevent large-scale discontinuities in the electroweak vacuum since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the electroweak epoch ended.|$|E

50|$|Researchers {{have also}} been using WSC tasks to {{investigate}} the implicit impact of exposure to appearance and weight related images in the media. In one study two groups of participants, a control group who watched <b>a</b> nonappearance <b>related</b> video and <b>an</b> experimental group who watched <b>an</b> appearance <b>related</b> video, {{were asked to complete}} twenty word stems with the first word that came to mind. The word stems were created with the possibility of being completed with <b>an</b> appearance <b>related</b> word or <b>a</b> nonappearance <b>related</b> word. For example, SLE___ could be completed with slender, <b>an</b> appearance <b>related</b> word or with sleep, <b>a</b> nonappearance <b>related</b> word. For both females and males, results showed that watching <b>an</b> appearance <b>related</b> video before completing a WSC task significantly increased the number of appearance related responses. This study shows that the WSC task can be successfully used to explore the implicit influences of the media.|$|R
