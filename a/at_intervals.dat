40|$|In many {{applications}} one {{is interested in}} the behavior of a process at various time scales or intervals T. The key issue in accurate time series analysis <b>at</b> <b>interval</b> T is order selection, rather than parameter estimation. Order selection <b>at</b> <b>interval</b> T uses knowledge of the statistal behavior of estimated AR parameters <b>at</b> <b>interval</b> T. A �nite sample expression for this behavior is derived and veri�ed in simulations. Spectral details which are not considered signi�cant with standard modeling are accurately described with modeling <b>at</b> <b>interval</b> T. As a result, order selection <b>at</b> <b>interval</b> T yields better models than application of standard order selection. ...|$|R

5|$|About 20 eruptions have {{occurred}} on the Mono–Inyo Craters chain <b>at</b> <b>intervals</b> of 250 to 700 years during the past 5,000 years. Seismic soundings and lava composition indicate that these eruptions most likely originated from discrete and small magma bodies. The rate of eruption over the last 1,000 years has increased, with at least 12eruptions occurring.|$|E
5|$|By 1927, {{the year}} of her 90th {{birthday}}, Cosima's health was failing. The birthday was marked in Bayreuth by the naming of a street in her honour, although she was unaware; the family thought that knowledge of the celebrations would overexcite her. In her last years she was virtually bedridden, became blind, and was only lucid <b>at</b> <b>intervals.</b> She died, aged 92, on 1 April 1930; after a funeral service at Wahnfried her body was taken to Coburg and cremated.|$|E
5|$|Clicks {{are quick}} {{broadband}} burst pulses, used for sonar, although some lower-frequency broadband vocalizations may serve a non-echolocative purpose such as communication; for example, the pulsed calls of belugas. Pulses in a click train are emitted <b>at</b> <b>intervals</b> of ~35–50 milliseconds, {{and in general}} these inter-click intervals are slightly greater than the round-trip time of sound to the target.|$|E
50|$|It {{is served}} by Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn line S 9 <b>at</b> hourly <b>intervals.</b> It is also served by bus routes 221 (Brassert - Marl Mitte, <b>at</b> 60 minute <b>intervals),</b> 222 (Sinsen - Recklinghausen + Polsum - Hassel - Buer, <b>at</b> 30 minute <b>intervals),</b> 223 (Chemiepark - Sinsen - Wacholderstr, <b>at</b> 30 minute <b>intervals),</b> 225 (Hüls - Hamm - Waldsiedlung, <b>at</b> 30 minute <b>intervals),</b> 238 (Drewer Süd - Hüls Süd - Recklinghausen, <b>at</b> 30 minute <b>intervals),</b> 242 (Sickingmühle - Haltern/Mersch, <b>at</b> 30 minute <b>intervals),</b> 270 (RE Hbf + Brassert - Hervest - Dorsten, <b>at</b> 30 minute <b>intervals),</b> SB26 (Barkenberg - Wulfen + Sinsen - Oer-Erkenschwick, <b>at</b> 30-60 minute <b>intervals)</b> and SB27 (Langenbochum - Herten - Wanne-Eickel, <b>at</b> 30 minute <b>intervals),</b> SB25 (Dorsten + Recklinghausen, <b>at</b> 30 minute <b>intervals)</b> and taxibus service 229 (Hagenstr - Blumensiedlung <b>at</b> 60 minute <b>intervals),</b> all {{operated}} by Vestische Straßenbahnen.|$|R

5|$|In 1792, Claude Chappe, a French engineer, {{built the}} first fixed visual {{telegraphy}} system (or semaphore line) between Lille and Paris. However semaphore suffered from the need for skilled operators and expensive towers <b>at</b> <b>intervals</b> of ten to thirty kilometres (six to nineteen miles). As a result of competition from the electrical telegraph, the last commercial line was abandoned in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, beetles have open circulatory systems, {{based on}} {{hemolymph}} rather than blood. As in other insects, a segmented tube-like heart {{is attached to}} the dorsal wall of the hemocoel. It has paired inlets or ostia <b>at</b> <b>intervals</b> down its length, and circulates the hemolymph from the main cavity of the haemocoel and out through the anterior cavity in the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} the two species are not similar. The call of the greater melampitta is a double or triple note, which is slurred and {{repeated}} monotonously, and {{is reminiscent of the}} black pitohui. The call of the lesser melampitta are either harsh buzzy notes or chirped whistles, both of which are repeated <b>at</b> <b>intervals.</b>|$|E

5|$|The ringed caecilian (Siphonops annulatus) has {{developed}} a unique adaptation {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy. The brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes <b>at</b> <b>intervals</b> of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate. Meanwhile, they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{sun drying}} {{has been used}} for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, and beans, spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop <b>at</b> <b>intervals.</b> This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates, spoilage when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, wetting by rain, and attack by rodents, birds, and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered driers. The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the chamber}} were placed human remains, {{which have been}} {{discovered}} and removed <b>at</b> <b>intervals</b> during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries. Early twentieth century excavation found two separate deposits of bone, each buried atop a stone slab, one higher than the other. Also buried within the chamber were flint tools and small quantities of pottery.|$|E

50|$|All three Stadtbahn lines run to {{the same}} pattern: {{services}} on each line run during the peak hour <b>at</b> 10-minute <b>intervals,</b> in the evenings and on weekends or public holidays <b>at</b> 15-minute <b>intervals</b> and {{late in the evening}} <b>at</b> 30-minute <b>intervals.</b> During trade fairs, services on line U11 run on weekends at 10-minute intervals; between Messe (fair ground) and Berliner Platz they sometimes even run <b>at</b> 5-minute <b>intervals.</b> Operations end on all three lines at about 23:00.|$|R
5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked <b>at</b> <b>intervals</b> by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E
5|$|A {{gunpowder}} plant {{had been}} established around 1573 in Faversham. The town had a stream which could be dammed <b>at</b> <b>intervals</b> to provide power for watermills. It {{became known as the}} Home Works in the 18th century and was nationalised in 1759. By the 19th century, the site stretched for around a mile along the waterfront. A second explosive works was established at Oare to the northwest of town in the late 17th century, with the Marsh Works following in 1786. Towards the end of the 19th century, two new factories were built alongside the Swale to manage production of TNT and cordite. Faversham developed six explosive factories, and from 1874 to 1919, the town was the centre of the explosives industry in the UK.|$|E
5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge <b>at</b> <b>intervals</b> of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
50|$|At rush hour, trains run <b>at</b> 4-6-minute <b>{{intervals}}</b> on lines 1 and 3, 7-minute on line 4 and <b>at</b> 1-4-minute <b>intervals</b> on line 2; {{during the}} rest of the day, trains run <b>at</b> 8-minute <b>intervals</b> on lines 1 and 3, 9-minute intervals on line 2 and 10-minute intervals on line 4.|$|R

5|$|After delays, {{the voyage}} began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin {{spent most of}} that time on land {{investigating}} geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and <b>at</b> <b>intervals</b> during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected in a calm spell.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown {{of these are}} composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced <b>at</b> <b>intervals.</b> Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs {{have one or two}} rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar {{physical and chemical properties}} that recurred <b>at</b> <b>intervals</b> of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group. His table placed hydrogen with the halogens.|$|E
