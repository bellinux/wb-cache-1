This demo included cutscenes to introduce the player to Rapture, the game's tutorial section, and its first levels; the demo also included weapons, plasmids, and tonics {{that would otherwise be}} introduced later in the full title, as to give the player more of the features that would be found in the published game. The Xbox demo was the fastest demo <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reach one million downloads on the Xbox Live service.

5|$|In 1790, a new Royal Opera House was {{proposed}} {{to be built}} in Leicester Square. The scheme was led by The Prince of Wales, Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford and James Cecil, 1st Marquess of Salisbury and aimed to re-establish London as a centre for Italian opera and ballet, with an opera house to rival those in mainland Europe. The opera house was never built, as the royal patent needed <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> license a theatre was refused. The plans for the original design are preserved in Sir John Soane's Museum, while a 1790 painting by William Hodges, which displays the finished design, belongs to the Museum of London.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{the ship}} was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration, which {{transferred}} her to the Soviet Union {{under the terms of}} Lend-Lease in December 1942. She was assigned to the Far East Shipping Company under her new name of SSTashkent, but sailed with the Soviet Pacific Fleet throughout the war. She delivered cargo and troops in support of the Soviet invasion of Japanese-held territories in August 1945. After the war, the ship remained a part of the Soviet merchant fleet until 1966. She was transferred to North Korea <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> become a fish processing facility, and was scrapped in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The {{originally}} intended 12-pounder guns were exchanged for sixteen 4-in (102mm) QF Mk III guns {{early in the}} construction process. They were positioned in the superstructure and on turret roofs in open mounts as they were {{not expected to be}} manned in a ship-to-ship engagement during daylight. During 1914–15 the turret roof guns were transferred to the superstructure and the total number of guns was reduced to twelve. All of the remaining guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{are working to}} reduce costs of electric power from offshore wind. One example is the Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the Nez Perce tribe {{was first}} {{founded in the}} valley of the Clearwater River, one of the Snake River's {{lowermost}} major tributaries. At its height, there were at least 27 Nez Perce settlements along the Clearwater River and 11 more on the Snake between the mouth of the Clearwater and Imnaha Rivers. There were also villages on the Salmon River, Grande Ronde River, Tucannon River, and the lower Hells Canyon area. The Snake River's annual salmon run, which was estimated <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> exceed four million in good years, supported the Nez Perce, who lived in permanent, well-defined villages, unlike the nomadic southeastern tribes along the Snake River. The Nez Perce also were involved in trade with the Flathead tribe to the north and other middle Columbia River tribes. However, they were enemies to the Shoshone and the other upstream Snake River tribes.|$|E
5|$|Although Rappe did not {{completely}} {{rule out the}} possibility of a German or British attack on southern Sweden if the opportunity arose, he felt that Russia was the most realistic threat. There were only two plausible scenarios for war with Russia: either Sweden would become involved in a war between Germany and Russia which would feature southern and central Sweden as the battlegroundand Rappe made no attempt to hide which country the General Staff wanted Sweden to side with in that caseor Russia would make a limited attack on Norrbotten to reach northern Norway and the Atlantic, an attack that Rappe earlier said was not very likely. Rappe had played down the strategic importance of the Ofoten and Iron Ore Lines and played up the importance of the main railway line to Boden, which was under discussion <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> speed up its completion. The railway to Boden was nearly finished by 1892, negating the need for Rappe to play that political game any longer. A railway line to Boden was of utmost {{need to be able to}} bring up troops to Lule Riverthe main line of defenceand a future fortress there.|$|E

5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that {{this was one of}} the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and Clarence Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It has been suggested that Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Jaime Sabater, Sr. (1904–1955), a United States Naval Academy graduate, Class of 1927, {{commanded}} the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines, 3rd Marine Division during the Bougainville amphibious operations. On November 1, 1943. The Allies intended {{to establish a}} beachhead around Cape Torokina, within which an airfield would be built. Allied forces did not plan, <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> try to capture the entire island of Bougainville from Japanese forces. An attempt by the Japanese Navy to attack the U.S. landing forces was defeated in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, between November 1 and November 2. A subsequent attempt by Japanese land forces to attack the Allied beachhead was defeated in the Battle of Koromokina Lagoon.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{attended}} the local Cap Coch school, leaving {{at the age}} of 12, as was usual <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> begin work in the Cwmpennar coal mine. He remained there until the mine was exhausted in 1905, when he moved to Mountain Ash to work at Nixon's Navigation Colliery. His ambition and intelligence were quickly recognised by his superiors, and he was encouraged to study mining engineering, at first locally in Aberdare and, in 1907, at the Royal College of Science in London. In 1908, with sponsorship from the Brecon Memorial College, he passed his matriculation and began studying for a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree at University College, Cardiff, with a view thereafter to entering the nonconformist ministry. However, Davies's religious beliefs were influenced by R. J. Campbell, a noted preacher who rejected much traditional Christian teaching and asserted that socialism was the practical expression of Christianity. Davies's association with such supposed heresies was unacceptable to the Brecon college, which withdrew its financial support.|$|E

5|$|Despite some protests, on 18 September 1773, the Committee {{formally}} {{signed the}} treaty of cession, renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the occupied territories. The Sejm on 30 September 1773 accepted the partition treaty. By the first partition the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 211,000km² (30% of its territory, amounting <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> about 733,000km²), {{with a population of}} over four to five million people (about a third of its population of 14 million before the partitions). The treaty was a major success for Frederick II of Prussia: Prussia's share might have been the smallest, but it was also significantly developed and strategically important. Russia received the largest, but economically least-important area, in the northeast.|$|E
5|$|His reward, however, {{was to be}} the university's first Keeper of the Archives, {{appointed}} on 11 August 1634. The new statute {{governing the}} position noted the losses that Oxford had suffered because of the careless keeping of its archives, and the need for an experienced person to take charge of them and to advise the university's officers in defending its interests. He was to be paid not less than £40 annually, with a levy of one shilling from each graduate and undergraduate. Thereafter, he sought to obtain royal confirmation of Oxford's rights and privileges, to keep the city of Oxford subordinate to the university, and to match the position of Cambridge. A new royal charter was obtained in 1636 to confirm the revised statutes. Under Twyne and his successor as Keeper (Gerard Langbaine), the archives were moved into one of the rooms in the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library; three of the wooden presses that were built <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> store them are still in use.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's next novel, The Man-Eater of Malgudi, was {{published}} in 1961. The book was reviewed as having a narrative that is a classical art form of comedy, with delicate control. After the launch of this book, the restless Narayan once again took to travelling, and visited the U.S. and Australia. He spent three weeks in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne giving lectures on Indian literature. The trip was funded by a fellowship from the Australian Writers' Group. By this time Narayan had also achieved significant success, both literary and financial. He had a large house in Mysore, and wrote in a study with no fewer than eight windows; he drove a new Mercedes-Benz, a luxury in India <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> visit his daughter who had moved to Coimbatore after her marriage. With his success, both within India and abroad, Narayan started writing columns for magazines and newspapers including The Hindu and The Atlantic.|$|E

Starr's stay with Sheridan was short-lived, as he found Sheridan's habit of changing the set list without telling his backing group beforehand frustrating, so he rejoined the Hurricanes. On 5 February 1962, Best fell ill and the Beatles had to play a lunchtime concert at the Cavern and an evening concert at the Kingsway club in Southport. As the Hurricanes had no concert that day Starr played with them live on stage for the first time (although he had recorded with them in Hamburg).|$|E
5|$|Terence Tao (Australia) {{participated in}} IMO 1986, 1987 and 1988, winning bronze, {{silver and gold}} medals respectively.

Tao also holds the distinction of being the youngest medalist with his 1986 bronze medal, alongside 2009 bronze medalist Raúl Chávez Sarmiento (Peru), at the age of 10 and 11 respectively. Representing the United States, Noam Elkies won a gold medal with a perfect paper at the age of 14 in 1981. Note that both Elkies and Tao could have participated in the IMO multiple times following their success, but entered university and therefore became ineligible.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} the focus of a Portland Development Commission urban renewal based on a 1982 master plan, {{becoming}} an urban renewal district in 1985, and expiring in July 2008. The park blocks underwent serious renovations in 1987, adding plazas, large flower beds, lighting and irrigation, and newly paved sidewalks. Several apartment complexes specifically aimed at the middle class were built, including the University Park Apartments (125 units, $10.5 million, quickly sold and converted to condos), South Park Square Apartments (184 units, $16 million, completed May 1988), and Tom Mesher's Gallery Park Apartments (31 units, $3 million). In 1987, the New Theater Building of the Portland Center for the Performing Arts was completed immediately next door to the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall. The South Park Blocks Association, a commercial and institutional association, was started <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> attract residents and consumers to the area and to address security concerns.|$|E
