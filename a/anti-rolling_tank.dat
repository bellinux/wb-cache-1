The vessel will be upgraded for service in the northern latitudes by increasing her ice strengthening, now adequate for icebreaking in the Baltic Sea, to Polar Class 4 (PC-4) which is intended for vessels operating year-round in thick first-year ice which may include old ice inclusions. Furthermore, a [...] <b>anti-rolling</b> <b>tank</b> will be installed to improve her open water characteristics.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some background}} for {{an analysis of}} the risk of severe parametric roll motion for a ship operating in head seas. This background includes a consideration of basic probabilistic qualities of parametric roll in head seas: ergodic qualities and distributions, since these results are necessary to establish a method of prediction of extreme values. The ship motions that generate parametric excitation, heave and pitch, have also been studied in this analysis. The post-Panamax C 11 class container carrier was chosen for analysis, since a vessel of this type is known to have suffered significant damage in an incident attributed to severe parametric roll. It was shown that despite large-amplitude of motion, pitch and heave retain their ergodic qualities and normal character of distribution, while the roll motions are clearly non-ergodic and do not have a normal distribution. The analysis is built upon the numerical simulation of ship motion in head seas using Large Amplitude Motion Program (LAMP). The paper also considers the effectiveness of anti-rolling devices in mitigating parametric roll by suppressing the parametric excitation.

40|$|A {{ship out}} at sea is exposed to {{environmental}} forces {{in addition to those}} generated by the ship's actuators. It is these forces that make the ship move. However, in some cases the ship moves in an undesirable way. Because the moment of inertia in roll is smaller than the other moments of inertia, motion in roll becomes the least dampened of all the unwanted motions of a ship. Therefore, nowadays ships are often equipped with roll reducing devices. A common device is the <b>anti-roll</b> <b>tank,</b> which delivers its stabilizing moment by moving the tank fluid from side to side. The topic of this thesis is to study and analyze how the ship's dynamics in sway, roll and yaw is influenced by an u-shaped <b>anti-roll</b> <b>tank</b> and how to control the tank fluid to make a stabilizing moment in roll. In order achieve this, a 3 DOF lateral model of a ship equipped with a u-tank will be derived using Lagrangian mechanics. The model's validity will be analyzed by comparing it to a well known and proven model. In order to increase the u-tank's performance, several controllers, both passive and active, will be designed. Furthermore, the model with its controllers will be implemented in Matlab/Simulink and exposed to regular and irregular beam seas.

[...] A flume tank model and a pair of paravanes, as well as an oscillating bench simulating sinusoidal rolling, were designed and then constructed.

The analysis was carried out by inspecting the phase lags εt of the motion of tank water to the roll motion. [...] Free roll decay tests for a fishing vessel model with the tank and paravanes were carried out for identification of the damping generated by the tank and paravanes.

The study of roll responses, roll energy spectra, response amplitude operators (RAO), and resonant and significant roll amplitude reductions at various wave and stability conditions shows that the tank can provide 50 % to 70 % roll reductions, which are approximately 30 % more than the paravanes can do in the same circumstances. The effects of tuning, liquid level, and internal damping on the efficiency of the tank are discussed. Comparisons in the behaviors of the stabilizers for different wave conditions are also made.

40|$|The {{undesirable}} effects of roll motion of ships (rocking about the longitudinal axis) became noticeable {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century when significant changes were introduced to the design of ships as a result of sails being replaced by steam engines and the arrangement being changed from broad to narrow hulls. The combination of these changes led to lower transverse stability (lower restoring moment for a given angle of roll) with the consequence of larger roll motion. The increase in roll motion and its effect on cargo and human performance lead to the development several control devices that aimed at reducing and controlling roll motion.

Computer simulations of anchor handling vessels {{can be used to}} evaluate the forces acting on them, and to gain valuable insight into their operational limitations. Introductorily, an overview containing important aspects of anchor handling operations is presented. The objective is to highlight important subjects that must be considered before a simulator is developed. A simulator of an anchor handling vessel is successfully implemented in Matlab and Simulink. The simulator contains modules for ballast <b>tanks,</b> <b>anti-roll</b> <b>tanks,</b> cables, seabed and anchor interaction, winch systems and guide pins. The vessel model is matched up against a real anchor handling vessel to give realistic thrust characteristics. The simulator is capable of simulating both anchor deployment and anchor recovery operations in real time. Catenary equations are used to model cables. A quasi-static polynomial approach with look-up tables is used for implementation. The method allows the use of different catenary models to simulate different phases of the anchor handling operation. A catenary model of two cables with a point load, imitating the effect of an anchor, is developed based on existing catenary models in the literature. The simulator is verified through simulations. A set of case studies is used to evaluate the vessel performance during anchor deployment and recovery. The case studies consider operation in ideal and rough weather conditions, and it is shown how equipment failures and poor vessel configuration can lead to decreased vessel stability and loss of maneuvering capabilities. </p...|$|R

An advantage of free-flooding tanks over U-tube and free-surface tanks is that they are easy to retrofit, because they do not require a considerable amount of space in the center part of the vessel, but can be built into the sides where, generally, plenty of space is available due to the broad beam of such vessels. Also, they can be closed off and emptied for transits. Free-flooding tanks are thus a viable option for the stabilization of offshore installation vessels. How effective are free-flooding tanks? The modeling of this kind of tanks is complex, because of the interaction of the tank fluid with the environment. The amount of water in the tanks varies continuously due to the inflow and outflow of water through the flooding ports. In the 80 s of the last century the US Navy were looking to improve the motions of their aircraft carriers, whose roll motion behavior had deteriorated as a result of upgrades over the years of service. They developed a prediction model in the frequency domain based on linearized ship motion theory and a regular wave input, which includes several non-linear effects to closer approximate the actual behavior of the water in the free-flooding tanks. In this study, this prediction model is programmed into SCILAB (a numerical solution program) and the model is evaluated for a pipelaying vessel. The input for the model is the hydrodynamic database from a 3 D diffraction program, in this case AQWA. The results show that free-flooding tanks are effective at reducing the roll motions of the ship for lift operations. Tuned tanks, where the tank transfer period is tuned to the ship natural frequency, perform better than untuned tanks, because for tuned tanks the tank moment lags the ship motion 90 ° at resonance frequency. To support the design of free-flooding tanks the influences of different parameters in the tank model are quantified. Also, an attempt is made to transform this model to time domain simulation in AQWA. The coupling of the tank, the ship motions and the fluid pressures is of high importance for the tank moment. Due to limitations in AQWA it is impossible to integrate the tank equation directly and fully with the ship motions and the fluid domain. To check the results from the AQWA simulation a simple time domain simulation was programmed in SCILAB based on the same assumptions as for frequency domain. The results from this simulation match the results from the frequency domain, because based on the same assumptions. It is questionable whether these assumptions still hold in time domain. Also, the motions during a time interval are not influenced by the motions before this interval in this simple time domain simulation. Consequently, the results of the time domain simulation {{have been found to be}} unreliable and time domain simulation must be addressed in a different way.
