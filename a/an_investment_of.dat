5|$|One World Trade Center is principally {{owned by}} the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Around 5percent equity of the {{building}} was sold to the Durst Organization, a private real estate company, in exchange for <b>an</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> at least $100million. The Durst Organization assisted in supervising the building's construction, and manages the building for the Port Authority, having responsibility for leasing, property management, and tenant installations. By September 2012, around 55percent of the building's floor space had been leased, but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014; the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8percent by November 2014.|$|E
5|$|A hangar {{was built}} at Bergen Airport in 2003, {{and at the}} same time the airline was {{certified}} as a mechanical aviation workshop. The following year, the Cessna 421 was replaced with a Cessna 441 Conquest II. In 2006, two Beechcraft King Air were bought, and the last Cessna sold. On 20 November 2003, Notodden Airport was closed for all scheduled traffic by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, due to a lack of safety requirements. Bergen Air Transport was forced to reroute all its aircraft to Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Following <b>an</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> NOK 500,000 from the airline and NOK 1.2 million from the municipality, which owns the airport, scheduled services commenced again. From 1 October 2004, NOK 250,000 was invested at Notodden Airport. Starting in October 2004, the airline also introduced security control of all passengers at Notodden Airport. In 2005, the company had a revenue of NOK 10.3 million; this increased to NOK 20.1 million in 2006, giving a profit of NOK 2.8 million, when the airline transported 2,841 passengers.|$|E
5|$|A {{more ambitious}} plan by Butlin was thought up {{on a trip}} to the Bahamas in 1946. Seeing {{potential}} for a camp in warmer climes, he formed a company under the chairmanship of Sir Bede Edmund Hugh Clifford and bought land in Grand Bahama. Butlin also purchased the Princess hotel in Bermuda and the Fort Montagu beach hotel in Nassau. The camp was intended to be complete and open on New Years Day of 1950. After <b>an</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> US$5 million (2011:£) the camp opened, still only partially complete, in the winter of 1949. To celebrate its opening, Butlin ran a mystery flight, where guests, who had paid $129 (2011:£) each, were taken on a flight to the resort without being informed in advance.|$|E

5|$|Developed in the 2000s at <b>an</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> US$2 million after IDF {{commitments}} for 1,200 units, some AIL {{jobs were}} believed to be in jeopardy following a mid-2005 announcement that the IDF would purchase 100 US sold Land Rover Defender-based MDT David. The announcement provoked threats of protests from AIL's management and labourers, who had recently faced the blow of local Humvee assembly ceasing due to budget considerations. The MDT David was chosen over the armoured version of the Storm because the heavy Storm was said to suffer from handling and reliability problems, safety hazards and limited mission operability. However the IDF said that the purchase of the David was to fill a temporary gap in production until the Storm II's testing was completed, and has since begun filling its commitment.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Luka Rijeka d.d., {{operator}} of the Port of Rijeka, {{signed a contract}} of strategic partnership with the ICTSI and Jadranska vrata d.d.. The partnership aims to expand {{the capacity of the}} container terminal to 600,000 TEUs. The contract also stipulates that the concession regarding operation of the terminal is to last for 30 years with <b>an</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> 54 million euro. It is estimated that ICTSI and Luka Rijeka d.d. will invest up to one billion kuna (135million euro) in the Port of Rijeka. Upgrades of other port terminals are also planned, with investments through the World Bank and through build-operate-transfer and public–private partnership schemes. They include cargo terminals in the city of Rijeka and the new passenger terminal opened in October 2009.|$|E
5|$|Manstein's first {{attack on}} Sevastopol in November failed, and with {{insufficient}} forces left {{for an immediate}} assault, he ordered <b>an</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> the heavily fortified city. By 17 December he launched another offensive, which also failed. On 26 December the Soviet troops landed on the Kerch Straits to retake Kerch and its peninsula, and on 30 December executed another landing near Feodosiya. Only a hurried withdrawal from the area, in contravention of Manstein's orders, by the 46th Infantry Division under General Hans Graf von Sponeck prevented a collapse of {{the eastern part of}} the Crimea; the division lost most of its heavy equipment. Manstein cancelled a planned resumption of the attack and sent most of his forces east to destroy the Soviet bridgehead. The Soviet forces were in a superior position regarding men and materiel as they were able to re-supply by sea, and were therefore pushed by Stalin to conduct further offensives. However, the Soviet troops were unable to capture the critical rail and road access points which would have cut the German lines of supply.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{funded by}} the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local {{supporters}} for £1 via an application form. In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies. After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after <b>an</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> £2,000. Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948, but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian, but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{the board}} {{a few days after}} the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began {{acquiring}} shares in the club; for <b>an</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> approximately £40,000, he accumulated a 54percent shareholding and took control in January 1964. When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; Martin Edwards went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980. Media tycoon Robert Maxwell attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price. In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton for £20million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the Board of Directors instead.|$|E
5|$|The New York Giants, an American {{football}} team which {{plays in the}} National Football League (NFL), have had a long, and at times turbulent financial history. The Giants were founded in 1925 by businessman and bookmaker Tim Mara with <b>an</b> <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> 500 US$, {{and became one of}} the first teams in the then five-year-old NFL. Mara passed ownership of the team on to his sons Wellington and Jack after the 1929 Stock Market Crash to insulate the team from creditors. At first the Mara sons owned the team in name only, but they took increasingly larger roles in the organization beginning in the mid-1930s. Tim Mara remained involved in the team's operations until his death in 1959, when his sons assumed full control of the club. After Jack's passing in 1965, his son, Tim, took over his share of the team.|$|E
