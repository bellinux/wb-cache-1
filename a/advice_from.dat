40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the needs of}} Dutch general practitioners on discharge medication, both regarding content, timing and the appreciation of pharmacotherapeutic <b>advices</b> <b>from</b> clinical pharmacists. Setting A general teaching hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Method A prospective observational study was performed. A questionnaire {{with regard to the}} content, optimal timing (including way of information transfer) and appreciation of pharmacotherapeutic advices was posted to 464 general practitioners. One reminder was sent. Main outcome measure Description of the needs of general practitioners was assessed. For each question and categories of comments frequency tables were made. The Fisher-exact test was used to study associations between the answers to the questions. Results In total, 149 general practitioners (32 %) responded. Most general practitioners (75 %) experienced a delay in receiving discharge medication information and preferred to receive this on the day of discharge. GPs wished to receive this information mainly through e-mail (44 %). There was a significant correlation (P =  0. 002) between general practitioners who wanted to know whether and why medication had been stopped (87 %) and changed (88 %) during hospital admission. The general practitioners (88 %) appreciated pharmacotherapeutic <b>advices</b> <b>from</b> clinical pharmacists. Conclusion This study indicates how information transfer on discharge medication to GPs can be optimised in the Netherlands. The information arrives late and GPs want to be informed on the day of discharge mainly by e-mail. GPs wish to know why medication is changed or discontinued and appreciate pharmacotherapeutic <b>advices</b> <b>from</b> clinical pharmacists...|$|R
