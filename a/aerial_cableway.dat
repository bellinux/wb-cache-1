25|$|The Alpha Cement works began {{near the}} Francis works in 1910 {{as part of}} the Thames Portland Cement Company. It stood about a mile from the river and {{included}} a Goshead <b>aerial</b> <b>cableway,</b> which ran alongside the road constructed by the soldiers of Cliffe Fort, then disused. Alpha continued after the closure of the Francis works, which it took over in 1934. With this amalgamation an additional railway was added in 1935 to replace the cableway, linking the works with the quayside next to the fort.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} years of the 20th century, several {{proposals}} were made to link Freiburg to Schauinsland. The extension of city tram route 2 on segregated track to Günterstal in 1913 was intended as the first section of a high speed tramway that would connect with a proposed rack railway to the mountain's summit. Other proposals included an <b>aerial</b> <b>cableway,</b> proposed by Professor Georg Benoit of the University of Karlsruhe, and a much longer adhesion railway from Freiburg Hauptbahnhof via Schauinsland to Todtnau. The outbreak of the First World War stopped any further progress on these plans.|$|E
500|$|At Aucanquilcha volcano {{there is}} some fumarolic activity, and sulfur {{deposits}} are found at the summit. Several sulfur mines lie in the complex. One mine {{at an altitude of}} [...] was opened in 1913 and remained in use from 1950 to 1992. It was the world's highest mine during that period. Originally, sulfur obtained at the mine was transported down with llamas. Subsequently, an <b>aerial</b> <b>cableway</b> was employed to transport the sulfur to the town of Amincha. To bring the sulfur down, a road network to the summit was constructed in 1972, although it is now impassable.|$|E

500|$|A mine at [...] {{altitude}} that yielded ore with 30% sulfur {{was opened}} by Julian B. Carrasco in 1913, who subsequently established the Compañía Minera y Azufrera Carrasco S.A in 1933. The sulfur was transported down first with llamas, later through an <b>aerial</b> <b>cableway</b> system and finally by trucks. The sulfur was then transported to Chuquicamata {{to be converted}} into sulfuric acid. The mine was active from 1950 to 1992. The last reported mining activity on the mountain was in 1994. In 1977 other sulfur mines were present to the west between Cerro Polan and Cerro Gordo {{and south of the}} main Aucanquilcha massif.

From 1915 it was expanded. The connection [...] to the Grotte aux Fées was built in 1935-36. The Ermitage battery of four 75mm guns was constructed in 1938-39, with further improvements to habitation during and after World War II. The artillery was deactivated in 1984, when the position was converted {{to use as a}} command post. By 1995 the fort was entirely deactivated. Routine access to the fort for supplies was provided by an <b>aerial</b> <b>cableway.</b>|$|E

2500|$|After {{years of}} study, the {{construction}} of a non-polluting mass transit system was proposed; the trolleybus was chosen as the most appropriate means of transport. Construction of the Mérida trolleybus system started {{near the end of the}} 1990s. The first line was inaugurated on June 18, 2007, with 15 of 34 proposed stations completed. This route serves Ejido and Mérida. The second line is in the planning stages and is expected to be [...] long with 3 common stations alongside or crossing route 1. Route 3, an <b>aerial</b> <b>cableway</b> (originally planned to be a funicular), is a [...] long route that will connect the community of Chama to a Mérida trolleybus station; construction has yet to begin. Once construction is completed, Mérida will be the first city in Latin America with under 500,000 inhabitants to have a rapid-transit system. The existing bus lines will be reorganized into 47 or so feeder routes, in order to provide better public transit to less-serviced areas.|$|E

After surveying the site, he founded a settlement there which he named 'Irvinebank', after the River Irvine of his birthplace, in Scotland. He used the latest knowledge and technology he had found in England, Scotland, Belgium and Germany, along with the finance raised, to develop the field and surrounding regions. John Moffat lived in Irvinebank from 1884 to 1912 and from there helped spur the development of north-eastern Australia by building mines, mills, smelters, towns, railways, tramways, <b>aerial</b> <b>cableways</b> and other infrastructure.|$|R
