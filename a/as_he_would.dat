5|$|According to Njal's saga, Bróðir {{tried by}} sorcery {{to predict the}} outcome of the battle against Brian. He augured that if the battle were on Good Friday, King Brian would fall but win the battle; but if they fought on any day before, all who opposed Brian would be killed. Brian was unwilling to fight on Good Friday, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not fight on a fast day, but the Danes forced the battle to the Friday, which fell that year on 23 April.|$|E
5|$|In January, Lee lost in {{the final}} of Korea Open to Chen Long, his fourth {{straight}} defeat by the Chinese. He recorded his tenth Malaysia Open title a week later. Soon after the triumph, he announced {{it would be his}} last Malaysia Open outing, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> assess his condition after the Asian Games and might retire if the results were not good.|$|E
5|$|Initially, de Peyster {{had been}} {{selected}} to lead {{an assault on the}} breastworks outside the city, however the night before the assault he noticed the city aflame from a signal tower and informed General Weitzel. The men of the corps then entered the city unmolested. Admiral David Farragut later claimed that de Peyster was due as much credit <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have received had he actually taken the city by storming it, because doing it without bloodshed still carried the same intent.|$|E

5|$|On July 14, Pineda was {{diagnosed}} with a partial tear of his ulnar collateral ligament and a flexor strain in his right elbow. Prior to the injury, Pineda went 8-4 with a 4.39 ERA. His season was ultimately finished <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> undergo Tommy John surgery, which he underwent on July 18.|$|E
5|$|The 1970 season {{started with}} Pearson {{competing}} part-time, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{for the rest}} of his career. Pearson led the Daytona 500 under caution with 13 laps remaining and changed only his right side tires in a two-tire pit stop. Pete Hamilton did a four-tire stop and passed Pearson after the restart for the victory. In 19 starts, he won a single race (Darlington) and earned two pole positions (Bristol, Darlington) to finish 23rd in points.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Dr. Marvin Monroe and Itchy & Scratchy; the latter had previously appeared in the shorts. It also {{marked the first}} appearance of yellow Smithers, who was drawn as an African-American in the previous episode. Eddie and Lou also appeared for the first time, although Lou was mistakenly animated with yellow instead of black, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> later become. Lou was named after Lou Whitaker, a former Major League Baseball player.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{moved forward}} <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> follow the vicar, then <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not, and in {{absolute}} perplexity whither to turn himself, went awkwardly to the door. Elfride followed lingeringly behind him. Before he had receded two {{yards from the}} doorstep, Unity and Ann the housemaid came home from their visit to the village.|$|R
60|$|The {{next few}} days he passed in {{considerable}} suspense. He did not dare go near Normanstand until <b>he</b> was summoned, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be when <b>he</b> was required.|$|R

5|$|A {{significant}} {{factor contributing to}} the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to add new elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> want to include portions of it in Duke Nukem Forever. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to {{a new version of}} the Unreal engine that was designed for multiplayer matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not have a plan for what the finished game would look like. At the same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired Bear Stearns to look into selling the company or merging it. Later that year, Infogrames Entertainment announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive. The publishing rights for Duke Nukem Forever passed to Gathering of Developers in early December 2000.|$|E
5|$|At a VCA {{meeting in}} April 1981, Loxton {{announced}} that he was severing all connections with organised cricket. He initially said that he was resigning for family reasons, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be moving to the Gold Coast in Queensland with his wife. However, he proceeded to give a blunt 15-minute speech, claiming that he had lost the art of communicating with the players and expressing his disenchantment with some aspects of the game, a reference to the declining player conduct. After relocating to the Gold Coast, he was unable to turn his back on cricket, and umpired matches at local level into his 70s. Although he became severely visually impaired, Loxton still attended matches and asked his companions to describe the proceedings for him; ever opinionated and blunt, he still offered advice to local cricketers.|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E

5|$|Balakirev's despotism {{strained}} {{the relationship}} between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|During 1946, {{the first}} full season after the war, Hammond played only 26 innings but scored 1,783 runs {{at an average of}} 84.90, topping the {{first-class}} averages for the eighth time in succession—still an English record as of 2015. At times, he began to show technical weaknesses. Captaining England to a 1–0 victory in a three-Test series against India, he scored one fifty, making 119 runs at an average of 39.66. He batted fifth in the order in the final match, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> in four of his five remaining Tests. Gloucestershire fell to fifth in the County Championship, and Hammond, after enthusiastically making the team very competitive {{at the start of the}} season, became increasingly affected by pain, particularly in damp weather. As captain, he could be irritable and consciously created remoteness and division.|$|E
5|$|Former Georgetown University {{basketball}} coach John Thompson had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{tell the story}} {{many times in the}} following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on Jim Rome's radio show, he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001. Thompson was planning to be in Las Vegas for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel {{on the day of the}} show. After a Rome staffer personally assured Thompson that he would be able to travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed his travel plans. He felt the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon.|$|E

5|$|Frost {{also met}} RAF Flight Sergeant C.W.H. Cox, who {{had volunteered to}} {{accompany}} C Company for the operation; as an expert radio mechanic, {{it would be his}} job to locate the Würzburg radar set, photograph it, and to dismantle part of it for transportation back to Britain. Derek Garrard of Jones' team asked Jones to obtain an Army uniform and identification number for Cox, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be the object of special attention from the Germans if he was captured in Air Force uniform, but the War Office were obdurate.|$|E
5|$|In {{these years}} Sargent tackled a wide repertoire, {{recording}} much of it, {{but he was}} particularly noted for performances of choral pieces. He promoted British music, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> throughout his career, conducting Handel's Messiah performed with large choruses and orchestras; and the premières of At the Boar's Head (1925) by Holst; Hugh the Drover (1924) and Sir John in Love (1929) by Vaughan Williams; and Walton's cantata Belshazzar's Feast (at the Leeds Triennial Festival of 1931). To popularise classical music, Sargent conducted many concerts for young people including the Robert Mayer Concerts for Children from 1924 to 1939.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{stressed}} {{that he would}} act as the trustee of the princes' commitment, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be serving as India's head of state well into 1948. He engaged in a personal dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of Bhopal, who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making Bhopal part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked up in his safe. It would be handed to the States Department on 15 August only if the Nawab did not change his mind before then, which {{he was free to}} do. The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal.|$|E

50|$|Santos was {{scheduled}} to face Rob Sinclair at BAMMA 7, however he {{pulled out of the}} fight, refusing to fly over from Paris <b>as</b> <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not make weight and knew <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not be able make the full amount of money from competing anyway.|$|R
5|$|Napoleon {{is shown}} to be <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been {{high up in the}} mountains, as a mortal and imperilled man. While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon impervious to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he really {{would have been in the}} situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Wales, Beadles played for his local side Newtown during the 1919–20 season, winning the Montgomeryshire & District Football League. The {{following}} year, he moved to Merseyside, where he turned out for amateur team Graysons of Garston of the West Cheshire Association Football League, an amateur side that represented a local shipping company, whilst also working for the company. Beadles often commented on his role at the company to family members, believing he was only employed due to his footballing skills <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> spend most working days making tea. In June 1921, he signed for Liverpool, {{one of the leading}} teams in the country at the time, along with teammate Danny Shone.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Alive or Just Breathing, Leach left the band for {{personal}} and health issues. Killswitch Engage quickly recruited Howard Jones to replace Leach. Jones would stay in the band for nearly ten years, until his departure in 2012, which prompted Leach to rejoin the band on the ten-year anniversary of Alive or Just Breathing. This is also the last album to feature Dutkiewicz on drums, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> switch to guitar before the touring process. The drumming position was filled by Tom Gomes.|$|E
