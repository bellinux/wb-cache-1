5000|$|A report {{published}} by the Federal Reserve Board reported [...] "This is possible because creditors generally have followed a practice of furnishing to credit bureaus information about all <b>authorized</b> <b>users,</b> {{whether or not the}} <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> is a spouse, without indicating which <b>authorized</b> <b>users</b> are spouses and which are not.

50|$|During {{the period}} that PDUFA III was in effect the FDA's {{requirement}} that drug companies pay user fees for 505(b)(2) applications to switch drugs from requiring a prescription to being sold over-the-counter became a source of controversy. The drug industry claimed that the FDA misinterpreted the section of PDUFA III <b>authorizing</b> <b>user</b> fees when deciding to charge for reviewing 505(b)(2) applications. Specifically, they said Congress only intended user fees to be paid on new indications for a new active ingredient and that switching a drug to over-the-counter status was {{an exception to the}} rule requiring user fees.|$|E
40|$|An "authorized user" is {{a person}} who is {{permitted}} by a revolving account holder to use an account without being legally liable for any charges incurred. The Federal Reserve's Regulation B, which implements the 1974 Equal Credit Opportunity Act, requires that information on spousal <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> accounts be reported to the credit bureaus and considered when lenders evaluate credit history. Since creditors generally furnish to the credit bureaus information on all <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> accounts, without indicating which are spouses and which are not, credit scoring modelers cannot distinguish spousal from non-spousal <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> accounts. This effectively requires that all <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> accounts receive similar treatment. Consequently, becoming an <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> on an old account with a good payment history, may improve an individual's credit score, potentially increasing access to credit or reducing borrowing costs. As a result, the practice of "piggybacking credit" has developed. In a piggybacking arrangement, an individual pays a fee to be added as an <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> on an account to "rent" the account's credit history. This paper provides the first comprehensive look at <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> accounts in individual credit records and how their importance differs across demographic groups. Our analysis suggests that piggybacking credit can materially improve credit scores, particularly for individuals with thin or short credit histories. We also evaluate the effect that eliminating <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> accounts from credit scoring models would have on individual credit scores. Our results suggest that removing this information has relatively little effect on credit scores, but may reduce model predictiveness. Credit scoring systems; Consumer credit...|$|R

40|$|A {{traceability}} {{scheme is}} a broadcast encryption scheme such that a data supplier T can trace malicious <b>authorized</b> <b>users</b> (traitors) who gave a decryption key to an unauthorized user (pirate). This paper first derives lower bounds on {{the sizes of}} keys and ciphertexts. These bounds are all tight because an optimum one-time use scheme is also presented. We then propose a multiple-use scheme which approximately meets our bounds. This scheme is proven to be secure as well as much more efficient than the schemes by Chor, Fiat and Naor. Finally, practical types of asymmetric schemes with arbiter are discussed in which T cannot frame any <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> as a traitor. 1 Introduction In such applications, as pay TV, CD ROM distribution and online databases, data should only be available to <b>authorized</b> <b>users.</b> To prevent unauthorized users from accessing data, the data supplier will encrypt data and provide only the <b>authorized</b> <b>users</b> with personal keys to decrypt it.

50|$|The {{system can}} also be used for client {{authentication}} in order to limit access to a web server to <b>authorized</b> <b>users.</b> To do this, the site administrator typically creates a certificate for each user, a certificate that is loaded into their browser. Normally, that contains the name and e-mail address of the <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> and is automatically checked by the server on each reconnect to verify the user's identity, potentially without even entering a password.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a fully k-resilient traitor tracing scheme that utilizes RSA as a secret-key rather than public-key cryptosystem. Traitor tracing schemes deter piracy in broadcast encryption systems by enabling {{the identification of}} <b>authorized</b> <b>users</b> known as traitors that contribute to unauthorized pirate decoders. In the proposed scheme, upon the confiscation of a pirate decoder created by a collusion of k or fewer <b>authorized</b> <b>users,</b> contributing traitors can be identified with certainty. Also, the scheme prevents innocent users from being framed as traitors. The proposed scheme improves upon the decryption e#ciency of past traitor tracing proposals. Each <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> needs to store only a single decryption key, and decryption primarily consists of a single modular exponentiation operation. In addition, unlike previous traitor tracing schemes, the proposed scheme employs the widely deployed RSA algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{security}} scope, Authentication is {{considered as a}} core model to control accessing any system. Password {{is one of the}} most significant mechanisms which diagnose the <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> from others. However, it is facing many problems such as spoofing and man in the middle attack(MitMA). When unauthorized user has got the correct password. Then, this user would be able to access into the data and change previous password which causes significant loss in efforts and cost. Similarly, the hacker "who don't have a password" is also trying to penetrate the system through predicted a set of words. In fact, both of <b>authorized</b> and hacker <b>users</b> work to input a wrong password, but <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> may have only one or two wrong characters while the hacker inputs a whole wrong password. The aim of this paper, established an algorithm under the name of "Confidence Range ". The main tasks of this algorithm are monitoring all the activities which associated with the password on time, error, and style to the <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> to recognize any suspicious activity. For that reason, a unique EPSB,” Electronic Personal Synthesis Behavior”, has been generated to the <b>authorized</b> <b>user</b> by the application of confidence range algorithm...|$|R
