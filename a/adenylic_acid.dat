50|$|Adenylylation, {{now known}} as AMPylation, is {{a process in which}} {{adenosine}} monophosphate (AMP) molecule is covalently attached to a protein side chain, altering the function of the protein. This covalent addition of AMP to a hydroxyl side chain of the protein is posttranslational modification that is stable and reversible. Adenylylation involves a phosphodiester bond between a hydroxyl group of the molecule undergoing adenylylation and the phosphate group of the adenosine monophosphate nucleotide (i.e. <b>adenylic</b> <b>acid).</b> This process can occur to molecules such as tyrosine residues.

40|$|The {{key role}} of ATP, a purine nucleotide, in the {{conversion}} of chemical energy into mechanical work by myocardial tissue is well established (1, 2). The requirement for purine nucleotides has also been demonstrated in the multiple synthetic reactions which maintain all animal cells in the steady state. Since the question immediately arises whether the purine nucleotides are themselves in a steady state, in which their rates of synthesis equal their rates of degradation, it seems reason-able to investigate first what mechanisms of syn-thesis and degradation may be operative. At present, there are three known pathways for the synthesis of purine nucleotides. The first is the synthesis de novo of the purine ring from small molecular weight precursors, such as glycine, formate, CO 2, glutamine and aspartic acid (3). The initial steps in this synthesis (4, 5) are as follows: 1. Ribose- 5 -phosphate + ATP 3 -> 5 -Phospho-ribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) + AMP. 2. PRPP + glutamine [...] 5 -phosphoribosyla-mine (PRA) + glutamic acid. 3. PRA + glycine + ATP- * glycinamide ribo-tide + ADP + Pi.

40|$|The {{authors have}} studied the acute effects of the {{intravenous}} and intia-arterial injection of the sodium salt of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in man. Rapid injection causes a frightening sensa-tion {{in the chest and}} hYperpnea. The changes found agree with those reported in cats and are con-sistent with the concept that adenosine triphosphate is a vasodilator in somatic structures but causes an increase in pulmonary vascular and possibly in splanchnic resistance. Its principal action seems to be pharmacologic ratheI than in its role as an intracellular metabolite. ALTHOUGH the important role of ad-enosine triphosphate (ATP) as a coen-zyme in transfer of high-energy phos-Dhnte is widely recognized, ' there is no available information on its pharmacologic effects in man. Increasing attention has been directed toward adenosine compounds since the dem-onstration by Drury and Szent-Gydrgyi 2 that adenosine and <b>adenylic</b> <b>acid</b> dilate the coronary vessels and lower arterial blood pressure in cats and dogs.

40|$|Part I: The {{leaves of}} nec rd (a single gene {{necrotic}} maize mutant) become necrotic {{when they are}} exposed to light for a few days. Extensive analysis has failed to reveal any difference in chemical composition between leaves of normal plants and of homozygous nec rd plants before any necrotic symptoms are visible (prenecrotic leaves). Treatment of nec rd seedlings with various metabolites (B vitamins, purines, pyrimidines, amino acids, etc.) did not prevent the appearance of necrosis. The rate of photosynthesis of prenecrotic leaves is normal at low light intensities but 20 to 50 % of normal at saturating light intensity. C 14 O 2 feeding experiments indicate that the carbon fixing reactions function normally in the mutant. Hill reaction rates are also similar in mutant and normal plants, as is the metabolism of labelled inorganic phosphate. CMU, which specifically inhibits photosynthesis to the extent of about 90 %, delays the onset of visible necrotic damage and reduces the severity of subsequent necrotic symptoms. It is suggested that the nec rd lesion is in some reaction associated with photosynthesis and that it causes the accumulation of one or more toxic substances. These lower rate of photosynthesis and damage cell membranes. The necrotic phenotype would appear {{to be the result of}} the breakdown of cell compartmentalization. Part II: The kinin, 6 -benzylaminopurine (benzyladenine), is converted to a number of low molecular weight materials by senescing leaves of Xanthium pensylvanicum Wall. (cocklebur). A major product is the riboside, benzyladenosine, which has been identified by comparison of its properties with those of benzyladenylic synthesized enzymatically using E. coli nucleoside phosphorylase and by degradative studies. The ribotide, benzyladenylic acid, also appears to be present. Labelled adenylic, guanylic and inosinic acids are produced, as are small amounts of adenine and guanine. Substantial amounts of label are also found in urea and in a ureide. Small amounts of labelled <b>adenylic</b> and guanylic <b>acids</b> are found in the RNA of the leaf, but benzyladenylic acid itself does not appear to be incorporated into RNA in measurable amounts.

Paper chromatographic analysis has indicated that uridine, uric acid and two unidentified adenine containing compounds are prominent constituents of this mixture. Uric acid and the two adenine containing compounds substantially increase the growth rate of small galls from which the larva has been removed while uridine has slight growth promoting activity. Various related compounds (e. g. adenosine, adenine and guanosine) also have growth-promoting activity.

40|$|S-adenosyl-L-methionine(SAM) {{activated}} the virus-associated RNA polymerase of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus in vitro. Synthesis of single-stranded viral RNA (mRNA) proceeded {{depending on the}} presence of SAM. A methyl residue of SAM was incorporated into an RNA molecule. A ribose moiety of <b>adenylic</b> <b>acid</b> in the 5 '-terminal region of the nascent RNA was methylated in the very early stage of the transcription. The dependence of the viral transcription {{on the presence of}} SAM and the methylation of terminal nucleotide suggests that the transcription of CPV is a "methylation-coupled " reaction...|$|E
40|$|The template-directed {{oligomerization}} of activated derivatives of 2 -aminoadenylic acid (paA) on polyuridylic acid (poly(U)) in aqueous buffers was studied. The reaction {{differs from}} that of <b>adenylic</b> <b>acid</b> (pA) under identical conditions, in that only di- and tri-nucleotides are observed as substantial products rather than a longer sequence of oligomers. The reaction of paA also {{differs from that}} of pA in that it does not require Mg (2 +), and is less susceptible to increased temperature. The relevance of these observations to the chemical evolution of polynucleotide replication is discussed. Improved syntheses of paA and its diphosphate are reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{stimulation}} by {{yeast extract}} of acid production in milk by various lactobacilli was studied. It {{was found that}} supplementing milk with purine and pyrimidine bases and amino acids allowed nearly maximal acid production by Lactobacillus bulgaricus strain 7994, L. acidophilus 4796, 4356, and 4357, and L. leichmannii 326 and 327. Further supplementation with deoxyribotides allowed maximal acid production by L. acidophilus 204, but L. acidophilus 207 required adenosine or <b>adenylic</b> <b>acid.</b> L. casei strain 7469 showed no appreciable response to the amino acids or purine and pyrimidine bases, and is presumed to require an unidentified factor in corn steep liquor...|$|E
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of 5 -fluoro- 2 ′-deoxy-β-uridine (FUDR) has been solved {{and the details}} of the molecular structure determined by x-ray analysis. The bond lengths and angles have been measured and are compared with the dimensions found for calcium thymidylate and <b>adenylic</b> <b>acid.</b> In all three compounds the bonds formed by the nitrogen atom involved in the glycosidic bond are not coplanar. Furthermore, it is found that in FUDR the C 2 ′ carbon atom is out of the plane of the ribose ring. The possible effect of these observations on nucleic acid structures is discussed...|$|E
