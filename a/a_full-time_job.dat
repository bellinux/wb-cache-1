5|$|An {{occupation}} of the pier was started by ten activists on the designated closure date. The campaign was boosted {{by the appearance of}} Chow Yun-fat early on the morning of 28 April to sign the petition, and to appeal pre-emptively to the police not to hurt protesters. Some activists, like Chu Hoi-dick, {{have been involved in the}} Star Ferry pier protest, and took turns to maintain a round-the-clock presence. Leung Chun-yiu spent three nights a week at the site, despite working <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>job,</b> vowing to block the demolition non-violently in any way he could.|$|E
5|$|In September 1972, 5,667 {{students}} {{entered the}} new state university, the largest opening day enrollment at the time. Previously, Miami had been the largest {{city in the country}} lacking a public baccalaureate-granting institution. Eighty percent of the student body had just graduated from Dade County Junior College (now Miami-Dade College). A typical student entering FIU was 25 years old and attending school full-time while holding down <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>job.</b> Forty-three percent were married. Negotiations with the University of Miami and Dade County Junior College led FIU to open as an upper-division only school. It would be 9 years before lower-division classes were added.|$|E
5|$|In late 1992 Takanohana {{announced}} his engagement to actress Rie Miyazawa, news which sparked a similar amount of coverage {{to the royal}} wedding held that year. However the engagement was broken off the following year, reportedly because Miyazawa was seen by Takanohana's parents and the Sumo Association as being unwilling to sacrifice her career to become a regular stable wife. The role of {{the wife of a}} head coach in looking after the stable's recruits and liaising with supporter's groups is regarded as <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E
30|$|In summary, the Italian {{labor market}} {{exhibits}} distinctive features. There is a disparity {{between men and}} women in the participation rate, mainly regarding married couples. Moreover, once employed, Italian women are much less likely to have <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>jobs</b> than in other European countries. In what follows, we bridge these facts to the Italian tax system.|$|R

5|$|In 1927, Nordale hired {{a recent}} University of Alaska Fairbanks {{graduate}} named Bob Bartlett. Bartlett {{had worked for}} the paper during school vacations, but he made journalism <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>job</b> following graduation. For four years, Bartlett was the only reporter (other than the editor) who regularly wrote local stories. In late 1930, Bartlett was made the paper's assistant editor in lieu of a raise that the paper couldn't afford to pay. Bartlett remained the paper's assistant editor until 1933, when he became the secretary to Anthony Dimond, Alaska's delegate to the U.S. Congress. Bartlett became the delegate to Congress in 1945, and in 1958, when Alaska hosted its first election for state office, Bartlett was elected one of its first two U.S. Senators.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Madonna {{was trying}} to {{establish}} her career in the music industry. She was the drummer of a band called Breakfast Club, which was headed by the Gilroy brothers, Dan and Ed. After their lead female vocalist left, Madonna was given {{the role of the}} lead female singer. However, she wanted to be the only female voice of the band, and opposed against the introduction of another female vocalist, Angie Smith. This led to a dispute between Dan and her, which resulted in Madonna leaving the band. She then formed a new band called Madonna and The Sky, but that also faced a major problem within a few weeks when its principal drummer Mike Shenoy, who had <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>job</b> and a fiancé, decided to leave the band.|$|E
25|$|The West Virginia Legislature is bicameral. It {{consists}} of the House of Delegates and the Senate.

25|$|From North Shields, she {{was unusual}} for a racewalker in that she stood at 4 foot 11 inches (1.50m). She joined her local {{athletics}} club in 1966 and soon began taking part in regional competition.

She was an amateur athlete and maintained <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>job</b> in the British civil service to support her sporting career.|$|E
50|$|A semi-{{professional}} {{athlete is}} one for whom sport is not <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> occupation. They are not amateur because they receive regular payment from their team (company), {{but at a}} much lower rate than <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> professional athlete. <b>As</b> a result, players may have (or seek) <b>a</b> second <b>full-time</b> <b>job.</b> <b>A</b> semipro player/team could also be one that represents a place of employment that only the employees are allowed to play on. In this case, it's considered semipro because their employer pays them, but for their regular job, not for playing on the company's team.|$|R

40|$|Using 2006 Canadian Census data, {{this paper}} {{focuses on the}} {{economic}} performance of highly educated immigrants who were born in less developed countries and who studied inside or outside Canada. There are two outcomes that are studied for immigrants and Canadian-born: access to <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> full-year <b>job</b> and earnings. This study finds that immigrants from all places of birth have a lower probability of having <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> full-year <b>job</b> than Canadian-born individuals and that, for most places of birth; immigrants who studied outside Canada have a lower probability of having such a job than immigrants who studied in Canada. People with more years of schooling earn more for both immigrants and Canadian-born, but immigrants earn less than the Canadian-born workers with the same educational attainment. Among the immigrants, some completed their higher education {{in their own country}} while others studied in Canada. The results show that immigrants who studied in Canada tend to earn more than immigrants who studied outside Canada...|$|R

A low-paid part time job in t− 1, however, still goes along with a higher chance of being high-paid in t than unemployment in t− 1 (0.299 vs. 0.233 — this difference is significant at the 10 % level).|$|R
25|$|A broad way of {{defining}} adolescence is {{the transition from}} child-to-adulthood. According to Hogan & Astone (1986), this transition can include markers such as leaving school, starting <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>job,</b> leaving the home of origin, getting married, and becoming a parent for the first time. However, the time frame of this transition varies drastically by culture. In some countries, such as the United States, adolescence can last nearly a decade, but in others, the transition—often {{in the form of}} a ceremony—can last for only a few days.|$|E
25|$|Membership in the {{legislature}} is best regarded as being <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>job</b> during the session and a part-time job {{the rest of the}} year due to committee meetings and hearings (for which legislators are reimbursed their expenses and receive a mileage allowance). A few members are on enough committees to make something of a living from being legislators; most are independent businesspeople and attorneys, although the latter group is perhaps no longer the absolute majority of members that it at one time comprised. In keeping with Tennessee's agricultural roots, some senators and representatives are farmers.|$|E
25|$|Until 2005, the {{position}} of Government House Leader was not technically a cabinet-level post, but rather a parliamentary office, so to qualify for cabinet membership, an individual had to be named to cabinet in some other capacity. For a time, with {{the position}} having evolved into <b>a</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>job,</b> Government House Leaders have been named to cabinet as Ministers of State with no portfolio specified. The Martin government created these positions so that the Minister of State title is effectively invisible. An amendment to the Salaries Act made this unnecessary by listing the Government House Leader as a minister.|$|E
