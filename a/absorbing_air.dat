PAL was the lone surviving airline, <b>absorbing</b> <b>Air</b> Manila and Filipinas Orient Airways. On March 10, 1973, PAL was re-designated as the national flag carrier. PAL continued its expansion {{with the arrival of}} its first Douglas DC-10 in July 1974. Three years later, the Philippine government re-nationalized PAL, with the Government Service Insurance System holding a majority of PAL shares. In 1979, the Boeing 727, the Boeing 747-200B and the Airbus A300B4, dubbed the [...] "Love Bus", joined the PAL fleet, while the PAL DC-8 fleet was retired.|$|E
50|$|While the R value will vary, most ocSPF {{products}} have an R value of around 3.8 per inch. Unlike medium-density closed-cell SPF, ocSPF {{is not a}} vapour barrier. When installed at 5.5 inches or more, ocSPF does act as an air barrier. It is often used for interior walls because it provides sound reduction by blocking and <b>absorbing</b> <b>air</b> leakage. It is usually only recommended for indoor applications.|$|E
50|$|President Ferdinand Marcos {{implemented}} a one-airline {{policy in the}} Philippines in 1973. Philippine Airlines (PAL) was designated as the flag carrier and became the lone surviving airline, <b>absorbing</b> <b>Air</b> Manila and Filipinas Orient Airways. Subsidies {{from the government and}} income from better performing routes allowed PAL to service smaller airports. When the airline industry was opened to new players in 1995, PAL continued service to some missionary routes until 1999, shortly after it went into receivership.|$|E

50|$|A “Jake Brake” is {{an engine}} {{compression}} release brake used especially for steep hill downgrades. The Jake Brake opens the exhaust valves when the piston is near {{top dead center}} (where ignition normally occurs). On the upstroke, the piston compresses {{the air in the}} cylinder to 1/15th its original volume, which creates drag on the engine. The Jacobs Engine Brake then releases the compressed air and the energy stored in it before it can push back on the piston during the down stroke. The Jake Brake turns a power producing engine into a power <b>absorbing</b> <b>air</b> compressor and in turn, causes the truck to slow down.Inside of the truck, the driver can choose how many cylinders to activate; the more cylinders activated, the more slowing of the truck.|$|E
50|$|Red mangroves, {{which can}} {{survive in the}} most {{inundated}} areas, prop themselves above the water level with stilt roots and can then <b>absorb</b> <b>air</b> through pores in their bark (lenticels). Black mangroves live on higher ground and make many pneumatophores (specialised root-like structures which stick {{up out of the}} soil like straws for breathing) which are also covered in lenticels.|$|R
5000|$|This {{stone is}} {{typically}} {{used by many}} architects and landscapers. Some examples of use are: tables, fireplaces, wall tiles, pool areas, columns, etc. A unique quality of the stone is that it <b>absorbs</b> <b>air</b> and humidly without causing expansion. Which means the stone can {{take a lot of}} moisture and humidity which is perfect for any outdoor or wet space.|$|R
5|$|After the war, the Command {{continued}} Anti-Submarine Warfare duties {{during the}} Cold War, {{to combat the}} threat posed by the Soviet Navy and other fleets of the Warsaw Pact. It ceased to exist in 1969 when it was subsumed into the newly formed Strike Command, which had also absorbed the former Bomber, Fighter and Signals Commands and later also <b>absorbed</b> <b>Air</b> Support Command, the former Transport Command.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1993, <b>Air</b> Training Command <b>absorbed</b> <b>Air</b> University {{and changed}} the command {{designation}} to Air Education and Training Command (AETC). AETC assumed responsibilities for both aspects of career development: training and education. Missions such as combat crew training, pararescue, and combat controller training, and (later) space training transferred to the new command, so that airmen would report to their operational units mission ready.|$|R

25|$|Living {{habits are}} varied; the family {{includes}} both bottom-foraging and midwater species. Callichthyids inhabit {{a wide range}} of habitats, from small, swift, oxygen-rich creeks to big rivers and flooded areas. Their habitats may even include swampy and muddy habitats where oxygen may be virtually absent. Callichthyids survive in these conditions by breathing air; air is collected at the water surface and swallowed. The intestines are used to absorb oxygen, and the air is expelled from the anus. The anterior digestive intestine packages digesta into a string of slightly compressed boluses, creating an air channel in the digestive intestine, thus allowing air to pass unimpeded. The posterior intestine is modified for respiration into a thin-walled and highly vascularized structure by reduction of the thickness of the epithelium, submucosa, and muscle layers; though highly modified to <b>absorb</b> <b>air,</b> it is inefficient for digestive purposes. Air moving through the digestive tract facilitates the movement of digesta to the rectum. Unlike other catfish such as loricariids or trichomycterids that may breathe air only under hypoxic conditions, callichthyids breathe air under all water conditions. Some callichthyids are able to <b>absorb</b> <b>air</b> through their hind guts to move short distances on land. Air stored in their digestive tracts also accounts for 75% of the necessary air for neutral buoyancy.|$|R

50|$|Despite the yarn {{durability}} sisal {{is known}} for, slight matting of sisal carpeting may occur in high-traffic areas. Sisal carpet does not build up static {{nor does it}} trap dust, so vacuuming is the only maintenance required. High-spill areas should be treated with a fibre sealer and for spot removal, a drycleaning powder is recommended. Depending on climatic conditions, sisal will <b>absorb</b> <b>air</b> humidity or release it, causing expansion or contraction. Sisal is not recommended for areas that receive wet spills or rain or snow. Sisal is used by itself in carpets or in blends with wool and acrylic for a softer hand.|$|R
60|$|I was one day sitting up-stairs, as usual, {{hearing the}} {{children}} their English lessons, {{and at the}} same time turning a silk dress for Madame, when she came sauntering into the room with that <b>absorbed</b> <b>air</b> and brow of hard thought she sometimes wore, and which made her look so little genial. Dropping into a seat opposite mine, she remained some minutes silent. Désirée, the eldest girl, was reading to me some little essay of Mrs. Barbauld's, and I was making her translate currently from English to French as she proceeded, by way of ascertaining that she comprehended what she read: Madame listened.|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} {{of the level of}} material and energy intensity is one of the strategies to limit the impact of the processes of urban transformation, in relation to construction technologies applied to new construction and building rehabilitation. The possibility of using high-performance materials allows design concepts based on the {{reduction of}} technical elements thickness, on a greater durability due to self-cleaning properties and resistance to environmental conditions, on the ability to <b>absorb</b> <b>air</b> pollutants and to ensure high insulating properties. Nanotechnology applied to architecture outlines a particular interesting scenario, introducing innovative qualities compared to characteristics and performance of conventional building materials and construction products...|$|R

These occupations, however, did not prevent his hearing the sounds of Barnstable's voice calling eagerly to young Merry. Bending his head towards the sound, Griffith beheld his friend looking anxiously up the main hatch, with a face grimed with smoke, his coat off, and his shirt bespattered with human blood.

25|$|Also in 2004, ANA set up {{low-cost}} subsidiary Air Next {{to operate}} flights from Fukuoka Airport starting in 2005, {{and became the}} majority shareholder in Nakanihon Airline Service (NAL) headquartered in Nagoya Airport. In 2005, ANA renamed NAL to Air Central, and relocated its headquarters to Chūbu Centrair International Airport. On 12 July 2005, ANA reached a deal with NYK to sell its 27.6% share in Nippon Cargo Airlines, a joint venture formed between the two companies in 1987. The sale allowed ANA to focus on developing its own cargo division. In 2006, ANA, Japan Post, Nippon Express, and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines founded ANA & JP Express (AJV), which would operate freighters. ANA is the top shareholder of AJV. It <b>absorbed</b> <b>Air</b> Japan's freighter operations.|$|R
