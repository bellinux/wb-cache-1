5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> large group of those gathered to shake their fists and yell {{so he could get}} a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E

The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E

5|$|Born in Tokyo, Japan, on July 5, 1968, Ito became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} four. He began to learn to play the piano, becoming interested in it after hearing piano music coming from a classroom he passed by daily with his mother. He was also interested in Electone music, but was discouraged from learning it by a piano teacher. By the time he began composing at the age of ten, he had learned to play alto saxophone, clarinet, and piano, and was interested in becoming a singer/songwriter. When he was close to graduating from college, he decided to pursue a career in composing music; when he <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> professor for advice, the professor recommended becoming a video game music composer, given the recent success in Japan of Dragon Quest III. During March 1990, after applying to several video game companies including HAL Laboratory, Ito began working at Square.|$|E
5|$|From 1–14 February 1945, Hartmann briefly led I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 53 {{as acting}} Gruppenkommandeur {{until he was}} {{replaced}} by Helmut Lipfert.

Hartmann attended the jet conversion program led by Heinrich Bär. Galland also intended Hartmann to fly with Jagdverband 44. Hartmann declined the offer, preferring to remain with JG52. Some sources report that Hartmann's decision to stay with his unit was due to a request via telegram made by Oberstleutnant Hermann Graf. Now Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG52, Erich Hartmann claimed his 350th aerial victory on 17 April, {{in the vicinity of}} Chrudim. The last wartime photograph of Hartmann known was taken in connection with this victory.|$|E

In 2002, Jackson was challenged in the Democratic primary by three candidates. Jackson claimed that state Sen.

The claim was that they selected 68-year-old retired Robbins truck driver, Jesse L. Jackson, as an opponent in order to confuse voters and derail the congressman's re-election campaign. Jackson <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> Cook County court to question the Shaws and others under oath, but his effort was rejected and no criminal wrongdoing was found.

5|$|Leading up to Turning Point 2007, TNA {{officials}} {{began to}} suspect Scott Hall would not {{show up at the}} event, as the last contact with him prior to the event was earlier that morning. TNA officials soon received word from Hall that he was suffering from food poisoning and {{would not be able to}} attend. As a result of the no-show, officials approached Samoa Joe and asked him to help take blame off the company for Hall's no-show and to help promote talent in TNA by giving an announcement before introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe's announcement went five minutes longer than originally planned, which upset several individuals in TNA. At one point during his announcement, he <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> person off-screen if they were angry and to go ahead and fire him, as he did not care; this individual was the legitimate president of TNA, Dixie Carter. After the event went off the air, a heated exchange between Kevin Nash and Joe took place backstage. The next night, TNA held a meeting and announced that anyone unhappy with their job could void their contract with the company. Senshi was the only one who wished to void his contract. During the meeting, Joe apologized for his actions at the event.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E
