5|$|Tesla Motors {{designed}} its Model S {{to allow}} fast battery swapping. In June 2013, Tesla announced their goal to deploy a battery swapping station {{in each of}} its supercharging stations. At a demonstration event Tesla showed that a battery swap operation with the Model S takes just over 90 seconds, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> it takes to refill a gasoline-powered car used for comparison purposes during the event. The first stations are planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California where, according to Tesla, {{a large number of}} Model S sedans make the San Francisco-Los Angeles trip regularly. These will be followed by the Washington, DC to Boston corridor.|$|E

25|$|Fresh {{pasta is}} usually locally made with fresh {{ingredients}} {{unless it is}} destined to be shipped, in which case consideration {{is given to the}} spoilage rates of the desired ingredients such as eggs or herbs. Furthermore, fresh pasta is usually made with a mixture of eggs and all-purpose flour or “00” low-gluten flour. Since it contains eggs, it is more tender compared to dried pasta and only takes <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to cook. Delicate sauces are preferred for fresh pasta in order to let the pasta take front stage.|$|E
25|$|A {{cordless}} {{electric screwdriver}} with supercapacitors for energy storage has <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> run <b>time</b> of a comparable battery model, {{but can be}} fully charged in 90 seconds. It retains 85% of its charge after three months left idle.|$|R
25|$|In navicular {{suspensory}} desmotomy, the ligaments {{supporting the}} navicular bone are severed. This makes the navicular bone more mobile, and thus reduces {{the tension of}} the other ligaments. It is successful <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R

25|$|When first introduced, CANDUs offered {{much better}} {{capacity}} factor (ratio of power generated {{to what would}} be generated by running at full power, 100% of the time) than LWRs of a similar generation. The light-water designs spent, on average, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being refueled or maintained. Since the 1980s dramatic improvements in LWR outage management have narrowed the gap, with several units achieving capacity factors ~90% and higher, with an overall fleet performance of 92% in 2010. The latest-generation CANDU 6 reactors have an 88–90% CF, but overall performance {{is dominated by the}} older Canadian units with CFs on the order of 80%. Refurbished units have demonstrated poor performance to date, on the order of 65%.|$|E
500|$|On April 24, 1931, Hornsby hit three {{home runs}} and drove in eight runs in a 10–6 victory over Pittsburgh. Hornsby played in 44 of the first 48games, but after a disappointing {{performance}} he only played himself <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{for the rest of}} the year. In 100games, he had 90RBIs, 37doubles, and a batting average of [...]331. He also led the league in on-base percentage (.421) for the ninth time in his career. The team finished 84–70, 17games back of the pennant-winning Cardinals, and four games back of the Giants.|$|E
500|$|Foraging {{distance}} from colonies has been measured at around [...] at South Georgia, offshore over the continental shelf, and anywhere from [...] at Marion Island. Macaroni penguins normally forage at depths of , {{but have been}} recorded diving down to [...] on occasions. Some night foraging does occur, but these dives are much shallower, ranging from only [...] in depth. Dives rarely exceed two minutes in duration. All dives are V-shaped, and no time is spent at the sea bottom; <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> on a foraging trip is spent diving. Birds have been calculated as catching from 4 to 16 krill or 40 to 50 amphipods per dive.|$|E
50|$|SFM would {{arrange for}} {{programming}} by giving {{part of the}} advertising to the movie companies, while the station would get <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> ad <b>time.</b> SFM would end up with 7.5 to 15 minutes of advertising time to sell for each 2 to 3 hour movie.|$|R

2500|$|This is {{analogous}} to the Old Persian cuneiform script, where vowels were most often written overtly but where consonants/syllables were decided by the vowel <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and, to a very limited extent, to the Etruscan alphabet, where most syllables based the consonant /k/ shared neither consonant nor vowel letter: Only the combinations CE, CI, KA, and QU were permitted. (This Etruscan convention is preserved in the English, not only in qu for queen, but also the letter names cee, kay, cue/qu.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Several tubes {{burned out}} almost every day, leaving ENIAC {{nonfunctional}} <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Special high-reliability tubes {{were not available}} until 1948. Most of these failures, however, occurred during the warm-up and cool-down periods, when the tube heaters and cathodes were under the most thermal stress. Engineers reduced ENIAC's tube failures to the more acceptable rate of one tube every two days. According to a 1989 interview with Eckert, [...] "We had a tube fail about every two days and we could locate the problem within 15 minutes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tesla {{designed}} the Model S to allow fast battery swapping, which also facilitates vehicle assembly. At a demonstration Tesla showed a battery swap operation taking around 90 seconds, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{it takes to}} refill an empty gas tank. In June 2013, Tesla announced plans to deploy Tesla stations, with facilities to support battery pack swaps, although by June 2015 Tesla {{said that it was}} unlikely that more battery swap stations would be added. Battery swapping was planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California between San Francisco to Los Angeles, followed by the Washington, D.C. to Boston corridor. Each swapping station costs [...] and stocks about 50 batteries. Owners can pick up their original battery pack fully charged on the return trip, which is included in the swap fee.|$|E

The associated traffic impact for the composite alternative is very short (only one night), {{as opposed to}} 12  days for the post-tensioned alternative. This is a big advantage, especially when the construction related lane closure would involve a major interstate highway in a congested metropolitan area.|$|R
50|$|<b>About</b> <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> during <b>the</b> {{first two}} days of GDC are given over to tutorials, one- or two-day-long {{sessions}} on a given topic.

30|$|Figure  16 shows clearly, with UTSM the {{inverted}} spectra {{have a large}} deviation {{with actual}} relaxation <b>time</b> spectra of <b>the</b> two samples. With LTSM and UASM, the inverted spectra are essentially coincident with actual spectra. Table  8 shows that sampling by using UASM takes only <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> lengths of <b>the</b> other two methods, so the vertical resolution can be improved effectively.|$|R
2500|$|Twin {{studies have}} shown that 80% of {{identical}} twins shared the same preference for the herb, but fraternal twins agreed only <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> strongly suggesting a genetic component to the preference. [...] In a genetic survey of nearly 30,000 people, two genetic variants linked to perception of coriander have been found, the most common of which is a gene involved in sensing smells. [...] The gene, OR6A2, lies within a cluster of olfactory-receptor genes, and encodes a receptor that is highly sensitive to aldehyde chemicals. Flavor chemists have found that the coriander aroma is created by a half-dozen or so substances, and most of these are aldehydes. [...] Those who dislike the taste are sensitive to the offending unsaturated aldehydes, while simultaneously may also be unable to detect the aromatic chemicals that others find pleasant. Association between its taste and several other genes, including a bitter-taste receptor, have also been found.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the input}} is a random permutation, the pivot has a random rank, {{and so it}} is not {{guaranteed}} {{to be in the middle}} 50 percent. However, when we start from a random permutation, in each recursive call the pivot has a random rank in its list, {{and so it is}} in the middle 50 percent <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> That is good enough. Imagine that you flip a coin: heads means that the rank of the pivot is in the middle 50 percent, tail means that it isn't. Imagine that you are flipping a coin over and over until you get [...] heads. Although this could take a long time, on average only [...] flips are required, and the chance that you won't get [...] heads after [...] flips is highly improbable (this can be made rigorous using Chernoff bounds). By the same argument, Quicksort's recursion will terminate on average at a call depth of only [...] But if its average call depth is , and each level of the call tree processes at most [...] elements, the total amount of work done on average is the product, [...] Note that the algorithm does not have to verify that the pivot is in the middle half—if we hit it any constant fraction of the times, that is enough for the desired complexity.|$|E

40|$|The {{formulation}} {{and implementation}} of an optimization method called Simultaneous Aerodynamic Analysis and Design Optimization (SAADO) is presented and applied to a simple 3 D wing problem. The method aims to reduce the computational expense incurred in performing shape optimization using state-of-the-art CFD flow analysis and sensitivity analysis tools. Results for this small problem show that the method reaches the same local optimum as conventional optimization methods and does so in <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> computational <b>time...</b>|$|R

60|$|For about a {{fortnight}} {{there were at}} work upon the job two German overseers, about a hundred Black Boys, and from twelve to twenty-four draught-oxen. It rained <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and the road was like lather for shaving. The Black Boys seemed {{to have had a}} new rig-out. They had almost all shirts of scarlet flannel, and lavalavas, the Samoan kilt, either of scarlet or light blue. As the day got warm they took off the shirts; {{and it was a very}} curious thing, as you went down to Apia on a bright day, to come upon one tree after another in the empty forest with these shirts stuck among the branches like vermilion birds.|$|E
60|$|The result {{justified}} Deerslayer's conjecture. Not {{long before}} the sun had finally disappeared, the two logs were seen {{coming out of the}} thicket, again, and as it drew near, Judith announced that her father and Hurry, both of them pinioned, lay on the bushes in the centre. As before, the two Indians were rowing. The latter seemed to be conscious that the lateness of the hour demanded unusual exertions, and contrary to the habits of their people, who are ever averse to toil, they labored hard at the rude substitutes for oars. In consequence of this diligence, the raft occupied its old station in <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that had been taken in the previous visits.|$|E
50|$|It's {{immediately}} {{clear that}} each of the two photons does not possess the property of being polarized vertically or horizontally, since the probability of passing, for example, a test of vertical polarization on the part of photon 1 is characterized by the coefficient of the state in which it has this polarization and the square of this coefficient is one half. Therefore, if one carries out this test, photon 1 will pass <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in an unpredictable manner. The same reasoning applies to the horizontal test and for the other photon.|$|R
