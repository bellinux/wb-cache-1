The events of 1968 convinced him that the <b>average</b> <b>American</b> was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics.

5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the <b>average</b> <b>American</b> may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the <b>average</b> <b>American</b> may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, 42% of all {{households}} and 76% of {{households in the}} top quintile had two or more income earners. As a result, there was a considerable discrepancy between household and personal income.

5|$|The {{median income}} per {{household}} member was clocked at $24,672 in 2005.

Personal income changes considerably over the life-time of the <b>average</b> <b>American,</b> from $28,000 at age 25 to about $42,000 {{at the age of}} 65.

Considering the fact that the <b>average</b> <b>American</b> does not have a bachelor's degree, he or she is most likely employed in the service, sales, and office support fields with many working in the professional support and business fields as well.

5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens of taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the <b>average</b> <b>American,</b> while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{findings}} in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by John Robinson's late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have {{four hours of}} leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays. Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest. During {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, watching television became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the <b>average</b> <b>American</b> had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television. Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study {{by researchers at}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the <b>average</b> <b>American</b> male. The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This {{may be due to the}} increased momentum of collisions from speed players.|$|E
5|$|While nine innings {{has been}} the {{standard}} {{since the beginning of}} professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took {{an hour and a half}} to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. By 1997, the <b>average</b> <b>American</b> League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters). In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete. The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently. Other leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.|$|E
