Previous three-dimensional simulations have shown th at such systems can develop turbulent-like fluctuations resulting from forward and inve rse cascade in wave vector space. We present {{a study of the}} transition to turbulence of such multiple current sheet systems, including the effects of adding a magnetic guide field a nd velocity shears across the current sheets. Three-dimensional hybrid simulations are performed of systems with eight narrow current sheets in a triply-periodic geometry. We c <b>arry</b> <b>out</b> a number of different analyses of the evolution of the fluctuations as the initia lly highly ordered state relaxes to one which resembles turbulence. Despite the evide nce of forward and inverse cascade in the fluctuation power spectra, we find that non e of the simulated cases have evidence of intermittency after the initial period of fast reco nnection associated with the ion tearing instability at the current sheets. Cancellation an alysis confirms that the simulations have not evolved to a state which can be identified as f ully developed turbulence.

40|$|The subject. The author's {{research}} methodology of social processes is represented, {{by establishing a}} bond between the ways of property organization and governmental form – especially its political regime. The analysis of methodology {{is based on the}} historical materials devoted to Russian statehood in terms of its transition states during the appropriate industrialization of domestic production. The results, scope of application. Since 1861, the Russian statehood during its existence has experienced a number of important transitional states, where the successful process of forming the traditional foundations of the corresponding society in different periods (pre- Soviet, Soviet and post-Soviet) in terms of the author's methodology was and still is untenable. The basis of this methodology is the existing relationship between the concrete way of property organization and its social function. Thus, a private way of property organization reproduces the function of social development. A mixed (corporate) way provides a function of social compromise (convergence). Finally, the common (collective) way of property organization can be determined by the function of social security. A concrete way of property organization <b>arries</b> <b>out</b> only a specific social function. An attempt to change this dependence leads the corresponding society to the destruction of the foundations of its existence. Thus, the liquidation (abolition) of the private way of property organization objectively forms the impossibility of realizing the functions of social development and the functions of social compromise (convergence) in the society by the common (collective) way of its organization. There is another aspect of the relationship between a particular way of organizing property and its social function. Each of the above methods of property organization, reaching a monopoly state that goes into rent, provides for self-destruction and transformation of its social function as opposed to: from development to degradation, from compromise to confrontation, from social provision of society to the provision of clans. A brief historical digression in the article makes it possible to disclose the content of this methodology when analyzing the facts of life of Russian statehood, including its latest history until 2017. Conclusions. The modern post-Soviet statehood in its various foundations: economic, political, social and cultural, when realizing the appropriate tendencies of segregation of the private way of property organization and the growing monopolization of state property, largely casts doubt on the future development of our society. </p...|$|R

The algorithms have originally been proposed for Parallel Multiple Context-Free Grammars (PMCFG), a super lass to LMCFG, by Peter Ljunglöf. LMCFG is a Mildly Context-Sensitive Grammar formalism. The implementations {{are part of}} the work being <b>arried</b> <b>out</b> for the TALK proje t at the departements of Linguisti s at Göteborg University and Computing S ien e at Chalmers University of Te hnology and Göteborg Univerity. The Language Te hnology Group at Chalmers is urrently ondu ting resear h round the grammar formalism Grammati al Framework (GF). The important sub lass ontext-free GF is equivalent to PMCFG. This implies that a subset of the ontext-free GF grammars an be parsed as equivalent LMCFG grammars. Four dierent algorithms for parsing LMCFG are implemented, using dedu tive agenda-driven hart-parsing. The rst algorithm is a straightforward bottom-up strategy om-bining items with smaller over of the input string to items with larger over. The se ond algorithm uses a ontext-free approximation and then re overs the resulting hart. The third algorithm is an a tive algorithm with Earley and Kilbury predi tion. And the last algorithm is in remental. The algorithms have not been thoroughly tested as part of the work presented here. However, preliminary testing indi ate that they seem faster than the existing parser for GF.

ICT is a vital tool for SME development as per the previous researchers and this service is currently offered by fixed wireless operators using WiMAX technology. However, the initial WiMAX based product and services launched targeting SME customers did not move well as expected, though pre-launch market surveys suggested otherwise. In addition, too many inconsistencies exist about the understanding of the SME environment since little empirical research has been carried out even globally. Hence, the research wa <b>arried</b> <b>out</b> to identify key success factors for promoting WiMAX technology for Sri Lankan small industries which is a sub sector of SME. The factors that influence small industry's intention to use the ICT services delivered via WiMAX technology were found by statistically analyzing the data gathered through the survey instrument. Further, regulatory and technological factors which affect the deployment of this technology were derived by qualitatively analyzing the responses received for the structured questionnaire distributed to telecom operators and the regulator. The result of this study indicates that the need for voice service, initial cost, quality of the installation, quality of the service delivered, quality of the maintenance and ease of use significantly affect the user's intention to adopt the ICT services. Further, cost of WiMAX CPE, high maintenance cost, subsequent operational cost and the vendor support have an impact on the deployment of this technology. The telecom regulator too can contribute immensely for the success of WiMAX technology in Sri Lanka by creating the environment for deploying mobile variant of the WiMAX technology, and provisioning required license amendments to offer NGN type services...|$|E

The weakness of the industrial relationship {{is caused by the}} units independetly. This is different from the industry which is based on community concept emphasizing a main priority to close inter relationship between the units. This research was <b>arried</b> <b>out</b> in Trangsan, Gatak, Sukoharjo, Central Java. Where there is a industrial community which has been a close inter relationship since long time ago. The goal of this research is to know the type and the nature of unit inter relationship in rattan industrial community in Trangsan, and know the strategy how it faced a nationally economical crisis. This research used a survei method. The number of the population was 110 entrepreneurs from Trangsan. The sample was obtained with stratied into three categories, based on number of labour force. Every category was taken 20 % as sample based on homogeneity sample, ana the respondent was examined with random sampling. The collected data were presented in frequency and cross table. The analysis of qualitative data used logical rationale, deductive – inductive, analogy and comparison, while the analysis of quantitative data used the analysis of frequency and cross table. The use of these two analysis {{was the result of the}} research. These are the result of the research: 1) a inter relationship among small – scalled businesses; 2) there is a weak inter relationship between small and medium scaled industries; 3) the business inter relationship of rattan industries is subcontract in which a part of the big scaled industry’s job is reponsible for the small saled one; 4) the form of the business inter relationship is cooperative; 5) the main strategy of rattan industry community to face nationally economical orisis strengthens their business inter relationship...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{pyrolysis}} {{is one of}} the renewable technologies where {{waste tyre}} and tube were pyrolysed into fuel oil, carbon lack, and combustible gas under the action of reasonable technological conditions. This technology could not only reasonably and effectively dispose waste tyre and tube without pollution, but also is effective in producing fuel that can reduce energy crisis. In the present work, thermal pyrolysis of waste bicycle tyre and tube samples were <b>arried</b> <b>out</b> in a semi batch reactor made up of stainless steel ithin the temperature range of 450 ºC to 800 ºC. The optimum yrolytic oil of 49. 6 %was obtained at 600 ºC for tyreand 9. 65 % for tube at 700 ºC. Again to increase further oil ield, different catalysts have been used. e. SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3, Kaolin, CaO, and MgO. But, it was identified that theatalyticpyrolysis was not effective when compared to thermal pyrolysis in terms of product yields (oil). The physical properties of the oil obtained were determined by using standard test methods and the chemical composition was analyzed by using FTIR, GC-MS analyzer. The char obtained was characterized for its calorific value and surface morphology by SEM. Characterization of both pyrolytic oil shows that the obtained oil is a mixture of diesel and gasoline. The composition of the oil showed the presence of aromatic and aliphatic compounds. Kinetic parameters of tyre and tube sample were also studied at the heating rates of 10, 15 and 20 ºC/min by TGA which showed that with the increase of rate of heatingactivation energy decreases. Engine performance test was done by using different blends such as 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of bicycle tubepyrolyticoil with diesel. Performance, emission and combustion characteristics of the diesel engine were tudied. From engine test it was concluded that 40 % blend of tube pyrolytic oil with diesel can be substituted with diesel. After proper treatment these oil can be used as substitute of alternative fuel...|$|E

A comparison of voltammetric instrumentation (voltammetric in situ profiling (VIP) system versus Hanging Mercury Drop Electrode with potentiostat) highlighted the advantage of high resolution measurements (ca. 20 - 60 min intervals) for environmental studies and the minimisation of artefacts associated with discrete sampling methodologies. Field-based studies were carried out in two contrasting estuaries in SW England, one heavily impacted with metal contaminants (Fal Estuary) and another subject to greater variety of anthropogenic influences (Tamar Estuary). High resolution in situ trace metal speciationm easurementsc, <b>arried</b> <b>out</b> over tidal cycles, identified important information on the temporal and spatial distributions of biologically relevant dynamic (< 4 nm) metal species of Cd, Pb and Cu. Variation in embryo-larval responses to discrete samples from these estuaries, effectively paralleled the metal speciation measurements showing enhanced toxicity when the marine water influence was at its lowest. In both systems, the results indicated that the combined effect of the metals studied was likely to have provided a significant contribution to the bioassay response. However, the difficulty in de-coupling the speciation measurements with biological responses was evident and supports the need for more comprehensive campaigns to study the impact of contaminants on ecosystem functioning. Bioassay and metal speciation analysis techniques were complementary, exhibiting high sensitivity and rapid responses, and would be considered effective screening tools for waters subject to intermittent inputs of metal contaminants and areas with recognised pressures. The integrated approach has extended our knowledge of trace metal speciation in estuarine environments and their effects on the developing embryos of the Pacific oyster. This approach has the potential for wider application. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
