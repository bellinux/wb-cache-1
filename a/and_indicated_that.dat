5|$|In September 1974, Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam {{met with}} Suharto <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> {{he would support}} Indonesia if it annexed East Timor. On 11 November 1975, the Whitlam {{government}} was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, this {{experiment}} was repeated and a further three atoms of copernicium-283 were positively identified. The adsorption property was confirmed <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> copernicium has adsorption properties completely {{in agreement with}} being the heaviest member of group 12. These experiments also allowed the first experimental estimation of copernicium's boiling point: 84°C, so {{that it may be}} a gas at standard conditions.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 2010, {{the last}} album, L'OuvreTemps (The Time Opener), was published. With this album the authors {{concluded}} the entire comic {{series with the}} intention to prevent the series from becoming weak, or staggering behind newer comics. However, Christin has written a 270-page Valérian and Laureline novel, Valérian et Laureline: Lininil a disparu (Valérian and Laureline: Lininil Has Disappeared), <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> Valérian and Laureline will continue to live on in a yet unspecified form.|$|E

5|$|The Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{had opened}} the {{previous}} year, and proved a remarkable success in abstracting traffic from the parallel canal, <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> longer distances, not merely feeders to a harbour or from a colliery, could be dealt with, and everywhere business people were considering where a railway might advantageously be built next. When the Grand Junction Railway was authorised in 1833, {{it was possible to}} consider that railways might one day link central Scotland and the south of England.|$|E
5|$|Despite Mitică's {{association}} with Bucharest and his usual most common {{career as a}} state employee, several commentators have recounted {{that he may have}} been based on Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur from the town of Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern Muntenia). Matheescu took pride in this supposed connection, and, around 1939, argued in its favor in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded the rumor, <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal began {{a process}} of decolonisation and began a {{withdrawal}} from Portuguese Timor (later East Timor). Australians had long taken {{an interest in the}} colony; the nation had sent troops to the region during World War II, and many East Timorese had fought the Japanese as guerrillas. In September 1974, Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> he would support Indonesia if it annexed East Timor. At the height of the Cold War, and {{in the context of the}} American retreat from Indo-China, he felt that incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region, and reduce the risk of the East Timorese FRETILIN movement, which many feared was communist, coming to power.|$|E

5|$|In 1691, Arsenije {{struck a}} deal with Leopold I, who was Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary, whereby the Habsburgs granted the Serbs ecclesiastic {{autonomy}} and some degree of self-administration, much to the displeasure of the Roman Catholic Church and Hungarian authorities. Leopold recognized Arsenije as the leader of Habsburg Serbs in both religious and secular affairs, <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> this power would be held by all future Archbishops. In 1712, Sremski Karlovci became the Patriarchate for Serbs living in the Habsburg Empire.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2008, the RCMP {{ruled out}} laying {{criminal}} charges {{in relation to}} the accident. It stated that the finding had been reviewed by a Crown prosecutor and that no wrongdoing was found. The families of two of the deceased expressed disapproval of the decision <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> they may bring a lawsuit against several of the involved parties, though others have publicly stated that they accepted the decision. The chief coroner of the province stated that a provincial inquest was possible, though it would take some time to come to any decision on the matter. No decision on whether or not to have an inquest was made for over a month.|$|E
5|$|The TSQ-81 antenna only {{received}} {{minor damage}} during the attack, and the U.S. suffered no casualties. However, the only 105mm howitzer {{operated by the}} Hmongs received a direct hit, and was rendered ineffective. At around 20:20, Sullivan gave the U.S. commander at Lima Site 85 the authority to direct air strikes against targets on the lower slopes of the mountain, {{on the basis that}} the situation had become critical. About 20 minutes later, the 33-man North Vietnamese platoon began climbing up towards the U.S. facility at Lima Site 85. At 21:15 Sullivan considering evacuating all U.S. personnel from the facility at first light. However, officers of the Seventh Air Force contacted the U.S. Embassy in Laos <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> evacuation should only occur as the last resort, when the situation on top of Phou Pha Thu was no longer under their control.|$|E

5|$|At dawn, lookouts on Greyhound {{were able}} to {{establish}} that Victoria was a large merchant ship rather than a warship and Elphinstone was encouraged to resume the attack. Aalbers sailed shortly afterwards, his ships tacking away from the shore in line of battle ready for the British advance. In doing so, Pallas drew ahead of the next ship in line, creating a gap through which the British attack could be directed. At 05:00, Elphinstone raised French colours {{in an effort to}} confuse the Dutch officers <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> he wished to speak with the Dutch commander. Aalbers was not fooled, and when Elphinstone opened fire on Pallas at close range at 05:30, the Dutch frigate replied immediately. With the frigates engaged, Harrier cut between Pallas and Victoria, Troubridge discharging his carronades into Victoria and ordering his crew to fire muskets at the deck of Pallas. In response, Victoria and Batavier pulled out of the line to engage Harrier, which continued its fire against Pallas, while William, bringing up the rear of the Dutch line, pulled out completely and sailed for the coast.|$|E
5|$|Impressed by Rivera's pitching, Yankees {{management}} {{chose not}} to re-sign Wetteland in the offseason, opting instead to replace him as closer with Rivera. In April 1997, MLB retired the uniform number 42 league-wide to honor Jackie Robinson for breaking the baseball color line, although Rivera was among a dozen players allowed to continue wearing the number per a grandfather clause. Rivera's transition from setup man to closer in 1997 was not seamless; he blew three of his first six save opportunities <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> he was initially uncomfortable in the role. With reassurance from manager Joe Torre, Rivera settled into the ninth-inning role, and he earned his first All-Star selection with 27saves and a 1.96ERA at the midseason break. In the 1997 All-Star Game, he pitched a perfect ninth inning to collect his first save in an All-Star Game. That summer, he added a cut fastball to his pitching repertoire after accidentally discovering how to throw the pitch. Rivera finished the regular season with 43saves in 52opportunities with a 1.88ERA. His first year as closer ended with a blown save in Game 4 of the 1997 AL Division Series against the Cleveland Indians; with the Yankees four outs from advancing to {{the next round of}} the postseason, Rivera allowed a game-tying home run to Sandy Alomar Jr. The Yankees eventually lost that game and the next, eliminating them from the postseason.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, team-owner Per Berg {{stated that}} Lillestrøm SK {{would be in}} need of a new venue <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> one could be built at Kjeller, should the airport close. By 2007, the club's {{management}} was working on ideas to building new stadium, as the luxury boxes were all sold out and the club could not make more than NOK22 to 23 million per year on commercial income from Åråsen. In 2009, Lillestrøm launched itself as one of six candidate cities for Norway's joint bid with Sweden to host Euro 2016. This would involve building a new venue seating between 35,000 and 44,000 in Lillestrøm. The stadium would be built in modules, so the upper tiers could be dismounted after the championship and installed on other venues. The proposal was selected as one of four for the bid, but the bid was never sent. In January 2009, the club sold 25 percent of their ownership in Åråsen Eiendom, which is responsible for operating the commercial facilities at the stadium, to Lillestrømbanken, a local bank, for NOK9 million. The club retained full ownership of Åråsen Stadion AS, the company which owns the venue. In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players' Association among away-team captains, Åråsen was found to be the league's third-best stadium, with a score of 4.33 on a scale from one to five.|$|E

5|$|Land {{interaction}} during Krovanh's {{passage of}} Luzon significantly weakened the cyclone, and upon the system's reemergence into the South China Sea by 2000UTC on August22, Krovanh {{was classified as}} only a tropical storm by the JMA. Redevelopment was rather rapid following emergence, and just four hours later the storm was redesignated as a severe tropical storm. On August24, the storm began to develop tight banding and reformed its prior banding eye feature, which later organized into a well defined eye. Later that day Krovanh clipped the northeastern coast of Hainan before crossing the Leizhou Peninsula on August25. During this time, the JMA upgraded Krovanh back to typhoon intensity <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the storm was reaching a secondary peak in strength. The JTWC indicated a similar development as the typhoon traversed the Gulf of Tonkin. However, according to the JMA, Krovanh waned into a severe tropical storm shortly before the storm made its final landfall on Cẩm Phả, Vietnam at approximately 1500UTC on August25. Over land, Krovanh deteriorated rapidly, and both agencies ceased monitoring the system on August26 while it was well northwest of Hanoi.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen days the fleet slowly {{followed}} the coastline west, and then south. The casks brought from Cuba were leaking and the expedition was now running dangerously low on fresh water; {{the hunt for}} more became an overriding priority as the expedition advanced, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull close to the shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the day of Saint Lazarus, another city was spotted and named San Lázaro by the Spanish – it is now known by its original Maya name, Campeche. A large contingent put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats to fill their water casks in a freshwater pool. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. They were led amongst large buildings until they stood before a blood-caked altar, {{where many of the}} city's inhabitants crowded around. The Indians piled reeds before the visitors; this act was followed by a procession of armed Maya warriors in full war paint, followed by ten Maya priests. The Maya set fire to the reeds <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the Spanish would be killed if they were not gone by the time the reeds had been consumed. The Spanish party withdrew in defensive formation to the shore and rapidly boarded their boats to retreat to the safety of the ships.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{he was not}} as steadfast as his father, and was easily swayed by the {{officials}} at court. The early period of his caliphate was dominated by the vizier al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah. A very able man, he was also ambitious; he had plotted to assassinate al-Mu'tadid shortly before the latter's death, and now ruthlessly eliminated any rivals for influence over the new caliph. Thus al-Qasim ordered {{the execution of the}} imprisoned Saffarid ruler, Amr ibn al-Layth, when al-Muktafi, immediately after his arrival in Baghdad asked after his well-being <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to treat him well. Shortly after, the vizier managed to discredit al-Mu'tadid's loyal commander-in-chief, Badr al-Mu'tadidi. Badr was forced to flee Baghdad but surrendered after being promised a pardon by the vizier's agents, only to be executed on 14 August. A few days later, al-Qasim ordered the arrest of an uncle of the Caliph, Abd al-Wahid, a son of al-Muwaffaq, who never heard from again; and in September 903 al-Husayn ibn Amr al-Nasrani, a Christian secretary, whom al-Muktafi initially favoured and who opposed al-Qasim, was denounced and exiled, his offices being given to al-Qasim's sons, al-Husayn and Muhammad. Al-Qasim even succeeded in having his little daughter betrothed to one of al-Muktafi's infant sons, and his eminent position in the state was highlighted by the award, {{for the first time in}} the Islamic world, of a special honorific title, Wali al-Dawla. In the bureaucratic struggles of the period, al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah favoured the Banu'l-Jarrah and resisted the pro-Shi'ite leanings of the Banu'l-Furat. The leading representative of the Banu'l-Furat, Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Furat, only escaped death due to the vizier's own death in 904. Before his death al-Qasim had nominated as his successors either al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i or Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah, but the latter refused the post, and Ali ibn al-Furat quickly gained the favour of al-Abbas al-Jarjara'i and the Caliph.|$|E
