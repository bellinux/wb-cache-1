40|$|We {{present a}} new event ranking {{algorithm}} {{that applies to}} a <b>single</b> <b>document.</b> The rules of identifying events are defined first and then the event relation graph is constructed to represent the <b>single</b> <b>document.</b> Based on the adjacency matrix of the event relation graph, the method of ranking events for a <b>single</b> <b>document</b> is elaborated. Present experimental {{results show that the}} algorithm of ranking events can achieve satisfied ranking results with an average Recall of 74. 5 % and an average Kendall’ T of 0. 374 for 40 documents...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{methods for}} <b>single</b> <b>document</b> {{summarization}} usually {{make use of}} only {{the information contained in}} the specified document. This paper proposes the technique of document expansion to provide more knowledge to help <b>single</b> <b>document</b> summarization. A specified document is expanded to a small document set by adding a few neighbor documents close to the document, and then the graphranking based algorithm is applied on the expanded document set for extracting sentences from the <b>single</b> <b>document,</b> by making use of both the within-document relationships between sentences of the specified document and the cross-document relationships between sentences of all documents in the document set. The experimental results on the DUC 2002 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on document expansion. The cross-document relationships between sentences in the expanded document set are validated to be very important for <b>single</b> <b>document</b> summarization...|$|R

30|$|The {{algorithm}} {{performs the}} task of text summarization is called as text summarizer. The text summarizers are broadly categorized in two categories which are single-document summarizer and multi-document summarizers. In single-document summarizers, a <b>single</b> large text <b>document</b> is summarized to another <b>single</b> <b>document</b> summary, whereas in multi-document summarization, a set of text documents (multi documents) are summarized to a <b>single</b> <b>document</b> summary which represents the overall glimpse of the multiple documents.|$|R

50|$|VDP is {{a direct}} {{outgrowth}} of digital printing, which harnesses computer databases and digital print devices and highly effective software to create high-quality, full color documents, with a look and feel comparable to conventional offset printing.

Instead of producing 10,000 copies of a <b>single</b> <b>document,</b> delivering a <b>single</b> message to 10,000 customers, variable data printing could print 10,000 unique documents with customized messages for each customer.|$|R
