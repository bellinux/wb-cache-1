5|$|Cerium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role in humans, {{but is not}} very toxic either; it does not <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> the food chain to any appreciable extent. Because it often occurs together with calcium in phosphate minerals, and bones are primarily calcium phosphate, cerium can <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> bones in small amounts that are not considered dangerous. Cerium, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. Cerium nitrate is an effective topical antimicrobial treatment for third-degree burns, although large doses can lead to cerium poisoning and methemoglobinemia. The early lanthanides act as essential cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium alone are about equally effective.|$|E

5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as they make their way between these resources.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is not metabolized. It is cleared {{from the}} body by tubular {{secretion}} and excreted unchanged in the urine; metformin is undetectable in blood plasma within 24 hours of a single oral dose. The average elimination half-life in plasma is 6.2 hours. Metformin is distributed to (and appears to <b>accumulate</b> <b>in)</b> red blood cells, with a much longer elimination half-life: 17.6 hours (reported as ranging from 18.5 to 31.5 hours in a single-dose study of nondiabetics).|$|E
5|$|Molluscs {{have been}} and still are an {{important}} food source for anatomically modern humans. However {{there is a risk}} of food poisoning from toxins which can <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> certain molluscs under specific conditions, and because of this, many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. Molluscs have, for centuries, also been the source of important luxury goods, notably pearls, mother of pearl, Tyrian purple dye, and sea silk. Their shells have also been used as money in some preindustrial societies.|$|E

40|$|A carbon-cloth gas {{diffusion}} layer (GDL) displays better performance than a carbon-paper GDL under humidified conditions. A straight flow field displays better performance than a serpentine flow field. To investigate these phenomena, neutron radiography {{was used to}} compare the amount of liquid water that <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> test fuel cells. It was found that a larger amount of water <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> a carbon-cloth GDL than in a carbon-paper GDL. From the viewpoint of cell performance, the carbon-cloth GDL was less influenced by the accumulated water than the carbon-paper GDL. It is assumed that the broader pore distribution of a carbon-cloth GDL creates oxygen-diffusion paths even if water <b>accumulates</b> <b>in</b> the GDL. With a serpentine flow field, water <b>accumulated</b> <b>in</b> the corner and the gas bypassed the flow field. These phenomena are the main causes of performance deterioration with a serpentine flow field...|$|R

5|$|Prion {{aggregates}} {{are extremely}} stable and <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death. This structural stability means that prions {{are resistant to}} denaturation by chemical and physical agents, making disposal and containment of these particles difficult. Prion structure varies slightly between species, but nonetheless prion replication is subject to epimutation and natural selection just like other forms of replication.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of other}} species of caddisfly make nets rather than cases. These are silken webs {{stretching}} between aquatic vegetation and over stones. These net-making larvae usually live in running water, different species occupying different habitats with varying water speeds. There is a constant drift of invertebrates washed downstream by the current, and these animals, and bits of debris, <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> the nets which serve both as food traps and as retreats.|$|E
5|$|As enemies <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> the arena, {{the amount}} of safe space decreases. This, {{alongside}} the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move at high speed and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E

Contaminants that {{are found in the}} tissues of marine mammals include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of marine mammals.|$|E
5|$|During the infection, {{rotavirus}} produces mRNA {{for both}} protein biosynthesis and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus {{as early as}} two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought {{to be made by}} two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 24,000 {{metric tons}} of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest {{a wide array of}} this {{floating}} debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Np and atomic number 93. A radioactive actinide metal, neptunium {{is the first}} transuranic element. Its position in the periodic table just after uranium, named after the planet Uranus, led to it being named after Neptune, the next planet beyond Uranus. A neptunium atom has 93 protons and 93 electrons, of which seven are valence electrons. Neptunium metal is silvery and tarnishes when exposed to air. The element occurs in three allotropic forms and it normally exhibits five oxidation states, ranging from +3 to +7. It is radioactive, poisonous, pyrophoric, and can <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> bones, which makes the handling of neptunium dangerous.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{threatened}} by humans indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting {{is a significant}} cause of mortality in seals and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian monk seals, northern fur seals and brown fur seals. Pinnipeds are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals <b>accumulate</b> <b>in</b> these animals since they are {{near the top of}} food chains and have large reserves of blubber. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers, decreased reproductivity and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. Other man-made threats include habitat destruction by oil and gas exploitation, encroachment by boats, and underwater noise.|$|E
