5|$|Modern historiographical {{practice}} {{distinguishes between}} chattel slavery (personal possession, where the slave was regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> property {{as opposed to}} a mobile member of society) versus land-bonded groups such as the penestae of Thessaly or the Spartan helots, who were more like medieval serfs (an enhancement to real estate). The chattel helot is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner, who may buy, sell, or lease them like any other chattel.|$|E
5|$|Mici {{had been}} a student in Pittsburgh, and wanted {{to return to the}} United States. Her chance came in 1935, when, thanks to George Gamow, Teller was invited to the United States to become a Professor of Physics at George Washington University, where he worked with Gamow until 1941. At George Washington University in 1937, Teller {{predicted}} the Jahn–Teller effect, which distorts molecules in certain situations; this affects the chemical reactions of metals, and in particular the coloration of certain metallic dyes. Teller and Hermann Arthur Jahn analyzed it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> purely mathematical physics. In collaboration with Stephen Brunauer and Paul Hugh Emmett, Teller also made an important contribution to surface physics and chemistry: the so-called Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm. Teller and Mici became naturalized citizens of the United States on March 6, 1941.|$|E
5|$|The Malay Archipelago {{attracted}} many reviews, {{with interest}} from scientific, geographic, church and general periodicals. Reviewers noted and sometimes disagreed with various of his theories, especially {{the division of}} fauna and flora along what soon {{became known as the}} Wallace line, natural selection and uniformitarianism. Nearly all agreed that he had provided an interesting and comprehensive account of the geography, natural history, and peoples of the archipelago, which was little known to their readers at the time, and that he had collected an astonishing number of specimens. The book is much cited, and is Wallace's most successful, both commercially and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> literature.|$|E

5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} is very thin {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, {{computer}} store owner, {{was killed}} in 1985 by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed {{in the parking lot}} of his store. A similar attack against a computer store occurred in Salt Lake City, Utah, on February 20, 1987. The bomb, which was disguised <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> lumber, injured Gary Wright when he attempted to remove it from the store's parking lot. The explosion severed nerves in Wright's left arm and propelled more than 200 pieces of shrapnel into his body. Kaczynski's brother, David—who would play a vital role in Kaczynski's capture by alerting federal authorities to the prospect of his brother's involvement in the Unabomber cases—sought out and became friends with Wright after Kaczynski was detained in 1996. David Kaczynski and Wright have remained friends and occasionally speak together publicly about their relationship.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{ceiling was}} redesigned, with Michelson taking {{structural}} inspiration from a jet engine fan. Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling {{to give the}} bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble functioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> sophisticated equipment designed to inform {{the captain of the}} ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS Enterprise Flight Manual as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat-sensitive plates. The wattage of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25watts to 6watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed. For the science station, two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled into the walls when not in use, but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered {{it would be easier to}} move them by hand.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} the tube map <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> {{information}} design has led to many imitations of its format. What is probably the earliest example is the Sydney Suburban and City Underground railway map of 1939. Not only does it follow Beck's styling cues, but in size, design and layout it is a near-clone to the London map of the late 1930s, {{right down to the}} use of the Underground roundel.|$|E
25|$|Candace Morales, a {{graduate}} student pursuing a Masters of Science in Education while concentrating in Reading, proposes that in a curriculum that utilizes Bless Me Ultima <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> multicultural literature, it must be timed appropriately. Specifically, she suggests teaching it to middle schoolers so {{that they have a}} diverse lens (that of a Chicano/a culture) to view their own development; to Morales, Antonio’s own pursuit of “knowledge, truth, and personal identity” will resonate with the students as well.|$|E

25|$|By 1845, {{all that}} was left of the Stourbridge Lion was its boiler. The boiler was still functional, however, and it was used in a foundry in Carbondale for about another five years until the foundry's owner headed west to try his luck as a Forty-niner. The foundry was sold a few years later to new owners who {{recognized}} the boiler's value <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> history, and reportedly tried to sell it for $1,000 (equal to $ today) in 1874. The owners weren't able to find a buyer so they hung onto it themselves.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, with {{producer}} and friend Joanna Scanlan, Swinton developed a performance/installation live art {{piece in the}} Serpentine Gallery, London, where she was on display {{to the public for}} a week, asleep or apparently so, in a glass case, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> performance art. The piece is sometimes wrongly credited to Cornelia Parker, whom Swinton invited to collaborate for the installation in London. The performance, entitled The Maybe, was repeated in 1996 at the Museo Barracco in Rome and in 2013 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.|$|E
25|$|Sleddale Hall {{was offered}} for sale in January 2009; a trust has been created by fans who wish collectively to {{purchase}} the building for its preservation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> British film history. It was sold at auction for £265,000 on 16 February 2009. The starting price was £145,000. It was bought by Sebastian Hindley, who owns the Mardale Inn in the nearby village of Bampton, which did not feature in the film. Hindley was unable to raise the necessary finances and in August 2009 the property was resold for an undisclosed sum to Tim Ellis, an architect from Kent, whose original bid failed at the auction.|$|E

25|$|The Sneinton Dragon {{is a large}} {{sculpture}} {{that stands}} at the junction of Colwick Loop Road and Sneinton Hermitage. Made from stainless steel, it was created by local craftsman Robert Stubley after residents of Sneinton were asked by the Renewal Trust what {{they would like to}} see <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> public art to represent their area. It was commissioned by Nottingham City Council and was unveiled on 21 November 2006. The dragon stands 7 feet tall, has a wingspan of 15 feet and took 3 months to finish. During the Christmas period the dragon receives a Santa hat, which often disappears within days. There also are three other sculptures in Sneinton.|$|E
25|$|The {{uniformity}} of BR branding continued until {{the process of}} sectorisation {{was introduced in the}} 1980s. Certain BR operations such as Inter-City, Network SouthEast or Railfreight began to adopt their own identities, introducing logos and colour schemes which were essentially variants of the British Rail brand. Eventually, as sectorisation developed into a prelude to privatisation, the unified British Rail brand disappeared, with the notable exception of the Double Arrow symbol, which has survived to this day and serves as a generic trademark to denote railway services across Great Britain. The BR Corporate Identity Manual is noted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> British design history and there are plans for it to be re-published.|$|E
25|$|Valerie Sinatra (Rebecca Front) – travel correspondent. The Scottish-accented Sinatra {{works in}} The Day Today travel pod, perched {{at the top}} of a tower looming a full mile above the centre of Great Britain. The traffic reports cover strange traffic accidents, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> pie {{blocking}} the road and coverage of an ongoing crash that has been in progress south of Newcastle upon Tyne for several weeks; police marksmen to shoot speeding drivers in the chin; as well as general traffic reports including a claim that workers have finished cobbling the M25.

25|$|Don DeLillo, {{who rose}} to {{literary}} prominence {{with the publication}} of his 1985 novel, White Noise, a work broaching the subjects of death and consumerism and doubling <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> comic social criticism, began his writing career in 1971 with Americana. He is listed by Harold Bloom as being among the preeminent contemporary American writers, in the company of such figures as Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, and Thomas Pynchon. His 1997 novel Underworld chronicles American life through and immediately after the Cold War and is usually considered his masterpiece. It was also the runner-up in a survey that asked writers to identify the most important work of fiction of the last 25 years. Among his other important novels are Libra (1988), Mao II (1991) and Falling Man (2007).|$|E
25|$|Trace {{amounts of}} {{explosive}} residue were detected on three samples of material from three separate {{locations of the}} recovered airplane wreckage (described by the FBI <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> canvas-like material and two pieces of a floor panel). These samples were submitted to the FBI's laboratory in Washington, D.C., which determined that one sample contained traces of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), another nitroglycerin, and the third a combination of RDX and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN); these findings received much media attention at the time. In addition, the backs of several damaged passenger seats were observed to have an unknown red/brown-shaded substance on them. According to the seat manufacturer, the locations and appearance of this substance were consistent with adhesive used {{in the construction of}} the seats, and additional laboratory testing by NASA identified the substance as being consistent with adhesives.|$|E
25|$|A show of gladiators {{was to be}} {{exhibited}} {{before the}} people in the market-place, and most of the magistrates erected scaffolds round about, with an intention of letting them for advantage. Caius commanded them to take down their scaffolds, that the poor people might see the sport without paying anything. But nobody obeying these orders of his, he gathered together a body of labourers, who worked for him, and overthrew all the scaffolds the very night before the contest was to take place. So that by the next morning the market-place was cleared, and the common people had an opportunity of seeing the pastime. In this, the populace thought he had acted the part of a man; but he much disobliged the tribunes his colleagues, who regarded it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> violent and presumptuous interference.|$|E
