50|$|Unofficial {{currency}} substitution or de facto {{currency substitution}} {{is the most}} common type of currency substitution. Unofficial currency substitution occurs when residents of a country choose to hold a significant share of their financial <b>assets</b> <b>in</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>currency,</b> even though the foreign currency is not legal tender there. They hold deposits in the foreign currency because of a bad track record of the local currency, or as a hedge against inflation of the domestic currency.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} some long-run {{aspects of}} the Swiss balance of payments, highlighting two macroeconomic phenomena that make Switzerland stand out among other countries: first, it has had a persistent current account surplus and the largest ratio of net foreign assets to GDP in the world; second, its real interest rates have been significantly {{lower than those of}} most other industrialized countries, earning it the label “interest rate island”. These two distinctive features may be related, and ultimately both may result from an excess of national savings over investment for many years. The real interest differential may largely be attributed to a foreign exchange rate risk premium, which compensates Swiss residents for holding net <b>assets</b> <b>in</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> and foreign residents for bearing net liabilities in Swiss francs. ...|$|E
40|$|Dollarization, {{which can}} be {{considered}} as a wide-spread characteristic of the emerging market economies, is caused by economic units’ holding <b>assets</b> <b>in</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> to prevent the value of their financial assets from the risk of devaluation of the national currency and to diversify their portfolio when the asset side of the balance sheets is considered. On the other hand, when the liability side of the balance sheets are considered, firms’, households’ and the government’s borrowing in foreign currency both from domestic and foreign sources causes dollarization. This paper constructs asset, liability and composite dollarization indices as indicators of the lasting dollarization process in Turkey, proposing measures for the degree of dollarization of the Turkish economy. All indices justify the success of the stabilization program that has been conducted since 2002, in reversing the dollarization trend. composite dollarization index, asset dollarization, liability dollarization...|$|E

This result implies that the main reason for the depreciation of the yen is the weak Japanese demand. If the Japanese domestic demand expands further, the yen rate will appreciate more...|$|R

Then, we incorporate these features of international financial integration in a simple general equilibrium model and analyze how they affect the international transmission of monetary shocks. We find that financial integration is a central component of the model, with the valuation gains from an exchange rate depreciation leading to a welfare effect that is at least as large as that stemming from nominal rigidities alone but possibly much larger. We characterize how interdependence is affected by the composition of the portfolio across asset categories and how structural features of the model interact with financial integration.

40|$|There {{are four}} factors {{involved}} in the current financial crisis in Asia that have caused surprise. Since the Latin American debt crisis was {{thought to have been}} aggravated by the dominance of syndicated private bank lending, borrowers were encouraged to increase private direct investment flows. The stability of capital flows to Asia was used as an example. Yet, the Asian crisis appears to have been precipitated by the reversal of short-term private bank lending. Second, the flows of capital to Asia have been used as example of the benefits of free international capital markets in directing resources to the most productive uses. Yet, {{in the aftermath of the}} crisis it appears that total returns on equity investments in Asia have in fact been lower than in most other regions throughout the 1 990 s. Third, it appears that in a number of Asian countries, the majority of the international lending was between foreign and domestic banks. It has been suggested that the major cause of the crisis is unsafe lending practices by the Asian banks permitted by inadequate national prudential supervision. Yet, these economies were the most advanced on the road to market liberalisation. One of the cardinal principles of financial liberalisation, formed in the aftermath of the Chilean crisis, is that the creation of institutional structures ensuring the stability of the financial system should precede financial market liberalisation. Indeed, many countries were following this advice. It is interesting to note that the lending banks were generally large, global banks who employ highly sophisticated risk assessment procedures. Yet, they appear to have continued lending well after the increased risks in the region were generally apparent. This suggests that even the most sophisticated operators in global financial markets have difficulties in assessing risk, and that their regulators were no more successful in imposing prudent limits. Finally, private portfolio and direct investment flows were considered to be preferable to syndicated bank lending because they were thought to segregate the problem of foreign exchange instability from asset market instability. Syndicated lending was denominated in the currency of the lending bank, and the exchange rate risk was borne by the borrower; but direct equity investors purchase <b>foreign</b> financial <b>assets</b> denominated <b>in</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> and thus bears the currency risk. It was suggested that in a crisis the foreign investor would suffer first from a fall <b>in</b> <b>asset</b> prices, and second from a decline in the exchange rate, which would discourage him from liquidating the investment and reduce selling pressure <b>in</b> the <b>foreign</b> exchange market. Yet, the linkage between the collapse in exchange rates and equity markets appears to have been even closer in Asia than in other experiences of financial crisis. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} {{investments}} <b>in</b> low-risk <b>assets</b> denominated <b>in</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>currencies</b> and discusses theoretical implications {{related to the}} findings. Specifically, it looks at Japanese yen (JPY) and US dollars (USD). Chapter 1 provides some background information about the phenomenon called carry trade, which has been mentioned in the public debate about economic affairs in general and exchange rate movements in particular. Since the term carry trade is often used in a vague or undefined manner, I start out by gathering some information from various sources in order to present a short overview of what carry trade actually is. This {{is done in the}} first part of Chapter 1. I then continue by describing some aspects of the Japanese financial market in order to justify the choice of Japanese yen and US dollars for the empirical study made in the thesis. In the main part of Chapter 1, I go on to check whether uncovered interest parity (relating interest rates and expected exchange rate changes) are supported using the data on Japanese yen and US dollars. I then proceed to explore if there was a forward discount bias in the period 1993 to 2008 in order to look at uncovered interest parity from another angle. This is done by removing currency exchange risk through the use of forward contracts. My empirical findings do not support uncovered interest parity. In fact, the results are opposite of what the uncovered interest parity hypothesis suggests. In the case of uncovered interest parity, I find that when a currency gave a higher interest return than another, this tended to lead to an increase rather than a decrease in the value of the same currency over the same period. I also find that although shorter three-year periods within the 1993 - 2008 period exhibited mixed results, uncovered investments in USD three-month bonds tended to yield higher return over the longer 1993 - 2008 period when compared to similar uncovered three-month bond investments in JPY. I find that covered investments in Japanese yen gave higher return than similar investments in US dollars. This result is robust in the sense that it applied to the observed period 1993 - 2008 as a whole, and also to shorter three-year time-spans within this period. This shows that the forward rate was distorted, or biased. I relate this to the forward discount bias which has been described in economic literature. In the last part of Chapter 1, I discuss potential reasons for these findings and compare the findings to other studies by reviewing some of the literature in this field. I also look at the development of the Japanese financial market from the 1980 s. That review indicates that although the Japanese financial market may have been less liquid in the past than the US market, deregulations and reforms have made the markets more similar. Chapter 2 of the thesis goes a step further into a theoretical paradox called the Siegel paradox. The Siegel paradox describes investments <b>in</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>currencies</b> and predicts a forward discount bias. I study the Siegel paradox for currency movements by using a simplified example with USD and JPY. The rationale leading to the paradox is analyzed, and alternative ways of thinking are investigated by looking at a simple version of the two-envelope problem. I try to find similarities and differences between the Siegel paradox and the two-envelope problem in order to gain some insight into what may be the common cause of the two paradoxes. I find that Jensen’s inequality applies to both paradoxes. I find that the lack of a total value in the Siegel paradox and the existence of such a total value in the two-envelope problem may be one of the important differences between the two problems. In Chapter 3, I discuss the relevance of the findings related to the paradoxes in Chapter 2 to interest rate parity and the forward discount bias found in Chapter 1. I suggest that the Siegel paradox is a purely theoretical misstatement which does not explain the forward discount bias observed in the market. Rather, I suggest that the forward discount bias is the result of other rational choices made by investors, like a risk premium and risk aversion among the investors combined with tax differences, trading costs and differences in liquidity. I suggest that investors that base their investment choices on the Siegel paradox are probably allocating their capital in an inefficient manner. Finally, I indicate that further investigation should be made into resolving the Siegel paradox as this could possibly lead to a deeper understanding of risk, return and capital allocation in the financial markets...|$|R
