5|$|At {{the time}} of release in Denmark in 1886, critics from the daily {{newspapers}} were generally enthusiastic about Ved Vejen.

5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} {{the book for}} public educators as <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>contribution</b> to liberal theory. Their common criticism was based around practical applications and the imposition of autonomy as a value, e.g., her contemporary examples of national civics education, how citizens who disagreed with the focus on autonomy could be accommodated, and how a weak perfectionist state could defend marginalized group interests {{in a public school}} setting.|$|E

Sebum may act as a delivery system for antioxidants, antimicrobial lipids, pheromones, and hydration of the stratum corneum. The insoluble fatty acids contained within sebum have broad antimicrobial activity. Additionally, sebaceous gland secretion provides vitamin E to the upper layers of facial skin.|$|E

5|$|A convoy {{to return}} the 9th Division to Australia was {{assembled}} in the Red Sea near Massawa from late January to early February 1943. The ships began their voyage across the Indian Ocean on 4 February and, after refuelling at Addu Atoll, arrived safely at the Western Australian port of Fremantle on 18 February. Four of the transport ships continued to the Australian east coast, one docking at Melbourne on 25 February and the remainder arriving at Sydney two days later. After its return to Australia, the 9th Division made <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>contribution</b> to operations in New Guinea during late 1943.|$|E
5|$|His 1815 Polish {{translation}} of Homer's Iliad {{met with a}} negative reception. In 1816–20 he published many of his writings in a 9-volume Works (Dzieła). Volumes 7–9 comprised his Humankind: A Didactic Poem (Ród Ludzki. Poema Dydaktyczne), a gigantic philosophical essay and poem that is regarded as <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>contribution</b> {{to the history of}} Polish philosophy. However, the work ran afoul of the new censorship law and was not distributed, much of the edition eventually being destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Robert Blaich, {{the senior}} {{managing}} director of design at Philips, introduced a design management system that regards design, production, and marketing as a single unit.

At Philips Design, Stefano Marzano became CEO and Chief Creative Director in 1991, continuing the work of Robert Blaich to align design processes with business processes and furthering design strategy as an important asset of the overall business strategy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>contribution</b> to make to animal justice, {{particularly}} liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains {{on the periphery of}} mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E
5|$|Mici {{had been}} a student in Pittsburgh, and wanted {{to return to the}} United States. Her chance came in 1935, when, thanks to George Gamow, Teller was invited to the United States to become a Professor of Physics at George Washington University, where he worked with Gamow until 1941. At George Washington University in 1937, Teller {{predicted}} the Jahn–Teller effect, which distorts molecules in certain situations; this affects the chemical reactions of metals, and in particular the coloration of certain metallic dyes. Teller and Hermann Arthur Jahn analyzed it as a piece of purely mathematical physics. In collaboration with Stephen Brunauer and Paul Hugh Emmett, Teller also made <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>contribution</b> to surface physics and chemistry: the so-called Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm. Teller and Mici became naturalized citizens of the United States on March 6, 1941.|$|E
5|$|From the first, {{research}} into the Super was directed by Teller, who was its most enthusiastic proponent. Although this work was always considered secondary to the objective of developing a fission bomb, the prospect of creating more powerful bombs was sufficient to keep it going. The Berkeley summer conference had convinced Teller that the Super was technologically feasible. <b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>contribution</b> was made by Emil Konopinski, who suggested that deuterium could more easily be ignited if it was mixed with tritium. Bethe noted that a tritium-deuterium (T-D) reaction releases {{five times as much}} energy as a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) reaction. This was not immediately followed up, because tritium was hard to obtain, and there were hopes that deuterium could be easily ignited by a fission bomb, but the cross sections of T-D and D-D were measured by Manley's group in Chicago and Holloway's at Purdue.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1962 that Australia voted for a UN {{resolution}} condemning South Africa for its actions in South-West Africa, a change in policy led by External Affairs Minister Garfield Barwick. Initially in opposition, until he was Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was a vocal advocate of independence for Namibia. Over the following two decades, Australia played a small (but significant) role in supporting Namibian independence. Political leaders from both benches of Parliament, including Prime Ministers Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser, were active internationally in their support of independence for Namibia while in office. As a result, Australia {{was involved in the}} UN process almost from the start. In 1972 Australia voted in favour of a UN trust fund, and two years later it was elected to the UN Council for Namibia. Australia pledged support for UNTAG at the inception of the UN plan for Namibia with Resolution 435 in September 1978, and made <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>contribution</b> to UN deliberations about Namibia while a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 1985–1986.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army was {{the largest}} service in the Australian {{military}} during World War II. Prior to the outbreak of war the Australian Army was split into the small full-time Permanent Military Forces (PMF) and the larger part-time Militia. Following the outbreak of war, on 14 September 1939 Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced that 40,000 members of the Militia would be called up for training and a 20,000-strong expeditionary force, designated the Second Australian Imperial Force (Second AIF), would be formed for overseas service. Meanwhile, conscription was introduced in October 1939 to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF. The Australian Army subsequently made <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>contribution</b> to the Allied campaigns in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and North Africa fighting the Germans, Italians and Vichy French during 1940 and 1941, {{and later in the}} jungles of the South West Pacific Area fighting the Japanese between late 1941 and 1945. Following the Japanese surrender Australian Army units were deployed as occupation forces across the South West Pacific. Meanwhile, the Army contributed troops to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan from 1946.|$|E
5|$|York {{recorded}} {{their first}} win in 17 matches after beating Plymouth 2–0 at home, with Chambers and Cresswell scoring {{in the first}} half. McGrath, Rankine and Rodman were sent back to their parent clubs, having become surplus to requirements under Worthington. The team were denied a second successive win after Peter Murphy scored a stoppage-time equaliser for Accrington, with the match finishing a 1–1 home draw, after Adam Reed had given York the lead in first half stoppage time. Carson and Kerr were ruled out {{for the remainder of}} the season through injury, with the former returning to parent club Ipswich after the expiration of his loan. York recorded a second victory in three matches after winning 2–0 away to Northampton, who had been on a run of ten consecutive home wins, with Chambers scoring in the first half and John Johnson scoring an own goal in the second half. This result saw York rise out of the relegation zone by moving up to 20th place in the table, having occupied 23rd place following the previous four results. Cresswell was recalled from his loan by new Sheffield United caretaker manager Chris Morgan, after making <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>contribution</b> for York in their battle against relegation.|$|E
