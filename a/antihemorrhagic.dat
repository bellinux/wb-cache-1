In particular, guidelines for flap operations in hemophilia B patients have still not been defined, and case reports are rare. We reconstructed the heel of a 41 -year-old male hemophilia B patient using a reverse sural artery flap operation. The patient presented with mild hemophilia, having 27 % of the normal value of coagulation factor IX. Coagulation and the changing value of the coagulation factor were regularly measured, and 70 % of the normal value of coagulation factor IX was maintained through the injection of recombinant coagulation factors and <b>antihemorrhagics.</b> Hematoma developed twice (postoperative day [POD] 5 and POD 7) and in each case the hematoma was removed. Injections of recombinant coagulation factors and <b>antihemorrhagics</b> were continuously administered until postoperative week 2. When the coagulation factors were within normal ranges. In this article, a hemophilia B patient underwent reverse sural artery flap surgery and the healing progress was analyzed. We conclude that higher than baseline levels of coagulation factors are needed for successful healing in reverse sural artery flap surgery...|$|R

We also performed cross-neutralization tests employing the parallel line assay on different pairings of venoms and antivenoms to check the possibility of using Jiangzhe Agkistrodon halys venom as a substitute for the standard Agkistrodon halys venom in measurements of the <b>antihemorrhagic</b> activity, since A. halys venom is not easily available.

40|$|The {{majority}} of snake bites in Central America {{are caused by}} Bothrops asper, whose venom induce complex local effects such as myonecrosis, edema and especially hemorrhage. These effects are only partially neutralized by the clinically used antivenom, even when administered rapidly after envenomation. Recently we screened 49 substances for <b>antihemorrhagic</b> activity and found that a mixture composed of CaNa 2, EDTA, a B. asper serum fraction (natural antidote), and the currently used horse polyvalent antiserum is highly effective in the neutralization of local and systemic hemorrhage developing after B. asper envenomation (Borkow et al., Toxicon 35, 865 - 877, 1997). In the present study we screened the best six <b>antihemorrhagic</b> compounds for their capacity to neutralize the lethal activity in mice and the proteolytic, hemolytic, and antiattachment activities in vitro of the venom. The compounds tested included the currently used horse antivenom, rabbit antiserum against whole B. asper venom or against heated venom, B. asper and Natrix tessellata serum fractions, and CaNa 2 EDTA. The constituents of the <b>antihemorrhagic</b> mixture were also the best inhibitors of the other examined toxic activities. Importantly, the mixture effectively neutralized toxic activities of an additional nine venoms from snakes abundant in Central America. This work suggests that the polyvalent antivenom used in Central America could be enriched with a B. asper serum fraction producing a more effective antivenom. In addition, the local application of CaNa 2 EDTA to neutralize hemorrhagic toxins, immediately after a snake bite, may provide rapid inhibition of local damage caused by the venoms. /[DHR- 5544 - 6 - 00 - 1064 - 00]/AID/UCR::Investigación::Unidades de Investigación::Ciencias de la Salud::Instituto Clodomiro Picado (ICP...|$|E

40|$|Diffuse {{alveolar}} hemorrhage (DAH) is an acute, life-threatening event. The blood-gas barrier must be {{very thin}} to allow gas exchange and is therefore subjected to high mechanical stresses when the capillary pressure rises. In general anesthesia, inhaled gases cause high mechanical stresses, and thus DAH occurs under certain conditions. We describe a case of inferred postoperative DAH. A 25 -year-old man had an acute episode after undergoing a tonsillectomy for snoring. During surgery, no problems occurred and no marked bleeding was observed. After removal of the endotracheal tube, however, the patient had severe cough and hemoptysis. The patient was treated with an <b>antihemorrhagic</b> agent and antibiotics. He recovered after 1 week.

Several animals are known to be resistant to snakebites and the <b>antihemorrhagic</b> and anti-lethal components have been isolated from sera of opossum, mongoose, meerkat and hedgehog, as well as from venomous and non-venomous snakes.

The molecular weight of LTNF is 63 kDa, and it does not form precipitation with venoms or toxins by immunodiffusion. Death due to intraperitoneal (IP) injection of a predetermined lethal dose of venom from major families of snakes, for instance Crotalidae, Elapidae, Viperidae and Hydrophiidae, is prevented in mice by subsequent IP inoculation of LTNF.

Among the synthetic compounds tested, only O-phenanthroline and EDTA salts inhibited the hemorrhagic activity at concentrations of 0. 5 - 10 mM; however, only CaNa 2 EDTA was non-toxic at the concentrations studied.
