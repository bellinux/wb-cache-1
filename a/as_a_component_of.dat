5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{characterize}} physically and mineralogically six samples of natural and industrialized bentonites from Paraíba, Brazil, and to study its rheological properties to be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> water based drilling fluids. Also {{it is intended to}} compare the evolution of the mineralogical composition and rheology of these clays after 40 years of exploitation. The natural bentonite clays were transformed into sodium bentonite by addition of concentrated Na 2 CO 3 solution. The suspensions were prepared with 4. 86 % w/w to measure their rheological properties (apparent and plastic viscosities and water loss). The results showed that: i) the samples present typical mineralogical compositions of bentonites, but after four decades of exploitation, presents inferior quality and ii) among the clays samples, only one presented satisfactory rheological properties be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> water based drilling fluids...|$|R

5|$|Dysprosium {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, {{but it was}} not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material).

5|$|The {{complete}} {{history of}} Skåneland was not taught {{for a long}} time in schools in Skåneland, especially during periods with the immediate threat of revolt.

In reaction, a movement began in the late 19th century to revive awareness of the history and culture of Skåneland.

5|$|Beryllium {{was used}} by the Manhattan Project as a neutron reflector, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> {{modulated}} neutron initiators. Only one firm produced it commercially in the United States, Brush Beryllium in Lorain, Ohio. The Ames Project began working on a production process in December 1943, reducing beryllium fluoride in a bomb with metallic magnesium and a sulphur booster. The main difficulty with working with beryllium was its high toxicity. A closed bomb was used to minimize the possibility of producing toxic beryllium dust. The process worked, but the high temperatures and pressures created by the magnesium sulphide meant that it was potentially explosive. An alternative was then developed using beryllium fluoride in a bomb with metallic calcium and a lead chloride booster. The metal was cast in a vacuum. Research was still ongoing when the war ended.|$|E

5|$|Einsteinium was {{discovered}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> {{the debris of}} the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield {{on the order of}} one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Helium is used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> {{breathing}} gases {{to replace}} nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are {{absorbed by the}} blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, {{a decrease in the}} narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E
