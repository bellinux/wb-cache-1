[...] John Marrs of Gay Times compared the lyrical content of the song to Madonna's [...] "Drowned World/Substitute For Love" [...] (1998) explaining that the lyrics are essentially autobiographical as well as talks about how her outspokenness had led to the media trying to [...] "hurt her". It also talks about how although Madonna is tough at heart, she still feels the [...] "negativity"of the media. The chorus, which features skittering drums and strings, has Madonna simply saying: [...] "I don't wanna talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> now / even hearts made out of steel can break down."
