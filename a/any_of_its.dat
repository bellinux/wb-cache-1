5|$|Lacaille gave six stars Bayer designations, {{labeling}} them Alpha (α) to Zeta (ζ) in 1756, but omitted Epsilon (ε) and designated two adjacent {{stars as}} Gamma (γ). Bode extended the designations to Rho (ρ) for other stars, {{but most of}} these have fallen out of use. Caelum is too far south for <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> stars to bear Flamsteed designations.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} {{changed when}} Sadat, {{in the face}} of protests from his senior commanders, ordered an offensive to seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes, hoping to relieve Israeli pressure on the Syrians. The resulting offensive was ill-planned and ill-executed, culminating in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> objectives. This gave the Israelis the initiative to launch a counteroffensive.|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for {{the path that}} {{minimizes}} the maximum weight of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path problem, or vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E
5|$|At some {{stage in}} that summer the formal copying of the symphony began. On 4 September 1933 Paul Voigt, Sibelius's long-time copyist, sent {{a bill for}} making a fair copy of the first movement—23 pages of music. Sibelius {{informed}} him—the note survives—that the complete manuscript would be about eight times {{as long as this}} excerpt, indicating that the symphony might be on a larger scale than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> seven predecessors. Aino Sibelius later recalled other visits to Voigt that autumn at which Sibelius, whose mood she described as gloomy and taciturn, delivered further piles of music manuscript to the copyist.|$|E

5|$|Despite advance {{sales of}} 40,000 tickets, only 4,919 fans {{showed up to}} the first strike game played by {{replacement}} players. Neither team had <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> regular players on the roster. Detroit punter Mike Black's 3rd-quarter fumble on the 3-yard line set up Harold Ricks' game-winning touchdown run. The Buccaneers' three second-quarter touchdowns overcame the Lions' early 17-point lead. 17 of the Buccaneers' points resulted from Lions turnovers. Around 1,000 union members, including UAW president Owen Bieber, joined the Lions on the picket lines. Attendance was also likely influenced by a baseball game taking place the same day, in which the Detroit Tigers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays to win the A.L. East Championship.|$|E

5|$|NY73 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it did not initially follow <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> modern routing. It began at an intersection with NY28N in Tahawus and followed the Blue Ridge Road east to US9 in North Hudson. From there, it overlapped US9 south to Schroon, where it proceeded eastward on the former legislative Route48 to Ticonderoga, where it ended at a junction with NY22. At the time, modern NY73 from Lake Placid to Keene—identical to the old North West Bay Road east of the Lake Placid area—{{was assigned}} NY86A. The remainder of what is now NY73 from Keene south to Underwood was designated as NY427 within a year's time.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear Strike is a helicopter-based shooter {{game with}} a blend of both {{strategy}} and action, which the player views from outside the helicopter from an overhead perspective. It is similar to previous games in the series, but has 15 playable vehicles, a larger number than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> predecessors. The main helicopter is a fictional Super Apache, with additional helicopters including the Cobra and other Hueys. Playable jets include the Harrier Jump Jet and a fictional V/STOL version of the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The player can use surface vehicles including the M1 Abrams tank, Bradley armoured vehicle, the Multiple Launch Rocket System and a PACV hovercraft.|$|E
5|$|Riven {{combined}} the pre-rendered backgrounds with live action footage, {{in order to}} increase the player's immersion level. Riven was the first game in which <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> designers had directed live actors, and Vander Wende was apprehensive about their use. Rand Miller had to reprise his role of Atrus from Myst, even though he hated acting. All the actors were filmed with a blue screen as a backdrop, which was removed in post-production by chroma key, so that the actors would blend into the virtual environment. Real world stairs, doorways and studio lights had to be meticulously positioned on the live stage to match their CG equivalents. Some sequences were seamlessly cut together with morphing, to allow for partial variations due to the nonlinearity of the gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Some {{algorithms}} become simpler {{when used}} on DAGs instead of general graphs, {{based on the}} principle of topological ordering. For example, it is possible to find shortest paths and longest paths from a given starting vertex in DAGs in linear time by processing the vertices in a topological order, and calculating the path length for each vertex to be the minimum or maximum length obtained via <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> incoming edges. In contrast, for arbitrary graphs the shortest path may require slower algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman–Ford algorithm, and longest paths in arbitrary graphs are NP-hard to find.|$|E
