40|$|The {{history of}} social {{psychology}} in this article differs from the standard versions. This {{is due to the}} fact that I call on contribtuons from different interlocutors, some of them from outside the discipline {{of social psychology}}. Their theorical insights provide a clue to the idea hidden in the background of social psychology –the idea of "atmosphere". I begin by setting out what official social psychology has held in contempt – its own past, its own unofficial history. I also make a case for the work of certain authors who have been ignored within social psychology, and introduce others who have cautiously developed the idea of &# 39;atmosphere&# 39;. I trace how &# 39;atmosphere&# 39; became the central metaphor which historically informed the discipline of social psychology, taking account of the work of historians and philosophers, as well as sociologists and philologists. &# 39;Atmosphere&# 39; is the origin of social <b>psychology,</b> <b>an</b> idea that results in <b>a</b> nostalgic <b>psychology,</b> <b>an</b> historical <b>psychology</b> and <b>a</b> collective <b>psychology...</b>|$|R
