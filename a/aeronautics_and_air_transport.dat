40|$|The {{collaborative}} research project SUPRA, intends to develop methodologies and advanced flight simulator concepts for teaching airline pilots to detect, and recover from adverse flight upsets {{that lead to}} unusual attitudes. The project is funded by the EU Seventh Framework Programme, {{in the area of}} <b>Aeronautics</b> <b>and</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transport.</b> Research activities of SUPRA include: 1) extension of two existing aerodynamic models using systematic engineering methods and actual flight tests; 2) development of advanced motion cueing algorithms; 3) definition of self-motion perception criteria specifically for upset recovery profiles, including sustained G-loads. The integrated SUPRA concept will be evaluated in four high-performance research simulators. Two simulators (GRACE at the NLR; and the PSPK- 102 simulator at TsAGI) feature high fidelity civil cockpits on a Stewart platform, and are thus instrumental in answering the question if and how current level-D full flight simulators can be upgraded for adequate upset recovery training. Two other SUPRA simulators feature new generation moving bases: the Desdemona facility of AMST and TNO, and the MPS Robotic Simulator at the Max Planck Institute. The SUPRA project will investigate to what extent the unconventional large motion capabilities of both simulators are capable of simulating the extreme attitudes and G-loads relevant for successful upset recovery. The SUPRA project will run from mid 2009 to mid 2012...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of high-speed rail (HSR) <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> in China has encouraged {{research on the}} spatial effects and safety of these two modes of transport, and on the competition between them. We report here {{an investigation of the}} effects of competition between HSR <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> in China from a geographical perspective. The spatial service hinterlands for HSR <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> accessible within one and two hours by road transport were investigated using a method based on a geographical information system and the overlapping service hinterlands of HSR <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> were established. A city with both HSR stations and airports, or that was accessible to HSR stations and airports within a certain travel time by road transport, was defined as the overlapping market. The spatial effects of competition between HSR <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> at present <b>and</b> in the future were then studied with respect to the planned HSR network and airports. The results showed that both HSR <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> tend to serve areas with high population densities and well-developed economies and in 2012 most of the population and GDP in China were accessible within two hours by road transport to an HSR station or airport. The different technical and economic characteristics of HSR <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> determine the advantage markets. Spatially, the service hinterland of HSR mainly focuses on urban agglomerations and economic corridors in the eastern and central regions, whereas <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> has a competitive advantage in the more inaccessible western region of China. The overlapping market of HSR <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> will become increasingly large in the future and cities with a population of over one million and cities within 30 km to both airports and HSR stations will become the major competitive markets. Considering the cost of construction and the number of passengers required for economic operation, as well as the competition with <b>air</b> <b>transport,</b> it is suggested that the construction of some HSR projects in the western region of China should be canceled or slowed down...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale air {{transport}} modernisation initiatives including the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR), Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative for <b>Aeronautics</b> <b>and</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> aim {{to improve the}} operational efficiency, safety and environmental sustainability of aviation. Scientific advances in Air Transport Management (ATM) and avionic systems are required to achieve the ambitious goals set by national and international aviation organisations. This paper presents the recent advances in ATM and avionic system concepts, integrated architectures and trajectory generation algorithms, to be adopted in Next Generation Avionics Flight Management Systems (NG-FMS) and ground-based 4 -Dimensional Trajectory Planning, Negotiation and Validation (4 -PNV) systems. Current research efforts are focussed {{on the development of}} NG-FMS and 4 -PNV systems for Four Dimensional (4 D) Trajectory/Intent Based Operations (TBO/IBO), enabling automated negotiation and validation of aircraft intents and thus alleviating the workload of operators. After describing the NG-FMS/ 4 PNV concept of operations, the overall system architecture and the key mathematical models describing the 4 DT optimisation algorithms are introduced. Simulation case studies utilising realistic operational scenarios highlight the generation and optimisation of a family of 4 DT intents by the NG-FMS corresponding to a set of performance weightings agreed between Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) and Airline Operation Centres (AOC). The savings on time, fuel burn and gaseous emissions (CO 2 and NOx) associated with the globally optimal 4 DT intents are presented. The developed optimisation and negotiation/validation loops meet the timeframe requirements of typical online tactical routing/rerouting tasks...|$|E
40|$|Global {{aviation}} {{is growing}} exponentially {{and there is}} a great emphasis on trajectory optimization to reduce the overall environmental impact caused by aircraft. Many optimization techniques exist and are being studied for this purpose. The CLEAN SKY Joint Technology Initiative for <b>aeronautics</b> <b>and</b> <b>Air</b> <b>transport,</b> a European research activity run under the Seventh Framework program, is a collaborative initiative involving industry, research organizations and academia to introduce novel technologies to improve the environmental impact of aviation. As part of the overall research activities, "green" aircraft trajectories are addressed in the Systems for Green Operations (SGO) Integrated Technology Demonstrator. This paper studies the impact of large commercial aircraft trajectories optimized for different objectives applied to the on board systems. It establishes integrated systems models for both conventional and more electric secondary power systems and studies the impact of fuel, noise, time and emissions optimized trajectories on each configuration. It shows the significant change in the fuel burn due to systems operation and builds up the case as to why a detailed aircraft systems model is required within the optimization loop. Typically, the objective in trajectory optimization is to improve the mission performance of an aircraft or reduce the environmental impact. Hence parameters such as time, fuel burn, emissions and noise are key optimization objectives. In most instances, trajectory optimization is achieved by using models that represent such parameters. For example aircraft dynamics models to describe the flight performance, engine models to calculate the fuel burn, emissions and noise impact, etc. Such techniques have proved to achieve the necessary level of accuracy in trajectory optimization. This research enhances previous techniques by adding in the effect of systems power in the optimization process. A comparison is also made between conventional power systems and more electric architectures. In the conventional architecture, the environmental control system and the ice protection system are powered by engine bleed air while actuators and electrics are powered by engine shaft power off-takes. In the more electric architecture, bleed off take is eliminated and the environmental control system and ice protection system are also powered electrically through engine shaft power off takes...|$|E
