40|$|Abstract Introduction: Tissue {{adhesives}} {{can be used}} as {{adjacent to}} sutures to drop or avoid bleeding in cardiovascular operations. Objective: To verify the efficiency of fibrin and cyanoacrylate adhesive to seal arterial sutures and if the <b>adhesives</b> penetrate through <b>suture</b> line to the inner of arteries. Methods: 20 abdominal aorta segments of pigs were divided into two groups according to the adhesive which would be used as adjacent to the suture. In every arterial segment an arteriotomy was done, followed by a conventional artery closure. Afterwards a colloidal fluid was injected inside the arterial segment with a simultaneous intravascular pressure monitoring up to a fluid leakage through the suture. This procedure was repeated after application of one of the <b>adhesives</b> on the <b>suture</b> in order to check if the bursting pressure increases. The inner aorta segments also were analyzed in order to check if there was intraluminal adhesive penetration. Results: In Suture 1 group, the mean arterial pressure sustained by the arterial suture reached 86 ± 5. 35 mmHg and after the fibrin adhesive application reached 104 ± 11. 96 (P< 0. 002). In the Suture 2 group, the mean arterial pressure sustained by the suture reached 83 ± 2. 67 mmHg and after the cyanoacrylate adhesive application reached 152 ± 14. 58 mmHg (P< 0. 002). Intraluminal adhesive penetration has not been noticed. Conclusion: There was a significant rise in the bursting pressure when tissue adhesives were used as adjacent to arterial suture, and this rise was higher if the cyanoacrylate adhesive was used. In addition, the adhesives do not penetrate through the suture line into the arteries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The less {{traumatic}} use {{of surgical}} <b>adhesives</b> rather than <b>sutures</b> for mesh fixation in hernia repair {{has started to}} gain popularity because they induce less host tissue damage and provoke less postoperative pain. This study examines the host tissue response to a new cyanoacrylate (CA) adhesive (n-octyl, OCA). Partial defects (3 × 5 cm) created in the rabbit anterior abdominal wall were repaired by mesh fixation using OCA, Glubran 2 (n-butyl-CA), Ifabond(n-hexyl-CA) or sutures. Samples were obtained at 14 / 90 days for morphology, collagens qRT-PCR/immunofluorescence and biomechanical studies. All meshes were successfully fixed. Seroma was detected mainly in the Glubran group at 14 days. Meshes fixed using all methods showed good host tissue incorporation. No signs of degradation {{of any of the}} adhesives were observed. At 14 days, collagen 1 and 3 mRNA expression levels were greater in the suture and OCA groups, and lower in Ifabond, with levels varying significantly in the latter group with respect to the others. By 90 days, expression levels had fallen in all groups, except for collagen 3 mRNA in Ifabond. Collagen I and III protein expression was marked in the suture and OCA groups at 90 days, but lower in Ifabond at both time points. Tensile strengths were similar across groups. Our findings indicate the similar behavior of the <b>adhesives</b> to <b>sutures</b> in terms of good tissue incorporation of the meshes and optimal repair zone strength. The lower seroma rate and similar collagenization to controls induced by OCA suggests its improved behavior over the other two glues. Graphical Abstract: This article deals with a preclinical study to examine different aspects of the repair process in the host of three alkyl cyanoacrylates (n-butyl (GLUBRAN 2), n-hexyl (IFABOND), and n-octyl cyanoacrylate (EVOBOND)) compared to sutures (control), in the fixation of surgical meshes for hernia repair. It goes into detail about collagen deposition in the repair zone at short and medium term. The results obtained demonstrate lower seroma rate and similar collagenization to sutures induced by the n-octyl suggesting better behavior than the other two cyanoacrylates.

Methods: Skin closure with 4. 0 Mononylon (Ethicon, Summerville, NJ, USA) continuous subcuticular suture and with Dermabond (Ethicon, USA) (octylcyanoacrylate) was compared among 37 patients who had undergone body contouring surgery (23 abdominoplasties and 14 mammoplasties). Each side of the scar, randomly selected, was closed either with <b>adhesive</b> or <b>suture.</b> the time required for skin closure and the aesthetic aspect of these scars were compared. Three observers evaluated the scars at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively using a categorical and a modified visual analog scale. Results: the average time for closure using suture was 7 min and 45 s for the abdominoplasty and 4 min and 25 s for the vertical incision of the mammoplasty. This was significantly different statistically, {{as compared with the}} 2 min required for polymerization of the skin adhesive. the mammoplasty and abdominoplasty scars showed, no statistical difference at 3, 6, and 12 months according to both scales.

40|$|The use of fibrin tissue {{adhesives}} {{in clinical}} practice has grown {{over the past}} 10 years, {{and there has been}} increased use of adhesives in different surgical subspecialties. Conventional suture closure of periorbital tissues is effective however may result in complications, which has led to the search for other techniques and innovations. Although tissue adhesives have been used in clinical practice there is a paucity of randomized controlled studies that have evaluated their advantages and disadvantage in surgical practice. The goals of eyelid surgery include the restoration of tissue structure and function while causing minimal morbidity. The use of a medical product that induces physiological clotting and fibrin formation is appealing in both theory and clinical practice. However fibrin tissue adhesives present disadvantages and complications of their own. This thesis set out to evaluate the use of fibrin tissue adhesives in eyelid surgery and includes a 5 -year randomized control study comparing fibrin tissue <b>adhesives</b> to <b>suture</b> closure of skin. A challenge in the evaluation of eyelid surgery is the definition of a successful outcome. Surgical outcomes have traditionally been measured by surgical complications and the need for further redo surgery. Other relevant aspects of surgical outcome that have rarely been evaluated include surgical healing and scar formation, asymmetry that is present however not requiring further surgery, patient experience and satisfaction.

40|$|Suturing of perineal trauma after {{childbirth}} {{can cause}} {{problems such as}} pain, discomfort because of tight sutures, the need for suture removal, and dyspareunia. It is unclear whether leaving the perineal skin unsutured or using skin adhesives might prevent these problems. CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and prospective trial registers until January 2013 were searched for (quasi-) randomized controlled trials comparing nonsuturing of the perineal skin or skin <b>adhesives</b> versus <b>suturing</b> of the skin when repairing a second-degree perineal tear or episiotomy. Primary outcome measure was short-term and long-term pain and need for analgesic medication. Four randomized and two quasi-randomized controlled trials (involving 2, 922 women) with heterogeneity in contexts, designs, and methodological quality were included. Nonsuturing of the skin leads to less short-term and long-term pain compared to suturing and an increased rate of skin separation. Skin adhesives lead to less short-term pain without an increased rate of skin separation. Nonsuturing or skin adhesives lead to less complaints {{and there are no}} other adverse effects. Nonsuturing of the skin or the use of skin adhesives appears preferable in terms of pain. Nonsuturing could lead to more short-term skin separation when no adhesives are used, but there is no evidence for the clinical importance of skin separation.

40|$|Background Simple wound closure is {{normally}} performed with suture by trained emergency nurse in Hong Kong. The {{aim of the}} study was to compare two wound closure methods: octylcyanoacrylate tissue adhesive (Dermabond) as tissue <b>adhesives</b> and <b>suture</b> in term of cost-effectiveness, outcome appearance, pain and satisfaction for patients who received wound closure in emergency department in Hong Kong. Method: A randomized, unblinded, controlled trial design was used. Patients who met the inclusion criteria (age ≥ 18, ambulatory, with simple laceration wound) were invited for the study. Patients were randomly assigned to either the control (wound closure by suture-standarrd nylon stitches) or experimental group(wound closure by tissue adhesive (Dermabond). Wound follow up was performed at day 14, 30 and 90. Wound outcomes were determined by cost –effectiveness analysis, Wound Evaluation Score (WES), Visual Analog Comesis Scale (VACS), Visual Analog scale (VAS) for pain level and satisfaction level. Results: 185 patients completed the study with 90 on control group and 95 on experimental group. There were homogenous in demographic variables (age, sex, mechanism of injury, wound length, wound life) between 2 groups. At D 14 review, there was no significant different in term of wound evaluation score (WES) between 2 groups as reviewed by assigned wound assessors (P = 0. 27). However, patients of experimental group have statically higher satisfaction level (91. 3 VS 85. 2 P< 0. 005) & better cosmetic appearance score (VACS) P< 0. 005 at 3 time points. No significant difference in pain level between groups at day 14, 30 and 90 (F(1, 183) = 2. 67 P=. 11). The total cost per Dermbond case was much cheaper than the cost of suture due to the saving in nursing time and wound follow up.

30|$|Despite the {{universal}} {{acceptance of the}} importance of ECMO cannula securement, there are currently no data on best practice for the effective dressing and securement of ECMO cannulas. Currently, in many centres, ECMO cannula sites are covered with transparent dressings to protect the site from extrinsic contamination. Securement methods to stabilise ECMO lines and prevent gross movement include tapes, <b>adhesive</b> bandages and <b>sutures,</b> although practice lacks standardisation and no evidence-based recommendations exist. Commercial sutureless securement devices (SSDs) provide a more contemporary approach to ECMO line management at the bedside. However, there is mixed evidence regarding their efficacy in securing intravascular catheters [20, 21] and SSDs have never been tested with ECMO cannulas. Medical-grade skin glue (cyanoacrylate), also known as tissue adhesive (TA), has undergone recent investigation as a novel product for securing invasive devices [18, 20, 22 – 27] and reducing associated infection risk [25, 28, 29]. TA applications for improved intravascular catheter securement compared with transparent dressing include epidural [26], central venous [27], peripheral venous [22, 25] and arterial catheters [23, 24]. TA also has antimicrobial properties and in vitro testing small-gauge catheters has shown inhibition of Gram-positive organisms, suggesting its potential to reduce the incidence of catheter-associated infection [25, 29].|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{methods for}} skin closure are used, i. e. <b>sutures,</b> <b>adhesive</b> papertape and tissue adhesives. Little {{is known about}} the {{efficacy}} of these techniques in laparoscopic surgery. This study was performed to analyse the efficacy of octylcyanoacrylate, a new tissue adhesive, adhesive papertape and poliglecaprone for wound closure in laparoscopy. Methods: From May 2000 to September 2001, 140 patients were included in a prospective randomized trial. Wounds were closed with octylcyanoacrylate (n= 48), adhesive papertape (n= 42) or poliglecaprone (n= 50). Closing time, wound infection, cosmetic results and costs were evaluated. A time-motion analysis was also performed. Results: The patients in the three groups were well matched for age, gender and body mass index. Closing times per wound were 26, 33 and 65 s respectively for adhesive papertape, octylcyanoacrylate and poliglecaprone (P < 0. 001). Cosmetic results, as scored by the patients, were no different. The number of actions required to close each wound was 5. 7, 8. 3 and 21. 0 for octylcyanoacrylate, adhesive papertape (P= 0. 05 versus octylcyanoacrylate) and poliglecaprone (P < 0. 01 versus octylcyanoacrylate and adhesive papertape) respectively. Octylcyanoacrylate was significantly more expensive than poliglecaprone and adhesive papertape. Conclusion: Closure with adhesive papertape was the fastest method.

This was a prospective randomized study of LBSS skin <b>adhesive</b> versus Vicryl™ <b>sutures</b> for the topical closure of laparoscopic surgical incisions. Subjects were asked to return at 2  weeks postsurgery to report complications and adverse events. Wounds were evaluated for apposition and cosmesis using a modified Hollander Wound Evaluation Scale (HWES). The Shapiro–Wilk test of normality was done. Independent-samples T test, Mann Whitney U test, and chi-square test were used to compare variables between the two wound closure methods. A total of 114 subjects participated in this trial completing {{all aspects of the}} study. Fifty-five subjects received sutures for topical wound closure, with 59 subjects receiving LBSS. Surgeons were found to be satisfied with 100  % of all applications using the LBSS device. One hundred percent of wounds closed with sutures and 98.9  % wounds closed with LBSS achieving an optimal HWES of 0. There was no statistical difference in cosmesis or complications for either method. Closure with LBSS was significantly faster by a mean of 2  min. LiquiBand® Surgical S is as good as sutures for the closure of laparoscopic wounds in terms of cosmesis and complications with the added benefit of being significantly faster.|$|R

METHODS: New Zealand albino rabbits (n= 16), males and females, from 5 to 6 months old, average weight of 2500 g, were distributed randomly in Group A (n- 8) - biological adhesive and Group B (n= 8) - suture thread. After anesthesia with acepromazine (1 mg/Kg), ketamine (50 mg/Kg) and fentanyl EV (0, 5 ml/Kg), it was performed a supra-umbilical median laparotomy, the median hepatic lobe was isolated and subjected to severe standardized incision. In the group B the incision edges were sutured with simple 4 - 0 catgut, in separated stitches. It was evaluated the total time of the procedure, the hemostasis time and hemorrhage volume. In the 21 st post-operative day it was evaluated the presence of adherences and signs of infection in the abdominal cavity, and {{it was followed by}} the resection of the median hepatic lobe for the histological evaluation. RESULTS: The calculated mean and standard deviation showed that the procedure time, hemostasis time and bleeding amount were significantly smaller in the group of animals subjected to the use of fibrin adhesive. The surgical abdominal incision was significantly more extensive in the animals of the suture group (average of 6, 8 cm) in relation to the adhesive group (average of 3, 8), as well as the number of occurrences of abscesses. The adherence of the intestinal ansas to the sutured incision (group B) occurred in five cases and the major omentum adhesion occurred in all animals. In the group A (adhesive) it occurred adherences of the major omentum in three cases. The microscopy of the hepatic incision repaired with the use of fibrin showed that the inflammatory infection is less intense, not associated with the formulation of secretion in the abscesses, and therefore has a more favorable later cicatricial aspect than a conventional suture with surgical thread.

30|$|We {{have used}} our animal model to compare various <b>adhesive</b> systems to <b>sutures</b> {{in the same}} set of experiments. We chose the pig because of the {{feasibility}} of inserting catheters in blood vessels of a size comparable to those of humans and because pig skin has been considered the most similar to humans among the non-primate animals for decades in in vivo wound healing research [34, 35]. In addition, we believe that the reaction of pig skin to adhesives is likely to model human skin because both species have a similar total turnover time for the epidermis (30  days for the pig and 26 – 27  days for humans) [36]. We believe that our model presents an advantage over the other models from the literature, because the catheters were truly inserted into veins of living (anesthetized) animals. The peak axial pull force values measured are therefore likely to better approximate the clinical situation and provide a good basis for the comparison of various securement devices. Since we also generated internal data using the same pull force testing equipment on human volunteers (without insertion of the catheters into veins and without the suture comparison), we are able to comment on the two models. When comparing the pull force data generated in this pig model to the pull force data generated in the human in vivo model, the values were higher in the pig model than in the human model (the difference ranged on average from 4.6 to 9.2  N). Factors related to a catheter being inserted in the veins and the skin of the pig (no moisture or sweating compared to humans) may be contributing to the observed differences in readings. As found in the pig study, the findings in our human study had indicated that the securement dressing required significantly less force to dislodge the catheter than all three of the sutureless securement systems tested, and the three sutureless securement devices showed pull forces that were not different from each other at every time point tested (5  min, 4, and 7  days; manuscript in preparation). Therefore, the comparative performance of the adhesive securement systems tested was the same in both models, confirming the relevance of the pig model in effectively predicting the differences and similarities when measuring peak axial pull force.|$|R

OBJETIVO: Avaliar o desempenho do adesivo de fibrina e do fio de sutura absorvível no reparo de lesões hepáticas provocadas em coelhos. MÉTODOS: Coelhos (n= 16),Nova Zelândia, albinos, machos e fêmeas, 5 a 6 meses de idade, peso médio de 2500 gramas, foram distribuídos aleatoriamente em Grupo A(n = 8) - adesivo biológico e Grupo B(n= 8) - fio de sutura. Após anestesia com acepromazina (1 mg/Kg), quetamina (50 mg/Kg) e fentanylEV (0, 5 ml/Kg), realizou-se laparotomia mediana supra-umbilical, o lobo hepático médio foi isolado e submetido a uma lesão padronizada grave. No grupo A foi aplicado o adesivo de fibrina. No grupo B as bordas da lesão foram suturadas com categute 4 - 0 simples, em pontos separados. Avaliou-se o tempo total de procedimento, tempo de hemostasia e volume da hemorragia. No 21 º dia de pós-operatório avaliou-se a presença de aderências e sinais de infecção na cavidade e procedeu-se a ressecção do lobo hepático médio para a avaliação histológica. RESULTADOS: A média e desvio-padrão calculados mostraram que o tempo de procedimento, tempo de hemostasia e quantidade de sangramento foram significantes menores no grupo de animais submetidos ao uso do adesivo de fibrina. A extensão da ferida operatória foi significativamente maior nos animais do grupo sutura (média de 6, 8 cm) em relação ao grupo adesivo (média de 3, 8 cm) assim como o número de vezes da ocorrência de abscessos. A aderência de alças intestinais à lesão suturada (grupo B) ocorreu em 5 casos e adesão do omento maior ocorreu em todos os animais. No grupo A (adesivo) foram observadas aderências do omento maior em três casos. A microscopia da lesão hepática reparada com o uso de fibrina mostrou que a reação inflamatória é menos intensa, não está associada à formação de secreção ou abscessos e com isso tem um aspecto cicatricial tardio mais favorável que uma sutura convencional com fio cirúrgico. CONCLUSÃO: Em concordância com outros trabalhos da literatura biomédica, o adesivo de fibrina é uma opção viável para realizar hemostasia em um modelo animal (coelho) com lesão hepática grave...|$|R
