40|$|<b>Arboviruses</b> are emerging/reemerging {{infectious}} agents worldwide. The factors {{within this}} scenario include vector and host population fluctuations, climatic changes, anthropogenic activities that disturb ecosystems, {{an increase in}} international flights, human mobility, and genetic mutations that allow spill-over phenomenon. <b>Arboviruses</b> are maintained by biologic transmission among vectors and hosts. Sometimes this biological transmission is specific and includes one vector and host species such as CHK, DEN and urban YFV. However, most of the <b>arboviruses</b> are generalist and they use many vectors and hosts species. From this perspective, <b>arboviruses</b> are maintained through a transmission network rather than a transmission cycle.

40|$|<b>Arboviruses</b> (arthropod borne viruses) {{have life}} cycles that include both {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate hosts with substantial differences in vector and host specificity between different viruses. Most <b>arboviruses</b> utilize RNA for their genetic material and are completely dependent on host tRNAs for their translation, suggesting that virus codon usage {{could be a}} target for selection. In the current study we analyzed the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) patterns of 26 <b>arboviruses</b> together with 25 vectors and hosts, including 8 vertebrates and 17 invertebrates. We used hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify trends in codon usage. HCA demonstrated that the RSCU of <b>arboviruses</b> reflects that of their natural hosts, but not that of dead-end hosts. Of the two major components identified by PCA, the first accounted for 62. 1 % of the total variance, and among the 59 codons analyzed in this study, the leucine codon CTG had the highest correlation with the first principal component, however isoleucine had the highest correlation during amino acid analysis. Nucleotide and dinucleotide composition were the variables that explained most of the total codon usage variance. The {{results suggest that the}} main factors driving the evolution of codon usage in <b>arboviruses</b> is based on the nucleotide and dinucleotide composition present in the host.

40|$|BACKGROUND In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the role of}} free-living domestic pigeons (Columba livia) as a reservoir of <b>arboviruses</b> {{in the city of}} Belém, state of Pará, Brazil. We investigated the presence of antibodies against the most prevalent <b>arboviruses.</b> OBJECTIVES This study was aimed at evaluating some clinical and physical parameters of domestic pigeons, including the presence of antibodies to Amazon-endemic <b>arboviruses.</b> METHODS Eighty-five healthy pigeons were captured in Mangal das Garças Park, in Belém, and were bled. Upon capture, the birds were subjected to a clinical examination in search of alterations that could indicate the presence of <b>arboviruses.</b> Blood samples were converted to serum and tested using the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) technique with a panel of 19 antigens of <b>arboviruses</b> circulating in the Amazon. The confirmation assay for the positive reactions to the viral species tested by HI was a neutralisation test in new-born Swiss albino mice (Mus musculus) [mouse neutralisation test (MNT) ]. FINDINGS A total of 10 (11. 8 %) serum samples tested positive for antiflavivirus antibodies by HI. All the samples positive for the HI test were subjected to MNT for detection of viruses and yielded negative results (logarithmic neutralisation index < 1. 7). MAIN CONCLUSION The results represent the first serological detection of antiarbovirus antibodies in domestic pigeons as potential hosts of <b>arboviruses</b> in Brazil. The detection of haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies against genus Flavivirus indicated that there was recent contact between the analysed domestic pigeons and these <b>arboviruses.</b> Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of free-living pigeons in the maintenance cycle and spread of <b>arboviruses</b> in the Amazon...|$|R
40|$|Systemic viral {{infections are}} common. Symptomatic {{involvement}} {{of the nervous system}} in viral infections is uncommon. 1 Encephalitis is the most worrying manifestation of nervous system involvement by viruses. Arthropod-borne viruses (<b>arboviruses)</b> are among the most serious international infectious threats to the human nervous system. 2 The neuro-logic diseases that may be transmitted by arthropods to humans include meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, encephalomyelitis, neuritis (including anterior horn cells and dorsal root ganglia), and myositis. 2 <b>Arboviruses</b> are distributed worldwide. Different species, however, have a predilection for different geo-graphical areas. <b>Arboviruses</b> are transmitted to vertebral hosts by blood-feeding arthropod vectors including mosquitoes, biting flies, mites, nits, and ticks. 2, 3 The table reviews some of the common <b>arboviruses,</b> their vectors, and their geographical distribution. Transmis-sion pattern of <b>arboviruses</b> is climate-dependent and is broadly divided into 2 groups. In tropical areas, viruses circulate throughout the year, often with a broad sea-sonal peak. Pattern is different in temperate climates, where virus is transmitted between the vector and ver-tebrate host species only during the warmer months with no arboviral disease in colder months. 4 <b>Arboviruses</b> that affect the nervous system are RNA viruses of several genera of the Togaviridae, Fla-viviridae, Bunyaviridae, Reoviridae, and Orthomyxo-viridae families. 2, 3, 5 These <b>arboviruses</b> replicate in peripheral tissues, produce viremia, enter the CNS, replicate in neurons, and spread outward to other neuron populations, a process that may lead to encephalitis. 6 Some of the well-known encephalitides include West Nile encephalitis (WNE), Dengue feve...|$|R

40|$|As in humans, sub-clinical {{infection}} by <b>arboviruses</b> {{in domestic}} animals is common; however, its detection only occurs during epizootics and the silent circulation of some <b>arboviruses</b> may remain undetected. The {{objective of the}} present paper {{was to assess the}} current circulation of <b>arboviruses</b> in the Nhecolândia sub-region of South Pantanal, Brazil. Sera from a total of 135 horses, of which 75 were immunized with bivalent vaccine composed of inactive Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Western equine encephalitis virus(WEEV) and 60 were unvaccinated, were submitted to thorough viral isolation, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and neutralization tests for Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), EEEV, WEEV and Mayaro virus (MAYV). No virus was isolated and viral nucleic-acid detection by RT-PCR was also negative. Nevertheless, the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies in horses older than seven months was 43. 7 % for SLEV in equines regardless of vaccine status, and 36. 4 % for WEEV and 47. 7 % for EEEV in unvaccinated horses. There was no evidence of MAYV infections. The serologic evidence of circulation of <b>arboviruses</b> responsible for equine and human encephalitis, without recent official reports of clinical infections in the area, suggests that the Nhecolândia sub-region in South Pantanal is an important area for detection of silent activity of <b>arboviruses</b> in Brazil...|$|R
