40|$|When {{setting and}} {{monitoring}} fiscal targets, {{there is a}} need to take explicit account of the cyclical position of the economy and its effect on the budget. Most of the discussion on fiscal policy in South Africa deals only with long-term sustainability issues, largely ignoring the effects of the economic cycle. As a result, serious policy mistakes can occur if purely cyclical improvements in the public finances are treated as if they represent structural improvements, or if structural deterioration is interpreted as a cyclical effect. This study considers the countercyclical role of South African fiscal policy during the period 1970 to 2000. More specifically, it presents theoretical and empirical analysis of the significance of automatic fiscal stabilisers in the South African economy and calculates the cyclically adjusted budget balance that can improve fiscal policy-making and analysis. The study compares results for South Africa with six other developing countries (Chile, Mexico, Indonesia, India, Mauritius and Romania) and macroeconomic stabilisation and the potential role of automatic fiscal stabilisers in the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) are also investigated. This study highlights the need for continued caution in the use of discretionary policy, greater focus on making automatic fiscal stabilisers more effective in South Africa and the integration of better measures of fiscal balance into the discretionary policy process. Automatic fiscal stabilisers could also play an important role as a complement to countercyclical monetary policy and the operation of monetary policy could be facilitated by the predictable and automatic responses from <b>automatic</b> fiscal <b>stabilisers.</b> <b>Budget</b> rules could play an important role in developing countries and specifically in African countries. If applied flexibly, fiscal rules could be regarded as restoring at least a moderate countercyclical role in these countries through the operation of automatic fiscal stabilisers. Although automatic fiscal stabilisers are likely to be less important in African countries due to structural reasons, the combination of appropriate rules, taking into account the impact of the business cycle on the public finances and vigilance against the dangers of inappropriate discretionary policy, may make a valuable contribution to Africa’s development.

30|$|The <b>automatic</b> <b>budget</b> {{response}} or stabilizers is {{a summary}} concept for the automatic response of public sector revenues and expenditures {{to a change}} in the level of economic activity (the business cycle situation).

A recession will therefore be associated with a deteriorating public budget position and vice versa.|$|R

40|$|To many {{contemporary}} commentators, {{the doctrine of}} separation of powers is a hoary non sequitur used to justify reactionary results. To the evident frustration of the critics, however, the Supreme Court has recently been quite solicitous of the original understanding {{on the way in}} which federal power is to be distributed. In the face of a chorus of calls for innovative legislative action to undo a supposed government paralysis or to reverse a perceived concentration of authority in the executive branch, the Supreme Court has generally stuck to its guns, consistently reminding the Congress and the nation that policy inconsistent with the structure of government mandated by the Constitution is impermissible. So, for example, the Justices made short work of the legislative veto and of the <b>automatic</b> <b>budget</b> sequestration provisions of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. The principle of separation of powers, the Court explained in those cases, cannot yield to claimed gains in efficiency, for the constitutional rule that is subverted one day with the best intentions can just as easily be evaded the next day with the worst. Against this background, many observers were surprised by the Court 2 ̆ 7 s 7 -I vote last Term in Morrison v.

40|$|In this note, I {{examine how}} the {{responsiveness}} of the Swedish public budget to business-cycle conditions has developed between 1998 and 2009. I document substantial changes in three components behind the budget elasticity: (i) the average level of personal income taxes has fallen substantially, (ii) the progressivity of personal income taxation has increased, and (iii) spending on unemployment compensation has fallen. The first two changes have opposing effects on the budget elasticity, and I find that the higher progressivity has had a marginally larger impact on the elasticity than the tax cuts. Also allowing for the lower unemployment compensations, the three effects {{add up to a}} small and non-substantial fall in the budget elasticity. Considering that most of the components behind the budget elasticity are imprecisely estimated, there is no clear evidence that the Swedish budget elasticity has changed during the last decade. <b>Automatic</b> stabilizers; <b>budget</b> elasticity; fiscal policy; stabilization policy...|$|R
40|$|The global {{financial}} and economic crisis has revived {{the debate in}} the academic literature and in policy circles about the size and effectiveness of automatic fiscal stabilisers. Especially in the euro area where monetary policy is centralised and discretionary fiscal policy making is constrained by the EU fiscal rules, knowing the size and the effectiveness of automatic stabilisers is crucial. While automatic stabilisers are a fairly established concept in the fiscal policy literature, there is still no consensus about their actual nature and their effectiveness. This paper shows that differences in opinion mirror a deeper disagreement over how the budget would look like without automatic stabilisers. This issue is addressed by defining two types of counterfactual budgets giving rise to two different interpretations about the nature of automatic stabilisation. Simulations with a structural model confirm that the degree of smoothing is conditional on how the counterfactual budget, i. e. the <b>budget</b> without <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisers,</b> is defined. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Tax {{and social}} reforms aiming at {{lowering}} {{the tax burden}} and cutting social benefits may boost effciency and output, and improve market adjustment to shocks. But they may also reduce the impact of automatic stabilizers and so cause a less cyclical smoothing. This is problematic in the Economic and Monetary Union given the loss of national monetary autonomy. In this paper we {{examine the impact of}} the tax and social reforms of 1999 - 2005 in Germany on the automatic stabilizers. It is shown that the automatic stabilization power of several components of the public budget was changed by tax and social reforms. Nevertheless, it can be demonstrated that the automatic stabilization power of the public budget as a whole was not changed significantly.

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if there are significant emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) from a subarctic mire in northern Sweden. Subarctic peatlands in discontinuous permafrost regions are undergoing substantial environmental changes due to their high sensitivity to climate warming and there is need for including NMVOCs in the overall carbon <b>budget.</b> <b>Automatic</b> and manual chamber measurements were used to estimate NMVOC fluxes from three dominating subhabitats on the mire during three growing seasons. Emission rates varied and were related to plant species distribution and seasonal net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide. The highest fluxes were observed from wetter sites dominated by Eriophorum and Sphagnum spp. Total NMVOC emissions from the mire (∼ 17 ha) is estimated to consist of ∼ 150 kgC during a growing season with 150 d. NMVOC fluxes can account for ∼ 5 % of total net carbon exchange (− 3177 kgC) at the mire during the same period.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of the economy on the {{government}} budget as well as the effects of the budget on the economy. First, we provide measures of the effects of <b>automatic</b> stabilizers on <b>budget</b> outcomes at the federal and state and local levels. For the federal government, the deficit increases about 0. 35 percent of GDP for each 1 percentage point deviation of actual GDP relative to potential GDP. For state and local governments, the deficit increases by about 0. 1 percent of GDP. We then examine the response of the economy to the automatic stabilizers using the FRB/US model by comparing the response to aggregate demand shocks under two scenarios: with the automatic stabilizers in place and without the automatic stabilizers. Second, we provide measures of discretionary fiscal policy actions at the federal and state and local levels. We find that federal policy actions are somewhat counter-cyclical while state and local policy actions have been somewhat pro-cyclical.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Software {{testing is}} of {{critical}} importance {{for the success of}} software projects. Current inefficient testing methods often still take up half or more of a software project's <b>budget.</b> <b>Automatic</b> test data generation is the most promising way to lower the software testing cost. Manually creating testing data is expensive and often needs deep domain knowledge. Therefore, both industry and academia are always highly interested in automatic approaches to generating test data. Symbolic execution {{has been one of the}} most promising and exciting areas of automated testing research for many years now. In principle, symbolic execution "runs" a program, replacing concrete inputs with symbolic variables that represent all possible values. When a program branches, the execution takes both paths (if they are feasible under current constraints) and a set of path conditions on symbolic variables is modified for each path to record the new constraints on the symbolic values. However, scaling symbolic execution to large programs or programs with complex inputs remains difficult due to path explosion and complex constraints, as well as external method calls. Additionally, creating an effective test structure with symbolic inputs can be difficult. A popular symbolic execution strategy in practice is to perform symbolic execution not "from scratch" but based on existing test cases. This dissertation explores the idea that the effectiveness of this approach to symbolic execution can be enhanced by (1) reducing the size of seed test cases, (2) prioritizing seed test cases to maximize exploration efficiency, and (3) selecting a subset tests for symbolic execution without specifying the number of tests. The proposed test case reduction strategy is based on a recently introduced generalization of delta-debugging, and our prioritization and selection techniques include novel methods that, for this purpose, can outperform some traditional regression testing algorithms. Our results show that applying these methods can significantly improve the effectiveness of symbolic execution based on existing test cases...|$|R
