5|$|British {{military}} forces in Kenya were {{made aware of the}} revolution at 4:45am on 12 January, and following <b>a</b> <b>request</b> <b>from</b> the Sultan were put on 15 minutes' standby to conduct an assault on Zanzibar's airfield.

Crosthwait decided not to approve an immediate evacuation of British citizens, as many held key government positions and their sudden removal would further disrupt the country's economy and government. To avoid possible bloodshed, the British agreed a timetable with Karume for an organised evacuation.|$|E
