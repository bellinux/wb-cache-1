5|$|Subsequently, the Army {{decided to}} pursue {{development}} of another battlefield scout helicopter under the <b>Armed</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> <b>Helicopter</b> program; this resulted in another rotorcraft, designated as the Bell ARH-70, being selected and developed with the intention to replace the OH-58D {{in place of the}} Comanche. However, during October 2008, it was announced that the ARH-70 also met with cancellation, reportedly due to cost overruns on its development.|$|E

50|$|Heavy {{divisions}} (of {{which there}} are six) will have 48 Apaches, 38 Blackhawks, 12 Chinooks, and 12 Medevac helicopters in their aviation brigade. These will {{be divided into two}} aviation attack battalions, an assault lift battalion, a general aviation support battalion. An aviation support battalion will have headquarters, refuelling/resupply, repair/maintenance, and communications companies. Light divisions will have aviation brigades with 60 <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>helicopters</b> and no Apaches, with the remaining structure the same. The remaining divisions will have aviation brigades with 30 <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>helicopters</b> and 24 Apaches, with the remaining structure the same. Ten Army Apache helicopter units will convert to heavy attack reconnaissance squadrons, with 12 RQ-7B Shadow drones apiece. The helicopters to fill out these large, combined-arms division-level aviation brigades comes from aviation units that used to reside at the corps-level.|$|R
25|$|In 1989 and 1990 the RAAF's UH-1H Iroquois were {{subsequently}} {{transferred to the}} 171st Aviation Squadron in Darwin, Northern Territory and the 5th Aviation Regiment based in Townsville, Queensland following the decision that all battlefield helicopters would be operated by the Australian Army. On 21 September 2007, the Australian Army retired the last of their Bell UH-1s. The last flight occurred in Brisbane on that day with the aircraft replaced by MRH-90 medium <b>helicopters</b> and Tiger <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>helicopters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The XM157 Class IV UAV, was {{intended}} to provide reconnaissance, aerial communications extension capability at the brigade level for the United States Army's Future Combat Systems program. Other missions were to include land mine and improvised explosive device detection, standoff chemical, biological and radiological detection, and electronic intelligence collection. It was to be organic to the Reconnaissance Surveillance Target Acquisition Squadron within the FCS brigade combat team, which will consist of troops of manned <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>helicopters</b> (ARH) and a separate troop of Class IV UAVs. The FCS Class IV UAV Program was cancelled in January 2010.|$|R
25|$|The Bell ARH-70 Arapaho was an American four-bladed, single-engine, light {{military}} helicopter {{designed for}} the United States Army's <b>Armed</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (ARH) program.

25|$|The Tiger ARH (<b>Armed</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> <b>Helicopter)</b> is {{the version}} {{ordered by the}} Australian Army to replace its OH-58 Kiowas and UH-1 Iroquois-based 'Bushranger' gunships. The Tiger ARH is a {{modified}} and upgraded version of the Tiger HAP with upgraded MTR390 engines {{as well as a}} laser designator incorporated in the Strix sight for the firing of Hellfire II air-to-ground missiles. Instead of SNEB unguided rockets, the ARH will use 70mm (2.75in) rockets from Belgian developer, Forges de Zeebrugge (FZ). Twenty-two of the variant were ordered in December 2001. Most of the helicopters will be operated by the 1st Aviation Regiment based at Robertson Barracks in Darwin. The helicopter was shipped to Australia in part form and locally assembled at Brisbane Airport by Australia Aerospace.|$|E
25|$|Sikorsky S-76 SHADOW : Boeing-Sikorsky MANPRINT study. The {{original}} {{concept of}} the LHX program was to produce a one-man helicopter that could do more than a two-man aircraft. The Sikorsky (S-76) Helicopter Advance Demonstrator of Operators Workload (SHADOW) had a single-pilot advanced cockpit grafted to its nose. The purpose was to study the MANPRINT or human engineering interface between the pilot and the cockpit controls and displays. The cockpit was the prototype of a single-pilot cockpit designed for use on the prototype RAH-66 Comanche <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>helicopter.</b> The cockpit was designed so sensors would feed data to the pilot through helmet mounted displays. The MANPRINT study determined that single-pilot operation of the Comanche was unsafe, and would result in pilot overload. As result of this study, the Comanche {{was designed to be}} operated by a crew of two.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Army is {{primarily}} a light infantry force with equipment which may be carried by individual soldiers. It is also equipped with armoured vehicles and artillery; the Army is introducing more armoured vehicles into service {{as part of the}} 'hardened and networked army' initiative. The Army's armoured, mechanised and motorised units are currently equipped with 59 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, 774 M113 armoured personnel carriers (including vehicles in store), and 257 ASLAV armoured reconnaissance vehicles. 838 Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles are currently in service with 214 on order as of July 2012. The Army's artillery holdings consist of 112 L119 Hamel 105mm calibre towed guns, 36 155mm towed M198 howitzers, an unspecified number of 81mm mortars and 30 RBS-70 surface-to-air missiles. As of July 2015, Australian Army Aviation is equipped with 115 helicopters, including 19 Kiowa <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>helicopters,</b> 22 Eurocopter Tiger <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>helicopters,</b> 34 S-70A-9 Blackhawk, six CH-47D Chinooks, one CH-47F Chinook (with six on order), 27 of a planned 46 MRH 90 transport helicopters, and 12 Bell 206 training aircraft. The Army also operates 18 AAI RQ-7 Shadows as well as several ScanEagle and Skylark unmanned aerial vehicles. To support amphibious operations, the Army is equipped with 15 LCM-8 watercraft.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, the U.S. Department of Defense and the US Army {{made the}} {{decision}} to terminate the RAH-66 program. [...] As part of the termination, the Army retained the future years' funding intended for the Comanche. To replace the capability of the cancelled Comanche, the US Army planned several programs, including three new aircraft. The Army Staff decided that these three aircraft, the <b>Armed</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (ARH), the Light Utility Helicopter (LUH), and the Future Cargo Aircraft (FCA) (later renamed Joint Cargo Aircraft, or JCA), were to be existing, in-production commercial aircraft modified for Army service.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 December 2001, Eurocopter {{was awarded}} the {{contract}} to meet the Australian Army's [...] "AIR 87 requirement" [...] for 22 Tiger helicopters of the ARH (<b>Armed</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> <b>Helicopter)</b> version. Modifications from the standard Tiger included new communications and avionics systems, as well as compatibility with Australian safety requirements. Per the contract's terms, 18 of the 22 aircraft were assembled at Australian Aerospace's Brisbane facility, a subsidiary of Eurocopter. On 1 July 2007, because of delays in attaining operational capability, Australia's Defence Materiel Organisation stopped all payments {{in regards to the}} procurement. According to Australia's Department of Defense, by 2008 the main issues had been addressed and payments resumed accordingly. In October 2010, it was revealed that the helicopters will not be fully operational for another two years. In December 2011, the final Tiger ARH was delivered to the Australian Army.|$|E

500|$|The Boeing–Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche was {{intended}} to be an advanced five-blade <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> and attack <b>helicopter.</b> The Comanche was specifically tailored to the role of armed scout to replace the U.S. Army's OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, which is an upgraded version of a Vietnam War-era observation helicopter. It was both smaller and lighter than the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter that it had been intended to accompany. The RAH-66 was powered by a pair of LHTEC T800 turboshaft engines, each capable of generating up to 1,563 hp (1,165 kW) of power. The RAH-66's fuselage was [...] long and composed of composite materials; it was designed to be capable of fitting more readily onto transport ships, enabling the Comanche to be more rapidly deployed to flash points and other rapidly-developing situations. However, in the event of strategic transport assets not being available, the rotorcraft's ferry range of [...] would have allowed it to fly itself to battlefields overseas on its own.|$|R
