40|$|Background: Confusing look-alike drug names can harm patients’ {{safety and}} health. Ergonomic designs by {{emphasizing}} the differences of look-alike drug names (i. e., typographical method) have shown potential to improve name discrimination and perception. However, existing literature releases sparse and mixed evidence on the efficacy of typographical method. In addition, most studies were computer-based designs, which may block the generalization of findings from such designs to real-world settings. Moreover, few studies evaluated the interaction between typographical method and environmental interventions in reducing confusion errors. The dissertation was designed to fill these research gaps. Objectives: To {{examine the effects of}} typographical method, orthographic similarity, and pharmacy background on the differentiations of look-alike drug names; and to evaluate the influences of typographical method, format consistency, <b>attention</b> <b>grabber,</b> and time pressure on the visual searching of drugs that have look-alike names. Methodology: The dissertation was comprised of three experiments. A computer-based same/different judgement task was performed by 40 student pharmacists and 40 non-pharmacy students {{to examine the effects of}} typographical method, orthographic similarity, and pharmacy background on name differentiations (Experiment 1). For visual searching of look-alike drug names, two other experiments were conducted to assess the effects of typographical method, format consistency, <b>attention</b> <b>grabber,</b> and time pressure. Forty healthcare professionals in nursing were tested by performing a visual searching task in a high fidelity simulated pharmacy environment (Experiment 2) and another forty were tested with their eyes tracked in a computer-based design (Experiment 3). Results: In Experiment 1, all textual enhancement methods enabled participants to differentiate names more accurately and more easily than lowercase. A high degree of orthographic similarity yielded increased error rate and longer response time. Relative to non-pharmacy students, student pharmacists distinguished names more accurately and more easily. In Experiment 2, no textual enhancement method outperformed lowercase in the visual searching task. Response time was shortened if name formats on prescriptions and packages were identical. Turning on attention grabbers produced shorter response time, fewer mental efforts, and lower error likelihood. Participants perceived more mental efforts when co-workers or customers urged them in drug searching. In Experiment 3, highlighting the differences of look-alike drug names did not facilitate visual searching. Response time, fixation count, and fixation duration were lower when using identical formats on prescriptions and packages. Using attention grabbers improved accuracy, shortened response time, and reduced fixation count and duration. Conclusions: Highlighting the primary different portions of look-alike drug names (e. g., in boldface plus Tall Man lettering) could make names more distinctive, but it should not be the primary strategy to reduce confusion errors based on its non-significant influences on visual searching. More efforts should be paid on environmental interventions. Some recommendations are proposed: name formats on prescriptions and drug packages should be consistent; indicator lights to hint healthcare providers about locations of target drugs should be equipped on pharmacy shelves; co-workers and customers should not urge healthcare providers who are selecting drugs. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Ever since human beings stood upright, freeing their hands, they have been using natural pigments, earth colours and {{synthetic}} pigments to record their experiences. If the language is meant to communicate ideas and record events, then art was truly yhe first language. Colour is the most immediate form of non- verbal communication. We naturally react to colour as we have evolved with a certain understanding of it, partly because the survival of our ancestors depended on it with regard to what to consume and avoid.

As such, colour is an important face og contemporary design. We all, inherently, have preferences that inform our decisions when dealing with colour, and we are subject to all the cultural norms and understandings of colour usage that surround us. Colour is perhaps the first element that we register when we view something for the first time. Our cultural development and conditioning mean that we will naturally make associations based upon the colours we see, and these provide an idea of how we should react to an object or design that incorporates them. Colour attach meaning, and our reaction to this will depend upon cultural associations, trends, age and individual preferences...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this study: The {{objective of}} this study was to investigate the use of social media as a means to communicate with customers in an SME context. Two particular aspects were analyzed in this study. First, the role of social media was to be identified. Second, the study focused on the most important characteristics of social media in meeting the challenges in managing customer relationships. International business creates challenges for international business communication. International business communication perspective was taken into consideration in the present research. Methodology and Data: This is a single case study. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Interviews were conducted with the case company representative and communication specialists from other SMEs. A survey for the case company customers was used to collect data for this study. The respondents of the survey amounted to 2226 in total. Findings and Conclusion: From the interviews, four associations of the role of social media in corporate communication were identified. They are distributer, contact, listener, and <b>attention</b> <b>grabber.</b> The characteristics of social media use in SMEs were identified as 1) content can be perpetually fresh, 2) customers can select information, 3) community can form, unbounded by location and time. 4) digital interactivity redefines privacy and identity, 5) interactivity enables hyper impulsivity. During the study, "Water Army" (people who are paid to write posts), as a new phenomenon in the Chinese Internet environment, emerged.

40|$|Curiosity, as {{a strong}} {{motivator}} for exploration and discovery, {{has long been an}} underexplored but important emotional response in relation to technology. This research considers that it has great potential to improve many aspects of the user experience, especially in today’s screen-saturated context. However, engaging curiosity by novelty and uncertainty may exhaust attentional strength and challenge usability. Thus, the purpose of this research is to find ways to foster the human trait of curiosity and avoid its negative effects. To gain an in-depth understanding of curiosity, the first chapter reviews cross-disciplinary literature to expand its role in improving user experience. This ranges from serving as an <b>attention</b> <b>grabber</b> to including the values that contribute to human survival, thriving, emotional resilience, and personal development. The second chapter identifies problems in the current curiosity-provoking design methods. The chapter also emphasises design for supporting active curiosity and avoiding the creation of purely novel stimuli. This approach is to encourage active curiosity to develop. To this end, the research proceeds to conduct observational studies at a museum to broaden our understanding of factors that influence people’s curiosity and exploration within a screen-mediated context. Based on these observations, I identified that there are three conceptual elements: sociability, embodiment, and playfulness. Through theoretical discussion and reflection upon the design examples, subsequent three chapters explore the relationship between curiosity and each conceptual element. The chapters also suggest several design approaches that embrace curiosity in relation to its social, embodied, and playful nature. These include creating a sense of co-curiosity, allowing the use of covert and overt curiosity-satisfying strategies, increasing bodily exploration affordances of the screen for linking curiosity with embodiment, using metaphors of the body-screen relationship, and developing possibilities and adding enchanting effects for eliciting playfulness to enrich curiosity. In essence, this research enhances our understanding of the user experience from the perspective of curiosity, and these design suggestions also help to embrace users’ active curiosity in developing sociable, embodied, and playful well-being in the age of ubiquitous screens...|$|E

Subjective ratings of perceived "Urgency" and "Attention grabbing" were also measured. An interruption in recall was found caused by the words, but no effects were related to the semantic content or to the way they were spoken. Interestingly, results showed that participants rated action words as more urgent and <b>attention</b> <b>grabbing</b> than neutral words and non-words. However, neutral words generated higher ratings than the non-words. Participants also experienced higher urgency and <b>attention</b> <b>grabbing</b> effect by words that were spoken "urgent" than those spoken "calm", independent of whether they were negative or neutral. In conclusion it is argued there is a dissociation between subjective and objective measurements.

40|$|One’s {{own face}} {{possesses}} two properties {{that make it}} prone to grab attention: it is a face and, in addition, it is a self-referential stimulus. The {{question of whether the}} self-face is actually an especially <b>attention</b> <b>grabbing</b> stimulus was addressed by using a face-name interference paradigm. We investigated whether interference from a flanking self-face on the processing of a target classmate’s name was stronger than interference from a classmate’s flanking face on the processing of one’s own name as the target. In a control condition a third familiar face served as the flanker for both decisions from the participant’s own name and from the classmate’s name. The presentation of the self-face as a flanker produced significantly more interference on the identification of a classmate’s name than the presentation of that classmate’s face did on the identification of one’s own name. This result was due to the interfering power of the self-face and not to a particular resistance of one’s name to interfering facial stimuli. We argue that the emotional value or the high familiarity of one’s own face may explain its <b>attention</b> <b>grabbing</b> property. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{prevailing}} competition-based market economy, {{there is}} a need for marketing communication to be effective in order to retain customers and attract the new ones. One of the most popular modes of marketing communication – advertising, now has to find ways to be <b>attention</b> <b>grabbing</b> and persuading among the enormous amounts of advertisements. Therefore, creativity becomes crucially important. Using metaphors, which cause consumers to understand one or some elements of the advertisement in terms of another, is the possible technique to make an advertisement creative. Moreover, as visual elements of the advertisement are considered as more <b>attention</b> <b>grabbing</b> than the verbal ones, the assumption can be made that the usage of visual metaphors in advertising is the method leading into the effectiveness of advertising. Nevertheless, subtleties such as product category may have the impact on the consumers’ associations with the brand developed through advertising with visual metaphors and perceived value of the product; and the question rises whether this impact is positive or negative. The aim of this research is to determine the impact of visual metaphors on the effectiveness of milk advertising.
