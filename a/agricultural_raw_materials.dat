40|$|The upward {{movement}} {{in oil and}} food prices in the 2000 s has attracted interest in the information transmission mechanism between the two markets. This paper investigates the volatility spillover between oil, food consumption item, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> price indexes for the period January 1980 to April 2008. The results of the Cheung-Ng procedure show that variation in oil prices does not Granger cause the variance in food and <b>agricultural</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> prices. Since there is no volatility spillover from oil markets to food and <b>agricultural</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> markets, investors can benefit from risk diversification. However, there is bi-directional spillover between <b>agricultural</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> and food markets...|$|R

Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia are currently the biggest exporters, giving the majority of global trade. However, Balassa indices were the highest for Uganda, Ethiopia and Honduras, suggesting unreasonable specialisation patterns. Furthermore, stability and duration tests show significantly changing trends, implying fierce competition in these markets...|$|R

Transportation facilities had been developed to exploit the transit trade of South Africa, Swaziland, Rhodesia, Malawi, and Zambia, agricultural production for export purposes had been encouraged, and profitable arrangements for the export of labour had been made with neighbouring countries. Industrial production had been relatively insignificant, but did begin to increase in the 1960s. The economic structure generally favoured the taking of profits to Portugal rather than their reinvestment in Mozambique. The Portuguese interests which dominate in banking, industry, and agriculture, exerted a powerful influence on policy.|$|E
