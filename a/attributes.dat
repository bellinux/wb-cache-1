30|$|Recently, Turkmen et al. (2017) have {{proposed}} a policy analysis framework for XACML policies based on SMT. The framework supports the verification of a large range of properties including the robustness of XACML policies against two types of <b>attribute</b> hiding attacks, namely partial <b>attribute</b> hiding and general <b>attribute</b> hiding. Partial <b>attribute</b> hiding analyzes the case where a user hides a single <b>attribute</b> name-value pair, whereas general <b>attribute</b> hiding extends partial <b>attribute</b> hiding by assuming that a user completely suppresses information about one <b>attribute.</b> However, this work only allows verifying whether a policy is vulnerable to <b>attribute</b> hiding attacks.

5|$|Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} God {{is too great}} for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a {{complete}} and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, God {{is often referred to}} by titles and <b>attributes</b> (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism; such doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view that God is single and has no equal. The Bahá'í teachings state that the <b>attributes</b> which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own <b>attributes</b> in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.|$|E

40|$|Quality <b>attribute</b> {{requirements}} such {{as those}} for performance, security, modifiability, reliability, and usability have a significant influence on the software architecture of a system. At the Software Engineering Institute, we are studying and codifying the relationship between quality <b>attribute</b> requirements and the architectural design strategies that impact their achievement. In CMU/SEI- 2000 -TN- 017, we introduced the notion of quality <b>attribute</b> design primitives. Quality <b>attribute</b> design primitives (or <b>attribute</b> primitives) are architectural building blocks that target the achievement of one or sometimes several quality <b>attribute</b> requirements. Our intent is to codify a fairly comprehensive set of <b>attribute</b> primitives {{in a manner that}} articulates how each <b>attribute</b> primitive makes its specific contribution toward the achievement of one or several <b>attribute</b> goals. We believe this will provide a very powerful language for constructing or analyzing software architectures in relation to quality <b>attribute</b> requirements. To determine the expressive and explanatory power of these <b>attribute</b> primitives, we will examine various classes of systems. This paper uses <b>attribute</b> primitives to examine the qualities of Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) -based systems. In particular, we find that <b>attribute</b> primitives hold promise for providing insight into the quality <b>attribute</b> consequences of using various EJB infrastructure features...|$|R

In addition, this paper compares the new tree-walking approach with previous matching-based approaches and applicative approaches based on function caching.
