5|$|Witnesses {{reported}} seeing a parachute drifting {{away from the}} falling F-100F, leading to the hope that a pilot had ejected, but when the parachute was located it {{was determined to be}} <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> parachute that is meant to be deployed on landing to help slow the fighter down.|$|E
5|$|At some {{distance}} {{back from the}} leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E
5|$|From March 2013, {{concerns}} over further currency war diminished, though in November several journalists and analysts warned {{of a possible}} fresh outbreak. The likely principal source of tension appeared to shift once again, this time not being the U.S. versus China or the Eurozone versus Japan, but the U.S. versus Germany. In late October U.S. treasury officials had criticized Germany for running an excessively large current account surplus, thus acting as <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> on the global economy.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>dragging</b> {{death is}} <b>a</b> death caused by someone being dragged behind or {{underneath}} a moving vehicle, whether accidental or as a deliberate act of murder. If it is homicide, {{then it is}} also known as <b>a</b> <b>dragging</b> murder. An infamous example of <b>a</b> <b>dragging</b> murder is that of the African American James Byrd Jr., who was dragged to death by three men in Jasper, Texas in 1998. The case received extensive publicity around the world as a hate crime.|$|R

5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the stellar wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E
5|$|As in its predecessor, System Shock, {{gameplay}} in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of {{the action}} role-playing game and survival horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the experience as a standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a role-playing system allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a heads-up display that shows character and weapon information, a map, and <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> and drop inventory.|$|E

5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the actors}} {{cast in the}} four leading roles, only Gina McKee {{was a native of}} North East England, and she was from Sunderland rather than from Newcastle. McKee related {{strongly}} to many of the characters and story elements in the scripts and was very keen to play Mary, but the production team was initially uncertain whether {{it would be possible to}} age her up convincingly enough to portray the character in her 50s. McKee was concerned that she would not be given the part after an unsuccessful makeup test where efforts to make her appear to be in her 50s resulted in her resembling <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> queen.|$|E
5|$|Hill raced at open {{competitions}} and Top Fuel {{events from}} 1955 until {{he retired in}} 1966. After opening a motorcycle shop, he returned several years later to race motorcycles. He started racing drag boats after attending <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> boat event in 1974 and he won championships {{in all of the}} major boat drag racing sanctioning bodies. Hill set the lowest wet elapsed time (e.t.) record with a 5.16-second run, which was lower than the land drag racing record of 5.39seconds. He quit water drag racing after he suffered broken bones at a crash in Arizona and returned to land drag racing in 1985. Initially underfunded and unsuccessful, Hill set the all-time speed record at a National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) event in 1987, becoming the first person to hold both the land and water speed records simultaneously. In 1993, Hill became the NHRA's oldest Top Fuel champion. When Hill retired in 1999, he had won 12national season point championships on land or water, and had won more than 100trophies in motorcycles and 86drag events between his land and water careers.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) are {{suspicious}} that Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) new boyfriend Paul (Will Forte) is using her. Pete and Liz follow Paul {{to a bar}} and find out {{that he is a}} Jenna Maroney impersonator, performing as her in <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> show. The next day, Liz asks Jenna if she knows what Paul does, but Jenna is aware of his work, having met Paul at a Jenna Maroney impersonator contest in which he won and Jenna herself placed fourth. Liz does not approve of the relationship and confronts Paul, asking what his intentions are with Jenna. Paul tells her that he is not using Jenna to further his career, but that he is with her because she accepts him for who he is. Liz is convinced by their touching (although weird) display of care for each other, ultimately approving of their relationship.|$|E

25|$|Drag is {{a special}} form of {{performance}} art based on the act of cross-dressing. <b>A</b> <b>drag</b> queen is usually a male-assigned person who performs as an exaggeratedly feminine character, in heightened costuming sometimes consisting of a showy dress, high-heeled shoes, obvious make-up, and wig. <b>A</b> <b>drag</b> queen may imitate famous female film or pop-music stars. A faux queen is a female-assigned person employing the same techniques.|$|E
