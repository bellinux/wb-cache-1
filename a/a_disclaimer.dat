5|$|In the film, Koskov and Whitaker {{repeatedly}} use {{vehicles and}} drug packets {{marked with the}} Red Cross. This action angered a number of Red Cross Societies, which sent letters of protest regarding the film. In addition, the British Red Cross attempted to prosecute the filmmakers and distributors. However, no legal action was taken. As a result, <b>a</b> <b>disclaimer</b> was added {{at the start of}} the film and some DVD releases.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{critical}} buzz surrounding the show, BBC1 Controller, Michael Grade, quickly announced that the series would be repeated on BBC1, stating, “I think it will reach a wider audience and it deserves it”, and so Edge of Darkness was duly shown, in double episodes, over three consecutive nights between 19 December and 21 December 1985, the fastest time between original broadcast and repeat in the BBC's history. These repeats were accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>disclaimer</b> that the GAIA organisation depicted in the programme was not connected with the Gaia publishing company supported by Prince Philip. It was a move that paid off – Edge of Darkness doubled its audience on BBC1 to 8 million viewers.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum {{investigated}} a {{claim that}} Borislow falsely marketed the magicJack as having a free 30-day trial of the product. In reality, the customer must specifically cancel the trial prior to the 30-day mark, otherwise the credit card would be automatically billed. While Borislow maintained that his company's actions were not illegal, he reached a settlement on April 15, agreeing to pay the state of Florida $125,000 {{for the cost of}} the investigation. He said the company resolved over 500 complaints and added <b>a</b> <b>disclaimer</b> on the website clarifying the misconception.|$|E
5|$|Hershey Creamery Company, {{also known}} as Hershey's Ice Cream, is a creamery that {{produces}} Hershey's brand ice cream, sorbet, sherbet, and frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats such as smoothies and frozen slab style ice cream mixers. Founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 (all of whom have no relation to Milton S. Hershey and the chocolate company that he founded, also in 1894), it {{was taken over by}} the Holder family in the 1920s. The company {{was one of the first}} to offer consumers pre-packaged ice cream pints. In 1998, it modernized its operations to increase efficiency and reduce overhead. With their shared names and cities of origin, Hershey Creamery and Hershey Company have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court, with the creamery agreeing to add <b>a</b> <b>disclaimer</b> to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with The Hershey Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{privilege}} of peerage extends to all temporal peers and peeresses {{regardless of their}} position {{in relation to the}} House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from the privilege, and is held by only some peers (see History of reform of the House of Lords). Scottish peers from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish peers from the Act of Union 1800, therefore, have the {{privilege of}} peerage. From 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose the privilege of peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary peers of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their privilege of peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing <b>a</b> <b>disclaimer</b> under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963 loses all privileges of peerage. The privilege of peerage also extends to wives and widows of peers. A peeress by marriage loses the privilege upon marrying a commoner, but a peeress suo jure does not. Individuals who hold courtesy titles, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. Lords Spiritual (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the privilege of peerage as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{prosecution}} <b>disclaimer</b> {{is another}} type of disclaimer in patent law. Under United States patent law <b>a</b> prosecution <b>disclaimer</b> is <b>a</b> statement made by a patent applicant during examination of a patent application which can limit the scope of protection provided by the resulting patent. It is one type of file-wrapper estoppel, the other being prosecution history estoppel.|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, {{the opening}} sixteen minutes contain no English language, {{which made the}} audiences {{think that it was}} a foreign subtitled film, and caused walk-outs.

25|$|As {{part of the}} Single Audit, {{the auditor}} must prepare and submit three {{individual}} reports to the recipient and to the federal government. The first report is an opinion, or <b>a</b> <b>disclaimer</b> thereof, on whether the recipient’s financial statements are presented in conformity with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, identical to a financial audit’s report on a non-recipient entity. The second report is {{about the status of}} internal controls relative to the financial statements and major programs. The third report is an opinion, or <b>a</b> <b>disclaimer</b> thereof, on {{the degree to which the}} recipient has complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the federal assistance awards. Following the last two reports, if the Single Audit produced audit findings, the auditor must prepare the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs discussed earlier.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{following}} day, Sony Pictures appealed the ruling, {{saying it would}} pull the film if the decision to cut it was not reversed.

25|$|Workers {{were given}} the right {{to belong to a}} {{registered}} trade union or not to belong to a registered or unregistered trade union. Collective agreements were to be legally enforceable unless <b>a</b> <b>disclaimer</b> clause was inserted. There was a greater chance that collective 'no strike' clauses could be implied into individual contracts of employment. Only registered trade unions had legal rights and to enjoy legal immunities. Continued registration was dependent on the organisation having rules which specified how, when and by whom, authority was to be exercised, especially concerning the taking of industrial action.|$|E
25|$|Yeh Rastey Hain Pyar Ke, a 1963 {{suspense}} thriller starring Sunil Dutt, Leela Naidu and Rehman, was {{the first}} Bollywood film which seemed to exploit the case. It flopped at the box office. The film began with <b>a</b> <b>disclaimer</b> that all people and incidents were fictitious, and altered the case's outcome. Leela Naidu's 2010 book with Jerry Pinto indicates that the movie screenplay was written before the Nanavati case. It was a coincidence of the real-life case events with a similar movie storyline that led to similarities while the movie was being made.|$|E

25|$|Draws are {{conducted}} soon after all tickets {{are sold at}} the NSW Lotteries offices, and prizes can be claimed the day after; summaries are often printed in major newspapers. For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each morning at the NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one. The lesser demand for Mega Jackpot means {{that a number of}} weeks often passes between draws. Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased today may drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw. NSW Lotteries now adds <b>a</b> <b>disclaimer</b> to this effect when advertising these lotteries.|$|E

In {{an open letter to}} Warner Music Japan, the association asked Warner Music to edit out scenes from the video which depicted Kyary Pamyu Pamyu drinking straight from a bottle, as well as other drunken scenes. Warner responded by adding <b>a</b> <b>disclaimer</b> against fast drinking and underage drinking to the description box of the YouTube video, and released a statement in the media stating that the video was not meant to promote alcohol to minors.|$|E
