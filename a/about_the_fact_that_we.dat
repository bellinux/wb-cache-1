He asserts that in these [...] "archaic" [...] cultures, people [...] "have a much clearer idea <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can not be only what we are if at the same time, we are also what we are not, {{and that we can}} only know who we are if we experience our boundaries". He denounces Western scientists and anthropologists for their approaches to the study of such cultures, arguing that they have misrepresented them by attempting to fit them within the Western ideas of objectivity. He argues that in future, anthropologists must reach their own boundaries, and recognize the wilderness of their consciousness before they can truly understand the worldview of [...] "archaic" [...] humans.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in August 2005, Key explained that the album was a [...] "definite departure" [...] and [...] "more political" [...] than what Ocean Avenue had contained. In discussion of the album, Key said that the band had matured and that the music in Lights and Sounds would be different from their previous album. Though, Key added, [...] "...we have to be careful, {{we have to try}} and write songs [...] we wrote before. We have to make a conscious effort not to think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> went from being a nothing band... to having a bunch of hit singles in like, one year." [...] Printz Board of The Black Eyed Peas collaborated with Yellowcard on the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty" [...] where he played a trumpet solo. The song, [...] "How I Go", features a duet with Dixie Chicks' lead vocalist Natalie Maines, and features a twenty-five piece orchestra, which was conducted by violinist Sean Mackin. According to Peter Mosely, the band liked the Dixie Chicks' and even thought of collaborating with Maines on Ocean Avenue for the song [...] "View from Heaven". Mosely also revealed that the band approached Maines about singing on [...] "How I Go"; [...] "The original plan was just for her to sing back-up (on the song). [...] it ended up turning into a duet." [...] He also added that Maines took a demo of the song and returned to the studio, Sunset Sound, where the band were working, in addition to the Dixie Chicks working on their album, with lyrics and vocals of her own.|$|E

The song contains [...] "glittering" [...] chord progressions of a 1980s nightclub. According to Talia Kraines of BBC, the cover is an [...] "almost exact reworking" [...] of the original. This is followed by pop track [...] "Ace Reject", lyrically inspired by dysfunctional relationships. Buchanan spoke of the song's concept and meaning, saying: [...] "It's <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> break up and make up and we don't know why." [...] The UK bonus track, [...] "Better", features an [...] "ooh-ooh-ooh" [...] backing vocal and is lyrically about overcoming one's problems. The song was compared to [...] "Thank You" [...] by Jamelia. The album's twelfth and closing track is [...] "2 Hearts", an acoustic-driven pop ballad that incorporates European electropop. The song's instrumentation consists of guitars, horns, beats, bass, percussion and strings. It also features a string grandeur {{similar to that of}} Hybrid. The song is reminiscent of [...] "Grace Under Pressure" [...] by Elbow.|$|E

2500|$|The {{group has}} been the focus of controversy, both inside and outside the animal rights movement. Newkirk and, formerly, Pacheco are seen as the leading {{exporters}} of animal rights to the more traditional animal-protection groups in the United States, but sections of the movement nonetheless say that PETA is not radical enough—law professor Gary Francione lists the group among what he calls [...] "the new welfarists," [...] arguing that its work with industries to achieve reform, which continues in the tradition of Henry Spira, makes it an animal welfare group, not an animal rights group. Newkirk told Salon in 2001 that PETA works toward the ideal but tries in the meantime to provide carrot-and-stick incentives."What I say to myself all the time is that we have our heads in the clouds looking for Utopia, but we have our feet firmly planted on the ground dealing with reality. We make no bones <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> want an end to all cruelty to animals. But I think the meat industry and the leather industry and the experimenters understand, especially if we're fighting them, that we will back off if they move society and their industry a step forward. We're not going to stop everything overnight, so while we work for the ideal we certainly wish to provide the carrot-and-stick incentives to move along toward that goal."Animals are going to die by the millions today in all sorts of ugly ways for all sorts of ridiculous, insupportable reasons. If one animal who is lying in a battery egg farm cage could have the extra room to stretch her wing today because of something you've done, I think she would choose to have that happen." [...] There has also been criticism from feminists within the movement about the use of scantily clad women in PETA's anti-fur campaigns and others, but as Norm Phelps notes, [...] "Newkirk has been consistent in her response. No one, she says, is being exploited. Everyone ... is an uncoerced volunteer. Sexual attraction is a fact of life, and if it can advance the animals' cause, she makes no apologies for using it." [...] Also, Phelps notes that some activists believe that the group's media stunts trivialize animal rights, but he qualifies this by saying, [...] "t's hard to argue with success and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world." [...] Newkirk's view is that PETA has a duty to be [...] "press sluts." [...] She argues, [...] "It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves." [...] PETA has also faced criticism for it's targeting of children, such as distributing comic books entitled Your Mommy Kills Animals.|$|E

5000|$|Rothman and Swartz left Dimension in 1975. She {{tried to}} break out the {{exploitation}} field but struggled. I had good agents and together we {{tried very hard to}} get me work, but we repeatedly discovered I was stigmatized by the films I had made. The irony was that I made them in order to prove that I had the skills to make more ambitious films, but no one would give me the chance. Then there was the other reason, the so-called elephant in the room: I was a woman. No one told me directly, but I often learned indirectly that this was the decisive reason why many producers wouldn't agree to meet me. If that sounds exaggerated, remember that I worked in the American film industry from 1965 to 1974, and some of those years I was the only woman directing feature films.She later elaborated:I couldn't get any work in television. No one would even meet me... When it came to feature films, I was once invited by an executive at MGM to go and meet her, which was in the days when there were very few female filmmakers at all. I went and met her and she said to me, [...] "We were in a story meeting yesterday.

[...] My response when I heard that was, [...] "Well, if you want a vampire film like Stephanie Rothman made, why don't you get Stephanie Rothman?" [...] Rothman sold a script, Carhops, which was later filmed as Starhops (1978), but it was changed {{to such a degree that}} Rothman took her name off it.
