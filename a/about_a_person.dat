5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell Bellman jokes <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little}} or no connection to the poet. The first known Bellman joke is in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the jokes were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The jokes have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|In Makidani, Yamasaki, Shisō District, Harima Province (now within Shisō, Hyōgo Prefecture), a tale {{was passed}} down <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> in Karakawa {{who was a}} bakeneko. The same kind of tale was also found in Taniguchi, Fukusaki village, Jinsai District, of the same province, where {{it is said that}} in Kongōjō-ji, a bakeneko who troubled a {{villager}} was killed by someone from the temple. This bakeneko was protected from arrows and bullets by a chagamas lid and an iron pot. These, like the legend of Susanoo's extermination of Yamata no Orochi, have a commonality in that the local old families of the area played a role.|$|E
25|$|This psycho-physical {{process is}} further linked with {{psychological}} craving, manas (conceit) and ditthi (dogmas, views). One {{of the most}} problematic views according to the Buddha, {{is the notion of}} a permanent and solid Self or 'pure ego'. This is because in early Buddhist psychology, there is no fixed self (atta; Sanskrit atman) but the delusion of self and clinging to a self concept affects all one's behaviors and leads to suffering. For the Buddha, there is nothing uniform or substantial <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> only a constantly changing stream of events or processes categorized under five categories called skandhas (heaps, aggregates), which includes the stream of consciousness (Vijñāna-sotam). False belief and attachment to an abiding ego-entity {{is at the root of}} most negative emotions.|$|E

25|$|The {{more time}} {{participants}} {{are allowed to}} make some judgment <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> the more they will weigh information beyond physical appearance.

In {{a study of the}} interaction between ratings of people in speed dating and the form of media used to present them, impression accuracy in a speed dating task was not significantly different when a potential date was presented in person versus in a video. However, impressions of dates made via video were to be much more negative than those made in person. An additional study that looked at characterization of a romantic partner suggested that {{people are more likely to}} rely on “gut reactions” when meeting in person, but there isn't sufficient information for this kind of evaluation when viewing someone online.|$|E
25|$|The text, in Book 7, {{describes}} {{the legend of}} a bhagavata (devotee) named Prahlada. He {{is described as a}} boy full of virtues, but who is born to a demon king who is persecuting people for their independent and different religious beliefs in favor of Vishnu. Prahlada disagrees with his father, resists him, and pursues what he feels is right. In this legend, and many others, the text challenges presumption and stereotypes <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> based on birth and heredity, as well as encourages the readers through the character of Prahlada to resist threats, harassment and indoctrination from anyone. The Purana, state Gupta and Valpey, implies that virtues and vices are an individual's attribute and a person must be seen for who he is, rather than assumed to be following his parents because of hereditary circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Eddy and Boyd, who {{question}} {{the value of}} several of the Talmudic references state that the significance of the Talmud to historical Jesus research is that it never denies the existence of Jesus, but accuses him of sorcery, thus indirectly confirming his existence. R. T. France and separately Edgar V. McKnight state that the divergence of the Talmud statements from the Christian accounts and their negative nature indicate that they are <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who existed. Craig Blomberg states that the denial of the existence of Jesus was never part of the Jewish tradition, which instead accused him of being a sorcerer and magician, as also reflected in other sources such as Celsus. Andreas Kostenberger states that the overall conclusion that can be drawn from the references in the Talmud is that Jesus was a historical person whose existence was never denied by the Jewish tradition, which instead focused on discrediting him.|$|E

25|$|The remake {{version of}} the video is <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who loses touch with himself. Originally full of life, the protagonist becomes a robot working a {{monotonous}} office job. One morning, he wakes up from a dream of a beautiful girl dressed in white on the beach. He leaves for work, and his buried alter egos, dressed in white shirts, black slacks, assorted ties and each holding either red or white roses, emerge mysteriously. At work, his boss gives him a stack of paperwork, which he does mechanically. Meanwhile, at home, the alter egos are {{in a circle around}} his coffee table, throw the roses in the center, and leave. Back at work, he prepares to go home, but is then given another stack of documents. His frustrations boil over, and he throws his tie at his boss. He runs home not knowing what he is running for, and at the moment that he walks in the door, the last of the alter egos exits. He finds a white box that replaced his coffee table and is intrigued. He unwraps the red and white ribbons and opens the box to find himself on the beach with the same girl in his dream and the roses on the water.|$|E

Its lyrics illustrate a woman getting [...] "fierce" [...] when taken for granted as stated by Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune. She questions the loyalty of her male love interest and he {{is believed to be}} cheating on her with another woman. Claire Lobendfeld of Complex interpreted the song as being <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> fighting with his own feelings of jealousy. She felt that instead of flirting with other people during a night out to make a lover jealous, the protagonist goes for a [...] "downtrodden" [...] direction and reconnects with old people from her past.|$|E

500|$|On the {{creation}} of Yang, Shonda Rhimes said the character contained [...] "a little bit of [...] personality". Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said: [...] "Cristina was second, simply because she's {{the kind of woman}} I know really well, and I like her. There's something interesting <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who is that driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with." [...] Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: [...] "Thank God I did not get that part", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson. Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: [...] "She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Trapped Under Ice" [...] is <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who wakes from a cryonic state. Realizing {{there is}} nowhere to go, and no-one {{will come to the}} rescue, the person helplessly awaits {{impending}} doom. The song is built on a fast-picked galloping riff, reminiscent of the album's opener. It was inspired by a track Hammett's former band Exodus had demoed called [...] "Impaler", which was later released on that band's 2004 album Tempo of the Damned. [...] "Escape" [...] was originally titled [...] "The Hammer" [...] and was intended to be released as a single due to its lighter riffs and conventional song structure. The intro features a counterpoint bass melody and a chugging guitar riff that resolves into a standard down-stroked riff. Authors Mick Wall and Malcolm Dome felt the song was influenced by the album-oriented rock of 1970s bands such as Journey and Foreigner, but fans perceived it as an attempt for airplay at rock radio. Metallica performed [...] "Escape" [...] live only once, at the 2012 Orion Music+ More festival, while performing Ride the Lightning in its entirety.|$|E
500|$|The first {{music video}} debuted on July 14, {{featuring}} the song [...] "Tacky".

The video was filmed at Palace Theatre in downtown Los Angeles, previously featured as Julianne Moore's apartment in 1998 film The Big Lebowski. Yankovic specified that during {{each of the six}} continuous takes, he would have to rush down five flights of stairs while changing his outfit in order to appear in {{the beginning and end of}} the video. The video for [...] "Word Crimes" [...] features kinetic typography created by Jarrett Heather, reflecting the song's theme of proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The [...] "Foil" [...] video, produced in conjunction with CollegeHumor, shows Yankovic as the host of a cooking show obsessing on the use of aluminium foil, suddenly descending into conspiracy theories; it also includes guest appearances by Patton Oswalt, Tom Lennon, and Robert Ben Garant.|$|E
