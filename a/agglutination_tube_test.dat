Test data consisted of results from 1208 cattle in brucellosis-free herds, 1578 cattle in reactor herds of unknown infection status and 174 cattle from which Brucella abortus had been cultured. The complement fixation test had the highest specificity in both nonvaccinated and vaccinated cattle. The indirect enzyme immunoassay, if interpreted at a high threshold, also exhibited a high specificity in both groups of cattle. The hemolysis-in-gel test had a very high specificity when used in nonvaccinated cattle but quite a low specificity among vaccinates. With {{the exception of the}} complement fixation test, all tests had high sensitivities if interpreted at the minimum threshold. However, the sensitivities of the standard <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> and indirect enzyme immunoassay, when interpreted at high thresholds were comparable to that of the complement fixation test. A kappa statistic was used to measure the agreement between the various tests.

A total of 362 serum samples were obtained from 8 different dog shelters in Üstanbul and Üzmir provinces. The dogs were temporarily kept in these shelters. Of the 362 serum samples, 46 (12. 7 %), 28 (7. 73 %) and 27 (7. 45 %) were found to be positive by TAT, 2 ME-TAT and ELISA, respectively. Dogs in 6 (75 %) out of the 8 kennels were found to be positive for B. canis. The prevalence of seropositive animals were ranged between 5. 26 % and 31. 57 %, 5 % and 17. 54 %, and 2. 12 % and 15. 78 % by TAT, 2 ME-TAT and ELISA tests, respectively. Amongst the 46 sera evaluated as positive by TAT, 18 (39. 1 %) and 19 (41. 3 %) were found to be negative by 2 ME-TAT and ELISA tests, respectively. A 96. 42 % similarity was found between 2 ME-TAT and ELISA results. In conclusion, the <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> when used together with additional tests such as 2 ME-TAT and ELISA would be useful in eliminating the false-positive results obtained in serological diagnosis of B. canis infection of dogs. Similar results were observed between 2 ME-TAT and ELISA tests. Because B. canis antibodies were detected in sera of dogs from most of the shelters examined, it is concluded that preventive measures should be taken to eliminate B. canis from the entire dog population and carrier dogs should be kept separated from uninfected animals.
