40|$|There is {{a strong}} link between solubility, and thus crystallisation, and the {{molecular}} interactions of proteins in dilute salt solutions. Such molecular interactions are governed by the weak interaction forces (electrostatic, hydration and hydrophobic). Such forces can be quantitatively estimated {{in terms of a}} second virial self-coefficient (B 22) and a second virial cross-coefficient (B 23) for a single and a binary protein system, respectively. Previous studies confirmed the relation between a value of the second virial coefficient and a type of interaction (attractive or repulsive). The aim of this thesis is to correlate the second virial coefficient with the solubility and nucleation for single and binary protein systems. Model proteins used in this work are lysozyme and ovalbumin from egg-white, and α-amylase from Bacillus Licheniformis (BLA). The measurements are performed for sodium chloride and <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>solutions</b> in an acidic pH at 20 oC. Interaction chromatography is used in this work to estimate the B 22 and B 23 values for the model proteins in salt solutions. From the measured values of B 22 and B 23, the type of interaction is generalised {{as a function of the}} salt type, salt concentration, pH and protein type. For the single protein systems, in <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>solutions</b> (0. 1 - 2. 4 M) at pH 4. 0 and 7. 0, repulsion or no interactions are observed below 0. 8 M and, as the salt concentrations are increased attractive self-interactions are observed for the model proteins. However, for the sodium chloride solutions (0. 1 - 2. 0 M) at pH 4. 0 and 7. 0, the interaction patterns vary with the salt concentration, the pH and the type of protein studied. A common feature of the self-interaction for all the model proteins is the attractive interactions close to the isoelectric point. For the binary protein systems, three distinct regions are observed in the <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>solutions</b> (0. 1 - 1. 6 M) at pH in the range 4. 0 - 7. 0. Attractive or no cross-interactions are observed at low salt concentrations (< 0. 5 M). At the intermediate salt concentrations (0. 5 - 1. 0 M), the cross-interactions are constant and near zero. This is followed by a sharp increase in the attractive interactions above 1. 0 M <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> concentrations. However, for sodium chloride solutions (0. 1 - 1. 6 M) at pH 4. 0 - 7. 0, two distinct regions are observed. Attraction or no interactions are observed at low salt concentrations (< 0. 5 M) and above 0. 5 M concentrations of sodium chloride, negligible cross-interactions are observed between model proteins. For the single protein system, an overall increase in the solubility of three model proteins is observed with an increase in the concentrations of <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and also for sodium chloride solutions except for BLA, where a salting-in behaviour is observed. Linear regression is used on the solubility data to determine the parameters of the Cohn equation (β and Ks) where the values of β vary with solution pH, protein type and salt type. The values of Ks vary with protein type and salt type. However, it is insensitive to the solution pH for lysozyme in <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> ovalbumin in sodium chloride and BLA in <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>solutions.</b> For the binary protein system, the presence of ovalbumin had a measurable effect on lysozyme solubility at pH < 5. 0 in both salts. In low concentration sodium chloride solutions (< 0. 3 M), a decrease in the solubility of lysozyme was observed with the presence of ovalbumin at acidic pH < 5. 0. However, in <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>solutions,</b> the lysozyme solubility increases with the addition of ovalbumin in the salt concentration range 1. 6 - 2. 0 M and at pH < 4. 0. The primary nucleation threshold values are also determined for lysozyme in sodium chloride and <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>solutions.</b> In sodium chloride solutions (0. 2 - 1. 0 M), the critical supersaturation values increase as the solution pH is raised from 4. 0 to 7. 0; however in <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>solutions</b> (1. 0 - 2. 0 M), the reverse effect is observed. The critical supersaturation required to nucleate lysozyme in <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>solutions</b> is approximately three times higher than in sodium chloride solutions. For the single protein systems, the measured values of solubility and B 22 were correlated using published models (RSL and HDW). For each protein-salt combination, a reasonable single correlation between solubility and B 22 is possible as the salt concentrations and pH are varied. There are separate correlations for sodium chloride and <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>solutions.</b> Based on the correlation curve of solubility and B 22, it is proposed that the acidic pH range (4. 0 - 5. 0) is better for crystallising and precipitating globular proteins from these salt solutions. If the values of solubility and B 22 are converted into a non-dimensional quantity, the data derived from the different protein-salt systems collapse onto a single curve for the same salt type. The B 22 values are also correlated with the critical supersaturation (ln(c*/S)) for the primary nucleation of lysozyme in salt solutions. The values of the critical supersaturation increase as the values of the second virial coefficient become negative or reduce. The ideal critical supersaturation required to create nuclei of lysozyme in salt solutions is between 0. 1 and 1. 4. For the binary protein systems, B 23 values were related to the slope of the lysozyme and ovalbumin plot at same salt concentration and solution pH. Further work is required for binary protein systems to generalise such correlations as a function of the salt concentration and pH. The correlations derived in this thesis are useful generally to predict the solubility and primary nucleation of globular protein in salt solutions. This work reinforces the importance of the second virial coefficient in predicting the crystallisation of protein in salt solutions...|$|R

Six rumen-fistulated dairy cows with 3 or more previous lactations and no history of parturient paresis were randomly assigned to a sequence of diets in a crossover study with 4 periods of 10 days each. Dietary treatments were: A control ration consisting of wrap grass silage alone (1), the control ration supplemented with ammonium chloride and <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> salt <b>solution</b> (2), control ration following a period with supplementation (3) and control ration supplemented with increasing amounts of barley from 4 to 10 kg/cow per day, expected to produce subclinical rumen acidosis (4). Daily intake of the diets was adjusted to 14 kg DM/cow per day. On day 11, the calcium-regulating mechanisms in cows were challenged until recumbency by a standardized intravenous EDTA infusion and cows were left to recover spontaneously. Anion supplementation and the feeding of highly fermentable carbohydrate lowered urine pH below 7. 0 due to subclinical acidosis. During spontaneous recovery from EDTA induced hypocalcaemia, the cows more quickly regained a whole blood free calcium concentration of 1. 00 mmol/L if they had most recently been supplemented with either anionic salts or with increasing amounts of barley, as compared to the basic ration. It is concluded that so-called slug-feeding or 'steaming up' with highly fermentable carbohydrates before parturition in milk fever susceptible cows enhanced calcium homeostasis similar to the effect seen in cows on anionic diets. </p...|$|R

This work aims to study the effect of different concentrations of ammonia in the popular image on the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of different types of cement such as SRC; OPC and HSC. The electrochemical measurement (linear polarization systems) as well as infrared spectroscopy (IR) were used in this study. The behaviour of reinforced steel embedded in SRC; OPC and HSC with (5  wt. %) <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>solution</b> were determined. The results show that ammonia gets a harmful effect on OPC and SRC mortars but HSC shows high resistivity. Also, the reinforced steel is greatly affected in the aggressive medium containing ammonium solution...|$|E
40|$|Pulse plating of {{manganese-copper}} alloys from a <b>sulphate</b> <b>solution</b> {{with the}} addition of <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> at pH 6 - 7 has been studied. The Mn-Cu electrodeposition system is characterised by steady state and transient electrokinetic methods. The influence of pulse current on cathodic efficiency, microstructure and morphology of the deposits was analysed and compared with the results achieved with continuous current. When short off-times are applied, a uniform and homogeneous morphology is obtained. All the deposits exhibit suitable mechanical properties and low copper content (< 5 wt-%). The codeposition of copper prevents the phase transformation of as deposited ductile γ-Mn to the brittle and hard α-Mn for up to a few months...|$|R
30|$|The SE extract was {{subjected}} to <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> precipitation to obtain 60 % saturation in cold conditions. The solution was then centrifuged to collect the precipitates, which were further dialyzed against phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) to remove <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate.</b>|$|R
40|$|A simple, specific, {{accurate}} and precise reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic method {{was developed and}} validated for the estimation of Itraconazole in capsule dosage form. An inertsil C- 18, 5 μm column having 250 x 4. 6 mm internal diameter in isocratic mode with mobile phase containing Tetrabutyl <b>ammonium</b> hydrogen <b>sulphate</b> buffer <b>solution</b> and Acetonitrile in the ratio of 40 : 60 v/v was used. The flow rate was 1. 5 ml/min and effluents were monitored at 225 nm. The retention time for Itraconazole was 5. 617 min. The method was validated for linearity, accuracy, precision, specificity, limit of detection, limit of quantification and robustness. Limit of detection and limit of quantification {{were found to be}} 0. 85 μg/ml and 2. 60 μg/ml respectively and recovery of Itraconazole from capsule formulation was found to be 98. 3 to 100. 3 %. The system suitability parameters such as theoretical plates and tailing factor were found to be 2927. 43 and 1. 08 The proposed method was successfully applied for the quantitative determination of Itraconazole in capsule formulation...|$|R
