40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the possibilities of}} modern sensor technology enables measurements of non-electrical physical values by using advanced technology to automatic recognition of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>marking.</b> Research focuses on analyzing the usefulness of modern sensor technology for special cases in industrial automation for the steel industry. Development of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>marking</b> recognition system is described with the sensor elements implementation especially the optical scanner for surface differences recognition and the thermo camera surface temperatures recognition. The described research is specialized for various methods {{that can be used}} for alphanumeric marks recognizing instead of the standard industrial cameras usage. Verification and Recognition of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>marking</b> with regard to the applicability in industrial applications for segments detection is very important for actual research orientation.
