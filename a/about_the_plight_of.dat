5|$|In the Ramayana, Surabhi is {{described}} to be distressed by {{the treatment of}} her sons—the oxen—in fields. Her tears are considered a bad omen for the gods by Indra, the god-king of heaven.

Indra, moved by Surabhi's tears, rains to stop the ploughing of the tormented bullock.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1942, over 1,000 {{children}} {{that had been}} rounded up during the Kozara Offensive were being held at the Stara Gradiška concentration camp, itself a sub-camp of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex. Information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> these children was passed to concerned citizens in the NDH capital, Zagreb, {{one of whom was}} Diana Budisavljević, an Austrian. Budisavljević approached an Ustaše-appointed {{member of the board of}} the Croatian Red Cross, Kamilo Brosler, and told him about the children at Stara Gradiška. Brosler was horrified, and with the support of representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross began to place pressure on the NDH government to release the children. Budisavljević also used her contacts with the German Army to intervene with the Ustaše regime on behalf of the children.|$|E

40|$|The Columbian Exposition was {{notable for}} its {{impressive}} architecture and large international attendance. Of particular importance was the Women's Pavilion.

While its existence did not trigger significant changes for the Women's Movement, this pavilion was certainly a promising first step that would set a precedent for women's involvement in later years...|$|R

25|$|Rebecca Blaine Harding Davis (June 24, 1831 – September 29, 1910; born Rebecca Blaine Harding) was an American {{author and}} journalist.

Her most important literary work is the novella Life in the Iron Mills, published in the April 1861 edition of The Atlantic Monthly which quickly made her an established female writer. Throughout her lifetime, Davis sought to effect social change for blacks, women, Native Americans, immigrants, and the working class, by intentionally writing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> these marginalized groups in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 Fatmawati became {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> children with tuberculosis. She founded the Ibu Soekarno Foundation {{to fund a}} hospital. The following year a hospital was opened {{with the assistance of}} government funding. This was called the Madam Soekarno Hospital and Fatmawati laid the foundation stone in 1954. The birth of the hospital was a long one. The construction of the new building was halted by financial problems and it was not until 1961 that the hospital opened. By that time the hospital was run by the Ministry of Health and it did not specialise in tuberculosis or children but was a general hospital. In 1967 the name was changed to the Fatmawati Central General Hospital.|$|E
40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{evaluate}} {{the experience of}} Kosovar refugees evacuated to Australia in 1999 {{as part of the}} Howard Government’s ‘Operation Safe Haven’. I investigate the experience of the Kosovars in Australia alongside the role of the media in perpetuating the notion of “acceptability” in a broader debate <b>about</b> immigration. <b>The</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kosovar refugees provided much of the initial impetus for the introduction of the Howard Government’s temporary protection regime. My discussion and argument raise questions about Australian politics and refugee policy. These questions include asking why some refugees have been considered worthy of Australia’s charity and assistance, while others have not. I draw on narratives of national identity while investigating popular discourse surrounding the evacuation of Kosovar refugees to Australia...|$|R

5000|$|On May 17, 1954 the Supreme Court {{handed down}} its {{landmark}} ruling in Brown v.

The president's response was a frosty, [...] "The Supreme Court has spoken and I am sworn to uphold the constitutional processes in this country; and I will obey." [...] Over the succeeding six years of his presidency, author Robert Caro notes, Eisenhower would never [...] "publicly support the ruling; not once would he say that Brown was morally right." [...] His silence left civil rights leaders with the impression that Ike didn’t care much <b>about</b> <b>the</b> day-to-day <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> blacks in America. It also was a source of encouragement for segregationists vowing to resist school desegregation.|$|R
25|$|Lloyd Webber wrote a Requiem Mass {{dedicated}} to his father, William, {{who had died}} in 1982. It premiered at St. Thomas Church in New York on 24 February 1985. Church music had {{been a part of the}} composer's upbringing and the composition was inspired by an article he had read <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> Cambodian orphans. Lloyd Webber had on a number of occasions written sacred music for the annual Sydmonton Festival. Lloyd Webber received a Grammy Award in 1986 for Requiem in the category of best classical composition. Pie Jesu from Requiem achieved a high placing on the UK pop charts. Perhaps because of its large orchestration, live performances of the Requiem are rare.|$|E

Police used a hoist to reach the top of the lamp post and cut his chains. Manser climbed down the lamp post without force at 1:40 PM. He was then taken to the Bow street police station and held until the G7 summit ended at 6:30 PM, when he was released without being charged with an offense.|$|E
25|$|Entremets {{also made}} an {{effective}} tool for political displays. One {{of the most}} famous examples is the so-called Feast of the Pheasant, arranged by Philip the Good of Burgundy in 1454. The theme of the banquet was the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, and included a vow by Philip and his guests to retake the city in a crusade, though this was never realized. There were several spectacular displays at the banquet referred to by contemporary witnesses as entremets. Guests were entertained by a wide range of extravagant displays of automatons in the form of fountains and pies containing musicians. At the end of the banquet, an actor representing the Holy Church rode in on an elephant and read a poem <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> Eastern Christianity under Ottoman rule.|$|E
40|$|This {{exhibition}} {{is the story}} of the polar bears journey from the arctic wilderness to the museums and stately homes of Britain. Between 2002 and 2004, artists Bryndís Snæbjörnsdóttir and Mark Wilson undertook a survey of all the taxidermied polar bears in the UK, in a project called nanoq: flat out and bluesome. Thirty-three stuffed polar bears were traced and photographed in situ, including the baby bear at Worcester City Museum & Art Gallery. The project and exhibition documents the histories of each bear – its place of capture or shooting, the name of the person responsible, the nature or purpose of the expedition, the bear’s history in captivity, its age at death – and visitors are invited to think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> current <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> polar bears who are facing extinction because of the destruction of their habitat...|$|R
40|$|In {{this half}} of the twentieth century, the {{academic}} equivalent of the indentured servant is the adjunct faculty member in higher education. Adjuncts cannot say or do much <b>about</b> their <b>plight.</b> <b>The</b> dilemma <b>of</b> adjunct faculty leads to what should be considered a violation of due process rights. This Article first examines who are the adjunct faculty, what are their dilemmas, and how are they viewed in the academic world. The heart of the paper then explores the limited legal remedies available. The essential problems of lack of due process and minimal protection through collective bargaining and contractual agreements are examined with an eye toward some suggested approaches to improve <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> adjunct faculty...|$|R
