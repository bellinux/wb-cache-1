25|$|If I had {{not heard}} long ago from other people {{that you were a}} fool, I might now have known it of myself, since you thought I was sitting in an empty jug, and went to cover it up with your hand, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> me caught. I don't think you worth the trouble, or I would have given you, long since, such a lesson, that you should {{remember}} me long enough. But before long you will get a slight ducking.|$|E
500|$|The Washington Post concurred in this assessment, {{describing}} {{the premise of}} the show as [...] "Hey, what happens if you take the characters from Seinfeld and give them eating disorders?" [...] While crediting Starved for [...] "a few inventive laughs," [...] the language and sexuality of the show are described as [...] "exceptionally coarse" [...] and [...] "outrageous for cable television, even later at night." [...] Worse than these issues, the Post felt that Schaeffer neglected to develop the characters in favor of coming up with contrived situations for them. [...] "his failure to build understanding into the show dooms it to emptiness, with a sour aftertaste. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> just, you know, hurled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ah, Lord, your sorrow--why {{was it not}} my death? Now {{they lead}} you forth as naked as a worm, with torturers around you and armed knights. [...] The press of the crowd was {{incredibly}} intense as they threw things and harried you so shamefully, kicking at you <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been a dog. [...] I see in my soul how ruefully you walk, your body so bloody, so raw and blistered. The crown on your head is so sharp, and your hair, blown in the wind, is all matted with blood. Your lovely face is so pale and swollen with the blows and the beatings, and covered with spittle and phlegm. [...] And down runs your blood; it horrifies me to see it.|$|E
5000|$|... "Learn <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{to learn}} forever, live <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> die tomorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello, Peter! <b>You</b> look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{something}} very important on your mind," [...] was the greeting of Danny Meadow Mouse as Peter came hurrying up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Spare me," [...] Colston begged with a laugh. [...] "After all, {{it looks}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been right." [...] He {{turned to his}} wife. [...] "What do you think?" ...|$|R
60|$|UNDERSHAFT. You have learnt something. That always feels {{at first}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> lost something.|$|E
60|$|DOLLY (vehemently). An awful old man! (reproachfully) And {{you began}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> quite a nice father for us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellent well," [...] {{answered}} the father, [...] "and done <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> practised war from the cradle, instead of weaving broad-cloth." ...|$|E
50|$|If {{after reading}} it you {{die in the}} night, then it is <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> died on 'Natural Deen' and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> awake in the morning alive then <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> good fortune".|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{been very}} ill. I'm afraid that my {{moment on the}} world's stage has almost ended." [...] The ancient eyes studied the younger man reflectively. [...] "You look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been doing well. Like {{everyone}} else I thought highly of. You've gone to the top in this society." ...|$|R
50|$|It's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{infinity}} {{in front}} of you, the infinitely large, the infinitely beautiful, the infinitely white, infinite freedom. For me, it's the greatest sense of freedom a human being can experience. As I walked along, I would turn around, look at my tracks, they were endless, it was wonderful.|$|R
6000|$|... "You looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> seen one," [...] {{observed}} Frank Dobson, {{drawing down}} {{the corners of}} his mouth with his peculiar smile.|$|E
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE. You were a {{complete}} stranger to me at first, Addy; but now I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> never been away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I'll stand. It's more {{difficult}} to feel penitent in a comfortable position. It looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> seen Herbert Lansing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't do that, child, when I'm {{suffering}} {{for a new}} cap, {{and no one can}} suit me so well <b>as</b> <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the spirits to do it," [...] answered her mother from the sofa, where she spent most of her time bewailing her hard lot.|$|R
50|$|One Whitehall source commented: 'The energy noose {{tightened}} around Tripoli's neck. It {{was much}} more effective and easier to repair than bombs. It is like taking the key of the car away. You can't move. The great thing is you can switch it all back on again if Gaddafi goes. It {{is not the same}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> bombed the whole city to bits.|$|R
6000|$|... "But you do," [...] said Miss Duncan; [...] "you've got {{all sorts}} of {{possibilities}} in your face--you look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> might <b>have</b> lived for ages." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{observed}} {{that you made}} your casts <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> often trod these banks, and I could scarcely have guided you better myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can you help?" [...] Scott interrupted. [...] "If you can, {{it looks}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> kept {{something}} {{back when you}} made the other deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> succeeded very fairly. What o'clock is it? Remember {{that we have}} to meet Nelly at the {{turnstiles}} at six." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, put up that squeakin' old fiddle {{and go to}} bed. Seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> orta <b>have</b> sense {{enough not}} to set there keepin' {{everybody}} in the house awake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{has all the}} fleas in creation,' said Daisy confidentially, 'cats' and dogs', and hedgehogs', and human; and <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> been twice <b>as</b> welcome <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> brought one.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad to see}} so many of you together," [...] she said. [...] "It {{almost seems}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were <b>having</b> some sort of meeting. What is it about,--can't I join in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You talk <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{sounded the}} depths of vice!" [...] he said, laughing. [...] "What {{do you know about}} other than virtuous charms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Rosey timidly, [...] "I {{thought you}} went round and touched {{things in a}} {{familiar}} way <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> handled them before." ...|$|E
60|$|Forgive me {{for writing}} {{so fast and}} far. Just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to do but}} to read me. Oh, for {{patience}} for the novel.|$|E
50|$|The Alaskan hare {{is mostly}} solitary, and usually only congregate in groups during mating season in April and May. They will {{normally}} have one litter per year of between four and eight leverets, {{with the young}} born during June and July. The leverets are active shortly after birth, and are born with full coats and open eyes. Hares can also carry Tularemia which is a bacterial disease that can be transmitted to pets and humans. It can cause infectious wounds, swollen lymph nodes, and fever or symptoms that feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the flu.|$|R
5000|$|... 12 cards - 8 common, 3 uncommon, 1 rare. Booster packs have {{approximately}} a 1/4 {{of having a}} common swapped with a parallel foil card and {{approximately a}} 1/12 chance (1/13 Premiere, 1/11 Canterlot Nights) of having a common swapped with an ultra rare (always foil). It seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> some degree of safety in not receiving two of the same rare in a single booster box. No cards with the Fixed rarity will be in booster packs, these are only found in the theme/starter decks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Margaret, [...] "it's so very nice, every way; {{it makes}} <b>you</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did <b>have</b> a country, after all. It's as chic--that detestable little word!--as those new French books." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{certainly}} sounds <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{faith in}} it," [...] answered Dick Rover, with a smile. [...] "Are {{you willing to}} put that in writing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know now," [...] said Wyndham, with forced quietness. [...] "It looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> got a nasty knock. I'd hoped {{you would}} not find out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{been seeing}} things. The steward tells me {{a man has}} been overboard. I fancy the cold water must have sobered him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's another thing; Pedro, the clerk, reckons they're {{fighting}} near Salinas and the president's {{not popular}} in that neighborhood. Looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> might <b>have</b> some trouble {{to take the}} old man to the mission." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think thee was a {{great deal}} better off in the gardens of Maria Edgeworth," [...] said Mrs. Crowder, [...] "for there thee could come and go as thee pleased, and it almost makes my flesh creep when I think of thee living in company with the bloody tyrants of the past. And always in poverty and suffering, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>thee</b> <b>had</b> been one of the common people, and not the {{superior}} of every man around thee! I don't want to hear anything more about the wicked Nebuchadnezzar. How long did thee stay with Maria Edgeworth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You should {{either have}} said nothing, {{which is the}} course <b>you</b> ought to <b>have</b> adopted, or a little more. I fancy Violet {{would have been just}} <b>as</b> pleased <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> shown {{yourself}} determined to make sure of her." ...|$|R
