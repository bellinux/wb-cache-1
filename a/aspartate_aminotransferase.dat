5|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} tests are available to determine the degree of cirrhosis present. Transient elastography (FibroScan) is the test of choice, but it is expensive. <b>Aspartate</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> to platelet ratio index may be used when cost is an issue.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{nitrogen}} {{is first}} assimilated into organic compounds {{in the form}} of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses transaminases to move the amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, <b>aspartate</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.|$|E
5|$|Making these {{predictions}} is not trivial, {{even for}} simple systems. For example, oxaloacetate is formed by malate dehydrogenase within the mitochondrion. Oxaloacetate {{can then be}} consumed by citrate synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or <b>aspartate</b> <b>aminotransferase,</b> feeding into the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis or aspartic acid biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate {{as well as the}} concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes. This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called flux balance analysis.|$|E

Materials and Methods: In this study, forty female Wistar rats with body weight of 200 ± 20 g were randomly divided into 5 groups with 8 rats per group.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the underlying mechanisms}} by which sevoflurane protects the liver against ischemia/reperfusion injury {{evaluate the}} mechanism by which sevoflurane exerts this protective effect. METHODS: Twenty-six rats were subjected to partial ischemia/reperfusion injury for 1 h: one group received no treatment, one group received sevoflurane, and sham group of animals received laparotomy only. Four hours after reperfusion, levels of alanine and <b>aspartate</b> <b>aminotransferases,</b> tumor necrosis factor-a, and interleukins 6 and 10 were measured. Analyses of mitochondrial oxidation and phosphorylation, malondialdehyde content, histology, and pulmonary vascular permeability were performed. RESULTS: Serum levels of alanine and <b>aspartate</b> <b>aminotransferases</b> were significantly lower in the sevoflurane group compared to untreated controls (p< 0. 05). The sevoflurane group also showed preservation of liver mitochondrial function compared to untreated controls (p< 0. 05). Sevoflurane administration did not alter increases in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-a, and interleukins 6 and 10. Sevoflurane treatment significantly reduced the coagulative necrosis induced by ischemia/reperfusion (p< 0. 05). Pulmonary vascular permeability was preserved in the sevoflurane group compared to untreated controls. CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane administration protects the liver against ischemia/reperfusion injury, via preservation of mitochondrial function, and also preserves lung vascular permeability...|$|R
30|$|Serum was {{separated}} from blood by centrifugation and used for the determination of alanine <b>aminotransferases</b> (ALT), <b>aspartate</b> <b>aminotransferases</b> (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, creatinine, bilirubin, triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose using kits from Merck (France) and Ecoline (Germany). The liver tissue was excised immediately after decapitation and washed with ice cold normal saline. Homogenate (10 %) was prepared by homogenizing liver tissue with Tris HCl buffer (pH[*] 7.4).

Hepatic marker enzymes; alanine <b>aminotransferases</b> (ALT), <b>aspartate</b> <b>aminotransferases</b> (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and other biochemical parameters; glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, urea and creatinine were estimated in serum, while hepatic glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation were measured in liver tissue.

25|$|In {{people with}} {{alcoholic}} hepatitis, the serum <b>aspartate</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio {{is greater than}} 2:1.AST and ALT levels are almost always less than 500. The elevated AST to ALT ratio is due to deficiency of pyridoxal-6-phosphate, which is required in the ALT enzyme synthetic pathway. Furthermore, alcohol metabolite–induced injury of hepatic mitochondria results in AST isoenzyme release. Other laboratory findings include red blood cell macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume > 100) and elevations of serum γ-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels. Folate level is reduced in alcoholic patients due to decreased intestinal absorption, increased bone marrow requirement for folate {{in the presence of}} alcohol, and increased urinary loss.The magnitude of leukocytosis reflects severity of liver injury. Histologic features include Mallory bodies, giant mitochondria, hepatocyte necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration at the perivenular area. Mallory bodies, which are also present in other liver diseases, are condensations of cytokeratin components in the hepatocyte cytoplasm and do not contribute to liver injury.Up to 70% of patients with moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis already have cirrhosis identifiable on biopsy examination at the time of diagnosis.|$|E

For example, liver enzymes such as <b>aspartate</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> [...] and alanine aminotransferase [...] are found to be at abnormally high levels. The staging of the cancer can also be determined by abnormal elevated levels of calcium, which suggests that the cancer may have metastasised to the bones. In this case, a doctor should be prompted for a CT scan. Blood chemistry tests also assess the overall function of the kidneys and can allow the doctor to decide upon further radiological tests.|$|E
2500|$|A {{range of}} {{laboratory}} investigations are performed, where possible, to diagnose {{the disease and}} assess its course and complications.

Other laboratory findings in Lassa fever include lymphopenia (low white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelets), and elevated <b>aspartate</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> [...] levels in the blood. Lassa fever virus can also be found in cerebrospinal fluid. In West Africa, where Lassa is most prevalent, it is difficult for doctors to diagnose due to the absence of proper equipment to perform tests. In cases with abdominal pain, in countries where Lassa is common, Lassa fever is often misdiagnosed for example as appendicitis and intussusception which delays treatment with the antiviral ribavirin.|$|E
