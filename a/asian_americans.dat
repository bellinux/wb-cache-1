5|$|During this {{conflict}} 464 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor, 266 of them posthumously. By {{the end of}} the war, only two <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> had been awarded the Medal of Honor, Sergeant Jose Calugas of the Philippine Scouts and Private Sadao S. Munemori of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. A 1996 study commissioned by the United States Army by order of Congress investigated racial discrimination in the awarding of medals during World War II. The Command History Office at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center at the Presidio of Monterey, California was tasked with identifying affected service-members and reviewing the records. After performing a review of the files, the study recommended that several <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> and Pacific Islanders who received the Distinguished Service Cross during World War II should be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On June 21, 2000, President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal to 22 <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans,</b> 21 from the aforementioned study, in a ceremony at the White House.|$|E

50|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> {{women face}} {{additional}} barriers {{as a result}} of being both <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> and female. This idea of being in multiple minority groups is called intersectionality. In comparison to <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> men, articles revealed that estimated on average <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> women earned 27-40% less than <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> men in terms of payment, if the latter is proven to be true the gender gap in terms of payment between Asian men and women is the highest of any racial group. There are many negative stereotypes associated with <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> women that could have contributed to this salary difference. These stereotypes being the perception of <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> women as outsiders, ultra-feminine lotus blossoms, dragon ladies, and model minorities. Also, the stereotypes regarding their relationship to men play a role in their discrimination. Historically, <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> women were overly sexualized and thought off as being devoted and submissive. These stereotypes lead to discrimination and sexual harassment of <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> women in the workplace.|$|R

5|$|Wong's {{image and}} career {{have left a}} notable legacy. Through her films, public {{appearances}} and prominent magazine features, she helped to humanize <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> to white audiences {{during a period of}} overt racism and discrimination. <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans,</b> especially the Chinese, had been viewed as perpetually foreign in U.S. society but Wong's films and public image established her as an Asian-American citizen at a time when laws discriminated against Asian immigration and citizenship. Wong's hybrid image dispelled contemporary notions that the East and West were inherently different.|$|E

50|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> {{literature}} {{is the body}} of literature produced in the United States by writers of <b>Asian</b> descent. <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> literature became a category during the 1970s but didn't see a direct impact in viewership until later in the 1970s. Perhaps the earliest references to <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> literature appeared with David Hsin-fu Wand's <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> Heritage: An Anthology of Prose and Poetry, published in 1974. One of the earlier pieces of <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> literature produced by Combined Asian Resources Project (CARP) was Aiiieeeee! An Anthology of Asian-American Writers (1974). This anthology collected staples of long-forgotten <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> literature and criticized the lack of visibility of this literature. This anthology brought to light the necessity of visibility and criticism of <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> literature; with visibility came recognition of new literature. Elaine Kim's seminal book of criticism, <b>Asian</b> <b>American</b> Literature: An Introduction to the Writings and Their Social Context, was published in 1982 {{and was the first}} critical book on the topic.|$|R

The cities of San Jose and San Francisco had the third and fourth largest total number of <b>Asian</b> <b>Americans</b> out of every American city. In San Francisco, Chinese Americans constitute 21.4% of the population and constitute the single largest ethnic group in the city. Santa Clara county, and increasingly the East Bay, house a significant Indian American community.

There are more than 100,000 people of Vietnamese ancestry residing within San Jose city limits, the largest Vietnamese population of any city in the world outside of Vietnam.
