500|$|On 6 April 1917 the United States {{declared}} war and immediately seized interned German ships <b>at</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>and</b> territorial ports, but unlike most other German ships interned by the United States, Princess Alice {{had not been}} sabotaged by her German crew before her seizure.

Sources disagree about {{the identity of the}} ship's namesake, who is often reported as either a member of the Philippine Royal Family, or a Japanese princess. Putnam, however, provides another answer: one of the given names of Pocahontas was Matoaka, which was sometimes spelled Matoika. The newly renamed ship was taken to Olongapo City, [...] north of Manila and placed in the drydock Dewey at Subic Bay where temporary repairs were made. She then made her way to San Francisco, and eventually to the east coast. Princess Matoika was the last ex-German ship to be commissioned.|$|E

[...] Mara Keisling, the Executive Director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, was quoted as stating that the blaming of Alcorn's parents was unhelpful, adding, [...] "Despite the great cultural and policy advances transgender people have made, there is still a lot of disrespect, discrimination and violence aimed <b>at</b> <b>us.</b> <b>And</b> being a child or a teenager of any kind today is very difficult." ...|$|E

Or is it because there's something inherently funny in custard pies? Or in faces? Or in throwing things? No. No. and no! The real reason why we laugh is because we are relieved. Because we are released from a sense of fear. Wherever we may happen to be - in the cinema, theatre, or music-hall - we tend to identify with the actors we are watching. So that when a custard pie is thrown we fear for a moment that it as been thrown <b>at</b> <b>us.</b> <b>And</b> then, immediately we realise that it hasn't hit us, we experience a feeling of relief, and we laugh".|$|E
