50|$|The Southern <b>Africa-Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Division of Seventh-day Adventists is a sub-entity of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, which {{coordinates}} the Church's {{activities in}} the southern portion of Africa, which include the nations of Angola, Ascension Island, Botswana, Comoro Islands, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Réunion, São Tomé and Príncipe, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe; as well as St. Helena and Tristan da Cunha, territories of the United Kingdom, and the Kerguelen Islands, territory of France. Its headquarters is in Pretoria, South Africa and its incumbent president is Solomon Maphosa.|$|R
50|$|Université Adventiste Zurcher was {{established}} in 1995, following the destruction of Adventist University of Central Africa in Rwanda in 1994. To replace it, the Southern <b>Africa-Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Division of Seventh-day Adventists voted to open four campuses throughout the French-speaking areas of its territory—one in Cameroon, one in the Congo Democratic Republic, one in Rwanda, and one in Madagascar. In the fall of 1996, the University opened its doors to 35 theology students, and temporarily established itself on the Indian Ocean Union Mission compound (now the Indian Ocean Union Conference located in Antananarivo).The following year, the UAZ moved to Antsirabe then unto, a 200-hectare piece of property, abutting the National Highway between Antananarivo and Antsirabe. Construction began in July 1998 and continued until March, 1999. On March 25, 1999, building was sufficiently advanced to allow students and personnel {{to come to the}} campus and begin classes.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} wind speed on aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 0. 55 μm over remote <b>ocean</b> <b>regions</b> is investigated. Remote <b>ocean</b> <b>regions</b> {{are defined by}} the {{combination}} of AOD from satellite observation and wind direction from ECMWF. According to our definition, many <b>ocean</b> <b>regions</b> cannot be taken as remote <b>ocean</b> <b>regions</b> due to long-range transportation of aerosol from continents. Highly correlated linear relationships are found in remote <b>ocean</b> <b>regions</b> with a wind speed range of 0 – 20 ms − 1. The enhancement of AOD at high wind speed is explained as the increase of sea salt aerosol production...|$|R

40|$|The {{involvement}} of the ulama of the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>region</b> took at least two forms. Firstly, through their travelling or migrating to the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina (the Haramayn). The author found that {{a great number of}} ulama and students from the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>region</b> came to and later settled in the Holy Cities to study and teach. Secondly, students who felt that they possessed sufficient knowledge returned to their place of origin in the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>region,</b> teaching and forming networks of ulama and students in their own area. As a consequence, through these two methods, there appeared a complex criss-crossing of networks of ulama in the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>region</b> and other areas of the Muslim world.

40|$|In recent years, the {{regional}} security debate and responses in Australia have primarily reflected three competing security constructions of the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>Region.</b> The first is an allembracing {{concept of an}} Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>Region</b> comprising up to 51 states at its largest scale to 19 states at {{the scale of the}} Indian Ocean Rim-Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC). The second is a scaled-down version of the first into the East Indian Ocean. The third and largest in area is an Indo-Pacific concept which emphasises the pre-eminence of regional naval power and ensures that India (along with Indonesia, Japan and the United States, among others) potentially plays a central policing role not only within the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>Region...</b>|$|R
