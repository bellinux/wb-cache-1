50|$|A plate nut, {{also known}} as a nut plate, <b>anchor</b> <b>nut</b> or anchor plate, is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is {{internally}} threaded and a plate with two clearance holes for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed anchor nuts and as floating anchor nuts. The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel-plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate Vespel for potential application on the Solid Rocket Booster to replace all-metal deformed self-locking <b>nuts</b> and <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts</b> and be used as self-locking elements for bolts and screws. The Vespel self-locking elements were tested for prevailing torque retention at room temperature, after heating to 450 F and exposure for 3 hr, breakaway torque at 450 F and for vibration at a level consistent with the maximum expected on the SRB at lift-off and reentry. The investigation revealed Vespel has properties that can provide a self-locking capability for threaded fasteners up to 450 F and it can be used in <b>nuts</b> and <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts</b> for installation on the SRB. Vespel elements in bolts did not meet all our SRB requirements for reuse, however, we have defined a design for Vespel elements in nuts/anchor nuts that fully meets all requirements. It is recommended that No. 1, 1 / 4 in. and 5 / 16 in. nuts/anchor nuts be procured for use on the SRB. This system will eliminate the galling problems now encountered and achieve a much higher reuse life than the present deformed nut design...|$|R
5000|$|An {{insert nut}} {{provides}} a threaded socket for a wooden workpiece, {{similar to a}} wall <b>anchor.</b> Insert <b>nuts</b> are inserted into a pre-drilled hole by one of two means: screw in and hammer in. In both cases, the external protrusions bite into the wood, preventing the nut from either turning or pulling out.|$|R
40|$|Safe {{participation}} in the sport of rock climbing is dependent on using a range of equipment and using appropriate techniques. However, the level of safety achieved {{will depend on the}} specific equipment used, in terms of design, type, adequate load rating and condition, and also upon the climbing technique as this can significantly help to minimise any impact loads in the advent of a fall. In addressing these issues, this paper describes some mechanical tests which have been carried using a specially designed drop load rig in which falling weights have been applied to samples of climbing rope to establish impact loads. The load-time histories have been recorded and peak loads have been compared with those determined theoretically. In addition, some new and also used <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts</b> have been test loaded to failure and the different failure modes which resulted are described. Finally, the general design of climbing equipment is discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|A {{self-aligning}} nut, {{also known}} as a spherical nut or leveling nut, is a type of nut that is used in applications where the fastener is not perpendicular to the surface the <b>nut</b> <b>anchors</b> to. It achieves this action by using a flanged nut inside a specially shaped dished-out washer. They are commonly used in the aerospace industry. If this nut were not used the object would have to be spot faced perpendicular to the fastener.|$|R
40|$|Foundation, {{and method}} for the {{production}} of such a foundation. It is proposed that it be based on prefabricated concrete elements. The elements consist of base elements (2) and end elements (4). Each element is provided with two sockets for receiving pretensioning cables (6), which sockets are situated at a distance from each other, viewed in the vertical direction, and extend over the full length of the element. End elements are provided with further sockets relating to the other direction in which such end elements extend. After the elements have been placed against each other {{in the form of a}} closed curve, the tensioning cables are fitted in the sockets concerned and pretensioning is applied by means of pretensioning <b>anchors</b> comprising pretensioning <b>nuts.</b> Thereafter, the pretensioning anchors are sealed off relative to the environment, and the foundation is ready for use.

40|$|The {{pre-stressing}} concrete {{used for}} casting of section {{is quite different}} from Reinforced cements concrete (RCC.) in concrete Technology. The device mechanism developed for duct forming & anchoring with less losses of pre-stressing value in steel bars of concrete structural element. In modern type of pre-stressing electricity with low voltage and high current is used for a duct forming in concrete member & sulpher coating on steel bars, as duct material. While supplying electricity in the structure, sulpher get melted up because heat generated on the steel bars of the structure. No provision of any duct formation is requiring in concrete structural element. The high strength steel structure could be <b>anchored</b> by tightening <b>nuts</b> at both the ends. The Pre-stressing in concrete structure element is found more effective as compare to the RCC technology. To-day pre-stressing is preferred for many large structural elements like bridge etc. minute modification is required to adopt for all small concrete structure sections also. It is demand to replace RCC completely by pre-stress concrete, because of RCC have large section with less strength as compare to pre-stress concrete. RCC system is rein-forced first, to concrete structural element and then loaded after casting, when ever in the pre-stressing system, where reinforcement which are stressed first then casted & force is applie...|$|R
