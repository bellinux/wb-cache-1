It conducts qualitative <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> analysis {{in order to}} evaluate management decisions across {{the public and private}} sectors. According to The New York Times, it is considered the most prestigious management consultancy in the world. McKinsey publishes the McKinsey Quarterly since 1964, funds the McKinsey Global Institute research organization, publishes reports on management topics, and has authored many influential books on management. Its practices of confidentiality, influence on business practices, and corporate culture have experienced a polarizing reception.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} social {{scientific}} methods has also expanded. Social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, {{the end of the}} 1990s and the beginning of 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis.|$|E

25|$|These {{developments}} {{led to a}} {{deep understanding}} of basic processes in free-radical polymerisation—the commonest industrial process. For the propagation reaction, Gilbert led an international team that produced a methodology that overcame the long-standing problem of obtaining reliable rate coefficients for this process. He showed that the Arrhenius parameters for different types of monomer take different classes of values, and developed qualitative <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> understanding of these classes from fundamental transition-state theory and quantum mechanics. These new methods were based on those that he had developed in his work on unimolecular gas-phase processes. For the termination reaction, his data and models led to the qualitative <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> understanding of this process as diffusion-controlled.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} use of {{combinations}} of <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> qualitative approaches (Q-squared) for country level studies with particular reference {{to the work of}} the Global Development Network (GDN). It discusses the main features of these approaches and examines their strengths and weaknesses. It argues that Q-squared approaches offer substantial potential benefits in terms of data quality, depth of understanding and policy analysis. However, these benefits need to be weighed up against the additional direct and indirect costs that will be incurred. A framework for selecting the structure of Q-squared research programmes is then presented. This focuses on whether research is self-contained or opportunistic, on the types of mix that are adopted (<b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> ethnographic, <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> participatory, <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> ethnographic and participatory or participatory that yields Q-squared) and the timing of the mixing of approaches (merged, sequenced or concurrent). A series of practical examples of Q-squared studies are then reviewed. The conclusion argues that GDN will need to answer three specific questions based on this framework {{in the light of the}} research goals of each of its projects (specifi...|$|R
