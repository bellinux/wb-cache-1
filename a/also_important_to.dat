5|$|If an anaphylactoid {{reaction}} occurs the acetylcysteine is temporarily halted or {{slowed and}} antihistamines and other supportive care is administered. For example, a nebulised beta-agonist like salbutamol may be {{indicated in the}} event of significant bronchospasm (or prophylactically in patients with a history of bronchospasm secondary to acetylcysteine). It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> closely monitor fluids and electrolytes.|$|E

This work was <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> human medicine, as there are at least 90 genetic {{conditions}} that can affect both humans and horses. The horse genome was first sequenced in 2006, and was fully mapped by 2009.|$|E
5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of shrimps, salmon, halibut and cod. The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers, the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons of shrimp, around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. Hunting is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{some of the local}} livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, beluga whale, narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|E

5|$|In 2001 {{the total}} {{workforce}} in {{national and state}} governments and the quasi-government sector was 620,000, {{and the private sector}} employed 219,000. Key service industries are information technology, telecommunications, hotels, banking, media and tourism. Construction, power, health and community services and real estate are <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the city's economy. Delhi has one of India's largest and fastest growing retail industries. Manufacturing also grew considerably as consumer goods companies established manufacturing units and headquarters in the city. Delhi's large consumer market and the availability of skilled labour has also attracted foreign investment. In 2001, the manufacturing sector employed 1,440,000 workers and the city had 129,000 industrial units.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main {{influences}} were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of infrastructure {{must also be}} considered within emergency preparedness. Critical facilities that need to remain operable should be identified, and all others should be shut down to reduce damage. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> keep ash out of buildings, machinery and lifeline networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles. Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{following}} these principles when designing traffic signs will make the signs more comprehensible. Minimizing the time and effort it takes drivers to interpret traffic signs may help to reduce driver mental workload and frustration. It is <b>also</b> especially <b>important</b> <b>to</b> attempt to follow the standardization principle because, due to the increase in globalization, many drivers may be visiting internationally. It is <b>also</b> particularly <b>important</b> <b>to</b> follow the principle of visibility because of the increasing average age, and thus vision difficulties, of drivers.|$|R
5|$|Tourism is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{the local}} economy. In 2011, {{domestic}} and overseas visitors {{made more than}} 5.6 million trips to the town and spent over £460 million between them. The equivalent of 8,531 full-time jobs exist as a result which accounts for 15% of all employment in the town. Bournemouth seafront {{is one of the}} UK's biggest attractions with 4.5 million visitors in 2011. RNLI lifeguards provide seasonal coverage of Bournemouth's beaches.|$|E
5|$|We {{first learned}} about the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA custody in 2002. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> note that some detainees who were {{subjected}} to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator/courier. These attempts to falsify the facilitator/courier's role were alerting. In the end, no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through other intelligence means.|$|E
5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is <b>also</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E
