I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I knew it would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E

[...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother.

In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there.

500|$|On {{the night}} of 11 April, Lennon, Harrison and Mardas sat up late {{discussing}} their views of the Maharishi and {{decided to leave the}} next morning. They packed hurriedly, while Mardas went to Dehradun to find taxis. Lennon was chosen to speak to the Maharishi. When asked why they were leaving, Lennon replied [...] "If you're so cosmic, you'll know why". Paul Mason, a biographer of the Maharishi, later interpreted Lennon's statement as a challenge to the Maharishi's claim of cosmic consciousness. Lennon said that his mind was made up when the Maharishi gave him a murderous look in response. According to Mardas: [...] "John Lennon <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the Maharishi about what had happened... he asked the Maharishi to explain himself"; and the Maharishi answered Lennon's accusation by saying, [...] "I am only human". But Lennon said he was [...] "a bit rough to him" [...] and the Maharishi responded by saying [...] "I don't know why, you must tell me." [...] While waiting for Mardas to return, Lennon wrote the song [...] "Maharishi", which was later renamed [...] "Sexy Sadie" [...] because Harrison advised Lennon that was potentially libellous. According to Harrison, Lennon [...] "had wanted to leave anyway" [...] and this gave him a [...] "good reason to get out." ...|$|E

Prior to writing the screenplay, Berg met with the families of the deceased. [...] "My research started with meeting the families of the SEAL teammates who were killed", he said.

500|$|According to AllMusic, {{the album}} is mostly {{influenced}} by dance-pop, post-disco and pop rock music. The overall sound of Madonna is dissonant, {{and is in the}} form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilizing some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of Linn drum machine, Moog bass and the [...] This equipment has dated since, consequently the sound of the album comes off as somewhat harsh. Madonna commented on her debut album: [...] "The songs were pretty weak <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> England during the recordings so I wasn't around... I wasn't in control. [...] I didn't realize how crucial it was for me to break out of the disco mold before I'd already finished the [...] album. I wish I could have got a little more variety there." [...] The album starts with the song [...] "Lucky Star", a medium-paced dance track, beginning with a sparkle of synth note and is followed by heavy beats of electronic drum and handclaps. A guitar is played in high riff and a bubbling bass synth is produced to accompany the guitar sound. The song revolves around the [...] "Starlight, starbright" [...] hook for more than a minute, before going to the chorus. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the lyrics are repetitive and inane, revolving around the transparent ambiguity of the stars, and juxtaposition of the male character with being a heavenly body in the sky.|$|E
