Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} develop {{sensitive}} and specific assays for the detection of KIV and WUV. Study: Two KIV (KI-A and KI-B) and three WUV (WU-A, WU-B and WU-C) real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) assays were developed and evaluated. Clinical sensitivities and specificities were determined by testing 200 respiratory specimens and the results compared to those for previously described conventional PCR assays. Limits of detection were determined, and the <b>analytical</b> <b>specificities</b> of the assays were investigated. Results: No cross-reactivity was observed between the rtPCR methods and unrelated organisms. All five rtPCR assays could reliably detect 10 copies of genomic DNA equivalents per reaction, which was more sensitive than conventional methods.

In this study, the <b>analytical</b> <b>specificity</b> of the SCCA-IgM assay was assessed by evaluating SCCA-IgM measurement dependence on different capture phases, and by measuring the recovery of SCCA-IgM reactivity following serum fractionation. Methods: Serum samples from 82 patients with cirrhosis were analyzed. SCCA-IgM was measured using the reference test (Hepa-IC, Xeptagen, Italy) that is based on rabbit oligoclonal anti-squamous {{cell carcinoma}} antigen (SCCA) and a dedicated ELISA with a mouse monoclonal anti-SCCA as the capture antibody. Results: SCCA-IgM concentrations measured with the reference assay (median value = 87 AU/mL) were higher than those measured with the mouse monoclonal test (median value = 78 AU/mL). However, the differences in the SCCA-IgM distribution were not statistically significant (p > 0. 05). When SCCA-IgM concentrations measured with both tests were compared, a linear correlation was found (r = 0. 77, p 2000 kDa) with both tests.

Testing of the <b>analytical</b> <b>specificities</b> revealed no cross-reactivity with 41 and 26 different common organisms and demonstrated outstanding reproducibility of results.

Altogether, 643 culture isolates originating from clinical bovine mastitis, human, and companion animal samples were analyzed using the assay. The isolates represented 83 different species, groups, or families, and originated from 6 countries in Europe and North America. The <b>analytical</b> <b>specificity</b> and sensitivity of the assay was 100 % in bacterial and beta-lactamase identification across all isolates originating from bovine mastitis (n = 454). When considering the entire culture collection (including also the isolates originating from human and companion animal samples), 4 Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 Streptococcus salivarius, and 1 Streptococcus sanguis strain of human origin were identified as Streptococcus uberis, and 3 Shigella spp. strains were identified as Escherichia coli, decreasing specificity to 99 % in Strep. uberis and to 99. 5 % in E. coli. These false-positive results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. Specificity and sensitivity remained at 100 % for all other bacterial targets across the entire culture collection.

None of the 179 non-E. coli/Shigella strains tested was detected by both methods, {{with the exception of}} Escherichia fergusonii, which was detected by the CRENAME procedure combined with the E. coli/Shigella-specific rtPCR assay (CRENAME + E. coli rtPCR). DNA from all 90 E. coli/Shigella strains tested was amplified by the CRENAME + E. coli rtPCR, whereas the MI agar method had limited ubiquity and detected only 65 (72. 2 %) of the 90 strains tested. In less than 5 h, the CRENAME + E. coli rtPCR method detected 1. 8 E. coli/Shigella CFU whereas the MI agar method detected 1. 2 CFU/ 100 ml of water in 24 h (95 % confidence). Consequently, the CRENAME method provides an easy {{and efficient}} approach to detect as little as one Gram-negative E. coli/Shigella cell present in a 100 -ml potable water sample. Coupled with an E. coli/Shigella-specific rtPCR assay, the entire molecular procedure is comparable to U. S. EPA Method 1604 on MI agar in terms of <b>analytical</b> <b>specificity</b> and detection limit but provides significant advantages in terms of speed and ubiquity...|$|E
40|$|Neutral a-glucosidase (NAG) {{activity}} in human seminal plasma {{is an important}} indicator for epididymis functionality. In the present study, the classic World Health Organization (WHO) method has been adapted to enhance assay robustness. Changes include modified enzyme reaction buffer composition and usage of an alternative enzyme inhibitor for background correction (glucose instead of castanospermine). Both methods have been tested in parallel on 144 semen samples, obtained from 94 patients/donors and 50 vasectomized men (negative control), respectively. Passing-Bablok regression analysis demonstrated equal assay performance. In terms of assay validation, <b>analytical</b> <b>specificity,</b> detection limit, measuring range, precision, and cut-off values have been calculated. These data confirm that the adapted method is a reliable, improved tool for NAG analysis in human semen...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we review}} {{techniques}} useful in eliminating or reduc-ing interferences caused by molecules that cross-react in immunoassays. The biochemical rationale for usingthese techniques is discussed. Examples {{are taken from}} recent studies aimed at reducing interferences caused by endog-enous molecules such as digoxin-like immunoreactive factors or steroid hormones. In this context the role of protein-binding of cross-reacting molecules is also con-sidered. Immunoassay ligand selectivity can be inherently limited by the heterogeneity of the antigenic response or by the structural similarity of epitopes on multiple ligands. Certain empirical approaches have proved useful in max-imizing the <b>analytical</b> <b>specificity</b> of immunoassays. These approaches include isolating the relevant ligands before immunoassay, adjusting the kinetic or equilibrium condi...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Several {{pathogens}} could seriously affect {{public health}} if not recognized timely. To reduce {{the impact of}} such highly pathogenic micro-organisms, rapid and accurate diagnostic tools are needed for their detection in various samples, including environmental samples. Results Multiplex real-time PCRs were designed for rapid and reliable detection of three major pathogens that {{have the potential to}} cause high morbidity and mortality in humans: B. anthracis, F. tularensis and Y. pestis. The developed assays detect three pathogen-specific targets, including at least one chromosomal target, and one target from B. thuringiensis which is used as an internal control for nucleic acid extraction from refractory spores as well as successful DNA amplification. Validation of the PCRs showed a high <b>analytical</b> sensitivity, <b>specificity</b> and coverage of diverse pathogen strains. Conclusions The multiplex qPCR assays that were developed allow the rapid detection of 3 pathogen-specific targets simultaneously, without compromising sensitivity. The application of B. thuringiensis spores as internal controls further reduces false negative results. This ensures highly reliable detection, while template consumption and laboratory effort are kept at a minimum</p...|$|R
40|$|Amulti-residue {{methodology}} {{based on}} a solid phase extraction followed by gas chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry was developed for trace analysis of 32 compounds in water matrices, including estrogens and several pesticides from different chemical families, some of them with endocrine disrupting properties. Matrix standard calibration solutions were prepared by adding known amounts of the analytes to a residue-free sample to compensate matrix-induced chromatographic response enhancement observed for certain pesticides. Validation was done mainly according to the International Conference on Harmonisation recommendations, {{as well as some}} European and American validation guidelines with specifications for pesticides analysis and/or GCâMS methodology. As the assumption of homoscedasticity was not met for analytical data, weighted least squares linear regression procedure was applied as a simple and effective way to counteract the greater influence of the greater concentrations on the fitted regression line, improving accuracy {{at the lower end of}} the calibration curve. The method was considered validated for 31 compounds after consistent evaluation of the key <b>analytical</b> parameters: <b>specificity,</b> linearity, limit of detection and quantification, range, precision, accuracy, extraction efficiency, stability and robustness...|$|R
