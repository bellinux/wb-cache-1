5|$|Al-Mansuriya, near Kairouan, Tunisia, was {{the capital}} of Fatimid Caliphate during {{the rules of the}} Imams Al-Mansur Billah (r. 946–953) and Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah (r. 953–975). Built between 946 and 972, it was <b>a</b> <b>circular</b> walled city holding {{elaborate}} palaces surrounded by gardens, artificial pools and water channels.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{theories}} are that La Reforma is a dome which was eroded to form <b>a</b> <b>circular</b> pattern or {{a set of}} tectonic blocks. Although the dome {{was thought to be}} formed by the older Comondú volcanics, {{it appears to be a}} product of La Reforma activity.|$|E

5|$|On May 29, 2011, the Route 404 Memorial Garden, {{located near}} Denton, was dedicated, honoring {{those who were}} killed in car {{accidents}} along MD 404. The memorial consists of a flagpole surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>circular</b> path with bricks bearing the names of people who died along the route.|$|E
5|$|Shorter and quicker {{routes to}} the top of Helvellyn, though with less {{attractive}} scenery, begin from several points along the A591 road along {{the west side of the}} mountain. Two of these may be combined to create <b>a</b> <b>circular</b> walk. Incorporating the south ridge in the route can restore much of the scenic interest.|$|E
5|$|Steve Frankel was {{the only}} {{carpenter}} on set, which made him the art direction's sole contributor.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of displacement and thermal transient stresses in <b>a</b> thick <b>circular</b> plate with internal heat generation. External arbitrary heat supply is applied at the upper surface of <b>a</b> thick <b>circular</b> plate, whereas the lower surface of <b>a</b> thick <b>circular</b> plate is insulated and heat is dissipated due to convection in surrounding through lateral surface. Here we compute the effects of internal heat generation of <b>a</b> thick <b>circular</b> plate in terms of stresses along radial direction. The governing heat conduction equation has been solved by using integral transform method. The results are obtained in series form in terms of Bessel’s functions and the results for temperature change and stresses have been computed numerically and illustrated graphically...|$|R

5|$|The Circus {{is seen as}} the {{pinnacle}} of Wood's work. It consists of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form <b>a</b> <b>circular</b> space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give a clue to the design, the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome.|$|E
5|$|The Sholes and Glidden {{typewriter}} incorporated several components {{adapted from}} existing devices, such as escapement (a mechanism governing carriage movement) adapted from clockwork, keys adapted from telegraph machines and type hammers {{adapted from the}} piano. In developing the first model, however, Sholes and Soule had not investigated printing machines created by other inventors and, consequently, developed several poor designs {{which could have been}} avoided. The failure to research earlier designs also led to the reinvention of features which had already been developed. Soule, for example, suggested <b>a</b> <b>circular</b> typebar orientation. <b>A</b> <b>circular</b> arrangement had been used more than 30years earlier in a machine designed by Xavier Progin in 1833.|$|E

5|$|The {{path of the}} Sun in {{the local}} sky {{over the course of}} a local day during Uranus's and its major moons' summer {{solstice}} is quite different from that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow <b>a</b> <b>circular</b> path around Uranus's celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would trace <b>a</b> <b>circular</b> path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E
5|$|These {{polarization}} detectors {{are sensitive}} in the ultraviolet {{region of the}} light spectrum. In some army ant species, a group of foragers who become separated from the main column may sometimes turn back on themselves and form <b>a</b> <b>circular</b> ant mill. The workers may then run around continuously until they die of exhaustion.|$|E
