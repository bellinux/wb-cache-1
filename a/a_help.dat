5|$|A second sequel, titled Cars 3, was {{released}} on June 16, 2017. Lasseter didn't return to direct so Brian Fee took over the directors chair. The film focuses on Lightning McQueen, now a veteran racer, who gets <b>a</b> <b>help</b> from a young race car, Cruz Ramirez, to instruct him for the increasingly high-tech world.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Reyes and her fellow agents investigate a serial killer who uses numerology to choose his victims. Soon, Reyes and Scully meet an unusual man who may prove more of a hindrance than <b>a</b> <b>help.</b>|$|E
5|$|In third-person {{missions}} and occasionally some other types, a PDA is available. In the PDA the player can view {{their list of}} objectives (which can change {{over the course of}} a mission), maps of the area if available, <b>a</b> <b>help</b> screen and a list of weapons held with information on each. Characters also typically have cell phones which they sometimes receive calls on during missions. Some missions involve sniping using first-person shooter gameplay. These missions resemble the use of a sniper rifle during normal missions but the player cannot switch to a third-person view.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins as}} Kameo {{advances}} through a castle—with {{the help of}} three elemental powers—to rescue her family. As the tutorial prologue ends, Kameo loses her elemental powers and is ejected from the castle into the Enchanted Kingdom to grow stronger and try again. Kameo travels through four themed worlds (water, ice, fire, and swamp) at {{the outskirts of the}} Badlands, the overworld that connects the areas. Each of the worlds are interspersed with townsfolk and combat-oriented puzzles. Kameo can either travel to the worlds through the Badlands, where the elves and trolls skirmish, or warp from the Enchanted Kingdom. <b>A</b> <b>help</b> system built into the game provides hints or direct solutions for struggling players. Throughout the kingdom, Kameo finds and defeats the seven shadow creatures each guarding one of her elemental powers, while saving her family earning the other 3.|$|E

25|$|Pippen {{is remembered}} {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} defenders ever to play the game, and one of the most versatile and agile players overall. Much like fellow Chicago Bull Michael Jordan, he provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, or tough interior defense, and was particularly effective as <b>a</b> <b>help</b> defender. He was gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even compared with other professional athletes, and skills in areas that bode well for basketball.|$|E
25|$|The {{temporal}} {{punishment that}} follows sin is thus undergone either during {{life on earth}} or in purgatory. In this life, {{as well as by}} patient acceptance of sufferings and trials, the necessary cleansing from attachment to creatures may, at least in part, be achieved by turning to God in prayer and penance and by works of mercy and charity. Indulgences (from the Latin verb indulgere meaning to forgive, to be lenient toward) are <b>a</b> <b>help</b> towards achieving this purification.|$|E

25|$|With the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, {{in which}} the old feudal order made one last attempt to stop the new Japan, {{newspaper}} circulation soared, and woodblock artists were in demand, with Yoshitoshi earning much attention. In late 1877, he took {{up with a new}} mistress, the geisha Oraku; like Okoto, she sold her clothes and possessions to support him, and when they separated after a year, she too hired herself out to a brothel. Yoshitoshi's works gave him more public recognition, and the money was <b>a</b> <b>help,</b> {{but it was not until}} 1882 that he was secure.|$|E
25|$|Adam had to {{find another}} venue. With his license in hand and a {{partnership}} with Achille Mirecour, he acquired the Cirque Olympique (66 Boulevard du Temple) for 1,400,000 francs. The theatre had been designed as an indoor equestrian circus (founded by the British impresario Philip Astley). At a cost of 200,000 francs, it was renovated and altered for use as an opera house by the architect Louis Charles Théodore Charpentier. Having a capacity of 2400, it was unusually large, so the acoustics were less than ideal, but the stage projected into the auditorium, which was <b>a</b> <b>help</b> to the singers.|$|E
25|$|Lancelot is Morgan's prime {{object of}} sexual desire but he {{consistently}} refuses her obsessive advances {{due to his}} great love of Guinevere, even as Morgan either courts, drugs, enchants and imprisons the knight on several occasions. One tale has Lancelot captured in Cart Castle (Charyot) by her and two other lustful enchantress, Queen Sebile (Sedile) and the unnamed Queen of Sorestan, each of whom wants to make him her lover, but he refuses to choose and escapes with <b>a</b> <b>help</b> {{of one of their}} maidservants, Rocedon. Sebile and Morgan are close companions, working their magic together, but they tend to fall into petty squabbles due to their rivalries and bad tempers, including a conflict between them when they both seduce Lancelot's brother Sir Hector de Maris in the late 13th-century Prophesies de Merlin; a resulting contest between them is won by Nimue with <b>a</b> <b>help</b> from Merlin. Their friendship is further tested when a quarrel over a handsome widower named Berengier (captured by Sebile after Morgan kidnapped his child) ends in a violent attack by Sebile that leaves Morgan half-dead; Morgan swears revenge, but their relationship is later restored as usual. Morgan's other allies in Prophecies include the opponents of chivalry such as Mark and Claudas, and she enlists the help of the latter in her failed attempt to eliminate the Lady of the Lake. Sometimes she is successful, such as when she sends Lucifer {{in the guise of a}} dragon against Sir Segurant.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was designed in 1929 by an amateur designer Władysław Kozłowski. It was a wooden biplane, similar to de Havilland Gipsy Moth. The PZL State Aviation Works in Warsaw {{took over the}} design, searching for an aircraft {{to participate in a}} contest for a trainer aircraft, announced by the LOPP paramilitary organization (Air- and Anti-Gas Defense League). Kozłowski worked out a documentation, with <b>a</b> <b>help</b> of PZL bureau and fitted the example with a more powerful 100hp Gipsy I engine, instead of a planned 85hp version. The first prototype of PZL-5 was built and flown in May 1930, followed by two pre-series aircraft in June 1930, built on the factory's initiative specially for the International Touring Competition 1930 (Challenge) (registration SP-ACW and SP-ACX).|$|E
25|$|In {{the tales}} {{and beliefs of}} this people, wolf and orca {{are thought to be}} identical: orca can become a wolf or vice versa. In winter, they appear in the form of wolf, in summer, in the form of orca. Orca was {{believed}} to help people in hunting on the sea — thus the boat represented the image of this animal, and the orca's wooden representation hang also from the hunter's belt. Also small sacrifices could be given to orcas: tobacco was thrown into the sea for them, because they were thought to help the sea hunter in driving walrus. It was believed that the orca was <b>a</b> <b>help</b> of the hunters even if it was in the guise of wolf: this wolf was thought to force the reindeer to allow itself to be killed by the hunters.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists {{have been}} working in medical {{settings}} for many years (in the UK sometimes the field was termed medical psychology). Medical psychology, however, was a relatively small field, primarily aimed at helping patients adjust to illness. In 1969, William Schofield prepared a report for the APA entitled The Role of Psychology in the Delivery of Health Services. While there were exceptions, {{he found that the}} psychological research of the time frequently regarded mental health and physical health as separate, and devoted very little attention to psychology's impact upon physical health. One of the few psychologists working in this area at the time, Schofield proposed new forms of education and training for future psychologists. The APA, responding to his proposal, in 1973 established a task force to consider how psychologists could (<b>a)</b> <b>help</b> people to manage their health-related behaviors, (b) help patients manage their physical health problems, and (c) train healthcare staff to work more effectively with patients.|$|E
