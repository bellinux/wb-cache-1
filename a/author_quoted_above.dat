40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{identify}} an ambiguous statement {{appearing in the}} Physics literature, called ‘tetrad postulate ’ and which may produce nonsense if care is not taken. We identify {{the genesis of the}} ‘tetrad postulate’ and reveals the sources from where ambiguities arise. As an explicit example of the danger that the ambiguous ´tetrad postulate ’ may produce we discuss the validity of a so called ‘Evans Lemma ’ of differential geometry. We show that ‘Evans Lemma ’ is a false statement, the proof offered by that author being wrong because it is unfortunately based on incorrect use of fundamental concepts of differential geometry and incorrect use of the ambiguous ‘tetrad postulate’. Our main claim is proved with details, and we give an elementary counterexample to the ‘tetrad postulate’, in a very clear context. Our presentation, we believe is a very pedagogical way, so that any interested reader may follow it without a great effort. Our result proves that a ‘generally covariant unified field theory’, developed in a series of papers (see references) by the <b>author</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>above</b> is simply wrong, since he claims that his ‘lemma ’ is the pillar of such theory. We take the opportunity to present a detailed derivation based on modern mathematical methods (including all necessary theorems) of the correct equations satisfied by the (co) tetrad fields θ a in General Relativity, since wrong equations for that objects appeared, e. g., in the series of papers (see references) dealing with the (wrong) Evans ‘generally covariant unified field theory’. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{idea of a}} self-government {{administrative unit}} in Poland (named a „self-govemment province” by the legislator) results from many years of debates over the possibility to build democratic local authorities of this level {{with reference to the}} national traditions and the western European models. The Polish regional reform has gained in significance in the recent years as the role of the regions has grown significantly both within the particular member states and in Europe as a whole. Quoting the provisions of the Polish Constitution and the relevant parliamentary acts, the Author discusses the Polish regional reform and the particular provisions regulating the creation and work of the local authorities, comparing them to the systems already existing in the Western Europe. In this discussion the <b>Author</b> <b>quotes</b> <b>above</b> all the provisions of the European Charter of Local Self-Government and the European Charter of Regional Self-Government passed by the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities in Europe in June 1997...|$|R
40|$|Maxwell used {{conjugate}} {{functions to}} solve problems in electrostatics. His method depended on a guessing of the suitable complex transformation for any given problem. In 1867 Christoffel, and in 1869 Schwarz discussed a general theorem in Transformations which became finally known as the Schwarz-Christoffel Theorem. [ [...] . ] In this paper the essential elements of the function theory and the required electrostatics background are briefly developed or discussed and it is shown why and how the one may {{be applied to the}} other. Proofs of the invariance of charge, equipotentials, and lines of force under complex transformation, which are not usually found in the texts, have been supplied. A number of problems illustrating the use of the complex potential and the complex transformation are solved. The Schwarz-Christoffel Theorem is stated and a fairly detailed discussion of its application made, after which problems illustrating its use are worked out. Lastly methods of extending the solution to sylinders of curved cross-section as occur in papers by the <b>authors</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>above</b> are considered. The whole subject has been well known for many years and no attempt to add anything new has been undertaken. However, the solutions and treatment of a number of the problems are the writers own...|$|R
