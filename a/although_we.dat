5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>we</b> {{are used}} to {{thinking}} of supernovae primarily as luminous visible events, the electromagnetic radiation they release is almost a minor side-effect. Particularly {{in the case of}} core collapse supernovae, the emitted electromagnetic radiation is {{a tiny fraction of the}} total energy released during the event.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was greatly injured by the Danes in 988, and again (by Gruffydd ab Llewelyn) in 1038. Portions {{of an earlier}} structure were alleged {{to be included in}} the present edifice, which is of early English style. This is, however, unlikely, as stone church construction in Wales has been conventionally dated to the twelfth century and later, and the earlier buildings were probably wooden, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> know that a new tower and porch were built around 1115. Much evidence which might have shown whether there was any fabric dating from before the thirteenth century reconstruction, and even as far back as late Celtic (or Romano-British) times, was lost with the extensive late-Victorian reconstruction, particularly of the nave, is hidden beneath the present church, or is in the churchyard.|$|E

25|$|This example {{clearly states}} what appeal to ignorance is, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> have {{proved that the}} moon is not made of spare ribs, we have not proved that its core cannot be filled with them; therefore, the moon’s core is filled with spare ribs.|$|E
25|$|The fusion really worked, {{and after}} two days of intense rehearsals we had an amazingly tight piece, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> had {{problems}} with twenty dancers being covered in bruises! In order to get the attitude across and the intensity with the choreography they really had to slap each other. We had to change the styling to hide all the bruises, particularly on the thighs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>we</b> {{recognize}} that the Supreme Court did not identify a formal standard for assessing when these equitable defenses apply, the broadness of the Supreme Court's statements indicates to us that Sherrills holding is not narrowly limited to claims identical to that brought by the Oneidas, seeking a revival of sovereignty, but rather, that these equitable defenses apply to “disruptive” Indian land claims more generally.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Although</b> today <b>we</b> {{know that}} the North Pole was covered with thick ice {{for much of the}} period, the theory of the Open Polar Sea was popular in the 16th-19th centuries and many {{arguments}} were made to justify its existence: ...|$|R

25|$|The {{constellation}} Virgo is {{a specific}} constellation of stars in the sky, hence the process of forming Virgo cannot be an operational definition, since it is historical and not repeatable. Nevertheless, the process whereby we locate Virgo in the sky is repeatable, so in this way, Virgo is operationally defined. In fact, Virgo can have any number of definitions (<b>although</b> <b>we</b> can never prove {{that we are talking}} about the same Virgo), and any number may be operational.|$|E
25|$|Where arable {{cultivation}} {{continued in}} early Anglo-Saxon England, {{there seems to}} have been considerable continuity with the Roman period in both field layout and arable practices, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> do not know whether there were also changes to patterns of tenure or the regulation of cultivation. The greatest perceptible alterations in land usage between about 400 and 600 are therefore in the proportions of the land of each community that lay under grass or the plough, rather than in changes to the layout or management of arable fields.|$|E
25|$|As a minor detail {{important}} {{more for}} its form than its content, {{the operations of}} an algebra are traditionally organized as a list. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> are here indexing the operations of a Boolean algebra by the finitary operations on {0,1}, the truth-table presentation above serendipitously orders the operations first by arity and second by {{the layout of the}} tables for each arity. This permits organizing the set of all Boolean operations in the traditional list format. The list order for the operations of a given arity is determined by the following two rules.|$|E
5000|$|Despite these {{differences}} in structure, the lyra viol is {{not significantly different from}} other bass viols, and lyra viol music can be played on any bass viol. <b>Although</b> as <b>we</b> have seen during the 17th century builders made instruments specifically for this repertoire.|$|R

25|$|Gerard {{was born}} in Cremona in {{northern}} Italy. Dissatisfied with the meager philosophies of his Italian teachers, Gerard went to Toledo. There he learned Arabic, initially {{so that he could}} read Ptolemy's Almagest, which had a traditionally high reputation among scholars, but which, before his departure to Castile, was not yet known in Latin translation. The first Latin translation was made, from the Greek around 1160 in Sicily. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> do not have detailed information of the date when Gerard went to Castile, it was no later than 1144.|$|E
25|$|Now, assume (for example) {{that there}} are 5 green and 45 red marbles in the urn. Standing next to the urn, {{you close your eyes}} and draw 10 marbles without replacement. What is the {{probability}} that exactly 4 of the 10 are green? Note that <b>although</b> <b>we</b> are looking at success/failure, the data are not accurately modeled by the binomial distribution, because the probability of success on each trial is not the same, as the size of the remaining population changes as we remove each marble.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, {{garments}} more closely resembling contemporary bras had emerged, although large-scale commercial production {{did not occur}} until the 1930s. Since then bras have replaced corsets (although some women prefer camisoles) and a minority go without. The metal shortages of World War II encouraged {{the end of the}} corset. By the time the war ended, most fashion-conscious women in Europe and North America were wearing bras. From there the bra was adopted by women in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> have no information about what arrangements, if any, immediately preceded the adoption of the bra across Asia, Africa and Latin America.|$|E
30|$|The Mw of {{estimated}} afterslip with smoothness, sparsity, and SDS constraints were 6.87, 6.87, and 6.90, respectively.

25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>we</b> {{can find}} remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century (Sant Vicenç d'Enclar or Església de Santa Coloma), Andorra {{developed}} exquisite Romanesque Art during the 9th through 14th centuries, {{as much in}} the construction of churches, bridges, religious murals and statues of the Virgin and Child (being the most important the Our Lady of Meritxell). Nowadays, the Romanesque buildings that form part of Andorra's cultural heritage stand out in a remarkable way, with an emphasis on Església de Sant Esteve, Sant Joan de Caselles, Església de Sant Miquel d'Engolasters, Sant Martí de la Cortinada and the medieval bridges of Margineda and Escalls among many others.|$|E
25|$|The Chapel of Christ Crucified (Capela do Senhor Jesus Crucificado) was {{constructed}} in 1589, according to a date {{on the front of}} the arch over it. In the same area are two Renaissance medallions showing the heads of St. Peter and St. Paul. The altarpiece dates from the third quarter of the 18th century, a good example of the Rococo style. The central area is filled by pictures of Our Lady of Sorrows and of St. John the Evangelist, and by the large sculpture of Christ Crucified. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> do not know the creator of this piece, it appears to be by an Algarve artist, reflecting the technical and artistic mastery found elsewhere in the region.|$|E
25|$|This is {{especially}} noticeable {{in the temple}} reliefs in Medinat Habu that show the great attempted invasion of Egypt by the Sea Peoples. This relief shows us the Egyptian small yet maneuverable ships fighting against the larger yet slower ships of the Sea People. It portrays the ships as platforms from which archers and slingers can pepper down the enemy from. Having such fast and maneuverable ships enabled the Egyptians to constantly harass the enemy at a range {{while at the same}} time withdraw to safety and attack from a different side. At this stage, this purpose existed mostly in the New Kingdom era, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> are led to believe that it was used during the Second Intermediate Period during the siege of Avaris by Ahmose.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "Olmeca-Xicalanca" [...] {{was first}} {{mentioned}} by Tlaxcalan historian Diego Muñoz Camargo {{at the end}} of the 16th century.

25|$|Note that karaten/karaten is {{the only}} pair with more than two syllables (<b>although</b> <b>we</b> would get a second one if we used the {{definite}} forms of the pair perser/pärser, i.e. perserna/pärserna). The word pair länder (=countries, plural of land) and länder (=loins, plural of länd) could have been included, {{but this one is}} controversial. For those speakers who have grave accent in the plural of länd, the definite plural forms will also constitute a three-syllable minimal pair: länderna (acute accent, =the countries) vs. länderna (grave accent, =the loins). Although examples with more than two syllables are very few in Standard Swedish, it is possible to find other three-syllable pairs in regional dialects, such as Värmländska: hunnera (acute, =the Huns) vs. hunnera (grave, =the dogs), ändera/ännera (acute, =the ducks) vs. ändera/ännera (grave, =the ends), etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of Newton's law of gravity has enabled {{the acquisition of}} much of the detailed information we have about the planets in the Solar System, the mass of the Sun, and details of quasars; even the existence of dark matter is inferred using Newton's law of gravity. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> have not traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its orbit because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit galactic centers, galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in superclusters. The force of gravity exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects' masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.|$|E

I don't want to try to talk about him now because, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and yours, and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E
