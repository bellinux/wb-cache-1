30|$|Invitations {{to partake}} were posted {{on social media}} and sent {{directly}} to 117 artists <b>and</b> <b>designers.</b> Forty seven online survey responses were obtained, of which 44 were complete. Ten artists <b>and</b> <b>designers</b> agreed to be interviewed. Participants were asked how to best describe themselves {{at the start of}} the survey and interviews: the responses included sculptors, craftsmen, architects, product <b>designers,</b> jewellery <b>and</b> fashion <b>designers.</b> For analysis, these were grouped into <b>designers</b> <b>and</b> artists. Craftsmen, architects, jewellery <b>and</b> product <b>designers</b> were all grouped under <b>designers</b> <b>and</b> sculptors under artists.

Their responses were included in the overall survey analysis but ignored in comparisons between artist <b>and</b> <b>designers.</b>|$|R

The paper will analyse two case studies in which artists <b>and</b> <b>designers</b> acted as agents of change and will discuss insights from these case studies in the light of the literature reviewed. We will then continue to investigate how certain characteristics of the involvement of artists <b>and</b> <b>designers</b> in innovation processes relate to the impact of the process on a social-, business- or product level. The paper will conclude with lessons learnt regarding the role of artists <b>and</b> <b>designers</b> as agents of change in innovation processes and will introduce directions for future research...|$|R

A year later, Mahler appointed him chief stage designer to the Hofoper, where Roller's debut was a new production of Tristan und Isolde. The collaboration between Mahler and Roller created more than 20celebrated productions of, among other operas, Beethoven's Fidelio, Gluck's Iphigénie en Aulide and Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro. In the Figaro production, Mahler offended some purists by adding and composing a short recitative scene to ActIII.|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, it surged in {{popularity}} and {{was associated with}} Hollywood stars {{and members of the}} British Royal Family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club; an all-time low was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. This decline has been blamed on an influx of foreign <b>and</b> <b>designer</b> breeds, and the Sealyham's reduced usefulness as a working dog.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Balabushka met Penndel, Pennsylvania native Gus Szamboti at a tournament. Szamboti {{had been}} working for RCA as a {{draftsman}} <b>and</b> <b>designer,</b> but RCA layoffs were common at the time, and he had started designing and selling pool cues as a more stable job path. Though he too started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own. Balabushka was very impressed with Szamboti's blanks and, in addition to the two men becoming fast friends, he became Szamboti's first customer, buying blanks from him for $18 apiece.|$|E

5|$|Legend of Mana was {{directed}} by Mana series creator Koichi Ishii, who had worked on the three previous games in the series. Many of the other developers were new to the series, including producer Akitoshi Kawazu, the director and producer of many games in Square's SaGa series, <b>and</b> <b>designer</b> Akihiko Matsui, {{who had been the}} director for Chrono Trigger. The game's character designs and illustrations were done by Shinichi Kameoka, who was also new to the series. Retro Gamer, in 2011, stated that although Ishii kept the game tied to previous titles in the series by reusing gameplay elements, Kawazu had a heavy influence on the gameplay design of the game.|$|E
5|$|The artwork's {{concept was}} {{originated}} by Ramones fan Gus MacDonald, who illustrated the members performing with a lobster claw {{coming out of}} an amplifier and a snake around their feet.

This sketch did, however, include original drummer Tommy, so the drawing had to be modified to depict Marky instead. This alteration was undergone by artist John Holmstrom, a Punk magazine associate <b>and</b> <b>designer.</b>|$|E

Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932), the architect <b>and</b> <b>designer</b> Robert Lorimer (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist Douglas Strachan (1875–1950).

5|$|A platform-action game, Mega Man 3 {{follows the}} same format {{set forth by}} its two predecessors. The player, as Mega Man, must {{complete}} a series of stages in any order.

Mega Man 3 introduces new gameplay elements such as Mega Man's canine sidekick Rush and the ability to slide along the ground. Unlike with the first two installments of the series, artist <b>and</b> <b>designer</b> Keiji Inafune has considered the creation of Mega Man 3 to be very stressful due to time constraints and his own increased responsibilities during its development.|$|E
