5|$|Essex also rose in {{rebellion}} in June {{and the town}} of Colchester was taken by the Royalists. Sir Thomas Fairfax placed it under siege, and Mersea Fort was taken by Parliamentary forces and used to cut off any assistance reaching the town by river. Meanwhile, Parliament defeated the Kentish insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone at the start of June <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> a force under the command of Colonel Rich to deal with the castles of the Downs.|$|E
5|$|On 6March 1429 Joan of Arc {{arrived at}} Château de Chinon. She claimed to hear heavenly voices that said Charles would grant her an army {{to relieve the}} siege of Orléans. While staying at the castle she resided in the Tour du Coudray. Charles met with her two days after her arrival <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> her to Poitiers {{so that she could}} be cross-examined to ensure she was telling the truth. Joan {{returned}} to Chinon in April where Charles granted her supplies and sent her to join the army at Orléans.|$|E

5|$|Parliament {{defeated}} the wider insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone {{at the start}} of June, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> a force under the command of Colonel Nathaniel Rich to deal with Walmer and the other castles along the Downs. Walmer Castle was the first to be besieged, and surrendered on 12 July. Deal was attacked in late July, and in August artillery assaults began on Sandown as well, leading to the surrender of both remaining fortifications. Walmer was badly damaged during the conflict and it was estimated by Rich, responsible for carrying out the repairs, that the work would cost at least £500.|$|E
5|$|After the council, Cuthbert {{continued}} {{to correspond with}} Boniface up until Boniface's martyrdom in 754, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> condolences to Boniface's successor. Cuthbert held a second synod in 758, but nothing is known of any enactments it made. He also built the church of St. John the Baptist in Canterbury, which was destroyed by fire in 1067. He was buried in his new church. The new church was located {{on the west side}} of the cathedral, and was used as a baptistery. The church also became a burial site for many of the archbishops, and later was used for trials by ordeal. There is no explicit contemporary reference that states that these uses were intended by Cuthbert, but the fact that the church was dedicated to St. John the Baptist argues strongly that Cuthbert at least intended the new building as a baptistery.|$|E
5|$|Histiaeus now {{gathered}} a large force of Ionians and Aeolians {{and went to}} besiege Thasos. However, he then received {{the news that the}} Persian fleet was setting out from Miletus to attack the rest of Ionia, so he quickly returned to Lesbos. In order to feed his army, he led foraging expeditions to the mainland near Atarneus and Myus. A large Persian force under Harpagus was in the area and eventually intercepted one foraging expedition near Malene. The ensuing battle was hard fought, but was ended by a successful Persian cavalry charge, routing the Greek line. Histiaeus himself surrendered to the Persians, thinking that {{he would be able to}} talk himself into a pardon from Darius. However, he was taken to Artaphernes instead, who, fully aware of Histiaeus's past treachery, impaled him <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> his embalmed head to Darius.|$|E

5|$|Parliament {{defeated}} the wider insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone {{at the start}} of June, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> a force under the command of Colonel Nathaniel Rich to deal with Sandown and the other castles along the Downs. Walmer Castle was the first to be besieged and surrendered on 12 July. An earthwork fort was then built between Sandown and Deal, which may have been defended by around 150 men each. Deal was attacked in late July, and in August artillery assaults began on Sandown as well. The Royalists mounted an attack from the fleet on 10 August, with a second attack following on 15 August, involving a landing of 750 men supported by 50 soldiers from Sandown. Neither operation was successful and Sandown finally surrendered on 5 September, {{a few weeks after the}} surrender of Deal.|$|E
5|$|Pflueger {{volunteered for}} World War I in 1917, {{working for the}} Quartermaster Corps to design base facilities. He was first {{stationed}} in Washington, D.C. <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> to San Juan, Puerto Rico {{to take part in}} base expansion there. Returning to San Francisco in 1919, Pflueger once again focused on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, who now wished for a further doubling in size, extending their Stockton Street frontage 140 feet to California Street, and adding a seventh floor. A massive new entrance incorporating 17 Ionic columns was erected, topped by a pediment displaying a tableau carved by Armenian sculptor Haig Patigian. The Neoclassic-style project was completed in 1920. In 1984, the building was designated San Francisco Landmark No. 167.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes's {{pursuit of}} the {{exclusive}} mining rights in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the surrounding areas was motivated by his wish to annex them into the British Empire {{as part of his}} personal ambition for a Cape to Cairo Railway—winning the concession would enable him to gain a royal charter from the British government for a chartered company, empowered to annex and thereafter govern the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed on Britain's behalf. He laid the groundwork for concession negotiations during early 1888 by arranging a treaty of friendship between the British and Matabele peoples <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> Rudd's team from South Africa to obtain the rights. Rudd succeeded following a race to the Matabele capital Bulawayo against Edward Arthur Maund, a bidding-rival employed by a London-based syndicate, and after long negotiations with the king and his council of izinDuna (tribal leaders).|$|E

5|$|Sandgate Castle {{was seized}} in 1642 by Parliamentary forces {{at the start}} of the first English Civil War between the {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament, although its captain, Richard Hippesley, remained in post. The war ended in 1646 but, after the few years of unsteady peace, the Second Civil War broke out in 1648. The Parliamentary navy was based in Kent, protected by the other Henrician castles of Walmer, Deal and Sandown, but by May a Royalist insurrection was under way across the county, and the fleet joined the rebellion. Sandgate and its sister castles were occupied by the Royalists. Parliament defeated the wider insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone {{at the start of}} June, however, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> a force under the command of Colonel Rich to deal with the Kentish castles. Sandgate was still occupied by the Royalists that August, when Rich sent forces to prevent its garrison intervening to disrupt his assault on Deal and Sandown, but was recaptured soon after.|$|E
5|$|The French and American armies {{marched through}} Philadelphia from September 2 to the 4th, where the American {{soldiers}} announced {{they would not}} leave Maryland until they received one month's pay in coin, {{rather than in the}} worthless Continental paper currency. General Rochambeau generously loaned Washington half of his supply of gold Spanish coins. This would be the last time the men would be paid. It significantly strengthened French and American relations On September 5, Washington learned of the arrival of de Grasse's fleet off the Virginia Capes. De Grasse debarked his French troops to join Lafayette, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> his empty transports to pick up the American troops. Washington made a visit to his home, Mount Vernon, on his way to Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|The {{naming of}} the {{stations}} caused local debate. A draft for names {{were made by}} the municipal administration <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> to the borough councils in Fana, Årstad and Bergenhus. Four names were changed: Nonneseteren from Jernbanen, Florida from Strømmen, Brann stadion from Nymark and Hop from Troldhaugen. Brann stadion and Troldhaugen were afterwards considered by the municipal administration, because they could be in violation of the Place Name Act. The general rule is to use the place name where the station is located, and naming after institutions or facilities nearby is not permitted unless they are in the immediate vicinity. Brann stadion, named for the football venue, was declared a borderline case, but within the rules, while Troldhaugen was not permitted because the area is not {{in the vicinity of the}} station.|$|E

5|$|The {{work was}} {{commissioned}} by Sveriges Radio Radioteatern, the radio drama department of Sweden's national radio broadcaster. First released in the Swedish broadcast version in August 2009, with an English-language version following in November 2009, it features a cast of Swedish and American actors {{and a variety of}} musical styles ranging from opera to vaudeville and pop. The album's recording was a collaborative effort – while the music and English vocals were recorded by Sparks in the United States, the album's Swedish vocals were recorded by Sveriges Radio in Stockholm, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> to the Maels via an FTP server. The album and its ambitious dramatic concept received favourable reviews, and the Mael brothers have said that they are planning both a live show and a film version of the musical.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 63 BC, Hybrida went to Etruria {{to assist}} the praetor, Quintus Metellus Celer, in {{preventing}} Catiline escaping through the Alps and into Gaul. Catiline, hoping that Hybrida might choose to help him, choose to engage him and his consular army rather than the forces under the praetor. Hybrida, however, had given command of the army to his legate, Marcus Petreius, having either suffered a bout of gout or pretending to have. Catiline put up his final resistance in Pistoria, Etruria with an army of 3000 men. Here, Petreius and his soldiers massacred the entire army, killed and beheaded Catiline, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> his head to Rome. Hybrida, having adhered to the agreement that he had with Cicero and the Senate, was granted the governorship of Macedonia {{at the end of}} his consulship.|$|E
5|$|Hilary {{held the}} office of Sheriff of Sussex in 1155, and then again in 1160 through 1162. It was very unusual for a bishop to hold the post of sheriff, and was {{a measure of the}} trust that King Henry II had in Hilary. Hilary was the only bishop to hold {{the office of}} sheriff during Henry's reign, with the {{possible}} exception of Robert de Chesney, the Bishop of Lincoln. An English church council in 1143 had forbidden clergy to hold office as stewards or tax gatherers for non-clergy. As the office of sheriff involved the gathering of the county farm, or income from the county, and the payment of those revenues into the Exchequer, clergy holding office as sheriffs would have been acting against the decrees of the 1143 council. Hilary was well known as a canon lawyer, and was often employed by the papacy as a judge-delegate, hearing cases that had been appealed to Rome, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> back to the country of origin for trial. He also assisted other papal judges, including Theobald of Bec. Hilary served in England as a royal justice in 1156, and then was with the king in Normandy from late 1156 to April 1157. Hilary acted as judge-delegate for the papacy in at least 15 cases during his bishopric. He acted as a legal advisor to Henry II on a number of occasions, and Hilary's clerks occasionally drew up documents for the king.|$|E

5|$|Hill {{commanded}} the battalion {{during its first}} airborne operation in North Africa, dropping near the towns of Souk el-Arba and Béja, in Tunisia. It secured Beja <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> out patrols to harass German troops, ambushing a convoy and inflicting numerous German casualties, and defended a bridge at Medjez el Bab, although it was eventually forced to retreat. Hill was wounded during an attack by the battalion on Gue Hill, in which he attempted to capture three Italian tanks using his revolver; the crews of two were successfully subdued without incident, but the third opened fire and hit Hill in the chest several times. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and Légion d'Honneur for his service in North Africa and then evacuated back to England. There he took command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade in the newly formed 6th Airborne Division, and jumped with the brigade during Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy {{on the night of}} 5/6 June 1944. After nearly being killed on D-Day, by an aircraft strafing his position, Hill {{commanded the}} brigade {{throughout the rest of the}} time it was in Normandy, once leading a counter-attack during a German assault and later winning the first Bar to his DSO.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, without resigning from Parliament, Kent Hughes {{rejoined the}} Army, {{becoming}} a {{colonel in the}} 8th Division. He served in the Malaya campaign of 1942, where he was again mentioned in despatches. Kent Hughes was taken prisoner by the Japanese in Singapore and was kept in the Changi Prisoner Of War camp, where he was beaten and half-starved. In 1943 he was shipped as a slave labourer to Taiwan. In October 1944 he was shipped to Japan and on to Korea, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> by rail to Mukden in Manchuria, where prisoners of war were put to work in arms factories. In August 1945 Kent Hughes was liberated by the invading Red Army and returned to Australia with an amoebic complaint that would continue to bother him. While imprisoned, Kent Hughes secretly wrote what became Slaves of the Samurai, a colourful account of his wartime experiences, published in 1946. He also took up the case of Australian General Gordon Bennett, {{who was accused of}} cowardice and desertion after leaving Singapore without authorisation shortly before the city surrendered to the Japanese. Kent Hughes appeared before the Royal Commission into Bennett's case, and argued that Bennett was correct to avoid being taken prisoner and return to Australia to continue the fight.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} {{later in the}} game that the true villain is Ganon, King of Darkness. He has stolen a powerful trident {{and used it to}} take control of parts of Hyrule. He then stole the dark mirror and used it to create Shadow Link <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sent</b> him to kidnap the shrine maidens and trick Link into releasing Vaati. In order to gain as much power as possible and build up his army, Ganon wants {{to take control of the}} shrine maidens' power as well as abducting people and sending them into the Dark World where they would become part of his army. Vaati unknowingly furthered his plans by creating monsters to add to his army. It {{is revealed}} that the Knights of Hyrule were murdered by Ganon and their souls were trapped in the World of Darkness where they became creatures of Darkness. The four Links eventually save the shrine maidens, retrieve the Dark Mirror, destroy Shadow Link and Vaati, and face Ganon in a final battle. Trying to stop him from plunging the world into chaos, the four Links use the Power of the Maidens of Shrines, Including Zelda, to defeat Ganon, penetrating him.|$|E
