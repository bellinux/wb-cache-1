5|$|During the Battle of Masan in August 1950, Thompson {{was part}} of a unit {{conducting}} an offensive along the Pusan Perimeter. When North Korean troops attacked his company and caused many men to panic and scatter, Thompson stood his ground, refusing orders to evacuate despite being wounded, and covering the retreat of his platoon until he was killed by a grenade. For his actions, Thompson was awarded the Medal of Honor, one of only two African <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so honored in the war.|$|E
5|$|Author Michael Occleshaw {{made the}} claim in his 1995 book The Romanov Conspiracies: The Romanovs and the House of Windsor that Tatiana {{might have been}} rescued and transported to England, where she married a British officer and lived under the name Larissa Tudor. Occleshaw based this claim on {{studying}} the diaries of the British agent Richard Meinertzhagen, who hinted at the successful liberation of a Grand Duchess, allegedly Tatiana. However, historians discount this claim. Survival stories persist because two bodies were missing from the mass grave found in the forest outside Yekaterinburg and exhumed in 1991. Those bodies were identified as Tsarevich Alexei {{and one of the}} four grand duchesses, generally thought by Russians to be Grand Duchess Maria and by <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Grand Duchess Anastasia. Most historians believe that all of the Romanovs, including Tatiana, were assassinated at Ekaterinburg.|$|E
5|$|The American {{troops who}} were not killed or {{captured}} escaped behind the fortified American positions centered on Brooklyn Heights. Howe then ordered all of his troops to halt the attack, in a move considered controversial to this day, despite the protests of many officers in his command who believed that they should push on to Brooklyn Heights. Howe had decided against a direct frontal assault against the entrenched American positions, choosing instead to begin a siege and setting up lines of circumvallation around the American positions. He believed the <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> essentially trapped, with his troops blocking escape by land and the Royal Navy {{in control of the}} East River, which they would have to cross to reach Manhattan Island.|$|E

25|$|William Henry Lewis (November 28, 1868 – January 1, 1949) was an African-American {{pioneer in}} athletics, law and politics. Born in Virginia {{as the son}} of freedmen, he went to college in Massachusetts, where {{he became one of the}} first African-American college {{football}} players, and the first in the sport to be selected as an All-American. In 1903 Lewis was the first African American to be appointed as an Assistant United States Attorney; in 1910 he was the first to be appointed as one of the five United States Assistant Attorneys General, despite opposition by the Southern Democratic block; and in 1911 he was the among the first African <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> admitted to the American Bar Association.|$|E
25|$|Timothy {{wrote to}} Eleazar Wheelock, founder of Dartmouth College, in March 1773, {{regarding}} {{the admission of}} three boys to Moor's Indian Charity School, which was a school for training Native <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> missionaries themselves. In June, the Stockbridges petitioned that Timothy be allowed to sell {{as much as their}} land as was required, being that their tribe was greatly in debt, and some members imprisoned on those grounds. Their petition was again granted. In December, Timothy wrote to Governor William Tryon, requesting compensation for those Stockbridge Native Americans who had fought for the British during the French and American War. Shortly before his death, Timothy was chosen a member of the Governor's Council by mandamus of King George III. However, with his loyalty lying with the colonies in the days preceding the Revolutionary War, he declined.|$|E
25|$|Donald McAdams {{wrote that}} in the 1990s, within trustee District 5 there were schools that were about 50% White that usually had ample parent support and {{stronger}} test scores while there were schools about 90% or higher minorities that had low test scores and little to no parent support. He explained that in Houston white parents sent children to HISD schools that had minority children {{as long as the}} minority children tended to be middle class and that there was not too many of them. Many black students who lived in District 5 were middle class children who took school buses to the schools and did not live in the school zones. According to McAdams their enrollment levels were stable and White parents were comfortable with their presence. He added that very poor black children tended to go to their neighborhood schools outside of District 5. McAdams also stated that White middle class parents did not consider Asians and Asian <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> minorities who could make a school less attractive to them. In the 1980s and 1990s increased enrollment of poor, non-English speaking Central American students at some HISD neighborhood schools made them unattractive to White parents.|$|E

25|$|A {{sense of}} {{complacency}} fell upon {{those in charge}} of developing tanks in the U.S. Army because the M4 Sherman, in 1942, was considered by the <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> superior to the most common German tanks: the Panzer III and early models of the Panzer IV. Even through most of 1943, the 75-mm M4 Sherman was adequate against the majority of German armor, although the widespread appearance of the German 7.5 cm KwK 40 tank gun during this time had led to a growing awareness that the M4 was becoming outgunned. There was insufficient Intelligence data processing and forward thinking {{to understand that there}} was an ongoing arms race in tanks and that the U.S. needed to anticipate future German tank threats. The Tiger I and Panther tanks that appeared in 1943 were seen in only very limited numbers by U.S. forces and hence were not considered as major threats. The end result was that, in 1943, the Ordnance Department lacking any guidance {{from the rest of the}} army, concentrated its efforts in tank development mainly on its major project, the electrical transmission T23. By contrast, the Russians and British were engaged in a continuous effort to improve tanks; in 1943, the British begin development of what became the 51-ton Centurion tank (although this tank would reach service just too late to see combat in World War II) and, on the Eastern Front, a full-blown tank arms race was underway, with the Soviets responding to the German heavy tanks by starting development work on the T-34-85 and IS-2 tanks.|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{major league}} debut brought {{an end to}} {{approximately}} sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the baseball color line. After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration to the North, where their political clout grew, and President Harry Truman's desegregation {{of the military in}} 1948. Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that he was [...] "a legend and a symbol in his own time", and that he [...] "challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration." [...] According to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robinson's [...] "efforts were a monumental step in the civil-rights revolution in America... accomplishments allowed black and white <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more respectful and open to one another and more appreciative of everyone's abilities." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{automobiles}} made it {{much easier}} for black <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> independently mobile, the difficulties they faced in traveling were such that, as Lester B. Granger of the National Urban League puts it, [...] "so far as travel is concerned, Negroes are America's last pioneers." [...] Black travelers often had to carry buckets or portable toilets in the trunks of their cars because they were usually barred from bathrooms and rest areas in service stations and roadside stops. Travel essentials such as gasoline were difficult to purchase because of discrimination at gas stations. To avoid such problems on long trips, African Americans often packed meals and carried containers of gasoline in their cars. Writing of the road trips that he made as a boy in the 1950s, Courtland Milloy of the Washington Post recalled that his mother spent the evening before the trip frying chicken and boiling eggs so that his family would have something to eat along the way the next day.|$|E
