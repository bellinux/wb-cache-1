He was a strong opponent of the Manchester Ship Canal, appearing as an <b>adverse</b> <b>witness</b> on six occasions. In 1888 several of his suggestions were adopted by government as modifications of the policy in regard to Irish railways, recommended by the royal commission on Irish public works. At the prolonged inquiry before the board of trade in 1889 as to the revised schedules of maximum rates and charges preferred by the companies under the railway and canal traffic bill of 1888, he was under examination for eight days, and was highly complimented by the chairman, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, on the quality of his evidence. In 1891 he declined joining the royal commission to inquire into the relations between capital and labour, but appeared before it as the chief witness on behalf of the railway companies. On the retirement of Sir Richard Moon in the same year, Findlay was offered the post of chairman of the London and North Western Company, but preferred to retain his more arduous position.|$|E

Attorney Denies He’s Child’s Father. Hollywood Attorney Arthur Crowley today testified he had been intimate with former beauty queen Terry Lynn Huntingdon, but denied at trial of her paternity suit that he was father of her year-old daughter. Crowley was called as an <b>adverse</b> <b>witness</b> in the first day of testimony in trail of the former Miss United States’ suit before a jury of eight women and four men. Miss Huntingdon, a beautiful brunette, took the witness stand yesterday afternoon. Her attorney attempted to place in evidence the birth certificates of her daughter, identifying her as Elizabeth Paige Crowley. Crowley objected to the identification, and attorneys agreed to a stipulation which only gave the birth date of the baby, without use of the name. Another legal wrangle occurred when Miss Huntingdon identified a picture as 'our daughter.' The statement was ordered stricken from the record. Miss Huntingdon will resume testimony today. Crowley was described in an opening statement by Attorney Sydney M. Williams as a 'mature, experienced, sophisticated, debonair and prominent Hollywood attorney,' while Williams called his client a '20-year-old impressionable girl.' Crowley and his partner, Horace A. Ruderman, both objected and Superior Judge Lloyd Nix sustained them. Opening Statement In his opening statement, Ruderman said he would prove Crowley was not father of Miss Huntingdon’s daughter, Elizabeth, and that the plaintiff had been sexually promiscuous. When called as a witness by Miss Huntingdon’s attorney, Crowley admitted his romance with her. But he said he had not continued being intimate with her during the time she became pregnant. He also denied he ever said he had a rare blood type. He said his blood group was type A, which he estimated some 20 to 30 million persons have. Williams in his opening argument also claimed Miss Huntingdon, Miss United States in the 1959 Miss Universe Contest, was showered with attention by Crowley. He said Crowley told her she was 'the {{best thing that ever happened}} to him,' and that he thought more of her than any girl he had known. Crowley, 39, was a bachelor at the time that Miss Huntingdon asserted that he fathered her child." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{almost any}} area of legal {{counseling}} and advocacy, the lawyer may {{be faced with}} the dilemma of either betraying the confidential communications of his client or participating to some ex-tent in the purposeful deception of the court. This problem is no-where more acute than {{in the practice of}} criminal law, particularly in the representation of the indigent accused. The {{purpose of this article is}} to analyze and attempt to resolve three of the most difficult issues in this general area: 1. Is it proper to cross-examine for the purpose of discrediting the reliability or credibility of an <b>adverse</b> <b>witness</b> whom you know to be telling the truth? 2. Is it proper to put a witness on the stand when you know he will commit perjury? 3. Is it proper to give your client legal advice when you have reason to believe that the knowledge you give him will tempt him to commit perjury? These questions present serious difficulties with respect to a lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s ethical responsibilities. Moreover, if one admits the possibility of an affirmative answer, it is difficult even to discuss them without appearing to some to be unethical. It is not surprising, therefore, that reasonable, rational discussion of these issues has been uncommon and that the problems have for so long remained unresolved.

The argument proceeds from an inaccurate frame of reference. When the confrontation right developed, principally in {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries, and English defendants—Raleigh among them—demanded that <b>adverse</b> <b>witnesses</b> be brought face to face with them, they were making a procedural assertion as to how witnesses must give their testimony. (Giving testimony is what witnesses in litigation do.) Rarely did they phrase this claim in terms of hearsay, {{for the simple reason that}} there was no rule against hearsay in the modern sense.

40|$|This Comment {{examines}} three recent U. S. Supreme Court decisions {{dealing with}} forensic evidence and how its use {{is affected by}} the Confrontation Clause. The Confrontation Clause provides a defendant with the right to confront <b>adverse</b> <b>witnesses.</b> Notably, in Williams v. Illinois, Justice Breyer pointed out that the Court has explicitly not addressed the “outer limits of the “testimonial statements” rule set forth in Crawford v. Washington. ” Specifically, Justice Breyer asked how “the Confrontation Clause [applies] to the panoply of crime laboratory reports and underlying technical statements written by (or otherwise made by) laboratory technicians?” This question, while left unanswered, could have major implications in future criminal cases and could affect how prosecutors prepare for and conduct their trials. This Comment addresses an open question regarding where the “outer limits” of testimonial evidence truly are. Part I of this Comment presents a brief legal background on the Confrontation Clause. It specifically details recent Supreme Court cases involving the impact of the Confrontation Clause on the use of forensic evidence. Part II presents a scientific background on DNA, the complexity of its analysis, and specific advances that may further complicate its relationship with the Confrontation Clause and the need for in-court testimony. Part III proposes a solution that would incorporate aspects of the three recent Supreme Court opinions and provide a workable way for prosecutors to admit scientific evidence, while allowing defense attorneys the opportunity to cross-examine appropriate witnesses. In essence, the Court should adopt a “special needs” category for DNA forensic testimonial evidence. This category would allow for judicial discretion when balancing the benefits of DNA evidence to the prosecution with the defendant’s right to confront <b>adverse</b> <b>witnesses.</b> This would present a solution to Justice Breyer’s concerns about requiring the confrontation of every possible person that worked on a DNA sample, but it would still allow a defendant to adequately cross-examine knowledgeable witnesses...|$|R
40|$|Congress {{passed the}} Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990, endeavoring to {{eliminate}} discrimination against disabled Americans and assure equality of opportunity. The Law School Admission Council’s (LSAC) accommodation review process contradicts this purpose when it denies disabled individuals seeking accommodation on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). In its current state, this review process enables LSAC to issue denials without affording the disabled applicants {{an opportunity to}} be heard or to confront <b>adverse</b> <b>witnesses.</b> These omissions fail to meet procedural due process standards, but LSAC, as a non-profit, private corporation, is not compelled to meet these standards unless its monopolistic and coercive position over law school applicants qualifies its conduct as public in character. This Note argues that if the purpose of the ADA is to be fully realized, LSAC should implement an impartial appellate review process for disputes arising from accommodation requests by disabled individuals...|$|R
40|$|The federal Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program {{provides}} critical {{housing subsidy}} assistance to over two million low-income {{families in the}} United States. Each year some of these families have their Section 8 voucher assistance terminated based solely on uncorroborated hearsay evidence relied on by local public housing authorities to prove various program violations. State and federal courts have reached differing conclusions as to whether these terminations violate families’ procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and federal regulations governing the program. This Note argues that terminations based solely on hearsay evidence violate procedural due process and the federal regulations. Applying the balancing test laid out by the U. S. Supreme Court in Mathews v. Eldridge in 1976, this Note concludes that Section 8 voucher terminations may not be based solely on hearsay evidence without affording families the right to confront and cross-examine those <b>adverse</b> <b>witnesses</b> who provide the evidence relied on by the housing authority.

And the authors of those reports were known and were subject to subpoena and to the very cross-examination that the claimant asserts he has not enjoyed.

40|$|Unlike {{virtually}} any other business, expert witnesses are not typically held accountable in either tort or contract law for their commercial activities. This means that many {{are inclined to}} deliver what the market demands - partisan, biased, or plainly dishonest testimony - without concern for the costs this testimony may impose on others. This immunity from the internalization of the social cost of their testimony is hard to reconcile with any moral or economic standard. Harsh judicial reactions to some experts and {{a slight increase in}} expert witness liability may signal that a change in the privileged status of experts is in the offing. This Article examines the social costs of the current system and surveys the ways in which courts and adversely affected parties have attempted to bring expert witness excesses under control. The efforts range from judicial attempts to embarrass experts to actions by the parties retaining the expert and by those adverse to the expert. In the end, none of these measures seem to have had much effect. Two general proposals are made. The first is to decrease appeals to judges and jurors based on institutional authority. Institutional authority - the reliance on credentials - can be misleading in two ways. First it may suggest more about the competency of the witness than is warranted. Second, it may be taken to mean that the highly credentialed expert {{is more likely to be}} objective. This is also an unwarranted inference. The second proposal is to make experts more accountable to both friendly and <b>adverse</b> <b>witnesses.</b> This liability would be based on deviations in testimony from what the expert knows or should know would be acceptable by peers in his or her area of expertise...|$|R

30|$|First, the {{covariance}} {{structural analysis}} revealed that consumers who {{are aware of the}} dangers of food additives and tend to conform to others preferred the antioxidant-free label. With a large number of consumers worried about the safety of food additives, it is apparent that manufacturers are using such labels strategically as a means to reassure consumers. Meanwhile, consumers knowledgeable about wine and food processing disliked additive-free wine, implying that such consumers perceive the addition of antioxidants as necessary to produce high-quality wine. These results suggest a growing demand for wine that knowledgeable consumers consider to be of low quality by consumers in Japan.

40|$|In {{the annals}} of church history there are few personalities more {{interesting}} than Tertullian. He {{was a man of}} prodigious mental, spiritual and physical activity. His writings alone, without the aid of biographical data, assure us on this point. In this study of Tertullian, I have selected for analysis just one facet of his many-sided nature, namely, his attitude toward women. I shall attempt to prove that he was anti-feminist. There has been no major work published on this subject. The fact is surprising since so many of his writings were directed toward the Christian women of Carthage and contained recommendations which, had they been effected, would have materially changed the lives of these women. Two entire books, for instance, he devoted to women 2 ̆ 7 s dress; two others were written and dedicated to his wife; and three more were, fundamentally, pleas for the celibate life [...] pleas as vital to women as to men. Though specific studies are lacking, one can find the subject indirectly treated in the more general books on Tertullian, particularly those in which his moral teachings are emphasized. These I have used, in addition to the entire body of Tertullian 2 ̆ 7 s works, in reaching an estimate of his attitude toward women. I am particularly indebted on this score to Paul Monceaux 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of Tertullian, 2 ̆ 2 le moraliste, 2 ̆ 2 and to Charles Guignebert 2 ̆ 7 s study on 2 ̆ 2 le famille 2 ̆ 2 in his tertullian. All references to Monceasux are based on the first volume of his Histoire Litteraire de L 2 ̆ 7 Afrique Chretienne, which I have found indispensable for both background material and analysis. In citing texts I have used Roman numerals for the volume and Arabic for the page. The only exception will be found in the references from Tertullian, where the Arabic numerals indicate chapter, rather than page. The term anti-feminism, I realize, is elastic. Its essential meaning is constant, but its application varies in each age. The feminist of one era might be regarded as anti-feminist in the next. In applying the concept to Tertullian I shall use the term as indicating an attitude that ran counter to the efforts of the women of his day to assert their rights or demand new liberties. His views will be judged on the standards {{of the world in which}} he lived. In order to avoid the verbal oscillations that a comparison of this kind suggests, I shall for the sake of convenience, divide the study into three main sections. The first, 2 ̆ 2 The Defendant 2 ̆ 7 s Testimony. 2 ̆ 2 will contain excerpts from Tertullian 2 ̆ 7 s works which I consider representative of his attitude toward women. The second division, 2 ̆ 2 The <b>Adverse</b> <b>Witnesses.</b> 2 ̆ 2 will be a brief survey of the progress women had made before Tertullian 2 ̆ 7 s day, and of the Christian and Pagan ideas that prevailed while he lived. The last chapter will constitute 2 ̆ 2 The Plea for the Defense. 2 ̆ 2 Here I shall consider the special influences on Tertullian which tended to induce anti-feminism, and I hope to prove that these influences, despite their strength, were in no way able to force him willy-nilly into anti-feminism...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Appropriate {{therapeutic}} management of {{iron deficiency anemia}} (IDA) is essential to prevent serious health risks and indiscriminate exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions. Iron therapy is administered intravenously in patients failing to respond to oral iron treatment or needing rapid iron repletion. Several parenteral iron carbohydrate complex formulations are now available, classified as stable, such as ferric carboxymaltose, or labile, such as sodium ferric gluconate, according to the release rate of iron, directly taken up by transferrin and other proteins. The first one preparations allow clinically well-tolerated administration of a single much higher dose of intravenous iron by more rapid infusion than the second one and various therapeutic areas can take advantages of their use, as appropriate therapy for IDA correction. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS. In this retrospective study, we considered 346 patients with IDA, eligible for the intravenous treatment. 222 patients (group A) received {{an average of three}} intravenous injections of ferric carboxymaltose (500 mg / visit), other 124 patients (group B) received an average of ten infusions of sodium ferric gluconate (62, 5 mg / visit). Patients were assessed at first visit and at least after 2, 5 and 7 weeks {{from the beginning of the}} treatment. The primary endpoint was the difference in the mean Hb, ferritin and transferrin saturation values detected throughout the whole observation period between the two treatment groups. Drug-related adverse events and transfusion need were also evaluated. RESULTS. Significantly lower baseline levels of Hb, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were detected in group A, than in group B. Nevertheless, we found a faster and greater Hb, ferritin and TSAT increase with ferric carboxymaltose dosing regimen compared with sodium ferric gluconate. Throughout the whole observational period, group A showed a mean Hb level of 11, 3 g/dL (95 % CI 11, 1 – 11, 6), a mean ferritin level of 221, 1 ng/mL (95 % CI 184, 4 – 257, 7) and a mean TSAT of 20, 7 % (95 % CI 18, 9 – 22, 5); group B showed a mean Hb level of 10, 6 g/dL (95 % CI 10, 4 – 10, 8), a mean ferritin level of 85, 4 ng/mL (95 % CI 50, 9 – 119, 9) and a mean TSAT of 14, 1 % (95 % CI 11, 8 – 16, 4). After drug administration, statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the two groups in terms of mean Hb level (0, 74 g/dL, 95 % CI 0, 42 – 1, 06, p< 0, 0001), mean ferritin level (135, 7 ng/mL, 95 % CI 85, 3 – 186, 1, p< 0, 0001) and mean TSAT (6, 6 %, 95 % CI 3, 7 – 9, 6, p< 0, 0001). The occurrence of intravenous iron-related adverse drug effects was very low and the difference among the two groups was not statistically significant (p= 0, 8). No serious <b>adverse</b> events were <b>witnessed.</b> Patients requiring transfusions after the beginning of the treatment decreased and were 1. 4 % in group A and 4. 8 % in group B (p= 0, 05). Even patients with baseline Hb ≤ 8 g/dL showed a greater increase in Hb concentration in group A compared to group B and a very low proportion of them needed transfusions. CONCLUSION. The results of this study suggest that ferric carboxymaltose can be used safely and more effectively than sodium ferric gluconate to rapidly improve and maintain raised Hb concentration and TSAT values after drug withdrawal in patients with iron-restricted erythropoiesis, avoiding their exposure to the potential risks of untreated anemia, unnecessary transfusions or both...|$|R
