5|$|In the 20th century, Scotland {{played a}} major role in the British and allied effort in the two world wars and began to suffer a sharp {{industrial}} decline, going through periods of considerable political instability. The decline was particularly acute in the second half of the 20th century, but was compensated for to a degree by the development of an extensive oil industry, technological manufacturing and a growing service sector. This period also increasing debates <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of Scotland within the United Kingdom, the rise of the Scottish National Party and after a referendum in 1999 the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Kenshin first {{appeared}} in two chapters of Rurouni, Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story, the pilot chapters of the manga, in which he arrives in Tokyo and defeats several groups of villains attacking families. In these stories, Kenshin is given a similar personality to the one {{he has in the}} series, but his name is not mentioned. Following the original series' ending, Watsuki wrote two shorts where Kenshin makes brief appearances; in Yahiko no Sabato Kenshin and Kaoru entrust Yahiko with taking care of a dojo whereas in Haru ni Sakura he reunites with all his friends and learn <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where Saito left and learn of his friend Sagara Sanosuke through a letter after he left Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} of the Upanishad opens as a {{conversation}} between Brihaspati and Yajnavalkya, where Brihaspati asks Yajnavalkya for information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where the seat of all beings, the Brahman, lives. Yajnavalkya states that true Brahman-seat of all beings, or Kurukshetra, is Avimuktam – a place that Shiva never left. This Avimuktam {{is a part of}} Varanasi (Banaras). All renouncers, after having wandered places, should stay at this Avimuktam. This is the place, asserts the Upanishad, where Rudra imparts the moksha knowledge just when the last vital breaths of the dying are departing, leading one to videhamukti (salvation after death). This place is holy, a place to revere and not leave.|$|E

25|$|Tony Campolo and {{his wife}} Peggy have participated in very public debates and discussions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of lesbians and gays within church and society. Tony Campolo {{formerly}} contended that homosexuality was a sin in practice, though not in orientation. His wife, Peggy Campolo, disagreed, holding that committed, monogamous homosexual practice was not a sin; she supports full equality for homosexual, bisexual and transsexual persons.|$|E
25|$|The Lukács Baths {{are also}} in Buda and are also Turkish in origin, {{although}} they were only revived {{at the end of}} the 19th century. This was also when the spa and treatment centre were founded. There is still something of an atmosphere of fin-de-siècle <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place,</b> and all around the inner courtyard there are marble tablets recalling the thanks of patrons who were cured there. Since the 1950s it has been regarded as a centre for intellectuals and artists.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{his return}} to New Hampshire, Addison was charged by Boston Police with being a {{fugitive}} from justice. Addison was transported to the Suffolk County Jail; bail was set at $2 million (2006 US$) in bail. New Hampshire prosecutors sought {{the death penalty for}} Michael Addison, as killing the police officer qualified the crime as a capital murder. There was debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of capital punishment in New Hampshire, which had not executed any person since July 1939.|$|E
25|$|No {{agreement}} using modern DNA: In 2016, a whole-genome {{study of}} wolves and dogs concluded that admixture had confounded {{the ability to}} make inferences <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of dog domestication. Past studies based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide similarities with Chinese wolves, and lower linkage disequilibrium might reflect regional admixture between dogs with wolves and gene flow between dog populations, with divergent dog breeds possibly maintaining more wolf ancestry in their genome. The study proposed that the analysis of ancient DNA might be a better approach.|$|E
25|$|John Grey Gorton {{was born}} 9 September 1911, the second child of Alice Sinn, the {{daughter}} of a railway worker, and English orange orchardist John Rose Gorton. No birth certificate has been found, and there is uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of birth. A Victorian birth registry lists a 'John Alga Gordon' as being born in Prahran on 9 September 1911 to John James Gordon and Alice Sinn, however Gorton's father later said the birth took place in Wellington, New Zealand. John Gorton listed Wellington as his birthplace in official documents.|$|E

25|$|On 11 December 1998, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew {{responded to}} a gay man's {{question}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of homosexuals in Singapore, live on CNN International by saying, '...what we are doing as a government is to leave people to live their own lives {{so long as they}} don't impinge on other people. I mean, we don't harass anybody.' Given Lee's stature as the venerated albeit authoritarian founding father of independent Singapore, these words helped set the tenor for official policy on homosexuality for many years to come. His comments may be {{regarded as one of the}} most significant events, as far as gay rights are concerned, of the decade.|$|E
25|$|El Tajín prospered {{until the}} early years of the 13th century, when it was {{destroyed}} by fire, presumably started by an invading force believed to be the Chichimecas. The Totonacs established the nearby settlement of Papantla after the fall of El Tajín. El Tajín was left to the jungle and remained covered and silent for over 500 years. While the city had been completely covered by jungle from its demise until the 19th century, it is unlikely that knowledge of the place was completely lost to the native peoples. Archeological evidence shows that a village existed here at the time the Spanish arrived and the area has always been considered sacred by the Totonacs. However, there are no records by any Europeans <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> prior to the late 18th century.|$|E
25|$|A {{document}} attesting to {{the origins}} of the Bykovnia victims was found by the Polish émigré historians in Nazi German archives after the war. Polish researchers estimate that, apart from the Soviet victims of the Great Terror, the site might be the final resting place of 3,435 Polish officers captured by the Red Army during the Soviet invasion of Poland together with Nazi Germany in 1939, most of whom were executed in the spring of 1940 with over 20,000 Polish officers and intellectuals in the Katyn massacre. However, as the Soviet authorities denied responsibility, {{there was no way to}} confirm that the victims of the Stalinist purges were indeed buried there. During the Soviet times the fact <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> was brought up to authorities numerous times with the most famous one in 1962, for which one of the Ukrainian poets, Vasyl Symonenko was beaten up by law enforcement agents and soon died in hospital from kidney failure.|$|E

25|$|The {{most famous}} Parthian art {{work is the}} bronze statue of a local prince found in the Iranian {{province}} of Bachtiyārī at Shami. It was found by farmers in {{the remains of a}} small shrine of Greek gods and Seleucid kings, who eventually became the cult of the gods and also of past rulers. The statue is almost perfectly preserved, with only the hands missing. It is made of two parts and consists of the body and the head, which was carried out separately and fitted later. The prince is standing in Parthian clothes with a dagger on the side. He wears medium length hair and a mustache. He wears long trousers and a tunic that leaves his chest partially exposed. The figure is aligned in front, radiating power and authority, even if the head seems disproportionately small. Daniel Schlumberger remarks that there is certainly a specific type that would have dressed thus. Here is a typical Parthian nobleman, {{as can be seen in}} the details of the costume. An inscription at the base assigns it to a specific person. The dating is uncertain, ranging somewhere from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD The prince has not yet been identified, though, is often assumed to be Surenas. The high quality of the work sparked a lively debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of manufacture. Theories range from Susa to an artist from Palmyra, who created the work on site.|$|E
25|$|In writing Shiji, Sima {{initiated}} a new writing style by presenting {{history in a}} series of biographies. His work extends over 130 chapters — not in historical sequence, but divided into particular subjects, including annals, chronicles, and treatises — on music, ceremonies, calendars, religion, economics, and extended biographies. Sima's work influenced the writing style of other histories outside of China as well, such as the Goryeo (Korean) history the Samguk Sagi. Sima adopted a new method in sorting out the historical data and a new approach to writing historical records. At the beginning of the Shiji, Sima declared himself a follower of Confucius’s approach in the Analects to “hear much but leave to one side that which is doubtful, and speak with due caution concerning the remainder”. Reflecting these rigorous analytic methods, Sima declared that he would not write about periods of history where they was insufficient documentation. As such, Sima wrote “the ages before the Ch’in dynasty are too far away and the material on them too scanty to permit a detailed account of them here”. In the same way, Sima discounted accounts in the traditional records that were “ridiculous” such as the pretense that Prince Tan could via the use of magic make the clouds rain grain and horses grow horns. Sima constantly compared accounts found in the manuscripts with what he considered reliable sources like Confucian classics like the Book of Odes, Book of History, Book of Rites, Book of Music, Book of Changes and Spring and Autumn Annals. When Sima encountered a story that could not be cross-checked with the Confucian classics, he systemically compared the information with other documents. Sima mentioned at least 75 books he used for cross-checking. Furthermore, Sima often questioned people about historical events they had experienced. Sima mentioned after one of his trips across China that: “When I had occasion to pass through Feng and Beiyi questioned the elderly people who were <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place,</b> visited the old home of Xiao He, Cao Can, Fan Kuai and Xiahou Ying, and learned much about the early days. How different it was from the stories one hears!” Reflecting the traditional Chinese reverence for age, Sima stated that he preferred to interview the elderly as he believed that they were the most likely to supply him with correct and truthful information about had happened in the past. During one of this trips, Sima mentioned that he was overcome with emotion when he saw the carriage of Confucius together with his clothes and various other personal items that had belonged to Confucius.|$|E

500|$|In 1890 at the {{formation}} of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), Stanton was elected president. She left such duties to Susan B. Anthony and instead traveled to Europe for two years. While there she met with women who shared her views, and she gathered critical observations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of woman in the Bible. In Greenbank, Bristol, Stanton met with English suffragist Helen Bright Clark, and spoke to a group about the Bible position of woman. Clark questioned whether Stanton's liberal views had shocked some in attendance, and Stanton replied: [...] "Well, if we who do see the absurdities of the old superstitions never unveil them to others, how is the world to make any progress in the theologies? I am in the sunset of life, and I feel it to be my special mission to tell people what they are not prepared to hear..." ...|$|E
