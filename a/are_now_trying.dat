5|$|The Malaysian {{government}} aims {{to balance}} economic growth with environmental protection, {{but has been}} accused of favouring big business over the environment. Some state governments <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>trying</b> to counter the environmental impact and pollution created by deforestation; and the federal government is trying to cut logging by 10percent each year. 28 national parks have been established; 23 in East Malaysia and five in the Peninsular. Tourism has been limited in biodiverse areas such as Sipadan island. Animal trafficking is a large issue, and the Malaysian government is holding talks with the governments of Brunei and Indonesia to standardise anti-trafficking laws.|$|E
5|$|Research is also {{undertaken}} {{in this field}} of artificial photosynthesis. It {{involves the use of}} nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>trying</b> to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues.|$|E
5|$|Four months later, {{the player}} learns {{that the council}} city-states <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>trying</b> to find Remnants {{all around the world}} to use to fight the Conqueror, who is in turn binding and {{transforming}} the Remnants of the city-states, even those that are already bound. Rush and Irina's parents, once found, reveal that their research at the academy had been to create tablets that can transform Remnants and it is through one of these that Wagram stole that the Conqueror is able to do so. When the party travels to the God-Emperor's city, Undelwalt, to try to determine why he is supporting the Conqueror, they find Wagram, who tells them that the Conqueror is a Remnant himself. Wagram and the God-Emperor are supporting him in his quest to destroy the people of the world, who are misusing Remnants and destroying the balance of the world.|$|E

The Cincinnati Gazette said, [...] "The South cannot tolerate free speech anywhere, and would stifle it in Washington with the bludgeon and the bowie-knife, as they <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>trying</b> to stifle it in Kansas by massacre, rapine, and murder." [...] William Cullen Bryant of the New York Evening Post, asked, [...] "Has it come to this, that we must speak with bated breath {{in the presence of}} our Southern masters?...

2500|$|According to Simon Price of The Independent, [...] "It Ain't Easy" [...] is {{reminiscent}} of [...] "Rock Is Dead" [...] by Marilyn Manson. Alex Roginski of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the song [...] "utilises electro clash for a grinding foray into R" [...] K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic noted that the song [...] "pits a menacingly swung, twangy guitar riff", which according to him is [...] "lifted so blatantly" [...] from Depeche Mode's song, [...] "Personal Jesus". Buchanan spoke of the song's lyrical content and meaning, saying: [...] "It's basically about us as people. It's not easy being where we <b>are</b> <b>now,</b> <b>trying</b> to keep a balance between normality and doing this. When you're content within yourself, you should know how you are, and people around us know what we're like." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the April of {{his first}} year in Australia he {{attended}} a picnic to farewell Charles St Julian, who had been appointed Chief Justice of Fiji. In responding to a toast, the 17-year-old Celua said in Fijian: [...] "I thank you for so heartily drinking this toast. Speechmaking is a new thing to me, you must therefore please excuse my words being few. I come from a once dark land – a land of cannibal cruelty – but Christianity has raised us from the lowest degradation, and now we are a Christian people. We <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>trying</b> to establish law and order in our land, and I ask you to help us. We most earnestly desire the establishment of law, and if you will help us it can be done. We want to govern Fiji in every respect as this land is governed. I have come to white man's land to be trained at Newington College. I am anxious to be taught. You were born in the light, I in the darkness. You were born in a Christian land, I in a heathen country. I wish to be trained here that I may be of service in the government of my own country. Again I thank you for so heartily drinking prosperity to Fiji." ...|$|E

In the first place, the fibre of the silk that he spins must be fine, and also strong. In the next place, it must easily unwind from the cocoon. Then the animal must be a tolerably hardy one, so as to be easily raised in great numbers. Then the plant or tree that it feeds upon must be a thrifty and hardy one, and easily cultivated. The {{mulberry}} silk worm has been found to answer to these conditions better than any hitherto known; but there are some others that I believe they <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>trying,</b> in order to see if they will not be better still.

60|$|An {{effort is}} being made now to have Mr. Barret, the present register, retained. I have already said he has done {{the duties of the}} office well, and I now add he is a gentleman in the true sense. Still, he submits to be the {{instrument}} of his party to injure us. His high character enables him to do it more effectually. Last year he presided at the convention which nominated the Democratic candidate for Congress in this district, and afterward ran for the State Senate himself, not desiring the seat, but avowedly to aid and strengthen his party. He made speech after speech with a degree of fierceness and coarseness against General Taylor not quite consistent with his habitually gentlemanly deportment. At least one (and I think more) of those who <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>trying</b> to have him retained was himself an applicant for this very office, and, failing to get my recommendation, now takes this turn.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour ago}} the best heart that ever beat {{for me and}} mine went silent out of this house, and I am as one who wanders and has lost his way. She who is gone was our head, she was our hands. We <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>trying</b> to make plans--we: we who have never made a plan before, nor ever needed to. If she could speak to us she would make it all simple and easy with a word, and our perplexities would vanish away. If she had known she was near to death she would have told us where to go and what to do: {{but she was not}} suspecting, neither were we. (She had been chatting cheerfully a moment before, and in an instant she was gone from us and we did not know it. We were not alarmed, we did not know {{anything}} had happened. It was a blessed death--she passed away without knowing it.) She was all our riches and she is gone: she was our breath, she was our life and now we are nothing.|$|E
60|$|For myself, I do {{not believe}} in cities made after this fashion. Commerce, I think, must select the site of all large congregations of mankind. In some mysterious way she ascertains what she wants, and having {{acquired}} that, draws men in thousands round her properties. Liverpool, New York, Lyons, Glasgow, Venice, Marseilles, Hamburg, Calcutta, Chicago, and Leghorn have all become populous, and are or have been great, because trade found them to be convenient for its purposes. Trade seems to have ignored Washington altogether. Such being the case, the Legislature and the Executive of the country together have been unable to make of Washington anything better than a straggling congregation of buildings in a wilderness. We <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>trying</b> the same experiment at Ottawa, in Canada, having turned our back upon Montreal in dudgeon. The site of Ottawa is more interesting than that of Washington, but I doubt whether the experiment will be more successful. A new town for art, fashion, and politics has been built at Munich, and there it seems to answer the expectation of the builders; but at Munich there is an old city as well, and commerce had already got some considerable hold on the spot before the new town was added to it.|$|E
