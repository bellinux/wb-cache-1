For us it was not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> professional honor of a soldier, it was the question of an idea, an aim that had to be achieved. We were aiming at a political goal. There are many examples of what we did to be found in the Bible – Gideon and Samson, for instance. This had an influence on our thinking. And we also learned from the history of other peoples who fought for their freedom – the Russian and Irish revolutionaries, Giuseppe Garibaldi and Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
25|$|Another price {{explosion}} for tantalum in 2000/2001 {{forced the}} development of niobium electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte, which have been available since 2002. Niobium is a sister metal to tantalum and serves as valve metal generating an oxide layer during anodic oxidation. Niobium as raw material is much more abundant in nature than tantalum and is less expensive. It was <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> availability of the base metal in the late 1960s which led to {{development and implementation of}} niobium electrolytic capacitors in the former Soviet Union instead of tantalum capacitors as in the West. The materials and processes used to produce niobium-dielectric capacitors are essentially the same as for existing tantalum-dielectric capacitors. The characteristics of niobium electrolytic capacitors and tantalum electrolytic capacitors are roughly comparable.|$|E
25|$|The royal {{bloodline}} that Tutankhamun's family shared {{ended with}} the death of the young pharaoh, and with that came <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legitimacy of the following rulers. His tomb was the only one discovered that was not very disturbed by grave robbers, which allowed Carter to uncover many artifacts and the untouched mummy. It gave amazing insight into the royal burials, mummification, and tombs of the New Kingdom's 18th Dynasty. Since its discovery and widespread popularity, it has led to DNA testing done on it and other mummies from the time period that now give a proven family tree for many of the royalty during the 18th Dynasty. Since his death was unexpected and either poorly recorded or simply the records were lost over the years, with the discovery of his mummy and advances in modern technology, there is now strong and supported evidence as to Tutankhamun's death, and with that one of Egypt's most popular mysteries appears to have been solved.|$|E

25|$|At {{a reverse}} voltage lower than −1.5V at room temperature, the cathode {{aluminum}} foil begins {{to build up}} an oxide layer corresponding to the applied voltage. This is aligned with generating hydrogen gas with increasing pressure. At {{the same time the}} oxide layer on the anode foil begins dissolution of the oxide, which weakens the voltage proof. It is now <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outside circuit whether the increasing gas pressure from oxidization leads to bursting of the case, or the weakened anode oxide leads to a breakdown with a short circuit. If the outside circuit is high-ohmic the capacitor fails and the vent opens due to high gas pressure. If the outside circuit is low-ohmic, an internal short circuit is more probable. In every case a reverse voltage lower than −1.5V at room temperature may cause the component to catastrophically fail due to a dielectric breakdown or overpressure, which causes the capacitor to burst, often in a spectacularly dramatic fashion. Modern electrolytic capacitors have a safety vent that is typically either a scored section of the case or a specially designed end seal to vent the hot gas/liquid, but ruptures can still be dramatic.|$|E

500|$|In {{the decade}} after Britten's death, his {{standing}} as a composer in Britain was {{to some extent}} overshadowed by that of the still-living Tippett. The film-maker Tony Palmer [...] thought that Tippett's temporary ascendancy might have been <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two composers' contrasting personalities: Tippett had more warmth and had made fewer enemies. In any event this was a short-lived phenomenon; Tippett adherents such as the composer Robert Saxton soon rediscovered their enthusiasm for Britten, whose audience steadily increased during {{the final years of}} the 20th century. Britten has had few imitators; Brett describes him as [...] "inimitable, possessed of... a voice and sound too dangerous to imitate". Nevertheless, after his death Britten was lauded by the younger generation of English composers to whom, in the words of Oliver Knussen, he became [...] "a phenomenal father-figure". Brett believes that he affected every subsequent British composer to some extent: [...] "He is a key figure in the growth of British musical culture {{in the second half of}} the 20th century, and his effect on everything from opera to the revitalization of music education is hard to overestimate." ...|$|E

2500|$|In many jurisdictions, {{all forms}} of zoophilic acts are prohibited; others outlaw only the mistreatment of animals, without {{specific}} mention of sexual activity. In the UK, Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (also known as the Extreme Pornography Act) outlaws images of a person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive). Despite the Ministry of Justice's explanatory note on extreme images saying [...] "It is not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intentions of those who produced the image.

2500|$|Novelists {{often will}} be {{assessed}} in contemporary criticism {{based on their}} gender or treatment of gender. Largely, {{this has to do}} with the dominance of men in the publishing situation. Literary criticism, especially since the rise of feminist theory, pays attention to how women, historically, have experienced a very different set of writing expectations based on their gender; for example, the editors of The Feminist Companion to Literature in English point out: [...] "Their texts emerge from and intervene in conditions usually very different from those which produced most writing by men." [...] It is not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject matter or political stance of a particular author, but of her gender: her position as a woman within the literary marketplace. However, [...] the publishing market's orientation to favor the primary reading audience of women may increasingly skew the market towards female novelists; for this reason, novelist Teddy Wayne argued in a 2012 Salon article titled [...] "The agony of the male novelist" [...] that midlist male novelists are less likely to find success than midlist female novelist, even though men tend to dominate [...] "literary fiction" [...] spaces.|$|E
2500|$|The 18th-century German Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn {{read the}} admonition of [...] "Therefore, know {{and take it}} to heart that the Lord alone is God, in heaven above and on the earth below, and there is none else," [...] along with that of [...] "Hear, O Israel, the Eternal, our God, is a unique, eternal being!" [...] to {{demonstrate}} that whenever it is <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eternal truths of reason, Scripture does not say [...] "believe," [...] but [...] "understand" [...] and [...] "know," [...] in order that we may know that the Eternal is the true God, and there is no other. Nowhere does Scripture say: [...] "Believe, O Israel, and you will be blessed; do not doubt, O Israel, or this or that punishment will befall you." [...] Thus Mendelssohn concluded that Scripture does not command faith, but accepts no other commands than those that come by way of conviction. Its propositions are presented to the understanding, submitted for consideration, without being forced upon our belief. Belief and doubt, assent and opposition, in Mendelssohn’s view, are not determined by desire, wishes, longings, fear, or hope, but by knowledge of truth and untruth. Hence, Mendelssohn concluded, ancient Judaism has no articles of faith.|$|E
