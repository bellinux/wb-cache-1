5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the War of the Third Coalition, a cavalry reserve corps was organised in the Grande Armée, with command given to Marshal Joachim Murat. This cavalry reserve included Nansouty's heavy cavalry division, another heavy cavalry division under Jean-Joseph d'Hautpoul, three dragoon divisions, a foot dragoon division <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> cavalry brigade. Nansouty's six-regiment division soon acquired the reputation of being the best administered and most exact in its manoeuvres.|$|E

5|$|The MFA {{undertook}} a third restoration in 1943, when some yellowing of the glaze was repaired. Most recently, {{the painting was}} cleaned in 1980 when small amounts of grime were removed, some losses were filled in, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> coat of varnish was applied.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant is}} {{fairly easy to}} grow in a {{mediterranean}} climate with good drainage <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> (sandy) soil; however, with medium to high susceptibility to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, it is unreliable in conditions that favour {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mould, such as summer humidity or poor drainage. The use of phosphite fungicides does reduce the spread of Phytophthora. It generally does poorly in eastern Australia, although it is grown commercially in southeastern South Australia as a cut flower crop. It is also grown in California and Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Burnley did {{not play}} any {{pre-season}} friendly games other than a practice match between the first team and the reserves, which was watched by a crowd of around 10,000 at Turf Moor. The team's last competitive match had ended in a 0–2 defeat against Manchester United in the Lancashire Senior Cup on 8May 1920, almost four months earlier. The strip for 1920–21 was very little changed {{from that of the}} previous season; the claret jersey with light blue sleeves <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> blue stripe around the collar was kept along with the white shorts, but the claret socks were replaced by black.|$|E
5|$|C. m. monedula (Linnaeus, 1758), the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{is found}} in eastern Europe. Its range extends across Scandinavia, from southern Finland south to Esbjerg and Haderslev in Denmark, through eastern Germany and Poland, and south across eastern central Europe to the Carpathian Mountains and north-western Romania, Vojvodina in northern Serbia, and Slovenia. It breeds in south-eastern Norway, southern Sweden, and northern and eastern Denmark, with occasional wintering in England and France. It has been recorded as a rare vagrant to Spain. It has a pale nape and sides of the neck, a dark throat, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> grey partial collar of variable extent.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, the Australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which precluded sending the Militia outside of Australian territory to fight. While this force would draw from the military forces that already existed—the part-time Citizens Force and the Permanent Military Force—it would be largely be made up from recruits not currently serving. Known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), initially it was to consist of 20,000 men, comprising one infantry division <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> horse brigade. Recruitment for the first intake began on 10 August 1914, and the 7th Battalion was among the first units raised, forming less than a fortnight after the declaration of war.|$|E

5|$|In 2005 the Defense Department {{announced}} that it would be shifting 18,000 jobs to Fort Belvoir in Virginia and at least 5,000 jobs to Fort Meade in Maryland by 2012, as part of that year's Base Realignment and Closure plan. In anticipation of such a move, local officials and the military proposed extending the Blue and Green Lines to service each base. The proposed extension of the Green Line could cost $100 million per mile ($60 million per kilometer), <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> rail extension to Fort Belvoir was estimated to cost up to $800 million. Neither proposal has established timelines for planning or construction.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April the Mediterranean Fleet sortied to bombard {{the primary}} Axis supply port of Tripoli and was {{attacked}} {{by a pair of}} torpedo-carrying SM.79s from Rhodes. They were intercepted by a pair of Fulmars that damaged one bomber badly enough that it crash-landed back at its base, although one Fulmar was also forced to crash-land aboard Formidable. The next day Fulmars from 806 Squadron shot down one CANT Z.1007 bomber flying from Cyrenica to Sicily and a pair of Junkers Ju 52 transports flying fuel to North Africa. On the morning of 21 April, the carrier's aircraft dropped flares to illuminate the port so it could be shelled by three battleships <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> cruiser. On the way home, a pair of Fulmars shot down a Dornier Do 24 flying boat.|$|E
5|$|Permission {{was granted}} for flight testing {{to begin in}} April 1935, and Bajdak {{conducted}} his first flight in the prototype on 22 April 1935. For this initial uneventful flight, no weapons were installed <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> fuel load was used. The following day, Bajdak put the IK-1 into unplanned aerobatic manoeuvres, after which the wing fabric was observed as being slack. An official from Ikarus checked it and stated that this would resolve once the fabric varnish had completely dried. Bajdak took the aircraft for a third test flight the next day, which involved more unplanned aerobatics. When the aircraft was at , Bajdak {{put it into a}} shallow dive and pulled up abruptly at high speed, at which point the wing fabric began to tear rapidly, {{to the extent that it}} could be seen from the ground. The aircraft dropped into a spin to starboard, and Bajdak baled out safely while the IK-1 crashed into the ground.|$|E

5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} raster television monitor inset, with the rifle holster and start button below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; the screen is lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E
5|$|Shōhō {{was quickly}} located again {{that morning and}} sunk. In turn, the Japanese spotted the oiler, , and her escorting destroyer, which were misidentified as a carrier <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> cruiser. A single dive bomber was lost during the {{consequent}} airstrike that sank the destroyer and damaged Neosho badly enough {{that she had to}} be scuttled a few days later. Late in the afternoon, the Japanese launched a small airstrike, without any escorting fighters, based on an erroneous spot report. The American carriers were far closer to the Japanese than they realized and roughly in line with their intended target. Alerted by radar, some of the American Combat Air Patrol (CAP) was vectored to intercept the Japanese aircraft, the rest being retained near the carriers because of bad weather and fading daylight. The American fighters mauled the Japanese attackers who were forced to call off the attack, but some of the surviving Japanese pilots became confused in the darkness and attempted to verify if the American carriers were their own before being driven off.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} call-up of reservists to man the {{garrison}} artillery, the commanding {{officers of the}} other militia units were directed to begin preparations to raise an infantry division <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> horse division for home defence tasks. By the end of August 1914 the Government had judged that a force of this size was unnecessary given that Australia was distant from the war zones. Instead, {{it was decided to}} maintain {{only a small number of}} infantry battalions and light horse regiments on active duty at any one time. By the end of 1914 the home defence force comprised 100,000 reservists, of whom 56,000 were members of the Citizen Forces and 51,000 were rifle club volunteers. Despite fears of sabotage and uprisings by German-Australians, no domestic threat eventuated. From 1915, only skeleton garrisons were maintained at coastal forts, but the personnel manning them were forbidden to enlist in the AIF. This ban was lifted in April 1915 but the presence of a German commerce raider in Australian waters caused a mobilisation from February to April 1916, while another occurred in April 1918 for the same reason. In June 1918, 9,215 home service troops were on active duty in Australia, alongside 2,476 regular soldiers. Up to 50,000 militiamen enlisted in the AIF during the war.|$|E

5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, and the face is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair that makes them look about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> yellowish abdomen.|$|E
5|$|The basic German (Luftwaffe) {{camouflage}} {{during most}} of the war was based on a light blue undersurface and a two tone splinter pattern of various greens for the upper surfaces. In {{the first year of the}} war, the top colors were dark green and black-green; later, lighter and more greyish colors were used for fighters, though bombers mostly maintained the dark green/black green camouflage. The side of the fuselage on fighters and some light bombers often had irregular patches sprayed on, softening the transition from the upper to the lower surface. The undersides of night bombers and night fighters were painted black early in the war, but by 1943 switched to lighter base colors of their usual light blue undersurfaces for aircraft flown by day, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> gray base coat over the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. A special pattern was devised for the Mediterranean front, consisting of a sand yellow that often faded to tan, with or without olive green patches. As Germany lost air supremacy, ground camouflage became increasingly important, and late war fighters received a two tone scheme like the British Sand and Spinach, in dark brown and light green.|$|E
