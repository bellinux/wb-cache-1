50|$|A {{learning}} {{management system}} (LMS) is software used for delivering, tracking and managing training and education. For example, an LMS tracks <b>attendance,</b> <b>time</b> on task, and student progress. Educators can post announcements, grade assignments, check on course activity, {{and participate in}} class discussions. Students can submit their work, read and respond to discussion questions, and take quizzes. An LMS may allow teachers, administrators, students, and permitted additional parties (such as parents if appropriate) to track various metrics. LMSs range from systems for managing training/educational records to software for distributing courses over the Internet and offering features for online collaboration. The creation and maintenance of comprehensive learning content requires substantial initial and ongoing investments of human labor. Effective translation into other languages and cultural contexts requires even more investment by knowledgeable personnel.|$|E

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1995 the University of Twente, {{commissioned}} by the Province of Friesland, carried out research into the consequences of alternative locations for ambulances. The approach to this research {{was based on a}} network model, which represents the area to be covered. With this model the attendance times for the ambulances can be determined based on a shortest route algorithm. The <b>attendance</b> <b>time</b> is the time between the dispatching of the ambulance by Central Alarm after an emergency call and its arrival at the patient. The attendance times are compared with the norm as described by the Dutch law. The research concentrated on the Southwest and Northeast of the Province. In view of the norm of 15 minutes for the <b>attendance</b> <b>time,</b> the proposed alternative in the Southwest is the closing of one site and the moving of another. This is feasible under the condition that there will always be well-trained manpower available at the stations, and especially at the site which is moved. In the Northeast the moving of one post and the closure of another has no disadvantages with regard to attendance times. These conclusions appear to give a reliable picture of the real-world situation based on a conservative approach with the network model used, and, that higher travel speeds than those assumed are possible. ...|$|E

40|$|Clusters of {{workstations}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} suitable resources to assist e-scientists in the execution of largescale experiments that demand processing power. The utilization rate of these machines are usually not near 100 %, and hence this should motivate administrators to share their clusters to Grid communities. However, exploiting these resources in Computational Grids is challenging and brings several problems. This paper presents a transparent resource allocation strategy to harness idle cluster resources aimed at executing grid applications. This novel approach does not make use of a formal allocation request to cluster resource managers. Moreover, it does not interfere with local cluster users, being non intrusive, and hence motivating cluster administrators to publish their resources to grid communities.
