I {{wrote a book about}} everything that I went through, and I {{spent a lot of time}} talking about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago—the change that was happening and the uproar because of the color of my skin. I don’t know all of the negativity Nina, and I frankly could care less, but I heard some of the comments <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she’s</b> Muslim and what religion she is, which is ridiculous.|$|R

500|$|... "Rock Show" [...] is {{the sixth}} episode and season finale {{of the first}} season of the American comedy {{television}} series Parks and Recreation. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on May 14, 2009. It was written by Norm Hiscock and directed by Michael Schur. In the episode, Andy gets the casts removed from his legs, and Ann starts reevaluating their relationship when she learns he kept them on longer than necessary so she would keep pampering him. An intoxicated Mark flirts with Leslie, who feels conflicted <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> wants to move forward when he is drunk.|$|E
500|$|Petra Boynton, a British {{scientist}} {{who has written}} extensively on the G-spot debate, is also concerned about the promotion of the G-spot leading women to feel [...] "dysfunctional" [...] if they do not experience it. [...] "We're all different. Some women will have a certain area within the vagina which will be very sensitive, and some won't— but they won't necessarily be in the area called the G spot," [...] she stated. [...] "If a woman spends all her time worrying <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> is normal, or has a G spot or not, she will focus on just one area, and ignore everything else. It's telling people that there is a single, best way to have sex, which isn't the right thing to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Associated Press {{movie critic}} Christy Lemire called Season of the Witch [...] "a supernatural action thriller that's never {{actually}} thrilling". She wrote, [...] "The scenery is drab, the battles are interchangeable, {{and no one}} seems particularly interested in being here. At the same time, Dominic Sena ... never flat-out goes for it in a schlocky, B-horror kind of way. What we're left with is just bloated, boring and utterly forgettable." [...] The critic found Cage and Perlman to be poorly utilized and said of the film's progression, [...] "It's a slog from one challenge to the next, with no real tension building, {{and all the while}} the alleged witch plays coy <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she's</b> actually a witch, pouting beneath her bangs, Kristen Stewart-style." ...|$|R

500|$|Much of Brant's {{influence}} {{came from}} her connections to Sir William Johnson and her stepfather Brant Kanagaradunkwa. Additional influence came {{from the fact that}} women in Iroquois society had more political influence than did women in patriarchal societies. Under the Iroquois matrilineal kinship system, inheritance and social status were passed through the maternal line. Women elders influenced the selection of chiefs. [...] Because Brant's ancestry is unclear, historians have apparently disagreed <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> was born into an influential clan. Brant has been described as the [...] "head of the Six Nations matrons", although historian Robert Allen writes that [...] "there is no substantive evidence to suggest that Molly was ever a clan matron or mother within the Iroquois matrilineal society". Fiester and Pulis write that [...] "although not born to the position, she became one of the Mohawk matrons".|$|E

Claiming that the SNP Government had passed on 89 percent of the spending cuts imposed by the UK Government, she compared the Nationalists to the businessman criticised {{for his role in}} the financial collapse of Glasgow Rangers Football Club, saying, [...] "Putting the SNP in charge of a council is like putting Craig Whyte in charge of your tax return." [...] Retaining control of Glasgow City Council, where Labour was facing a strong challenge from the SNP, was another of the party's key objectives. After the polls, political academic John Curtice, writing for The Guardian, observed that Lamont [...] "has undoubtedly done enough to dispel doubts <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> was the right woman for the job".|$|E
500|$|... "Lecture Circuit" [...] was {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis and written by Mindy Kaling, who also plays Kelly Kapoor in the show. The first episode included a cameo performance by Rashida Jones, a regular cast member during the third season, where she played Jim Halpert's love interest Karen Filippelli. [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] aired just two months before Jones began her regular role as Ann Perkins in the NBC comedy series Parks and Recreation, which was created by Office producers Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. Dan Goor, a future writer for Parks and Recreation, made a cameo as Karen's husband in the photographs featured in the part one episode. Rob Huebel, a comedian {{best known for the}} MTV sketch comedy series Human Giant, guest starred as Holly's boyfriend, A.J.

500|$|Victoria Principal {{has said}} that she feels Pam changed {{throughout}} the course of the series. She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she really had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I really believe that Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E
500|$|Ali Shadman {{is one of}} the few Kurdish people {{remaining}} in Baghdad. His family are struggling financially and resort to siphoning petrol from their car to run their back-up generator when the power grid fails. When the generator breaks down one night, Ali begins to wonder why he is fixing it against a backdrop of gunfire, instead of studying in peace. Another night, he reports the neighbourhood's news but explains there is nothing to speak of other than the usual explosions, violence, and death. Anmar Refat, a Syriac Christian, tries to remain philosophical and hopes that armed gangs will not attack the school. His family, however, are more nervous about any nearby gunfire, as their Christian beliefs increase the threat to their lives if anyone were to find out about them. Anmar has a girlfriend, whom he can contact only via his mobile phone, but he has not heard from her in several days, leaving him worried <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> has found another boyfriend, or has been hurt in the violence. Hayder Khalid, a Shia Muslim, hopes to become a famous singer-songwriter. He frequently downloads music videos of English-language pop music so he can learn popular English songs and dance moves.

500|$|The ending {{sequence}} with Pam and Jim in {{the hospital}} was filmed at the North Hollywood Medical Center using the Sacred Heart Hospital set from Scrubs. Although the good news Jim and Pam learn {{in the hospital}} was never specifically stated, episode writer Jen Celotta confirmed that the news was that Pam was pregnant; the script included an off-hand question from a nurse to Pam <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> was pregnant so that viewers would make the connection later. Celotta said {{the idea of the}} pregnancy came as the writers were working on this specific episode, although she felt the show had always been heading in that direction. The series producers considered filming the scene with audible dialogue, but they thought the scene was more powerful without audio and felt actors John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer [...] "are such great actors and have the ability to convey so much without hearing their dialogue." [...] Celotta said the show's producers have no plans to release the scene with audio. While filming Jim Halpert's emotional reaction to the pregnancy news, Krasinski and director Ken Kwapis discussed the fact that Jim has been surrounded by this camera crew for the last five years, so he would be glad to share this moment with them. The moment when Jim looked directly at the camera, in particular, was meant to convey the idea that he was celebrating the news with the crew. The script did not call for tears, but Krasinski cried naturally as part of his performance.|$|E

6000|$|... "My {{own opinion}} of the matter is, briefly, as follows: I don't think she has met with any serious accident. Serious accidents, in nine cases out of ten, {{discover}} themselves.

Blimey. With her track record, how much proof does anyone need?" [...] Stephen commented on Mercedes and Jacqui saying that if they [...] "started charging for sex - they'd never worry about money again. It would be a busman's holiday for them. They could even make it a family business - slappersRus.com". Stephen questioned whether Mercedes would [...] "get her perfect wedding" [...] and then answered, [...] "Expect gunmen/bombs/fights/ murders. Get her to the church on time, but make sure there’s a getaway car waiting, too". When Mercedes was kidnapped, Stephen said that Mercedes was [...] "very unlucky with being centre-siege". Stephen added that [...] "Still, she's been in more terrifying situations – actually, she's only been in terrifying situations. Any chance of her just enjoying a double espresso once in a while?" [...] Stephen's colleague Caroline Fitton commented on Mercedes' doubts <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> could bring Bobby up alone saying it was [...] "entirely understandable" [...] due to Mercedes being unable to restrain from regularly [...] "changing clothes, cosmetics, jobs or men – let alone children".

500|$|Mrs. Roosevelt {{also made}} {{extensive}} use of radio. [...] She {{was not the first}} First Lady to broadcast—her predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, had done that already. But Mrs. Hoover did not have a regular radio program, whereas Mrs. Roosevelt did. [...] She first broadcast her own programs of radio commentary beginning on [...] July 9, 1934. On that first show, she talked about the effect of movies on children, the need for a censor who could make sure movies did not glorify crime and violence, and her opinion about the recent All-Star baseball game. [...] She also read a commercial from a mattress company, which sponsored the broadcast. [...] She said she would not accept any salary for being on the air, and that she would donate the amount ($3,000) to charity. [...] Later that year, in November 1934, she broadcast a series of programs about children's education; it was heard on the CBS Radio Network. Sponsored by a typewriter company, Mrs. Roosevelt once again donated the money, giving it to the American Friends Service Committee, to help with a school it operated. [...] During 1934, Eleanor Roosevelt set a record for the most times a First Lady had spoken on radio: she spoke as a guest on other people's programs, as well as the host of her own, for a total of 28 times that year. [...] In 1935, Mrs. Roosevelt continued to host programs aimed at the female audience, including one called [...] "It's A Woman's World." [...] Each time, she donated the money she earned to charity. [...] The association of a sponsor with the popular First Lady resulted in increases in sales for that company: when the Selby Shoe Company sponsored a series of Eleanor Roosevelt's programs, sales increased by 200%. [...] The fact that her programs were sponsored created controversy, with her husband's political enemies expressing skepticism <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> really did donate her salary to charity; they accused her of [...] "profiteering." [...] But her radio programs proved to be so popular with listeners that the criticisms had little effect. She continued to broadcast throughout the 1930s, sometimes on CBS and sometimes on NBC.|$|E
