40|$|Soil {{compaction}} is {{a complex}} mechanism which results in a decrease of soil porosity and an increase of soil strength. Such effects may reduce crop yield since they are harmful for root growth, germination, mesofauna and bacterial life. Soil compaction may also reduce hydraulic conductivity which {{increases the risk of}} runoff, contamination of surface water, erosion and emission of greenhouse gases due to anaerobic processes. In the context of sustainable agriculture, it is crucial to characterise the impact of the agricultural techniques on the compaction state in the arable layer due to machine traffic. For this purpose, Soil samples were taken in a Luvisol at different depths, on plots under longterm reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT). The impact of wheel traffic on the physical properties of the soils was also studied. The experimental approach consists in measuring traditional macroscopic soil properties such as bulk density and precompression stress, and combining them with pore size distribution obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry. <b>Automatic</b> <b>cone</b> index measurements were initially performed to map the soil resistance and easily identify the sampling depths. The measurements revealed a plough pan at 30 -cm depth under both CT and RT. Nevertheless, the subsoil under RT showed pieces of evidence of a natural regeneration process of the microporosity. The impact of wheel traffic was studied in RT and CT plots. It was shown that the passage of heavy machine such as beet harvester coupled to water content close to the optimum proctor is clearly unfavourable in terms of compaction. The measurements revealed large modifications of soil structure in the topsoil of CT, whereas the soil structure slightly changes through depth. However, the latter remains the more problematic case since the soil will not be loosened by tillage anymore, resulting in strongly compacted soil years after years. In addition to the experimental approach, numerical modelling was used in order to predict the soil compaction. A finite element method was used and the soil behaviour was modelled by an elastoplastic law (modified Cam-Clay model). The model parameters were calibrated from the experimental measurements. The simulations allowed to compare the porosity and the surface deformation after wheel traffic with the experiments. The variations of machine weight and tyre pressure were numerically studied and it was showed that the machine weight has an influence in the topsoil and the subsoil, whereas the tyre pressure affects only the topsoil...|$|E

Comparing several direct and indirect measuring methods, a dynamic long-range linear displacement precision measuring method for winding system based on magnetic rotary encoder is presented. Conceptual design of longrange linear displacement precision measuring mechanism according to proposed method is carried out. After error pre-analysis of several conceptual design schemes, a long-range linear displacement precision measuring mechanism based upon error avoidance theory is designed. The proposed measuring mechanism {{has been applied to}} conclude that its high accuracy, reliability and adaptability...|$|R

40|$|Nondestructive {{evaluation}} by deflection testing {{is widely used}} to assess the adequacy of existing airfield pavements, and strengthening design for future operations of aircraft applications. In situ modulus values of pavement layers were backcalculated using deflection data collected on airfield pavements for a marine airfield facility in Hawaii and Houston Intercontinental Airport. This paper also demonstrates the use of advanced three dimensional-finite element (3 D-FE) dynamic analysis procedures for correctly simulating pavements subjected to falling weight deflectometer (FWD) dynamic loads. A comparison of simulated and measured FWD deflection time histories is made for asphalt pavement-subgrade systems. Linear elastic structural responses of 3 D-FE pavement-subgrade models, subjected to aircraft wheel loads, are compared with the responses computed by the multilayered linear elastic analysis commonly used for mechanistic thickness design of airfield pavements. A methodology has been developed for automatic discrimination of subgrade layering and generation of resilient modulus values of the subgrade layers using the <b>Automatic</b> Dynamic <b>Cone</b> Penetrometer (DCP) data files. The results have been validated by resilient modulus values measured in laboratory tests, and the FWD backcalculated modulus values. The subgrade modulus values have been verified using 3 D-FE modeling and simulations...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of the {{three-dimensional}} structure of solar transients using incomplete plane of sky data {{is a difficult}} problem whose solutions have potential for societal benefit in terms of space weather applications. In this paper transients are characterized in three dimensions by means of conic coronal mass ejection (CME) approximation. A novel method for the <b>automatic</b> determination of <b>cone</b> model parameters from observed halo CMEs is introduced. The method uses both standard image processing techniques to extract the CME mass from white-light coronagraph images and a novel inversion routine providing the final cone parameters. A bootstrap technique is used to provide model parameter distributions. When combined with heliospheric modeling, the cone model parameter distributions will provide direct means for ensemble predictions of transient propagation in the heliosphere. An initial validation of the automatic method is carried by comparison to manually determined cone model parameters. It is shown using 14 halo CME events that there is reasonable agreement, especially between the heliocentric locations of the cones derived with the two methods. It is argued that both the heliocentric locations and the opening half-angles of the automatically determined cones may be more realistic than those obtained from the manual analysi...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} a global {{parametrization}} is determined {{by a number of}} factors, including amount of distortion, number of singularities (cones), and alignment with features and boundaries. Placement of cones plays a decisive role in determining the overall distortion of the parametrization; at the same time, feature and boundary align-ment also affect the cone placement. A number of methods were proposed for <b>automatic</b> choice of <b>cone</b> positions, either based on singularities of cross-fields and emphasizing alignment, or based on distortion optimization. In this paper we describe a method for placing cones for seamless global parametrizations with alignment constraints. We use a close relation between variation-minimizing cross-fields and related 1 -forms and conformal maps, and demonstrate how it leads to a con-strained optimization problem formulation. We show for boundary-aligned parametrizations metric distortion may be reduced by cone chains, sometimes to an arbitrarily small value, and the trade-off be-tween the distortion and the number of cones can be controlled by a regularization term. Constrained parametrizations computed us-ing our method have significantly lower distortion compared to the state-of-the art field-based method, yet maintain feature and bound-ary alignment. In the most extreme cases, parametrization collapse due to alignment constraints is eliminated...|$|R
40|$|In our {{previous}} paper we reported {{the results of}} modeling of 14 selected well -observed strong halo coronal mass ejection (CME) events using the WSA -ENLIL cone model combination. Cone model input parameters were obtained from white light coronagraph images of the CME events using the analytical method developed by Xie et al. This work verified that coronagraph input gives reasonably good results for the CME arrival time prediction. In contrast to Taktakishvili et al., where we started the analysis by looking for clear CME signatures in the data and then proceeded to model the interplanetary consequences at 1 AU, in the present paper we start by generating a list of observed geomagnetic storm events and then work {{our way back to}} remote solar observations and carry out the corresponding CME modeling. The approach used in this study is addressing space weather forecasting and operational needs. We analyzed 36 particularly strong geomagnetic storms, then tried to associate them with particular CMEs using SOHO/LASCO catalogue, and finally modeled these CMEs using WSA-ENLIL cone model. Recently, Pulkkinen et al. developed a novel method for <b>automatic</b> determination of <b>cone</b> model parameters. We employed both analytical and automatic methods to determine cone model input parameters. We examined the CME arrival times and magnitude of impact at 1 AU for both techniques. The results of the simulations are compared with the ACE satellite observations. This comparison demonstrated that WSA -ENLIL model combination with coronagraph input gives reasonably good results for the CME arrival times for this set of 'geoeffective" CME events as well...|$|R
