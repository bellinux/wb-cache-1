5|$|Hilde Levi (9 May 1909– 26 July 2003) was a German-Danish physicist. She was {{a pioneer}} {{of the use of}} {{radioactive}} isotopes in biology and medicine, notably the techniques of radiocarbon dating and <b>autoradiography.</b> In later life she became a scientific historian, and published a biography of George de Hevesy.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to Denmark, {{she worked with}} the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen to develop radiocarbon dating equipment. This was {{put to the test}} in 1951, dating the Grauballe Man. <b>Autoradiography</b> was then used by the Finsen Institute to investigate the effects of the radiocontrast agent thorotrast. Levi was a consultant at the Danish National Board of Health from 1952 to 1970.|$|E
5|$|When the Nazis began {{rounding}} up Danish Jews in September 1943, Levi fled to Sweden, {{where she worked}} for the biologist John Runnström at the Wenner-Gren Institute for Experimental Biology in Stockholm. After the war ended, she returned to Denmark {{to work at the}} Zoophysiological Laboratory in Copenhagen. She spent the 1947–48 academic year in the United States learning about the recently discovered techniques of radiocarbon dating and <b>autoradiography,</b> which she introduced to Europe. She retired from the Zoophysiological Laboratory in 1979, but became involved with the Niels Bohr Archive, where she collected papers of de Hevesy, eventually publishing his biography.|$|E

25|$|<b>Autoradiography,</b> {{also used}} for protein band {{detection}} post gel electrophoresis, uses radioactive isotopes to label proteins, which are then detected by using X-ray film.|$|E
25|$|High Resolution <b>Autoradiography</b> {{procedure}} {{continues to}} be used today by molecular biologists to detect RNA molecules in situ, and to study the localization of genes and DNA sequences.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, Leblond’s {{first attempt}} to use <b>autoradiography</b> failed, the reason being that the radioiodine-128 isotope, with its {{extremely}} short half-life (25 minutes), disintegrated so quickly that too little radioactivity remained to be detected by the photographic emulsion.|$|E
25|$|Despite these advances, it was {{not until}} Ardhendu Mukherjee and W. Beermann {{performed}} more advanced <b>autoradiography</b> experiments in 1965 that scientists could confirm that transcription of genes in the single male X chromosome was double that observed in the two female X chromosomes. Mukherjee and Beermann confirmed this by designing a cellular <b>autoradiography</b> experiment that allowed them to visualize incorporation of uridine into ribonucleic acid of the X chromosomes. Their studies showed equal levels of uridine incorporation in the single male X chromosome and the two female X chromosomes. Thus, the investigators concluded that the two-fold increase in the rate of RNA synthesis in the X chromosome of the male relative to those of the female could account for Muller’s hypothesized dosage compensation.|$|E
25|$|The first {{indirect}} use of {{thymidine kinase}} in biochemical research was {{the identification of}} dividing cells by incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine and subsequent measurement of the radioactivity or <b>autoradiography</b> to identify the dividing cells. For this purpose tritiated thymidine {{is included in the}} growth medium. In spite of errors in the technique, it is still used to determine the growth rate of malignant cells and to study the activation of lymphocytes in immunology.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Leblond {{joined the}} Laboratoire de Synthese Atomique in Paris which was {{involved}} in preparing radioactive isotopes for use in investigating the fate of various molecules in biological processes. Under the guidance of Antoine Lacassagne, Leblond injected radioiodine-128, into a rat {{and found that the}} label promptly accumulated in the thyroid gland, presumably incorporated into the thyroid hormone precursor thyroglobulin. To localize this label more precisely within the thyroid tissue, Leblond attempted to use the novel technique of <b>autoradiography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tritium is {{the active}} {{substance}} in self-powered lighting and controlled nuclear fusion, its other uses including <b>autoradiography</b> and radioactive labeling. It {{is also used}} in nuclear weapon design for boosted fission weapons and initiators. Some tritium is created in heavy water moderated reactors when deuterium captures a neutron. This reaction has a small cross-section (probability of a single neutron-capture event) and produces only small amounts of tritium, although enough to justify cleaning tritium from the moderator every few years to reduce the environmental risk of tritium escape.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Leblond found that, when {{he poured}} liquid {{photographic}} emulsion on a histological section containing a radio element, the emulsion was eventually activated by the radio-element; and if thereafter routine photographic development and fixation {{were applied to}} the emulsion-covered section, black silver grains appeared in the emulsion wherever it overlay sites containing a radio-element. This liquid emulsion approach {{has been used to}} develop a new High Resolution <b>Autoradiography</b> procedure characterized by close contact between emulsion and section. Such close contact makes it possible to localize the radio-elements in the section at high resolution, so that radio-elements can be localized at high magnification in the light microscope.|$|E
25|$|Polyacrylamide gel (PAG) {{had been}} known as a {{potential}} embedding medium for sectioning tissues as early as 1964, and two independent groups employed PAG in electrophoresis in 1959. It possesses several electrophoretically desirable features that make it a versatile medium. It is a synthetic, thermo-stable, transparent, strong, chemically relatively inert gel, and can be prepared {{with a wide range}} of average pore sizes. The pore size of a gel and the reproducibility in gel pore size are determined by three factors, the total amount of acrylamide present (%T) (T = Total concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide monomer), the amount of cross-linker (%C) (C = bisacrylamide concentration), and the time of polymerization of acrylamide (cf. QPNC-PAGE). Pore size decreases with increasing %T; with cross-linking, 5%C gives the smallest pore size. Any increase or decrease in %C from 5% increases the pore size, as pore size with respect to %C is a parabolic function with vertex as 5%C. This appears to be because of non-homogeneous bundling of polymer strands within the gel. This gel material can also withstand high voltage gradients, is amenable to various staining and destaining procedures, and can be digested to extract separated fractions or dried for <b>autoradiography</b> and permanent recording.|$|E
500|$|The RMS {{was named}} and {{discovered}} by J. Altman in 1969 using 3H-thymidine <b>autoradiography</b> in the rat brain. [...] He traced {{the migration of}} labeled cells from the SVZ, which is situated throughout the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles, rostrally to the main olfactory bulb. [...] He also quantitatively studied the effect of age {{on the size of}} the RMS. There is still some ongoing debate about the extent of the RMS and adult SVZ neurogenesis of new neurons in humans.|$|E
500|$|When the war ended, de Hevesy {{elected to}} stay in Sweden, and Bohr decided to drop {{biological}} research at the Institute and return to concentrating on physics. Levi accepted a position at the Zoophysiological Laboratory in Copenhagen, under August Krogh, who, like Bohr, had won a Nobel Prize. She spent the 1947–48 academic year in the United States as a Fellow of the American Association of University Women. While there, she learned from Willard Libby at the University of Chicago about his recently discovered technique of radiocarbon dating. She developed [...] the new technique of [...] <b>autoradiography</b> while working for the United States Atomic Energy Commission at the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Philippe Leblond, [...] (February 5, 1910 [...] April 10, 2007) was {{a pioneer}} of cell biology and stem cell {{research}} and a former Canadian professor of anatomy. Leblond is notable for developing <b>autoradiography</b> and his work showing how cells continuously renew themselves, regardless of age.|$|E
2500|$|Immunohistochemistry or IHC {{staining}} {{of tissue}} sections (or immunocytochemistry, {{which is the}} staining of cells), {{is perhaps the most}} commonly applied immunostaining technique. While the first cases of IHC staining used fluorescent dyes (see immunofluorescence), other non-fluorescent methods using enzymes such as peroxidase (see immunoperoxidase staining) and alkaline phosphatase are now used. These enzymes are capable of catalysing reactions that give a coloured product that is easily detectable by light microscopy. [...] Alternatively, radioactive elements can be used as labels, and the immunoreaction can be visualized by <b>autoradiography.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Immunocytochemistry, which {{involves}} raising antibodies against targeted {{chemical or biological}} entities, includes a few other techniques of interest. A targeted neurotransmitter could be specifically tagged by primary and secondary antibodies with radioactive labeling {{in order to identify}} the neurotransmitter by [...] <b>autoradiography.</b> The presence of neurotransmitters (though not necessarily the location) can be observed in enzyme-linked immunocytochemistry or enzyme--linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in which substrate-binding in the enzymatic assays can induce precipitates, fluorophores, or chemiluminescence. In the event that neurotransmitters cannot be histochemically identified, an alternative method is to locate them by their neural uptake mechanisms.|$|E
2500|$|Leblond used <b>autoradiography</b> to {{introduce}} radioactive precursors of DNA and then examine the renewal and fate of cells of several basic tissue types. He demonstrated {{for the first}} time that most cells and tissues in the adult body undergo continued renewal. Using mathematical models and modern methods of quantitation, Leblond and his colleagues estimated with remarkable accuracy the turnover and mitotic rates of numerous cell types. He and his colleagues made fascinating discoveries that resulted in the introduction of [...] "time dimension" [...] to cells and tissues, opening the doors to the understanding of the cell cycle and to the identification of stem cells.|$|E
2500|$|He {{then turned}} to {{sequencing}} DNA, which would require an entirely different approach. He looked at different ways of using DNA polymerase I from E. coli to copy single stranded DNA. In 1975, together with Alan Coulson, he published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the [...] "Plus and Minus" [...] technique. This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3' termini. These could be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel and visualised using <b>autoradiography.</b> The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement on what had gone before, but was still very laborious. Nevertheless, his group were able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded bacteriophage φX174. This was the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome. To their surprise they discovered that the coding regions {{of some of the}} genes overlapped with one another.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his seminal work on the amino acid sequence of insulin, Frederick Sanger and his colleagues {{played a key role}} in the development of DNA sequencing techniques that enabled the establishment of comprehensive genome sequencing projects. In 1975, he and Alan Coulson published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the Plus and Minus technique. This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3' termini. These could be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (called polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and visualised using <b>autoradiography.</b> The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement, but was still very laborious. [...] Nevertheless, in 1977 his group was able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded bacteriophage φX174, completing the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome. The refinement of the Plus and Minus method resulted in the chain-termination, or Sanger method (see below), which formed the basis of the techniques of DNA sequencing, genome mapping, data storage, and bioinformatic analysis most widely used in the following quarter-century of research. In the same year Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam of Harvard University independently developed the Maxam-Gilbert method (also known as the chemical method) of DNA sequencing, involving the preferential cleavage of DNA at known bases, a less efficient method. For their groundbreaking work in the sequencing of nucleic acids, Gilbert and Sanger shared half the 1980 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Paul Berg (recombinant DNA).|$|E
