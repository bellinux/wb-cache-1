40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} a set of operating points of a fan built in ventilation system of our test car. These operating points are given by the fan pressure characteristics and are defined by a pressure drop of the HVAC system (air ducts and vents) and volumetric flow rate of ventilation air. To cover a wide range of pressure drops situations, four cases of <b>vent</b> <b>flaps</b> setup were examined: (1) all vents opened, (2) only central vents closed (3) only central vents opened and (4) all vents closed. To cover a different volumetric flows, the each case was measured at least for four different speeds of fan defined by the fan voltage. It was observed that the pressure difference of the fan is proportional to the fan voltage and strongly depends on the throttling of the air distribution system by the settings of the <b>vents</b> <b>flaps.</b> In case of our test car we identified correlations between volumetric flow rate of ventilation air, fan pressure difference and fan voltage. These correlations will facilitate and reduce time costs of the following experiments with this test car...|$|R

It was powered by the same 4241 cc inline-eight with [...] Weighing in at 160 kg less, it was appreciably faster than the Nervastella. It has a 3130 mm wheelbase and was classified as a 24CV in the French taxation system. This first model can be recognized by having a straight one-piece front bumper, five equally sized <b>vent</b> <b>flaps</b> on the bonnet sides, and a fairly upright grille. The car was considered solid, fast, and safe, albeit lacking in brakes in spite of them being of a servoed (mechanical) design. The TG&#8239;5 model code showed its close relation to the TG/1/2/3/4 models of the Nervastella. Unlike the Nervastella, the first Nervasport received a three- rather than a four-speed gearbox.

50|$|The air (which {{is to be}} cooled), often {{after being}} {{filtered}} by a cabin air filter, is blowed by an adjustable speed electric powered centrifugal blower across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, an {{innovative}} low energy-intensive evaporative cooling {{system has been}} proposed for greenhouse application in near-tropical regions dominated by hot climate. The system can operate under dual- ventilation mode to maintain a favourable microclimate inside the greenhouse. A single ridge type un-even span greenhouse has been considered, targeting a few species of Indian tropical flowers. The greenhouse has a continuous roof vent as well as <b>adjustable</b> side <b>vents</b> and is equipped with exhaust fans on top and roll-up curtains on the sides. The greenhouse is surrounded by shallow water ponds outside its longitudinal walls and evaporative surfaces partially cover the free water surface. Inside the pond, low cost evaporative surfaces are so placed that they form air channels.   Thus, outside air flows through the channels formed by the wetted surfaces over the water surface and undergoes evaporative cooling before entering the greenhouse. A simplified theoretical model has been {{presented in this paper}} to predict the inside greenhouse air temperature while ambient weather data are used as model inputs. The study reveals that during average radiation periods, the greenhouse can depends solely on natural ventilation and during peak radiation hours fan-induced ventilation is needed to maintain the required level of temperature. It is seen that under dual-ventilation mode greenhouse, temperature can be kept 3 - 6 oC lower than ambient temperature when saturation effectiveness is 0. 7 and with 75 % shading.   Keywords: Greenhouse, Evaporative Cooling, Ventilation, Saturation Effectiveness, Wetted Surface Article History: Received February 25 th 2017; Received in revised form April 14 th 2017; Accepted May 4 th 2017; Available online How to Cite This Article: Misra, D. and Ghosh, S., (2017) Performance Study of a Floricultural Greenhouse Surrounded by Shallow Water Ponds.

The turtle releasing device with <b>flapped</b> <b>vent</b> has already been developed for small-scaled pound nets, but seems ineffective for large-scaled pound nets because the turtles rarely encounter the device in a large bag net. This study examined the validity of the sloping upper panel for guiding sea turtle to the releasing device in the bag net. Tank experiments were performed with three types of experimental bag nets: a box-shaped net with horizontal upper panel, one with square-pyramid shaped upper panels of 10 degrees (10 degrees slope net), and square-pyramid shaped bag net with upper panel of 20 degrees (20 degrees slope net). Five loggerheads in captivity (SCL: 42. 8 cm- 50. 0 cm) were prepared. The turtle swam around after entering the bag net, and about five minutes later it started to push its head up against the upper panel. In the 20 degrees slope net, the turtle moved to the shallowest space of the net. This suggested that the sloping upper panel guided the loggerhead turtle to the releasing device in the bag net of a largescaled pound net...|$|R

The present study evaluated and compared four sampling techniques: carcass rinse, <b>vent</b> skin <b>flap</b> sampling, thoracic skin flap sampling, and the FSIS approved sponge method in a turkey processing plant. Carcass rinse was consistently and significantly superior to tested alternatives for the detection of Salmonella in this plant. Salmonella recovery using the carcass rinse technique on split flocks at the re-hang area from 2 different scald systems suggested that countercurrent water flow improved the microbiological quality when temperatures were similar. However, elevations of the concurrent scald tank temperature eliminated the apparent benefit of directional flow. In contrast to most previously-reported observations in broiler processing plants, overall Salmonella recovery did not increase during processing and a significantly (P < 0. 05) lower overall recovery incidence from 4 flocks was observed immediately pre-chill as compared to post-feather removal. Also in contrast to previously-reported data from broiler processing plants, overall Salmonella recovery incidence in the turkey ceca was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than in the crop in 9 flocks evaluated. These data suggest that microbiological investigations to determine plant-specific critical control points in turkey plants are warranted prior to implementation of intervention strategies. After evaluation of turkey processing, we evaluated broiler carcasses in a commercial broiler processing plant for Salmonella incidence on carcasses that had been passed or retained by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) with regard to visible fecal or ingesta contamination. Contaminated and non-contaminated carcasses were removed from the processing line at the site of FSIS inspection (pre-immersion chilling) and subjected to the carcass rinse sampling procedure for Salmonella incidence recovery. Broiler flocks were evaluated over a 2 day period. Although a numerical association of increasing Salmonella recovery with visible contamination was observed, no significant (P < 0. 05) differences in Salmonella recovery incidence were identified in any single flock or combined data when evaluated. These data suggest that focus on organoleptic parameters of inspection may result in disappointing microbiologic improvements in broiler carcass quality...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of vent type (side, roof or both) and of an anti-aphid insect screen used to prevent insect intrusion on the ventilation rate of a round arch with vertical side walls, polyethylene covered greenhouse. The greenhouse was equipped with two side roll-up <b>vents</b> and a <b>flap</b> roof <b>vent</b> located at the University of Thessaly near Velestino in the continental area of Eastern Greece. Microclimate variables {{as well as the}} airflow rate were measured during summer. Two measuring methods were used for the determination of ventilation rate: (a) the decay rate 'tracer gas' method, using nitrous oxide N 2 O as tracer gas, and (b) the greenhouse 'energy balance' method. In order to study the effect of vent type on ventilation rate, in a greenhouse with an anti-aphid insect screen in the vent openings, airflow was determined during periods with ventilation being performed by: (i) roof, (ii) side or (iii) both roof and side vents. Furthermore, in order to study the effect of insect proof screen on airflow, measurements were also carried out during periods that ventilation was performed by side vents without a screen in the openings. A good correlation was found between the air exchange rate values calculated using the two methods, with the values obtained by the tracer gas method being slightly lower than those obtained by the energy balance method. Furthermore, the data of ventilation rate obtained by the tracer gas method fitted better to the model used for the prediction of ventilation rate. In addition, the use of anti-aphid screen in vent openings caused a 33 % reduction in greenhouse ventilation rate. From greenhouse ventilation performance point of view, {{it was found that the}} most effective vent configuration was the combination of roof and side vents, followed by side vents only (46 % reduction in ventilation), while the least effective was roof vent (71 % reduction ventilation). © 2006 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|R
