He also developed skin lesions {{that may have been}} symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma. After finishing The Songlines in August 1986, Chatwin went to Switzerland, where he collapsed on the street. At a clinic there, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to how he might have contracted HIV, including from a gang rape in Dahomey or possibly from Sam Wagstaff, the patron and lover of Robert Mapplethorpe.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{designed}} Deal Castle, but Sir Edward Ryngeley and Thomas Wingfield served as the commissioners for the project, with Robert Loyrde and David Marten as the paymaster and comptroller, and Christopher Dickenson and William Clement as the master mason and carpenters. Work began at Deal in April and progressed at speed, with 1,400 men <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site by the following month. A strike for higher pay was broken up over the summer by Ryngeley and by December, when Anne of Cleves dined there, the castle was mostly completed. Deal and the other fortifications along the Downs cost the Crown a total of £27,092 to build, much of which came from proceeds of {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries a few years before. Lead, timber and stone from local monasteries were also recycled for use in Deal Castle.|$|E
25|$|Impatient to {{complete}} his epic cycle, Wagner began work on the preliminary draft of Götterdämmerung on 2 October 1869, {{while he was still}} <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third act of Siegfried. There was to be no fair copy of this the final opera in the cycle, so the three acts passed through just three stages: preliminary draft (Gesamtentwurf), orchestral draft (Orchesterskizze), and full score (Partiturerstschrift). Wagner had altered his modus operandi once again while <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last two acts of Die Meistersinger: now it was his practice to finish both complete drafts of each act in turn before beginning the full score of the entire opera.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Pernkopf was hard <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth volume. Two of his former colleagues, Alexander Pickler and Werner Platzer, {{completed}} it for its 1960 publication. A few years later, the publisher brought out a condensed two-volume set with all the color plates, removing most of Pernkopf's explanatory text (and, later, airbrushing out the Nazi symbols Lepier and the others added to their signatures). Since little translation was necessary, this was the version of the atlas which medical students and physicians elsewhere in the world came to know and revere.|$|E
25|$|Despite his fame, he {{continued}} to live an impoverished and hectic existence, which probably contributed to the decline of his health. By 1931, he was dividing his time between Bucharest and Constanţa, having agreed to paint the walls of Saint George's Church in the latter city. Tonitza was angered by the reception of his work in Constanţa, declaring himself insulted after he was made to showcase his designs in competition to lesser-known artists. Eventually, he received the commission, {{and spent the next}} two years <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> murals, while distancing himself from Grupul celor patru.|$|E

25|$|Hitchcock was a film fan {{from his}} teenage years, and in 1919 began his film {{career at the}} age of twenty, working as a title card {{designer}} for the London branch of the American firm Famous Players-Lasky, the production arm of Paramount Pictures, at Islington Studios. After Famous Players-Lasky pulled out of London in 1922, Hitchcock stayed as part of the studio staff.

25|$|After {{additional}} sharp {{exchanges between}} Soviet and Chinese delegates over Albania at the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Twenty-Second Party Congress in October 1961, Khrushchev lambasted the Albanians for executing a pregnant, pro-Soviet {{member of the}} Albanian party Politburo Liri Gega, and the Soviet Union finally broke diplomatic relations with Albania in December. Moscow then withdrew all Soviet economic advisers and technicians from the country, including those <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Palace of Culture, and halted shipments of supplies and spare parts for equipment already in place in Albania. In addition, the Soviet Union continued to dismantle its naval installations on Sazan Island, a process that had begun even before the break in relations.|$|E
25|$|The {{first attempt}} to model the {{distribution}} of galaxies with a fractal pattern was made by Luciano Pietronero and his team in 1987, and a more detailed view of the universe’s large-scale structure emerged over the following decade, {{as the number of}} cataloged galaxies grew larger. Pietronero argues that the universe shows a definite fractal aspect over a fairly wide range of scale, with a fractal dimension of about 2. The fractal dimension of a homogeneous 3D object would be 3, and 2 for a homogeneous surface, whilst the fractal dimension for a fractal surface is between 2 and 3. The ultimate significance of this result is not immediately apparent, but it seems to indicate that both randomness and hierarchal structuring are <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scale of galaxy clusters and larger.|$|E

25|$|By Saturday, March 30, Sheriff Presley and Chief of Police Jack Runnels {{posted a}} $500 reward {{in an effort}} to gain any new {{information}} on the Griffin and Moore case that would lead to the arrest and conviction of the slayer or slayers. Officers stated that all clues found thus far had been fruitless. The results from the blood-stained sand were expected to arrive the day before, but due to delays at the laboratory, the results had not come in. By April 11, the officers were still hard <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> case. Presley said that his department and other authorities had not relaxed for one minute since the discovery of the crime. He also stated that the $500 reward was still being offered and that no tip, no matter how small, was left without a thorough investigation.|$|E
25|$|As is {{sometimes}} common in scientific discoveries, simultaneous developments can occur, {{as evidenced by}} a number of inventors who were <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> telephone. Over a period of 18 years, the Bell Telephone Company faced 587 court challenges to its patents, including five that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage. Bell's laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments. The Bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by Elisha Gray and Amos Dolbear. In personal correspondence to Bell, both Gray and Dolbear had acknowledged his prior work, which considerably weakened their later claims.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1903–1905 that the Barringer Crater was {{correctly}} identified as an impact crater, and it {{was not until}} as recently as 1963 that research by Eugene Merle Shoemaker conclusively proved this hypothesis. The findings of late 20th-century space exploration and the work of scientists such as Shoemaker demonstrated that impact cratering was by far the most widespread geological process <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Solar System's solid bodies. Every surveyed solid body in the Solar System was found to be cratered, and {{there was no reason to}} believe that the Earth had somehow escaped bombardment from space. In the last few decades of the 20th century, a large number of highly modified impact craters began to be identified. The first direct observation of a major impact event occurred in 1994: the collision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter.|$|E

25|$|Workers {{also had}} {{good reasons for}} discontent: overcrowded housing with often deplorable {{sanitary}} conditions, long hours <b>at</b> <b>work</b> (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> eve of the war a 10-hour workday {{six days a week}} was the average and many were working 11–12 hours a day by 1916), constant risk of injury and death from poor safety and sanitary conditions, harsh discipline (not only rules and fines, but foremen's fists), and inadequate wages (made worse after 1914 by steep wartime increases in the cost of living). At the same time, urban industrial life was full of benefits, though these could be just as dangerous, {{from the point of view}} of social and political stability, as the hardships. There were many encouragements to expect more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and desires. Living in cities, workers encountered material goods such as they had never seen in villages. Most important, living in cities, they were exposed to new ideas about the social and political order.|$|E
25|$|The {{final stage}} of the {{compositional}} process was the writing out in ink of a fair copy of the full score (Reinschrift der Partitur). This task was begun by Wagner himself on 15 February 1854, {{while he was still}} <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> instrumentation draft. It was delayed, however, by his decision to start work on Die Walküre (28 June 1854). Sometime in the summer of 1854 he hired a copyist to make a fair copy in ink of Das Rheingold (using his own unfinished fair copy as a model), but the copyist's work was so full of blunders that Wagner was forced to dismiss him and resume work on his own copy. He worked at it on and off for several months, alternating this work with the ongoing composition of Die Walküre. By 25 September 1854 the fair copy of Das Rheingold was finally completed. Wagner then sent it to the Dresden copyist Friedrich Wölfel, who completed a beautiful and very accurate ink copy on 11 November 1855. Wöfel's copy was used as the source-text (Stichvorlage) for the first public printing of the complete opera in 1873.|$|E
25|$|On June 24, 1963, the United Freedom Movement (UFM), a local {{civil rights}} organization, {{announced}} it would begin picketing the convention center construction site within five to seven days. The issue was racism: Some labor unions, which controlled all the work at the site through what was effectively a closed shop, refused to permit African Americans as members. The UFM and NAACP {{pointed out that there}} were just 27 African Americans <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site out of a total workforce of 300. The Cleveland Community Relations Board, supported by Cleveland Mayor Ralph S. Locher, Chamber of Commerce president Curtis Lee Smith, and Cleveland Federation of Labor president Patrick J. O'Malley, met with UFM representatives on Friday, June 28, in attempt to head off Monday's picketing. At the meeting, the UFM demanded that four unions which had no African American members—Electricians' Local 38, Plumbers Local 55, Sheet Metal Workers Local 65, and Structural Iron Workers Local 17—hire minority workers immediately. The four unions claimed they were not discriminating, but simply could not find workers qualified to pass the licensure tests required by union rules. The talks failed, and it was unclear if the UFM would picket prior to the next planned meeting, on July 11.|$|E
