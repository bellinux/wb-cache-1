Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003) {{indicates}} Potter was venturing into new territory in creating a tale with a large human presence (Lucie). Potter's artistic uncertainty is evident in her attempt to establish a relationship between clothes and the social and animal selves of humans and animals. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle wears human clothing while the neighbourhood animals wear and shed only their skins. Logically, Kutzer points out, all the animals should wear either human clothing or only their skins. She believes Peter Rabbit's blue jacket {{is used in the}} tale as a gimmick to remind the reader that other Potter books exist for purchase, and a gimmick that disrupts Potter's artistic intent. If Peter wears human clothing then why do the other animals wear only their skins? The issue of <b>animal</b> <b>clothing</b> versus human clothing is further confused when Mrs. Tiggy-winkle sheds her human clothing {{at the end of the}} tale to reveal herself a hedgehog who may or may not be able to shed her skin as well. If she can shed her skin, then why is she wearing human clothes? [...] Kutzer believes these questions remain unanswered and erode the tale's logic.|$|E

50|$|Sonic the Hedgehog, a game {{released}} in 1991, features a speedy blue hedgehog as the protagonist. This series' characters are almost all anthropomorphic {{animals such as}} foxes, cats, and other hedgehogs {{who are able to}} speak and walk on their hind legs like normal humans. As with most anthropomorphisms of <b>animals,</b> <b>clothing</b> is of little or no importance, where some characters may be fully clothed while some wear only shoes and gloves.|$|R

50|$|Foxtail barley is a fibrous-rooted, densely tufted {{grass that}} grows from 30 - 100 cm tall and is erect or {{reclining}} at the base. The stems are erect and smooth and the leaf sheaths are split and hairy. The inflorescence of the mature plant is a dense, long-awned nodding spike with greenish or purplish colouring. The jointed rachis breaks into sharply pointed segments with three spikelets composing each segment. Only the central spikelet has one creamy coloured seed while each segment has seven awns with upward pointing barbs. These awns {{are up to}} 3 in long and become easily attached to <b>animals,</b> <b>clothing,</b> machinery, etc. Leaf blades are slender and a greyish-green colour.|$|R

40|$|In two studies, {{we tested}} the {{relationship}} between children’s label-learning experience and label-learning ability within diverse superordinate categories with complex perceptual organization (<b>animals,</b> <b>clothing,</b> foods). Using both quasi-experimental and experimental designs, we examined 18 - and 24 -month-old children’s ability to generalize labels for novel members of superordinate categories {{as a product of}} their previous experience in learning labels for members of those categories. As predicted, children properly generalized more labels for members of the categories within which they had more label-learning experience than for members of the categories within which they had less label-learning experience. Results are consistent with the idea that children develop category-specific label-learning biases through their experience in learning labels for category members; they carry implications for multiple accounts of vocabulary acquisition and identify directions for future research...|$|R

Then the professor introduces his class to more foreign language words and images periodically prompting viewers to repeat and asking review questions such as [...] "what is the cat wearing?"

Similarly, the adaptations of birds' bills in species like the crossbill, spoonbill and (long-billed) snipe are discussed.|$|R

The group notes on its website: [...] "Every year, millions of animals are killed for the clothing industry—all in the name of fashion. Whether the clothes come from Chinese fur farms, Indian slaughterhouses, or the Australian outback, an immeasurable amount of suffering goes into every fur-trimmed jacket, leather belt, and wool sweater."

40|$|INTRODUCTION It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that living things (e. g. animals, fruits) have greater intracategory structural similarity or visual overlap than nonliving things (e. g., tools, vehicles); and that this visual crowding within-category makes them more difficult to name and discriminate for neurologically damaged individuals, normal subjects, and even monkeys (Humphreys, Riddoch, & Quinlan, 1988; Gaffan & Heywood, 1993). In an attempt to quantify an aspect of this, Humphreys et al. (1988) developed a measure of contour overlap (CO) for subcategories (e. g., <b>animals,</b> <b>clothing)</b> of items from the Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) corpus of line drawings. CO was derived by overlaying a grid on each item with every other item (from the same subcategory) and then calculating the average overlap {{as a function of}} the amount of contour in each picture [...] -overlap appears to have been matched at a gross visible level. They found that contour overlap (and hence structural similarity) was greater fo...|$|R
40|$|Colour is {{one element}} in human life. Colour is a {{creation}} {{that has a}} secret of its own if it is described and studied its occurrence. This article aimed to collect the verses of the Quran and the Prophet hadith which discuss about white colour. Thus there are twelve verses that deal with white colour and seven from Hadith in al-Kutub al-Sittah. Analysis is done through deductive analysis method to obtain a conclusion that shows association with the matter. The {{study found that the}} verses of the Quran were related to the light, happy person on the Day of Resurrection, eye diseases, miracles of Moses, the mountain colour, the colour of drink in heaven and the nature of women in heaven. While specializing in hadith al-Kutub al-Sittah found it focus on five things: light, <b>animals,</b> <b>clothing,</b> skin colour and the colour of milk.
