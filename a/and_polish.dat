50|$|Industrial {{development}} in Bhavnagar district {{could be attributed}} to the presence {{of a large number of}} diamond cutting <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> units, salt <b>and</b> marine chemicals, plastics, shipbuilding, and ship-breaking industries.Bhavnagar is an important center for the diamond cutting <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> industry in Gujarat as well as India. Thousands of skilled diamond-polishing workers are employed in diamond-cutting <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> firms, whose subsidiary offices are involved in cities like Surat, Mumbai, and Antwerp. Bhavnagar stands second in the diamond cutting <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> industry after Surat in India, with 6,000 units operating from the district and employing more than 300,000 people. Bhavnagar's commercial importance is enhanced by its proximity to the Gulf of Cambay and the Arabian Sea.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of finishing <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> procedures on the surface texture of compomer materials (Dyract and Compoglass) using the Enhance finishing <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> system. Forty-five cylindrical specimens were prepared from each material. Fifteen specimens of each material were light cured against a Mylar strip with no finishing or polishing (control), 15 others were finished only using the Enhance finishing system (experimental) and another 15 specimens were finished <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> using the Enhance finishing <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> system (experimental). All specimens were prepared at room temperature and stored for 3 days in closed containers of distilled water (300 ml) in a laboratory oven at 37 oC before testing. Both control and experimental specimens of each material were examined and photographed at different magnifications using a stereomicroscope and an SEM. Also, the surface roughness of all specimens was measured with a surface roughness analyzer. The surfaces cured against the Mylar strip demonstrated the smoothest surface. Following the Mylar strip surface, the next smoothest surface was seen in finished <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> Dyract followed by finished Compoglass. Finishing <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> procedures of compomer materials failed to reproduce the smoothness of surfaces created by mylar strips...|$|R

5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments {{arrived on}} the scene. Although the troops {{assisted}} in crowd control, their arrival was also a reaction of the authorities to fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian <b>and</b> <b>Polish</b> actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, Ron Jeffery, an agent of British <b>and</b> <b>Polish</b> intelligence in occupied Poland, eluded the Abwehr and travelled to London with a report from Poland to the British government. His efforts were at first highly regarded, but subsequently ignored by the British, which a disillusioned Jeffery attributed to the treachery of Kim Philby and other high-ranking communist agents entrenched in the British system. Jeffery tried to inform the British government about the Katyn massacre, but was as a result released from the Army.|$|E
5000|$|The cutting <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> of {{diamonds}} occurs {{mainly in the}} city of Surat, which is also known as 'Diamond City'. The cutting <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> units in Surat vary from large firms employing several thousands of diamond cutting <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> workers to very small informal enterprises having a few workers. The larger Cutting <b>and</b> <b>Polishing</b> of Diamonds (CPD) units have relatively better work and employment conditions and even provide for elaborate benefits. Most of the CPD units are owned by Kathiawadis, who were originally farmers from Northern Gujarat region. The whole diamond cutting <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> industry is largely community oriented, where most of the owners and workers are Kathiawadis. [...] In the recession of 2008, while many of the small and medium-sized CPD units were closed down with lay-off of workers, there were still some big CPD enterprises who managed to retain their workforce. This was primarily because of the paternal approach of owners, by which they consider workers as extended family members ...|$|R

With American and Canadian forces facing German counterattacks in their sectors, the Polish forces would have to defend against two veteran Panzer divisions to keep the gap closed.|$|E

5|$|Facing {{logistical}} problems, the new Polish Commander-in-Chief Jan Krukowiecki, who {{had replaced}} Dembiński in mid-August, ordered a sortie {{on the right}} bank.

Unlike Skrzynecki, he believed foreign intervention to be unrealistic, and wanted to force the Russians to return to peace talks by defeating the Russian forces, breaking the siege or defeating the assault attempts.|$|E
5|$|Frederick III's war on Sweden gave Charles X Gustav {{a reason}} to abandon the Polish–Lithuanian {{deadlock}} and fight Denmark instead. After marching his army {{to the west and}} making a dangerous crossing of the frozen straits in the winter of 1657/58, he surprised the unprepared Frederick III on the Danish isles and forced him into surrender. In the Treaty of Roskilde, Denmark had to abandon all Danish provinces in what is now Southern Sweden.

40|$|In this study, surface {{roughness}} of three esthetic materials namely composite resin, resin-modified glass ionomer, and a compomer were examined using three finishing <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> systems. Thirty samples of each material were prepared. Ten samples from each material were then finished <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> {{with one of}} the three systems (Sof-Lex discs, a combination of diamond and silicone points, and carbide finishing burs). Surface roughness (R) of the samples after finishing <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> were measured using a perthometer. The results showed that Sof-Lex discs and a combination of diamond and silicone points produced significantly better finished <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> surfaces on composite resin than on the other two materials. The roughest surfaces were obtained by carbide burs on glass ionomer (Photac-Fil). Although a combination of diamond and silicone points could provide acceptable finishing <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> surfaces for composite resin and resin-modified glass ionomer surfaces, Sof-Lex discs provided smoother surfaces.
