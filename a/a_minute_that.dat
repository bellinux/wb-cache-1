5|$|German glass {{ornaments}} {{were introduced}} to America by Frank Woolworth in the 1880s but such ornaments were produced under labor-intensive conditions and were expensive, with few Americans being able to afford {{more than one or}} two ornaments per year. On the eve of World War II, however, American companies began manufacturing inexpensive, mass-produced ornaments that made it possible for almost any American to have an extensive collection of Christmas ornaments for little cost within moments. With a few modifications, Corning Glass's light bulb machine could spit out 2,000 blank glass ornaments <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>that</b> were then bought by ornament companies to be decorated, packaged and sold by the dozen.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Sean Canfield threw an {{interception}} on the Cal 1-yard line, but Kevin Riley was intercepted in turn, which the Beavers {{were able to}} convert into a field goal. In the fourth quarter, Oregon State put together a scoring drive over six minutes long that culminated in a 24-yard touchdown run by Jacquizz Rodgers. With the game out of reach, Riley led the Bears on a drive lasting less than <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>that</b> ended in a 2-yard touchdown pass to Verran Tucker with a minute left to play. An attempt at an onside kick was recovered by Oregon State, and Canfield took two straight knees to end the game.|$|E
500|$|Fillmore {{hoped to}} gain the {{endorsement}} of the New York delegation to the national convention, but Weed wanted the vice presidency for Seward, with Fillmore as governor. Seward, however, withdrew prior to the 1844 Whig National Convention. [...] When Weed's replacement vice presidential hopeful, Willis Hall, fell ill, Weed sought to defeat Fillmore's candidacy to force him to run for governor. Weed's attempts to boost Fillmore as a gubernatorial candidate caused the former congressman to write, [...] "I am not willing to be treacherously killed by this pretended kindness... do not suppose for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>that</b> I think they desire my nomination for governor." [...] New York sent a delegation to Baltimore pledged to support Clay, but with no instructions as to how to vote for vice president. Weed told out-of-state delegates that the New York party preferred to have Fillmore as its gubernatorial candidate, and after Clay was nominated for president, the second place on the ticket fell to former New Jersey senator Theodore Frelinghuysen.|$|E

500|$|A new storyline {{began in}} August 2016 when Babe became {{the victim of}} a revenge attack, having {{accumulated}} several enemies over {{the months leading up to}} the attack. Several media outlets suggested a range of suspects, with the most prominent suspects being Claudette, Les and Pam, Abi and Sylvie. Other suspects included: Linda, Lee, Whitney, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) and Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa). The episode that aired in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2016 saw Babe argue with Claudette, Les, Abi and Sylvie with each suspect later seen going out, before someone confronts Babe in the Vic, locking her in the freezer. The scene where Babe is locked in the freezer received the episode's [...] "duff-duff". Episodes following the attack showed Babe tell her family that Sylvie was responsible for the attack, but have a conversation with Abi revealing her as the true culprit. Badland said that the attack [...] "takes Babe by surprise" [...] as [...] "she clearly didn't know there was somebody out there capable of doing this to her or else she'd have seen it coming." [...] She opined that [...] "Babe doesn't think for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>that</b> Abi could ever get the better of her." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Rucker it {{was largely}} an issue of musical genre and the high school group {{changing}} his thinking on it: [...] "I knew the song, and {{to me it was}} such a perfect bluegrass tune that I didn't think I could do it. But they did a country version of it, with drums and pedal steel. I was like, 'Wait <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> <b>That</b> would be a great country song.'" [...] On deciding to go country with it, Rucker says: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{session of}} a Yearly Meeting, {{as with all}} Quaker {{business}} sessions, is considered a time of worship in dealing with matters of business. [...] When a matter has been presented and explained, the Friends who are gathered wait in silence, listening to the leading of God's spirit within them. [...] Those who feel led to do so share their insights, while the others listen. [...] Eventually a 'sense of the meeting' begins to emerge. [...] The clerk of the meetinga type of facilitator or the Recording Clerka person who writes the minutes tries to formulate <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>that</b> reflects {{the sense of the}} meeting. More input may follow. [...] When it is clear that there is agreement, the sense of the meeting is recorded in the minute. [...] Some Friends at the meeting may have reservations about the matter but choose to defer to the others. [...] Friends believe and hope that the minute is God's will on the matter. [...] However, nothing is considered a permanent and inviolable law among Friends and every matter is open to future change.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} scene, where Moe and Larry were {{breaking}} rocks over Curly's head, Larry picks up {{what seems to}} be a rather heavy rock. Curly notices the rock and replies, [...] "Hey, wait <b>a</b> <b>minute!</b> <b>That's</b> <b>a</b> real one! I'm no fool." [...] Curly then chuckles, while Larry and Moe smile. This represents the only time the Stooges broke character on film.|$|R

2500|$|Melinda Newman of Hitfix was {{positive}} in her review, {{saying that the}} song [...] "It {{lives up to its}} title: You'll want to put on your dancing shoes and dance again. The song isn’t as interesting musically as the pair’s previous hit collaboration, “On the Floor” but it is more consistent in its commitment to being a full-on dance twirler [...] It’s totally charming, especially the [...] "woo..ooh" [...] background singing." [...] Newman compared the chorus of the song to Rihanna's [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] (2010). Gina Serpe of E! News said [...] "don't think for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>that</b> the meaning behind the song was lost on Lopez, who's been through some personal travails of her own this past year," [...] and briefly commented that the song was [...] "Likely already destined to hit the top of the charts." [...] Similarly, Jessica Sinclair of Long Island Press commented that the song was a [...] "sure-to-be-hit song." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Pop Crush labelled [...] "Dance Again" [...] {{as one of the best}} dance songs of 2012. She stated that: [...] "The song has an infectious beat that'll get you moving and grooving." ...|$|E
