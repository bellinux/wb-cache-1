5|$|In 1898 {{a friend}} of Watts {{suggested}} to Henry Gamble, Vicar of St Botolph's Aldersgate, that should the church manage to purchase the land owned by the CPF {{it would make a}} suitable site for Watts's memorial. Watts was approached, and agreed to the suggestion. On 13October 1898 the appeal was relaunched, with the proposal that if the remaining £3,000 were raised, Watts would design and build <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> way, which in due course would be lined with memorial tablets to commemorate the bravery of ordinary people. Watts planned to build <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> way around three sides of a quadrangle, with the roof supported on stone or timber columns.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, a new {{station in}} the Tomorrowland section was built for the DRR. Tomorrowland Station, {{consisting}} of <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> platform with no station building, was constructed in April 1958 with a futuristic theme, which was updated in 1998 {{as part of a}} redevelopment of the Tomorrowland section.|$|E

There are also a 263-seat theatrette, a roof terrace for gatherings, and music, study and activity rooms.|$|E
5|$|Section 3(c) {{contains}} its own preclearance {{language and}} differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> jurisdiction {{until such time}} as the jurisdiction may bail out of coverage under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance {{for as long as the}} court orders. Moreover, the court may require the jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from Section 5 preclearance, which requires <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes.|$|E

5|$|The {{final case}} in which the Supreme Court upheld Section 5 was Lopez v. Monterey County (Lopez II) (1999). In Lopez II, the Court reiterated its {{reasoning}} in Katzenbach and Rome, and it upheld as constitutional the requirement that covered local governments obtain preclearance before implementing voting changes that their parent state required them to implement, even if the parent state was not itself <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|The guns {{mounted in}} the open battery were lighter {{than those in the}} casemates and were not {{enclosed}} but traversed on rails in the open air. <b>A</b> <b>covered</b> section between each emplacement led to an ammunition lift shaft up which the shells and cartridges were raised using lifting gear that still survives.|$|E

5000|$|A {{major reason}} for the notion of <b>a</b> good <b>cover</b> is that the Leray {{spectral}} sequence of a fiber bundle degenerates for <b>a</b> good <b>cover,</b> and so the Čech cohomology associated with <b>a</b> good <b>cover</b> {{is the same as}} the Čech cohomology of the space. (Such <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> is known as <b>a</b> Leray <b>cover.)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} artwork is {{displayed}} on {{the exterior of the}} building. Sculptor Leo Friedlander used Vermont marble for the large relief sculptures {{on both sides of the}} main entrance. One sculpture depicts Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and Sacagawea, with a map of their expedition's route on the reverse (Lewis and Clark); the other (Covered Wagon) shows pioneers and <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> wagon, with a map of the Oregon Trail on the reverse. Additionally, Ellerhusen created five marble relief sculptures on the exterior, and a metal sculpture by Tom Morandi sits above the south entrance. Ellerhusen also cast six bronze sculptures arranged above the building's main entrance, three on the inside and three on the outside.|$|E
5|$|Also during 1956, the Fantasyland Depot, a new {{station with}} a Medieval theme and {{consisting}} of <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> platform with no station building, {{was created for}} the DRR in the Fantasyland section. By the time this new station was added, the DRR's system of having one train assigned to a single station and using sidings to pass trains stopped at stations was abandoned and replaced by the current system where each train stops at every station along the railroad's route. Fantasyland Depot was removed by July 1966 when the It's a Small World attraction, originally built for the 1964 New York World's Fair, was installed.|$|E
5|$|Ashton Bus Station {{is being}} {{converted}} into a state-of-the-art transport interchange. <b>A</b> <b>covered</b> concourse will replace the five island platforms, and the site will {{be linked to the}} Metrolink terminus. It will have new waiting areas, bicycle parking, and better access to travel information and tickets. Improved pedestrian routes will take people into the town centre. Construction is expected to take two years and the interchange should be open by the end of 2018.|$|E

5000|$|The {{problem was}} posed by Henri Lebesgue {{in a letter}} to Gyula Pál in 1914. It was {{published}} in a paper by Pál in 1920 along with Pál's analysis. He showed that <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> for all curves of constant width one is also <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> for all sets of diameter one and that <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> can be constructed by taking a regular hexagon with an inscribed circle of diameter one and removing two corners from the hexagon to give <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> of area [...]|$|R
5000|$|In July 2013, Thompson self-{{released}} <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> of Naughty Boy's single [...] "La La La".

5|$|Barrow {{was born}} in Springfield, Illinois, the oldest of four children, all male, born to Effie Ann Vinson-Heller and John Barrow. Barrow's father fought in the Ohio Volunteer Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, Barrow's parents, with John's mother, brothers, and sisters, {{traveled}} in <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> wagon to Nebraska; Barrow was born on a hemp plantation belonging to relatives during the trip. The Barrows lived in Nebraska for six years before moving to Des Moines, Iowa. His middle name, Grant, was bestowed on him in honor of Ulysses S. Grant, the Civil War general.|$|E
5|$|Between 1848 and 1852, land speculators {{laid out}} streets and {{commercial}} plots surrounding the new station. Industry, {{made possible by}} the railroad connections to major cities, soon arrived: a plow company in 1850, a tannery in 1854, and an iron foundry soon after. The city of Ayer, named after Groton-born James Cook Ayer, was incorporated from parts of Groton and Shirley in 1871; the railroad station was then renamed Ayer Junction. The station received a small expansion that year, and <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> island platform was built between the W tracks. The roof was rebuilt with new trusses; the former iron supporting pillars were used to construct the upper story of the nearby Spaulding Block.|$|E
5|$|Born in <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> wagon in Springfield, Illinois, Barrow {{worked as}} a {{journalist}} and soap salesman before entering the business of baseball by selling concessions at games. From there, Barrow purchased minor league baseball teams, also serving as team manager, and {{served as president of}} the Atlantic League. After managing the Tigers in 1903 and 1904 and returning to the minor leagues, Barrow became disenchanted with baseball, and left the game to operate a hotel.|$|E

5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the Loggia, which contained the staircase to access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> overpass, a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E
5|$|By 1894 two Manning Wardle {{locomotives}} were in use: Huddersfield, works number 616, built 1876, and Earl Temple, works number 1249, built 1894. Huddersfield {{was bought}} second-hand and {{had originally been}} named Prestwich. Earl Temple, later renamed Brill No.1, was identical to Huddersfield other than having <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> cab, and was bought new. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad could not afford the price, and thus Earl Temple was owned directly by the Earl and rented to the O Wotton No. 2, works number 1415, built 1899, was bought on 7 February 1899 to replace Huddersfield. All three were 0-6-0ST with inside cylinders. The decrepit Huddersfield was sold in 1901, {{and the other two}} Manning Wardle locomotives were sold in 1909.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of the set}} {{began on}} December 5, 1994, on Paramount Stage 16. The set's {{construction}} pushed the episode's cost over its budget. This was considered normal for a new series and the next four episodes also exceeded their budgets. Despite {{the high cost of}} the manor set, the crew designed it for repeated use {{over the course of the}} series. This was more appealing than shooting several sequences of <b>a</b> <b>covered</b> wagon on location in the countryside. Curry took special care to merge the blue-screen effects with Kolbe's footage seamlessly to achieve the effect of the manor transforming back into the holodeck. Curry and Kolbe had worked together on previous projects that required similar special effects.|$|E
