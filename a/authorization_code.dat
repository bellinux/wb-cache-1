When a user request one time <b>authorization</b> <b>code</b> (OTAC), a service provider send it via post or a registered mail and then a user can use it for authentication. For example, in the UK, some banks send their one time <b>authorization</b> <b>code</b> (OTAC) for Internet banking authorization via post or a registered mail.|$|E

The watermark is capable of carrying such information as authentication or <b>authorization</b> <b>codes,</b> or a legend essential for image interpretation. This capabilityisenvisaged to find application in image tagging, copyright enforcement, counterfeit protection, and controlled access. In this paper, we first outline the desirable characteristics of digital watermarks. Previous work in digital watermarking is then summarized.

40|$|Recent roll-outs of {{contactless}} payment infrastruc-tures – {{particularly in}} Austria and Germany – have {{raised concerns about}} the security of contactless pay-ment cards and Near Field Communication (NFC). There are well-known attack scenarios like relay at-tacks and skimming of credit card numbers. How-ever, banks and credit card schemes often mitigate these attacks. They explain that attacks are im-practical (e. g. in a relay attack an attacker needs to have RF access to a victim’s card while perform-ing a payment transaction) or even impossible (e. g. skimmed data does not contain the dynamic autho-rization codes that are normally required to perform a payment transaction). This paper introduces an attack scenario on EMV contactless payment cards that permits an attacker to create functional clones of a card that contain the necessary credit card data as well as pre-played <b>authorization</b> <b>codes.</b> The card clones can then be used to perform a limited num-ber of EMV Mag-Stripe transactions at any EMV contactless payment terminal. ...|$|R
50|$|A typical cable {{communications}} system includes several basic components {{such as a}} service provider, a Cable television headend, a Business Support Systems (BSS), an Operations Support System (OSS), a controller and a customer's Set-top box (STB), {{also known as a}} Cable Converter Box, or simply a converter, or more correctly converter/descrambler. The Set-Top box is a key component in Addressability Systems it is an Integrated receiver/decoder (IRD). Normally, the Headend receives a signal sent by a service provider, which may send the signal, for example, via an uplink (UL) to a satellite and a downlink (DL) from the satellite to the Headend. At the Headend, the signal may be manipulated, for example, by being scrambled, encrypted and having <b>authorization</b> <b>codes</b> attached thereto by a Scrambler. The billing system or BSS typically manages products and services, customers and addressable equipment such as the converters and controllers. A customer's request for a certain service or product is normally forwarded to the BSS. The billing system or BSS sends instructions to the controller, which configures the converter in accordance with the instructions. The controller also communicates with the headend to receive the proper authorization information needed for the particular configuration. This information is sent to the converter. The converter also receives the signal and compares information on the signal to corresponding authorization from the controller. Based on the comparison, the customer's STB {{may or may not be}} able to descramble the signal and view the content or Television Program.|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{provides}} an opportunity for transatlantic students to access course materials and simulation models from outside the campus, outside the country and outside the continent. This can be achieved through a Web-based remote access learning protocol. Remote access pertains to the communication with a data processing facility from a remote location such as a computer lab or home computer through a data link. For remote access, individual <b>authorization</b> <b>codes</b> are usually required which give transatlantic student team members the flexibility to access and control their projects on the local computers from anywhere and study the learning objects independent of time and location. For this purpose transportation models are developed and installed to monitor and control the transportation process, depending on constraints for different real world transportation scenarios. Henceforth, transatlantic students can access and run transportation scenarios via the Internet. This is regarded as a distributed virtual teaching and learning environment in transportation that supports collaboration between transatlantic (distant) team members, such as students, instructors and researchers as they develop plans and procedures for classes, case studies and projects, perform measurements and data processing as part of their transportation projects. This approach allows collaborative work at an international level independently of location and time. The Web-based remote access architecture helps to improve student skills in international collaborative projects, a requirement for the workforce of tomorrow in the modern globalized industrial world. 89 90 INNOVATIONS 201...|$|R

40|$|In recent times, Internet {{is being}} {{increasingly}} {{used as the}} platform for distribution of digital multimedia content. The inherent flexibility of Internet facilitates users to transact with one another to create, distribute, store, peruse, subscribe, enhance, modify and trade digital content in various forms like text documents, databases, e-books, still images, audio, video, computer software and games. The use of an open medium like Internet gives rise to concerns about protection and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights of the digital content involved in the transaction. In addition, unauthorized replication and manipulation of digital content is relatively trivial and can be done using inexpensive tools, unlike the traditional analog multimedia content. Copyright abuse is the motivating factor in developing new encryption technologies. One such technology is Digital watermarking. A digital watermark is a signal embedded in digital data {{that can be used}} to establish ownership or to ensure the integrity of the data. The watermark is capable of carrying such information as authentication or <b>authorization</b> <b>codes,</b> or a legend essential for image interpretation. This capability is envisaged to find application in image tagging, copyright enforcement, counterfeit protection, and controlled access. Digital watermarking describes the process of embedding additional information into a digital media, without compromising the media’s value. Digital watermarks should be difficult to remove; resist a variety of signal processing attacks including compression, cropping, printing, transmission, rotation, scaling, etc.; and be difficult to forge. We propose in this paper an algorithm which will embed watermark into a video. We are implementing this project in frequency domain technique of watermarking using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).

40|$|Abstract. A {{fundamental}} {{requirement for}} cooperating agents is {{to agree on}} a selection of component values of objects {{that can be used for}} reliably communicating references to the objects, to function as their keys. In a distributed environment, such as the web, it is more likely that a choice of such values may have time limits on the duration of their ability to serve as keys, e. g., values denoting permissions, <b>authorizations,</b> service <b>codes,</b> mobile addresses and so on. In this paper, we consider how a Boolean complete description logic can be embellished with a concept constructor for dynamic or temporal forms of equality generating constraints we call temporal path functional dependencies. In particular, we introduce the description logic DLFDtemp, demonstrate how it can be used to capture and reason about temporal keys and functional dependencies for a hypothetical distributed hospital database, and prove that the general membership problem for DLFDtemp is EXPTIME-complete. The latter is accomplished by exhibiting a reduction of the general membership problem for DLFDtemp to the simpler dialect DLF. ...|$|R
