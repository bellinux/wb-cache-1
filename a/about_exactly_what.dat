25|$|Despite {{backing from}} Sony, Media Molecule were unsure <b>about</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> {{direction}} {{they were going}} to take the game. They also worried about whether people would understand, or even like the game, but these worries were dispelled after its first presentation. Media Molecule were {{aware of the fact that}} Sony wanted them to demonstrate the game at the upcoming GDC 2007, but they were not told they were to be part of Phil Harrison's keynote speech until near the date it was due to take place. Healey stated that it was only when they arrived in San Francisco for the conference that they realised just how much backing Sony were devoting to the game—much more than Media Molecule had previously thought. Healey relates that although the revelation of Sony's faith in the game boosted their confidence, additionally, it increased the pressure on them with the realisation that their task had become much greater than originally anticipated.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the intense}} weather conditions, Kivilo {{believed}} that the overcast skies created a [...] "gray, somber, stark look." [...] Kivilo also chose not to use any lighting for daytime exterior scenes. For exterior scenes shot during sunnier filming days, computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used to re-create the overcast skies and counter any inconsistencies caused by the falling snow. In depicting the shootout in Lou's home, Kivilo's intent was to [...] "keep things quite sketchy in the lighting and not be clear <b>about</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was happening." [...] The camera department lit a China ball from the ceiling to depict a dimly lit kitchen light that would reveal Nancy holding a shotgun. Flash photography guns were used to depict the muzzle flashes during the shootouts.|$|E

2500|$|Outside of {{the rodeo}} world itself, there is {{disagreement}} <b>about</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> rodeo is.

[...] Fans view rodeo as a spectator sport with animals, having aspects of pageantry and theater unlike other professional sport. [...] Non-westerners view the spectacle as a quaint but exciting remnant of the Wild West while animal activists view rodeo as a cruel Roman circus spectacle, or an Americanized bullfight.|$|E
2500|$|To fund these {{expensive}} new ventures, the Beys of Tunis relied on tax revenues paid on a customary basis. Most {{of the country}} paid the mejba (...) established {{in the seventeenth century}} under the Muradid dynasty. There is much scholarly debate <b>about</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> this constituted and how it was levied, but it appears that before 1856, the term mejba signified a tax paid by a tribe, clan or other social group, based on a collective assessment. The Beys also imposed monopoly taxes on salt, tobacco, tanned hides and other commodities.|$|E

Hancock concluded that [...] "One gets the sense {{from all of this}} of an institution that has lost its way, departed from its purely humanitarian and developmental mandate, become confused about its place in the world – <b>about</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it is doing, and why". Despite the criticism, Edouard Saouma served as DG for three consecutive terms from 1976 to 1993.|$|E
