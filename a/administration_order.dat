25|$|To get Railtrack out of administration, the {{government}} {{had to go back}} to the High Court and present evidence that the company was no longer insolvent. The principal reason given by {{the government}} to the court for this assertion was the decision of the rail regulator – announced on 22 September 2002 – to carry out an interim review of the company's finances, with the potential to advance significant additional sums to the company. The High Court accepted that the company was not therefore insolvent, and the railway <b>administration</b> <b>order</b> was discharged on 2 October 2002.|$|E

The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.

Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.|$|E

2500|$|In {{countries}} that permit {{the making of}} an <b>administration</b> <b>order,</b> the floating charge had another key benefit.

[...] Practice became such that companies were asked to give [...] "lightweight" [...] floating charges to secured lenders which had no collateral value purely to allow the holders to block administration orders, an approach that was approved by the courts in Re Croftbell Ltd [...] BCC 781. [...] In the United Kingdom the law has now been changed by statute, but the power to block appointments of administrators has been retained in many other common law jurisdictions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{circumstances}} in which Railtrack had been put into administration were highly controversial, with allegations in Parliament on 24 October 2005 {{that the company had}} not been insolvent at the time (7 October 2001) and therefore that the <b>administration</b> <b>order</b> had been wrongly obtained. This was because of the jurisdiction of the independent rail regulator – at the time Tom Winsor – to provide additional money to maintain the company's financial position. Sir Alan Duncan MP, then the shadow transport secretary, said in Parliament that this aspect of the affair – which was not dealt with in the shareholders' case in the High Court – was [...] "perhaps the most shameful scar on the Government's honesty" [...] and [...] "an absolute scandal".|$|E
2500|$|The {{duties of}} an {{administrator}} in Schedule B1, paragraph 3 are theoretically {{meant to be}} exercised {{for the benefit of}} the creditors as a whole. However the administrator's duties on paper lie in tension with how, and by whom, an administrator is appointed. The holder of a floating charge, which covers substantially all of a company's property (typically the company's bank), has an almost absolute right to select the administrator. Under Schedule B1, paragraph 14, it may appoint the administrator directly, and can do so out of court. The company need not be technically insolvent, so long as the terms of the floating charge allow appointment. The directors or the company may also appoint an administrator out of court, but must give five days' notice to any floating charge holder, who may at any point intervene and install his own preferred candidate. The court can, in law, refuse the floating charge holder's choice of administrator because of the 'particular circumstances of the case', though this will be rare. Typically banks wish to avoid the spotlight and any effect on their reputation, and so they suggest that company directors appoint the administrator from their own list. Other creditors may also apply to court for an administrator to be appointed, although once again, the floating charge holder may intervene. In this case, the court will grant the petition for appointment of an administrator only if, first, the company [...] "is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts" [...] (identical to IA 1986 section 123) and [...] "the <b>administration</b> <b>order</b> is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration." [...] In Re Harris Simons Construction Ltd Hoffmann J held that 'likely to achieve the purpose of administration' meant a test lower than balance of probabilities, and more like whether there was a 'real prospect' of success or a 'good arguable case' for it. So here the company was granted an <b>administration</b> <b>order,</b> which led to its major creditor granting funding to continue four building contracts.|$|E
