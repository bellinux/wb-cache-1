40|$|We {{study the}} so called {{mechanisms}} with verification introduced by Nisan and Ronen [1999]. We show that these mechanisms can optimize any “reasonable ” cost function {{and that they can}} be resistant to any coalition of colluding agents in the strongest model which allows agents to exchange side payments. These mechanisms are also known as n-truthful. We apply our main result to a number of problems previously studied in the algorithmic mechanism design literature and obtain n-truthful (1 +ε) approximation mechanisms with verification. By contrast, no truthful mechanism <b>without</b> <b>verification</b> can achieve such an approximation ratio. Moreover, every mechanism <b>without</b> <b>verification</b> which is collusion-resistant must have an unbounded approximation factor...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} victim heterogeneity in harm {{levels in}} a bilateral-care model, where harm is private information. In practice, resources are expended on the verification of damages suffered. We establish a sufficient {{condition for the}} possibility to accurately deduce the harm level from the observable care choice <b>without</b> spending on <b>verification.</b> For cases in which this condition does not hold, this paper sets out a simple screening mechanism that induces victims to reveal their type truthfully and induces optimal care in equilibrium <b>without</b> <b>verification</b> costs.

50|$|The largest {{weakness}} of any TOFU-style model {{is that a}} human being must initially validate every interaction, which does not scale infinitely, and can quickly scale beyond the capabilities of any group of people using and managing computers with a need for trusted and secure protocols.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{recognition}} rate of totally unconstrained handwritten numerals, a verification stage is added after classification to distinguish the ambiguous numerals between two or more classes. Two recognition methods, structural method and statistical method, are used to overcome the limitations of a single method and deliver a much more reliable recognition system. The recognition rate is 71. 32 % using structural method <b>without</b> <b>verification.</b> The verification stage improves the recognition rate from 71. 32 % to 87. 50 %.

The Mongol TV news team planted fictitious stories of the McDonald's fast-food chain opening its first franchise operation in Mongolia among the news outlets, which ran the story as news unquestioningly <b>without</b> <b>verification</b> and fact checking.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Within {{the past}} 10 years, cognitive-behavioural pain {{management}} models have moved {{beyond the traditional}} focus on coping strategies and perceived control over pain, to incorporate mindfulness-and acceptance-based approaches. Pain acceptance {{is the process of}} giving up the struggle with pain and learning to live life despite pain. Acceptance is associated with lower levels of pain, disability and psychological distress. Relatively little is known, however, about how patients arrive at a state of <b>acceptance</b> <b>without</b> the aid of therapy...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{demonstration}} that allografts are rejected through immune {{reactions of the}} host, clinical therapies for organ allografts have relied on immune suppression to prevent these destructive events. A growing body of clinical and experimental data suggests that allografts elicit multiple, interactive immune responses. The result is not inevitably graft rejection, and "spontaneous" acceptance of fully allogeneic liver grafts occurs in rodents without immunosuppression. A spectrum of results range from spontaneous <b>acceptance</b> <b>without</b> immunosuppression to rejection with immunosuppression. The "dualistic pathway paradigm" aims to reconcile apparently conflicting observations in liver transplantation and proposes that: (1) immune engagement between the host and the allograft is instrumental in both rejection and acceptance; (2) there exist in all mammalian species congruent interactive pathways of immune activation whereby {{the fate of the}} allograft is determined by the quantitative results of these interactions; (3) the dualistic effect of immunosuppressive drugs on pathways of immune activation, conferring the capacity for favorable or unfavorable graft outcome should be investigated in experimental models in which organ allografts are spontaneously accepted. In conclusion the design of clinical strategies based on this research may contribute to protocols resulting in allograft <b>acceptance</b> <b>without</b> chronic immunosuppression...|$|R
40|$|We {{schedule}} the Steane [[7, 1, 3]] {{error correction}} on a model ion trap architecture with ballistic transport. We compare the level one error rates for syndrome extraction using the Shor method of ancilla prepared in verified cat {{states to the}} DiVincenzo-Aliferis method <b>without</b> <b>verification.</b> The study examines how the quantum error correction circuit latency and error vary {{with the number of}} available ancilla and the choice of protocol for ancilla preparation and measurement. We find that with few exceptions the DiVincenzo-Aliferis method <b>without</b> cat state <b>verification</b> outperforms the standard Shor method. We also find that additional ancilla always reduces the latency but does not significantly change the error due to the high memory fidelity. Comment: 15 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
50|$|While the Committee (with one dissension) did {{not support}} {{complete}} decriminalisation, it suggested thorough revision of the criminal law, with tougher penalties for street prostitution because of the harm of disturbance and nuisance. It suggested a new offence of interfering or attempting to interfere, {{on more than one}} occasion, with pedestrian or vehicular traffic for the purposes of offering to engage in prostitution or of employing the services of a prostitute but not the mere offer or <b>acceptance</b> <b>without</b> disturbance.|$|R
30|$|The {{acceptance}} of misinformation or misleading information {{by the people}} depends on their prior beliefs and opinions [5]. People believe things which support their prior thoughts without questioning them. The same is also supported by research in cognitive psychology [6]. The authors have brought out that preexisting political, religious or social views make people accept information <b>without</b> <b>verification</b> if it conforms to their beliefs. Countering such ideological and personal beliefs is indeed very difficult. Another important finding was that countering the misinformation may lead to amplifying the beliefs and reenforcing them.|$|R
50|$|For example, if an 8.0 {{earthquake}} {{occurs in}} the Aleutian Islands, West Coast states such as Washington, Oregon, and California would receive a tsunami watch first; if the tsunami is verified, a warning would follow. If no wave is observed, a cancellation message would follow the watch instead. If an 8.0 earthquake were to occur off of the West Coast of the United States, a warning <b>without</b> <b>verification</b> of a tsunami would be issued, as {{there would not be}} enough time to first verify a wave and then conduct an evacuation of vulnerable areas.|$|R
50|$|In 1955, {{approximately}} 150 coloured triangular or rectangular stamp forgeries by New York and Munich stamp dealer Henry Stolow (1901 - 1971) {{appeared on}} the market without a date of issue. These stamp issues were printed in the Österreichische Staatsdruckerei <b>without</b> <b>verification</b> of their legality. These issues do not bear any hint of their date of issue, as German stamps do, for example. Therefore, it is completely futile to assign them to specific years of issue, as is sometimes done. They were never used for postage, so there are only mint copies.|$|R
