5|$|The rest day was {{followed}} by the fourth day, which was abandoned due to persistent rain. Despite this, 21,000 spectators came in anticipation of the weather clearing so that some play would be possible. However, a northeasterly depression from the Faroe Islands brought ongoing precipitation <b>and</b> <b>prevented</b> any play.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} King Poniatowski decided {{to sue for}} peace, the Polish army was still in good {{fighting}} condition, not suffering from any major defeat nor from lack of supplies. King Poniatowski thought that due to Russian numerical superiority defeat was nonetheless imminent, and more could be gained through negotiations with the Russians, with whom he hoped a new alliance could be formed. Although subsequent events would prove him wrong, {{the question of whether}} this could have been foreseen, <b>and</b> <b>prevented</b> through continued military resistance, has been subject to much debate among historians.|$|E
5|$|Boston {{lacked a}} regular supply of fresh meat, and many horses needed hay. On May 21, Gage ordered {{a party to}} go to Grape Island, in the outer harbor, and bring hay to Boston. When the Continentals on the {{mainland}} noticed this, they took alarm, and the militia were called out. As the British party arrived, they came under fire from the militia. The militia set fire to a barn on the island, destroying 80 tons of hay, <b>and</b> <b>prevented</b> the British from taking more than 3 tons.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{became a}} {{province}} of the Roman Empire in 30BC, following the defeat of Marc Antony and Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the Battle of Actium. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the Roman army, {{under the control of}} a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, <b>and</b> <b>prevented</b> attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period. Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.|$|E

5|$|For many years, Germany {{simply had}} no battleships. The Armistice with Germany {{required}} {{that most of}} the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in Scapa Flow, Scotland. The Treaty of Versailles specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were scuttled by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, <b>and</b> <b>prevented</b> Germany from building or possessing any capital ships.|$|E

She did not see action during World War I, and was reduced to a gunnery training ship {{after the end of the}} war. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1929.|$|E

Nevertheless, the U.S. succeeded in turning back {{attempts by the}} Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports <b>and</b> <b>prevented</b> {{the majority of the}} Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. Thus, the battle turned back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi, resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in their favor.|$|E
