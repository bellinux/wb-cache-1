5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} five games, the absence of Adrian Peterson did not keep the Sooners from running {{the ball on the}} ground. Allen Patrick returned from missing the last two games with a sore <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> put up 163yards on 23carries, including a 65-yard touchdown scamper to start the second half.

5|$|The Bearcats {{opened the}} 2008 college {{football}} season against , winning 40–7 in an offensive effort led by senior quarterback Dustin Grutza, {{who was named}} the team's starter at that position following Mauk's dismissal.

In a 52–26 loss to a team that would play for the national championship that season, Grutza broke his <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> was replaced by junior Tony Pike.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{signed for}} Hertfordshire side Stevenage in August 2007, and {{featured}} regularly {{for the club}} for two seasons, playing in the club's successful FA Trophy campaign in May 2009. However, he suffered a dislocated <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> broken leg in three places in August 2009, ruling him out for eight months, but returned to first-team action in April 2010 as Stevenage won promotion to the Football League {{for the first time}} in the club's history. He then played a key part during the club's 2010–11 campaign, helping Stevenage earn promotion to League One.|$|E

5|$|Ferguson had a {{defensive}} selection dilemma {{ahead of the}} final, with both of his starting full-backs, Gabriel Heinze (<b>ankle)</b> <b>and</b> Gary Neville (groin), having suffered injuries. Neville eventually recovered {{enough to make the}} substitutes' bench, despite only playing in one of the team's last five games, but Heinze missed the game entirely, Mikaël Silvestre taking his place at left-back. Neville's absence meant that John O'Shea started at right-back. Neville was joined on the bench by winger Ryan Giggs and goalkeeper Tim Howard; Giggs' omission was a surprise, and it meant that Darren Fletcher started on the right wing, while Ronaldo played on the left. Howard, on the other hand, had been competing for the number 1 jersey with Roy Carroll all season, and it was ultimately the Northern Irishman who was picked.|$|E
5|$|Following their triumphant Earls Court appearances, Led Zeppelin took {{a holiday}} and planned an autumn tour in America, {{scheduled}} to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco. In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife Maureen {{were involved in a}} serious car crash while on holiday in Rhodes, Greece. Plant suffered a broken <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> Maureen was badly injured; a blood transfusion saved her life. Unable to tour, he headed to the Channel Island of Jersey to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu, California. During this forced hiatus much of the material for their next album, Presence, was written.|$|E
5|$|In early 1989, Schottenheimer {{was fired}} as Browns head coach, {{and took the}} head {{coaching}} job with the Kansas City Chiefs. He still had faith in Junkin, unlike the Browns, and traded a fifth-round pick {{to bring him to}} Kansas City. Two weeks after the trade, a report came out that Junkin had taken steroids provided by a doctor to treat an injured <b>ankle,</b> <b>and</b> had failed a drug test at the scouting combine as a result. Entering the 1989 Kansas City Chiefs season, Junkin competed with Walker Lee Ashley for the second inside linebacker spot alongside Dino Hackett. Ashley won the job, and Junkin played five games before a shoulder injury sidelined him {{for the rest of the}} season. He was released from the Chiefs after season's end, and retired after not being signed by any team through the 1990 season.|$|E

5|$|In his 1988 book Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, the {{freelance}} dinosaurologist Gregory Paul {{proposed that}} A. fragilis had tall pointed horns and a slender build {{compared to a}} postulated second species A. atrox, and was not a different gender due to rarity. Allosaurus atrox was originally named by Marsh in 1878 as the type species of its own genus, Creosaurus, {{and is based on}} YPM 1890, an assortment of bones including a couple of pieces of the skull, portions of nine tail vertebrae, two hip vertebrae, an illium, and <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> foot bones. Although the idea of two common Morrison allosaur species was followed in some semi-technical and popular works, the 2000 thesis on Allosauridae noted that Charles Gilmore mistakenly reconstructed USNM 4734 as having a shorter skull than the specimens referred by Paul to atrox, refuting supposed differences between USNM 4734 and putative A. atrox specimens like DINO 2560, AMNH 600, and AMNH 666.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City {{spent the}} week {{preceding}} the final at a {{training camp in}} Eastbourne. Two days before the final Bert Trautmann, who had originally arrived in England as a prisoner of war, was named Footballer of the Year. Eight players who had played in the previous year's final were selected in the starting line-up. Press speculation {{in the run-up to}} the match pondered which of Don Revie and Bobby Johnstone would be selected, as Johnstone had been suffering from a calf problem. Bill Leivers was also an injury doubt due to a twisted <b>ankle,</b> <b>and</b> Billy Spurdle had a boil on his left arm lanced on the eve of the final. Consequently, the Manchester City line-up was not named until the morning of the match. Leivers was passed fit after having two pain-killing injections, but contrary to press expectations Spurdle missed out. This meant both Revie and Johnstone appeared in the line-up, Johnstone switching to outside right.|$|E
5|$|On December 26, 2011, Barea {{made his}} debut for the Timberwolves, {{recording}} 14 points, 2 assists and 2 rebounds in a 100–104 {{loss to the}} Oklahoma City Thunder. However, Barea's season was hampered with <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> thigh injuries as he managed just 41 of 66 games for the Timberwolves in 2011–12. Despite this, on March 23, 2012, Barea scored his first career triple-double, recording 25 points, 10 rebounds and 14 assists in a 149–140 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. During the last weeks of the season, and with injuries to starters Ricky Rubio, Kevin Love and Luke Ridnour, Barea became the starting point guard, averaging 15.8 points and 9.4 assists during the last 9 games. During that period, Barea recorded a season-high 28 points and a career-high 15 assists.|$|E

She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the male {{part of the}} icon. The torso, hip and pelvis of the female is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves. Though the male private parts may be depicted, the female genitalia are never depicted and the loins are always draped. She wears a multi-coloured or white silken garment down to her <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> one or three girdles around her waist. The left half wears an anklet and her foot is painted red with henna. The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight, resting on a lotus pedestal. In contrast to the Shiva half, the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle, parrot-green or dark in colour. She may be draped in a sari covering her torso and legs.|$|E
5|$|Persistently {{hampered}} by <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> back injuries, Meckiff aggregated only 19 first-class wickets at 40 for the summer. His best innings performance was 4/39 against Queensland {{and he was}} unable to claim more than five wickets in any single match. In one match against arch-rivals New South Wales, the Victorian took a total of 5/155, all of his wickets being Test batsmen. Meckiff was not selected for the Ashes tour. His lack of form saved the Australian selectors the difficult choice of whether to omit him because of his action and avoid a potential run-in with umpires in England. Critics claimed that his new bowling action adopted in 1959–60 had made him legitimate but reduced his pace and effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Quinn {{signed with}} the Pittsburgh Steelers as an undrafted free agent {{following}} the 1997 NFL Draft. Quinn entered training camp behind Kordell Stewart, Mike Tomczak and Jim Miller on the depth chart, but after training camp Quinn had beaten out Miller and became the team's third-string quarterback. He saw his only game action on November 9 against the Baltimore Ravens, throwing for 10yards on one completion. Following the 1997 season, the Steelers allocated Quinn to play in NFL Europe, he later agreed {{to play for the}} Rhein Fire. In his second game with the Fire on April 12, Quinn completed 13 of 21 passes for 194yards. He also completed two touchdown passes. With Quinn as the starting quarterback, the Fire played in the World Bowl. However, Quinn was hampered by a sprained <b>ankle</b> <b>and</b> could not play in the game. He returned to the Steelers after the NFL Europe season but was waived on August 31.|$|E
