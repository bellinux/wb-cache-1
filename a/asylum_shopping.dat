50|$|In {{the jargon}} of European institutions, <b>asylum</b> <b>shopping</b> is the {{practice}} of refugees wanting to choose a country other than that prescribed by the regulations to apply for political asylum, to choose the one which will offer the best reception conditions, or to lodge an application in another country after being dismissed. This expression is used to treat certain asylum seekers in analogy with consumers of welfare provisions). Such definition appears in official documents, newspaper articles, analysis, etc. <b>Asylum</b> <b>shopping</b> is practised by 12% of asylum seekers, according to former European Commissioner for Justice Franco Frattini.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Asylum</b> <b>shopping</b> is the {{practice}} by asylum seekers of applying for asylum {{in several states}} or seeking to apply in a particular state after transiting other states. The phrase is used mostly {{in the context of}} the European Union and the Schengen Area, but has been used by the Federal Court of Canada.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{objectives}} of Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters is to prevent <b>asylum</b> <b>shopping.</b> The Dublin Convention stipulates that asylum seekers are returned to this country where their entry into the union was first recorded and where they were first fingerprinted. Another objective of this policy is to prevent asylum seekers in orbit, i.e. to prevent that asylum seekers are transferred between countries {{and none of them}} is willing to accept their applications.|$|E

5000|$|The law {{provides}} for the granting of asylum or refugee status {{in accordance with the}} 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 protocol, and the government has established a system for providing protection to refugees. In practice the government provided protection against refoulement, the return of persons to a country where they feared persecution. The government granted refugee status or asylum and subscribed to a [...] "safe country of transit" [...] policy, which required asylum seekers who transited a country determined to be [...] "safe" [...] to return to that country to seek refugee status. With the expansion of the European Union (EU) this concept has lost some of its importance because upon their accession, neighboring Slovenia, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and Hungary became subject to the EU provisions that establish criteria and mechanisms for determining the EU member state responsible for examining an asylum application. In 2005 new legislation introduced stricter detention and removal policies as part of a stronger enforcement of the 2003 Dublin II regulation (also referred to as the Dublin Convention) which discourages <b>asylum</b> <b>shopping</b> by allowing serial asylum-seekers to be returned to the EU country where they first applied for asylum. EURODAC, the EU's system for comparing fingerprints of asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants, has facilitated the application of the Dublin Convention. As a result, asylum applications dropped by more than 30 percent during the year with a noticeable trend in applicants attempting to conceal their routes of transit.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{proposes to}} use {{regulatory}} competition theory {{in order to}} better understand the evolution of the EU member States' asylum legislation. It argues that regulatory competition theory can explain the rapid trend of legislative amendments from the mid- 80 's onwards, the progressive yet incomplete convergence of the EU member States' legislation, and the spiral of restrictions of legal norms originally enacted to protect asylum seekers. Competition among legal norms also explains EU Member States' reticence to collaborate and share the burden. The first argument of the paper is that a phenomenon of competition developed because Member States were convinced that generous asylum policies would be a pull factor for asylum seekers. They feared that regulatory arbitrage (i. e. <b>asylum</b> <b>shopping)</b> would lead asylum seekers to select their destination State {{on the basis of the}} level of protection offered. States have entered into a process of de-regulation and, because of their interdependence, national measures have become instruments of a general race to externalise. The result has turned out to be negative and corresponds to a 'race-to-the-bottom'. This negative result can be observed at two levels : competition was detrimental to both asylum seekers and States; the rules enacted were suboptimal. The paper then explains why the first cooperation instruments introduced at the end of the 80 's and onwards have failed to meet their objective. The effects of cooperation schemes like the Dublin Convention or burden sharing projects are negligible and there was no shift from costly and unilateral aylum policies towards fairer and more efficient collective action. It is an example of cooperation in the shadow of competition. Finally the paper evaluates the communautarisation of the competence to act in the field of asylum. It is unlikely to permit the emergence of a federal and centralised regulation able to change the nature of the game. In conclusion, the paper seeks to assess if a good combination of cooperation and competition is likely to produce 'good' asylum policy in Europe and investigates the 'co-opetition' model promoted by Esty and Gerardin. enlargement; European identity; identity...|$|E
