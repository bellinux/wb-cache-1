2500|$|The {{increasing}} politicisation of {{land reform}} {{was accompanied by}} the deterioration of diplomatic relations between Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom. Public opinion on the Zimbabwean land reform process among British citizens was decidedly mediocre; it was perceived as a poor investment {{on the part of}} the UK's government in an ineffectual and shoddily implemented programme. In June of 1996, Lynda Chalker, British secretary of state for international development, declared that she could not endorse the new compulsory <b>acquisition</b> <b>policy</b> and urged Mugabe to return to the principles of [...] "willing buyer, willing seller".|$|E
2500|$|In 1984 James {{completed}} the largest commission {{that he had}} produced up to that point. [...] Air Structure, created for IBM in Marietta, Georgia, measured 5 feet high by 15 feet wide.

[...] That means not only technical excellence, but also distinctive style.”—Dietz announced that the museum had commissioned a piece from James for their permanent collection. [...] The result {{was the first in}} the Rhythm/Color series, Rhythm/Color: Spanish Dance. [...] It was also the first quilt in which James began to deliberately blur the edges of the block structure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distribution}} maps available above {{show that}} the abbey's assets were heavily concentrated, tending to form natural groups, in Shropshire. This was a major advantage that Haughmond had over nearby Lilleshall, which always suffered from the running costs associated with a widely dispersed property portfolio. The <b>acquisition</b> <b>policy</b> of the abbey tended to strengthen this advantage, deliberately buying or requesting grants of adjoining estates to increase local concentrations of land. Beyond Leebotswood, for example, the abbey built up a large composite of holdings. A grant by Henry II of meadow on the Long Mynd {{marked the beginning of}} the venture. More benefactors contributed, especially the powerful Robert Corbet of Caus Castle, and a substantial monastic estate took shape, known as [...] the “domain of Boveria”, from the Latin bos/bovis, an ox, and meaning roughly [...] "cattle shed". [...] This land along the Wales–England border, was mostly waste when the canons arrived but quickly became excellent pasture, as the new name suggests. It fell in the Diocese of Hereford and it was Bishop Robert Foliot who gave the canons permission to turn their oratory at Stitt, in Ratlinghope manor, into church for the region. After it acquired Aston Abbots, in the early 13th century, the community built up another large group of holdings east of Oswestry at Hisland, Twyford and West Felton, and Great Ness. Wherever estates adjoined uncultivated areas, the community took to vigorous assarting. This had been specifically allowed by Henry II in some of his grants. To make administration easier, the estates were divided into 12 local bailiwicks. These were generally under lay management, but obedientiaries, canons with specific responsibilities for rent and tithe collection, were deputed by the abbots to keep in touch.|$|E

50|$|In March 1996 Perry {{approved}} a new DoD comprehensive <b>acquisition</b> <b>policy</b> that emphasized commercial practices and products. Program managers and other acquisition officials {{would have the}} power to use their professional judgment in purchasing. The plan canceled more than 30 separate <b>acquisition</b> <b>policy</b> memoranda and report formats and replaced existing policy documents with new ones that were about 90% shorter. Perry considered these reforms one of his most important accomplishments, and saw savings generated by the new practices as part of the key to adequate funding of the military in an era of continuing tight budgets. In a further effort to save money Perry resorted to base closures and realignments. In May 1994 he and General John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced that Defense would go forward, as required by law, with a 1995 round of base closings. In doing so Defense would consider the economic impact on the affected communities and the capacity to manage the reuse of closed facilities.|$|E
