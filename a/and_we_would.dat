25|$|Note {{that using}} a {{hierarchical}} system like this (assuming {{it is done}} carefully) changes the intersection computational time from a linear dependence {{on the number of}} objects to something between linear and a logarithmic dependence. This is because, for a perfect case, each intersection test would divide the possibilities by two, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have a binary tree type structure.

I was in awe of all these great songs he’d written, and he would play them on the {{acoustic}} guitar really hard, Johnny Ramone style, all six strings. He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word that he spoke. His songs were just filled with that envy {{of people that are}} better looking, that are more successful.

25|$|My {{mother always}} told me {{that no matter how}} much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E
25|$|For one thing, {{we would}} no longer allow breeding. People could not create {{different}} breeds. There would be no pet shops. If people had companion animals in their homes, those animals {{would have to be}} refugees from the animal shelters and the streets. You would have a protective relationship with them just as you would with an orphaned child. But as the surplus of cats and dogs (artificially engineered by centuries of forced breeding) declined, eventually companion animals would be phased out, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> return to a more symbiotic relationship—enjoyment at a distance.|$|E

25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind {{that we were not}} only making music, we were making history.

I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated.

From a description provided by our source, I had easily identified the building in question, which was located in Baghdad's downtown Aadamiyah section. The ten crates of missile parts were stashed in a basement of the Baghdad headquarters of Saddam's own Ba'ath party. If we could achieve surprise and surround the site before the Iraqis could evacuate the crates, we would obtain the ultimate catch-22 situation: let us inside as promised <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> find the prohibited material; bar our entry and violate the Kofi Annan compromise, {{and in the process}} invite a devastating air strike by the United States. UNSCOM would be prepared to camp out around this site until the situation had been resolved one way or the other.|$|E

During its course Morrison worked on leftover material from his previous two albums (Astral Weeks and Moondance), recorded songs that he had not performed in the studio before ("Crazy Face" [...] and [...] "Give Me a Kiss"), as well as two instrumentals. Limited recording equipment was used, operated by drummer Dahaud Shaar, who was intending to open a recording studio in Woodstock at the time. Shaar remembered: [...] "I found an old church <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> just load in. I'd set up a pair of mikes <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> just run down some tracks with the tapes running. They became like a working thing for the album." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1947 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team went 10–0 and outscored their opponents 394 to 53. Dworsky led a defensive unit that gave up {{an average of}} 5.3points per game and shut out Michigan State (550), Pitt (600), Indiana (350), Ohio State (210), and USC (490). He also played fullback and center for the 1947 team and was named a third team All-American by the American Football Coaches Association. In a 1988 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Dworsky described the 1947 team's defensive scheme as follows: [...] "We were an intelligent team and we had some complex defenses, the nature of which you see today. I called the defensive signals <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> shift people, looping, or stunting." ...|$|E

What fun she was." [...] Novelist Hervey Allen called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir, [...] "the Stewart Avenue Gang". The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but those moments were followed by serious talk {{of the future of}} libraries, and {{the role of women in}} South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another. Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no air conditioning, electric stove, or dishwasher.|$|E

[...] He {{led them to the}} playoffs again in 1939–40, but the loss of players due to World War II took its toll on the franchise. [...] After finishing in last place the season before, the league announced that the Americans had suspended operations for the 1942–43 NHL season though Dutton {{continued to}} represent the team on the Board of Governors. Dutton believed that if the Americans could have held on through the war, his team would become more popular than the Rangers.

We're having discussions and there is some enthusiasm but I can't tell if it's just me". Comedy Central commissioned an additional 26 new episodes, and began airing them in 2010.

500|$|Screenwriter Dan Gerson joined Pixar in 1999 {{and worked}} on the film with the filmmakers {{on a daily basis}} for almost two years.

I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We'd get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here's where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further." ...|$|E

In December 2007, the group was awarded £50,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund to carry out a survey for the future for the site. Once restored, the castle could be opened.
