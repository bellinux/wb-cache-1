40|$|There {{have been}} many {{investigations}} on methods of water injection and their effects on engine performance. Water injection, also known as Anti-Detonant Injection (ADI), is a method of cooling the combustion chamber of an internal combustion (IC) engine by adding water to the incoming air-fuel mixture. Water is far more effective compared to gasoline {{when it comes to}} absorbing heat energy with a latent heat of vaporization about 6 times that of gasoline. By absorbing more heat energy, the in-cylinder temperatures are reduced thus helping to supress detonation. With a cooler and denser air charge, the Engine Control Unit (ECU) can <b>advance</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> timing and take advantage of the increased power. This study experimentally investigated the effect of water injection on the torque output, air intake temperature and exhaust gas temperatures in a naturally aspirated, spark ignition (SI) engine where water was injected at the intake port just before throttle body. Furthermore, this study also investigated the effect of water injection on detonation. A suitable water injection kit from Snow Performance was chosen to conduct the experiments. The experiments were conducted to test water to fuel mass flow rate ratios of 0 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % at constant engine speed set at 3000 rpm and at Wide Open Throttle (WOT). The results showed that with increasing mass ratios of water to fuel injected into the engine, the intake air temperature and exhaust gas temperature decreases. Water injection at 20 % mass ratio of water to fuel resulted in the lowest intake air temperature and lowest exhaust gas temperature. The engine torque on the other hand was observed to decrease with increasing water injection flow rate. However due to the lower intake temperature, advancing the ignition timing is permitted. It was found that with water injection, the knock is suppressed and detonation occurs at later spark ignition timing. It was concluded that water injection at 15 % mass ratio of water to fuel was the optimal injection amount for the Ford Barra engine operating at the speed of 3000 rpm with WOT. At this ratio of water injection, the power output was the highest with the ignition timing at 27 °bTDC (where knock occurs) and also produces low exhaust gas temperature and low intake air temperature compare to the engine‟s original performance characteristics...|$|E

This study experimentally investigates the effect of water injection on torque output, air intake temperature and exhaust gas temperature, in a naturally aspirated spark ignition engine, where water was injected at intake just before the throttle body and 98 -Octane is used as fuel throughout the cycle. Further, this study investigates the effect of water injection as a knock resistance and reducing the emissions.

In addition, this research gives a valid comparison between a previous study using 91 -Octane as its base fuel. It concludes 98 -Octane has better combustibility and less brake specific fuel consumption compared to lower octane fuels.

40|$|Particulate Matter (PM) {{legislation}} for gasoline engines {{and the introduction}} of gasoline/ethanol blends, make it important to know the effect of fuel composition on PM emissions. Tests have been conducted with fuels of known composition in both a single cylinder engine and V 8 engine with a three-way catalyst. The V 8 engine used an unleaded gasoline (PURA) with known composition and distillation characteristics as a base fuel and with 10 % by volume ethanol. The single cylinder engine used a 65 % iso-octane - 35 % toluene mixture as its base fuel. The engines had essentially the same combustion system, with a centrally mounted 6 -hole spray-guided direct injection system. Particle size distributions were recorded and these have also been converted to mass distributions. Filter samples were taken for thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) to give composition information. Both engines were operated at 1500 rpm under part load. The tests with the single cylinder engine used lambda of 0. 9, 1. 0 and 1. 1 with an ignition timing sweep of 15 - 45 °bTDC. The trends with the stoichiometric and weak mixtures were less clear (the PM emissions being at low levels), but with lambda of 0. 9 the trends were clear.

A dissimilar valve lift profile was used to generate the swirl followed with engine testing concluding the performance, efficiency and emissions as the engine operates {{as a function of the}} air flow and fuel. Firstly, a flow bench was used to analyse swirl generated by dissimilar valve lift (DVL) profiles on the intake valve to find the conditions with the best swirl conditions.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{unconfined}} dust explosions consist of a relatively weak primary (turbulent) deflagrations followed by a devastating secondary explosion. The secondary explosion may propagate with a speed of up to 1000 m/s producing overpressures of over 8 - 10 atm. Since detonation is the only established theory that allows a rapid burning producing a high pressure that can be sustained in open areas, the generally accepted view was that the mechanism explaining {{the high rate of}} combustion in dust explosions is deflagration to detonation transition. In the present work we propose a theoretical substantiation of the alternative propagation mechanism explaining origin of the secondary explosion producing the high speeds of combustion and high overpressures in unconfined dust explosions. We show that clustering of dust particles in a turbulent flow gives rise to a significant increase of the thermal radiation absorption length ahead of <b>the</b> <b>advancing</b> flame front.

The Becker introduced <b>the</b> <b>advanced</b> primer <b>ignition</b> blowback (API) design for autocannons, {{a concept that}} was quickly taken up by other companies. Notable among these was the Swiss Oerlikon FF S, which introduced a number of improvements. In the 1930s, Hispano-Suiza was asked to develop a 20 mm cannon able to fire through the propeller shaft of a gear-reduction inline aviation engine like the Hispano-Suiza 8BeC. They took out a license on the Oerlikon FF S and made minor modifications to produce the Hispano-Suiza Automatic Cannon Type HS.7 and HS.9. Shortly after production began, the Hispano-Suiza and Oerlikon companies disagreed over patent rights and their business connection came to an end.|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{cetane number}} on {{ignition}} delay and ignition location of disesel spray was experimentally investigated. Five kinds of fuels, which had different cetane numbers of light fraction and heavy fraction of fuel, were used. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> delay {{was not so}} affected by the change of cetane number, however, <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> location was strongly affected by a cetane number. When the light fraction cetane number was low, <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> was not observed near the nozzle. And when the heavy fraction cetane number was high, <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> was observed at the position far from <b>the</b> nozzle. <b>Ignition</b> position {{had an effect on}} flame development. When <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> occurred near <b>the</b> nozzle, flame development rate was slow. When <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> occurred at <b>the</b> position far from the nozzle, flame development rate was fast. In case of <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> position was far from the nozzle, effect of the cetane number on flame development was remarkable...|$|R
