40|$|Analysts {{must deal}} {{frequently}} with missing data in multivariate analysis. In such cases, estimating the covariance maxtrix V {{of the dependent}} variables usually involves initial estimation and iterative adjustment of imputed missing data values, and/or smoothing of an estimate I 7 " which is not necessarily positive semi-definite. This paper presents an alternative procedure for com-puting estimates of relevant multivariate parameters in situations where missing data occur at random and with small probability. MISCAT is a computer program which computes multivariate ratio estimates of the means and a corresponding positive semi-definite stimate of the covariance matrix. It {{is an extension of}} GENCAT, which is a program for the generalized least squares analysis of categorical data. Thus, one advantage of dealing with missing data in this manner is that variation among the ratio estimates may be conveniently analyzed within MISCAT using <b>asymptotic</b> <b>regression</b> methodology, provided that sample sizes are sufficiently large.

The program can generate functions of the adjusted survival rates, to which <b>asymptotic</b> <b>regression</b> models may be fit.

A general model for such data is formulated and two methods for the estimation of its parameters are developed. Under the assumptions of normality, one of these methods is shown to yield maximum likelihood estimates which are known to have desirable large sample properties, and the other method, which is computationally simpler, is shown to have the same desirable large sampie properties.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{basis of}} tumoral {{growth has been}} controversial. Many models have been proposed to explain cancer development. The descriptions employ exponential, potential, logistic or Gompertzian growth laws. Some of these models {{are concerned with the}} interaction between cancer and the immunological, system. Among other properties, these models are concerned with the microscopic behavior of tumors and the emergence of cancer. We propose a modification of a previous model by Stepanova, which describes the specific immunological response against cancer. The modification consists of the substitution of a Gompertian law for the exponential rate used for tumoral growth. This modification is motivated by the numerous works confirming that Gompertz's equation correctly describes solid tumor growth. The modified model predicts that near zero, tumors always tend to grow. Immunological contraposition never suffices to induce a complete regression of the tumor. Instead, a stable microscopic equilibrium between cancer and immunological activity can be attained. In other words, our model predicts that the theory of immune surveillance is plausible. A macroscopic equilibrium in which the system develops cancer is also possible. In this case, immunological activity is depleted. This is consistent with the phenomena of cancer tolerance. Both equilibrium points can coexist or can exist without the other. In all cases the fixed point at zero tumor size is unstable. Since immunity cannot induce a complete tumor regression, a therapy is required. We include constant-dose therapies and show that they are insufficient. Final levels of immunocompetent cells and tumoral cells are finite, thus post-treatment regrowth of the tumor is certain. We also evaluate late-intensification therapies which are successful. They induce an <b>asymptotic</b> <b>regression</b> to zero tumor size. Immune response is also suppressed by the therapy, and thus plays a negligible role in the remission. We conclude that treatment evaluation should be successful without taking into account immunological effects. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the last}} 100 years, {{commercial}} chickens have {{been split into}} two main groups. Broiler chickens are produced for meat production while layers are produced for egg production. This has caused large phenotypic changes and the genomic signatures of selection may be detectable using statistical techniques. Genomic regions identified by these techniques may include genes associated with production traits, and is therefore of interest to animal breeders. This thesis investigates signatures of selection {{in a number of}} commercial chicken lines using several statistical techniques based on population differentiation and levels of genetic diversity. First, signatures of selection were investigated using population differentiation in nine lines of broiler chickens. Weir and Cockerham's pairwise FST was calculated for genome-wide markers between the broiler lines and averaged into overlapping sliding windows to remove stochastic effects. A chromosome bound, circular permutation method was used to generate a null distribution and determine the significance of each window. A total of 51 putative selection signatures were found shared between lines and 87 putative selection signatures were found to be unique to one line. The majority of these regions contain peak positions for broiler QTL found in previous studies and eight regions were significantly enriched for broiler QTL. One region located on chromosome 27 contained 39 broiler QTL and 114 genes, several of which were functional candidates for association with broiler traits. Secondly, areas of low diversity were investigated in three different SNP datasets. All three datasets were taken from the same broiler line at different time points and consisted of different SNP densities, including 12 k, 42 k and 600 k. A number of zero diversity regions were found in each dataset and several were shared between the datasets. The 600 k dataset was also analysed using a regression test, which investigates the patterns of diversity as the distance from the selected site increases. This method searches for signatures of selections by fitting a regression to the diversity data to test the fit of the data to the theoretical model. A total of 15 regions were found displaying significant <b>asymptotic</b> <b>regression</b> and diversity values less than 0. 005. One of these regions located on chromosome 1 was also found as a fixed region in the 12 k and 42 k datasets and contained the gene IGF 1, which encodes an important protein for growth. Finally, signatures of selection were investigated between broiler and layer datasets by investigating population differentiation and diversity based analysis. Weir and Cockerham's pairwise FST was calculated between the two lines and outliers extracted. A total of 32 regions were found displaying high differentiation. Seven regions of low diversity in the layer dataset were also investigated. Several broiler and layer QTL had been previously identified in these regions. Two genes related to hedgehog proteins were identified within selected regions, which are known to be involved in embryogenesis. Finally seven regions were found to be highly differentiated between the broiler and layer lines, and the nine broiler lines in the first chapter. This may indicate selection which occurred during breed separation. Signatures of selection were identified in four broiler and layer datasets using several statistical techniques. A number of regions were identified in multiple datasets by a number of techniques and are therefore good candidate regions for selection. Other statistical techniques could be used in future studies to further confirm these regions and identify causative genes and variants...|$|E
40|$|The chief {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the population dynamics of the hyrax in the Mountain Zebra National Park (MZNP). To realise this objective information on growth, age determination, reproduction, habitat utilization, behaviour, parasites and mortality had to be gathered. The growth of hyrax in relation to age is described by means of Stevens <b>asymptotic</b> <b>regression</b> equations. Near asymptotic measurements are attained first in hind foot length (at 30 - 33 months of age), head/body length (at 37 - 39 months of age), girth (at 41 - 48 months of age) and body mass (at 68 - 70 months of age). Allometric growth of the various body measurements was investigated and useful predictive relationships for mass are presented. Age determination of hyrax was studied in detail. Cementum annuli counts provided reliable estimates of age. One primary cementum line is formed annually. The dried eye lens mass was an accurate means of age determination up to c. 72 months of age. A summary of findings which will facilitate age determination of dead animals or skulls, and live animals, is provided. Reproduction in the hyrax was studied with emphasis on breeding season, age-specific litter sizes, prenatal mortality and lactation. Male hyrax attained puberty at 15 - 17 months of age or one year later. Females generally attained puberty at 15 - 17 months of age. One female (1, 4 % of total shot sample for the specific age group) attained puberty at 4 - 5 months of age. Middle-aged hyrax had significantly larger litter sizes than younger animals. Hyrax in the MZNP feed on at least 80 different plant species belonging to 33 plant families. Crude protein of stomach contents and faecal samples showed little seasonal fluctuation implying that hyrax in the MZNP were on a stable quality diet. Female hyrax enjoyed a significantly better quality diet than males for the four month period prior to parturition and during the first two months of lactation. The crude protein values of faecal and stomach samples had a significant correlation. Body fat of male and female hyrax showed seasonal variation related to physiologically stressful periods. Seasonal differences in activity patterns were demonstrated. The basic structure of hyrax social organization is the multi-female kinship group that is matrilocal. Territorial dominant males maintain harems and exclude all other adult males. Peripheral males occupy areas on the periphery of the activity areas of other members of the hyrax colony. Peripheral males do not form bachelor groups and are normally younger than territorial males. It is suggested that territorial males are able to monopolize between 3 - 17 females in a successful and energetic manner. Both natal and breeding dispersal occurred, the former being considerably more extensive than the latter. The ecto- and endoparasites of hyrax were identified and their burdens quantified over a 13 month period. Juveniles had significantly larger burdens of ectoparasites than did adults. Information on age-specific mortality was obtained from skulls collected in the field and at black eagles' nests. Losses that occurred in the study population due to caracal and black eagle predation were quantified. Evidence is supplied which indicates that juvenile mortality may fluctuate markedly. The population dynamics of the hyrax population in the MZNP was studied by the use of time specific life-tables, models on population growth rates, population simulation models and sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity coefficients were used as a predictor of population regulation. Female juvenile mortality was considered to be the main regulating factor. Changes in fecundity schedule are important compensatory mechanisms and also play an important role in the regulation of a hyrax population. Predation, particularly by caracal, is thought to dampen population fluctuations. ...|$|E
