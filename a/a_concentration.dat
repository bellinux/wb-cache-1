Although different macrophyte species were sampled in the two lakes, a common pattern was observed for the <b>As</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the plants.

Strong positive Pearson correlations (rp = 0. 95) indicated stability of water <b>As</b> <b>concentrations</b> over the time period investigated (up to 31 months).
