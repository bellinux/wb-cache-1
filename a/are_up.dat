In both events, a 'training' round takes place on the opening day, as well as a 'trial' round before each competition; these non-scoring rounds are essentially practice or warm-up sessions, and athlete participation is optional.|$|E

5|$|Bacteriophages are {{a common}} and diverse group of viruses and are the most {{abundant}} form of biological entity in aquatic environments– there <b>are</b> <b>up</b> to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria, reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater. These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell. Within {{a short amount of}} time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, {{in the case of the}} T4 phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released.|$|E
5|$|Financial Times {{questioned}} why the Japanese auditor firm {{signed off}} on the financial statements in the same year when other members of its global network apparently refused to give clean bills of financial heath to Olympus subsidiaries such as Gyrus in the UK, and elsewhere. One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit fees <b>are</b> <b>up</b> to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|E
5|$|Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where {{the gills}} curve up {{to join the}} stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted {{on the walls of}} the cystidia, is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there <b>are</b> <b>up</b> to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).|$|E

5|$|Hampden is an all-seated bowl stadium, {{although}} {{the ground is}} split into four geographic sections, officially known as the North, East, South and West Stands. Due to {{the dominance of the}} Old Firm within Scottish football and their regular qualification for cup matches played at Hampden, the East and West stands are commonly known as the Celtic and Rangers ends. The East Stand has 12,800 seats on a single tier of 53 rows. The two end stands <b>are</b> <b>up</b> to 140metres away from the pitch, due to Hampden retaining its bowl shape after it was redeveloped. This distance is almost as great as if Hampden included an athletics track, {{although the}} distance between the pitch and the two side stands is more comparable to a normal football stadium.|$|E
5|$|In Birmingham, 60.4% of the {{population}} was aged between 16-74, compared to 66.7% in England as a whole. There are generally more females than males in each single year of age, except for the youngest ages (0–18) and late-30s and late-50s. Females represented 51.6% of {{the population}} whilst men represented 48.4%. The differences are most marked in the oldest age group reflecting greater female longevity, where more women were 70 or over. The bulge around the early-20s is due largely to students coming to the city's universities. Children around age ten are a relatively small group, reflecting the decline in birth rates {{around the turn of the}} century. There is a large group of children under the age of five which reflecting high numbers of births in recent years. Births <b>are</b> <b>up</b> 20% since 2001, increasing from 14,427 to 17,423 in 2011.|$|E
