5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the slip face point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>repose</b> of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>repose,</b> the sand avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then {{the addition of a}} further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche.

5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>repose</b> (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Soil is an {{assemblage}} of particles that have little to no cementation while rock (such as sandstone) may consist of an assembly of particles that are strongly cemented together by chemical bonds. The shear strength of soil is primarily due to interparticle friction and therefore, the shear resistance on a plane is approximately proportional to the effective normal stress on that plane.

25|$|Avalanche {{formation}} {{requires a}} slope shallow enough for snow to accumulate but steep {{enough for the}} snow to accelerate once {{set in motion by}} the combination of mechanical failure (of the snowpack) and gravity. The angle of the slope that can hold snow, called the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>repose,</b> depends on a variety of factors such as crystal form and moisture content. Some forms of drier and colder snow will only stick to shallower slopes, while wet and warm snow can bond to very steep surfaces. In particular, in coastal mountains, such as the Cordillera del Paine region of Patagonia, deep snowpacks collect on vertical and even overhanging rock faces. The slope angle that can allow moving snow to accelerate depends on a variety of factors such as the snow's shear strength (which is itself dependent upon crystal form) and the configuration of layers and inter-layer interfaces.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{demonstrate}} the use of tetrahedral clumps to model scaled railway ballast using the discrete element method (DEM). In experimental triaxial tests, the peak friction angles for scaled ballast are less sensitive to the confining pressure when compared to full-sized ballast. This is presumed to be due to the size effect on particle strength, whereby smaller particles are statistically stronger and exhibit less abrasion. To investigate this in DEM, the ballast is modelled using clumps with breakable asperities to produce the correct volumetric deformation. The effects of the quantity and properties of these asperities are investigated, and it is shown that the strength affects the macroscopic shear strength at both high and low confining pressures, while the effects of the number of asperities diminishes with increasing confining pressure due to asperity breakage. It is also shown that changing the number of asperities only affects the peak friction angle but not the ultimate friction angle by comparing the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>repose</b> <b>of</b> samples with different numbers of asperities...|$|R

40|$|Discrete element method (DEM) {{is proving}} to be a {{reliable}} and increasingly used tool to study and predict the behaviour of granular materials. Numerous particlescale mechanisms influence the bulk behaviour and flow of bulk materials.

Relevant parameters such as static and rolling coefficients of friction, coefficient of restitution and interparticle cohesion forces from the presence of liquid bridges have been investigated to model the bulk behaviour of dry and moist granular materials. To validate the DEM models, the results have been checked against experimental slump tests and hopper discharge experiments to quantitatively compare the poured and drained <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>repose</b> and solidsmass flow rate.

40|$|AbstractDiscrete element {{methods can}} {{be based on}} either {{penalties}} or impulses to resolve collisions. A generic impulse based method, the energy tracking method (ETM), is described to resolve collisions between multiple non-convex bodies in three dimensions. As opposed to the standard sequential impulse method (SQM) and simultaneous impulse method (SMM), which also apply impulses to avoid penetration, the energy tracking method changes the relative velocity between two colliding bodies iteratively yet simultaneously. Its main novelty is that impulses are applied gradually at multi-point contacts, and energy changes at the contact points are tracked to ensure conservation. Three main steps {{are involved in the}} propagation of the impulses during the single- and multi-contact resolution: compression, restitution-related energy loss, and separation. Numerical tests show that the energy tracking method captures the energy conservation property of perfectly elastic single- and multi-point collisions.
