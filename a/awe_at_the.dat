25|$|The human {{target is}} the {{essential}} distinguishing feature of the impalement arts. It has been asserted by several sources, including well-known knife throwers, that the power and appeal {{of this type of}} act lies as much in audience appreciation of the target as in admiration of the skill of the thrower or archer. Various theories have been put forward to explain this, ranging from simple <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of sadomasochistic eroticism, others cite dramaturgical works and point to parallels with the story arc of the hero in classic drama. In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the , in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril.|$|E

Dianne Williamson of the Telegram & Gazette praised [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] for taking a chance with the source material, and said, [...] "Often I'm in <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> courage of these [...] creators." [...] The Advertiser of Lafayette, Louisiana, called the episode [...] "hysterical" [...] and particularly praised its satire of American consumerism. The St. Paul Pioneer Press described the episode as [...] "hilarious" [...] and said, [...] "We know we shouldn't laugh, but we can't help it." [...] Vicki Englund of The Courier-Mail complimented the [...] "really bizarre storyline" [...] and {{the moral of the}} episode, and especially praised the jokes about Struthers: [...] "It {{might be a good idea}} not to eat during the hilarious second episode.

500|$|The Pillar {{quickly became}} a popular tourist attraction; Kennedy writes that [...] "for the next 157 years its ascent was a must on every visitor's list". Yet from the {{beginning}} there were criticisms, on both political and aesthetic grounds. The September 1809 issue of the Irish Monthly Magazine, edited by the revolution-minded Walter [...] "Watty" [...] Cox, reported that [...] "our independence has been wrested from us, not by the arms of France but by the gold of England. The statue of Nelson records the glory of a mistress and the transformation of our senate into a discount office". [...] In an early (1818) history {{of the city of}} Dublin, the writers express <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scale of the monument, but are critical of several of its features: its proportions are described as [...] "ponderous", the pedestal as [...] "unsightly" [...] and the column itself as [...] "clumsy". However, the Hibernian Magazine thought the statue was a good likeness of its subject, and that the Pillar's position in the centre of the wide street gave the eye a focal point in what was otherwise [...] "wastes of pavements".|$|E
500|$|Coach McKay had {{won four}} {{national}} championships while coaching at USC, {{and he never}} hesitated to express his lack of <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> NFL. He earned enemies in the league with his dismissive comments and nonchalant attitude. The league liked to promote the games as having life-or-death significance, and were undercut by a coach who would make statements such as, “You draw Xs and Os on a blackboard and that’s not so difficult. I can even do it with my left hand”. Such statements made the Buccaneers’ road more difficult, as a feeling grew around the league that McKay was a newcomer who needed to be taught a lesson. Linebacker Richard “Batman” Wood echoed those sentiments: “It was a brand-new organization. Who cared about us? They wanted to devastate us, beat us in the ground. And with coach McKay coming from college, they wanted to maybe even play us a little harder." [...] Examples given of opponents using McKay’s comments {{as an excuse to}} run up the score included the reverse that Denver ran late in a 48–10 victory, and the timeout that Chuck Fairbanks called {{at the end of the}} Patriots game to enable Steve Grogan to break the NFL record of season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. One sports analyst had predicted that McKay’s lucrative contract would encourage opposing coaches to run up the score on the Buccaneers, to be able to demonstrate to their team owners that they were deserving of similar money.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Wind" [...] is {{cast in a}} form closely {{associated}} with Dafydd, the poem in which a messenger or llatai, usually a bird or animal, {{is sent to the}} poet's lover. [...] It {{is a good example of}} how Dafydd's works in this form can include a close and warmly-appreciative description of a llatai, even when, as is often the case in Dafydd's poems, he is describing nature in one of its harsher aspects. [...] The careering course of the wind is embodied in the headlong pace of the poem. [...] Rachel Bromwich called [...] "The Wind" [...] one of [...] "the outstanding expressions of Dafydd's wonder and <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mysteries of the cosmic forces", but pointed out that in the end Dafydd curbs this force to act as a love-messenger to Morfudd. [...] The poet Gwyneth Lewis sees the poem as [...] "a hymn to the havoc that art can work in the world", while for the scholar Helen Fulton the wind is a metaphor for [...] "freedom and autonomy from the laws of governing society". [...] This political aspect of the poem is particularly apparent in lines 19–22 (13–16 in some editions): ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{summer of}} the year 1783 was an amazing and portentous one, and full of horrible phaenomena; for besides the {{alarming}} meteors and tremendous thunder-storms that affrighted and distressed the different counties of this kingdom, the peculiar haze, or smokey fog, that prevailed for many weeks in this island, and {{in every part of}} Europe, and even beyond its limits, was a most extraordinary appearance, unlike anything known within the memory of man. By my journal I find that I had noticed this strange occurrence from June 23 to July 20 inclusive, during which period the wind varied to every quarter without making any alteration in the air. The sun, at noon, looked as blank as a clouded moon, and shed a rust-coloured ferruginous light on the ground, and floors of rooms; but was particularly lurid and blood-coloured at rising and setting. All the time the heat was so intense that butchers' meat could hardly be eaten on the day after it was killed; and the flies swarmed so in the lanes and hedges that they rendered the horses half frantic, and riding irksome. The country people began to look, with a superstitious <b>awe,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> red, louring aspect of the sun; ...|$|E
2500|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward to explain the enduring appeal of the target girl. These range from simple <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of sadomasochistic eroticism, others cite dramaturgical works and point to parallels with the story arc of the hero in classic drama. In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the hero's ordeal, in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril. [...] Jim Steinmeyer, a noted illusion designer who has written well-regarded books {{on the history of}} magic, has identified a fashion for female peril as entertainment in the post-First World War period. Steinmeyer has written that P. T. Selbit's stage debut of the Sawing Through A Woman illusion in 1921 marked the beginning of a trend for women as the victims of choice for acts simulating danger or torture. While Steinmeyer focuses on stage magic and attributes some of the trend to practical factors, he also points to a broader pattern in entertainment generally, which he links to social trends. He concludes that: [...] "...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment". A further view on historical trends is provided by performer and blogger Ula the Painproof Rubbergirl, who has acted as a target girl for New York-based knife thrower The Great Throwdini. In an extensive article on her experiences and philosophical approach to the art she notes: [...] "Knife throwing is an old act. So is high wire. And rodeo. And stone throwing, witch burning, beheading, Roman gladiators, jousting, dog fights,you name it - we, humans, love it. And we love a vulnerable woman. Isn't there something oddly attractive about the woman in danger? I remember seeing lots of soundless black and white movies with a girl tied to the railroad tracks or a girl tied to a sawmill by some evil perverted landlord." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter gave a {{positive}} review and said, [...] "Scott {{did a great}} job reviving the Roman sand-and-sandals epic when he made the Oscar-winning Gladiator. This Egyptian saga is not quite in the same league, but it confirms the director's flair of widescreen imagery. Exodus has the added kick of 3D technology, and it has enough eye-popping set pieces to please adventure fans." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was positive of the film and said, [...] "Exodus is a biblical epic that comes at you at maximum velocity but stays stirringly, inspiringly human." [...] Reagan Gavin Rasquinha of The Times of India gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Exodus: Gods and Kings is 'spectacle' with a capital 'S' and in more ways than one, definitely epic." [...] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian gave 3 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "It’s impossible not to feel some <b>awe</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spectacle, but more shocks would have helped see you through the two-and-a-half hour running time." [...] Phillips Hawker of The Sydney Morning Herald gave a mixed review and awarded the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying, [...] "Exodus: Gods And Kings... lacks Gladiator's full-on intensity and committed central performances, however; it's a mixture of the grand and the bland, and when it's not spectacular it's a little plodding." [...] Justin Chang of Variety said, [...] "Some may well desire a purer, fuller version of the story, one more faithful to the text and less clearly shaped by the demands of the Hollywood blockbuster. But on its own grand, imperfect terms, [...] "Exodus: Gods and Kings" [...] is undeniably transporting, marked by a free-flowing visual splendor that plays to its creator’s unique strengths: Given how many faith-based movies are content to tell their audiences what to think or feel, it’s satisfying to see one whose images alone are enough to compel awestruck belief." [...] Jim Vejvoda of IGN said, [...] "Director Ridley Scott gets lost in the desert at times in Exodus: Gods and Kings, his epic, but not entirely effective take on the story of Moses' journey from Prince of Egypt to Hebrew leader." ...|$|E
