Currently NiMH batteries contain approximately 3 kg of REEs, 11 kg of nickel and 1. 5 kg of cobalt. Leaching with HCl and solvent extraction using Cyanex 923 have been applied to recover metals from this waste. Process has been developed for NiMH car batteries, which can be dismantled manually or mechanically. Depending on the way of dismantling, three different materials can be obtained (cathode plates, anode plates or mixed material). Developed technologies have been designed to recover metals either from cathodic and <b>anodic</b> <b>material</b> or from mixed (cathodic and <b>anodic)</b> <b>material.</b> Hydrochloric acid (8 M) is used as a leaching agent at a temperature of 30 °C. The extraction system consists of the solvating extractant trialkylphosphine oxide mixture (Cyanex 923) and tributyl phosphate (TBP) diluted in kerosene. A pre-main extraction (8 % Cyanex 923, 10 % TBP, 82 % kerosene) is used to remove Fe and Zn from cathode and mixed material leachates. Zn and Fe are extracted in four extraction stages followed by three scrubbing stages to remove co-extracted metal ions and four stripping stages to remove extracted Zn and Fe (99. 9 %). Aluminium and REEs are separated from Ni, K, and Mg in three main extraction stages (70 % Cyanex 923, 10 % TBP, 10 % kerosene, 10 % 1 -Decanol). High purity Ni (> 99. 9 %) in a raffinate is obtained after main extraction. Loaded organic phase is stripped with mixture of 0. 9 M NaNO 3 and 0. 1 MHNO 3 to remove co-extracted Co, Mn and Ni. Aluminium and REEs are recovered by stripping step using 1 M HCl after previous scrubbing of organic phase with 1 M NaNO 3 to remove residual Co and Mn.
