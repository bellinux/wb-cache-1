"If Youth but Knew" [...] is {{the title}} of a book {{published}} some years ago, but still with a quite living interest, by [...] "Kappa"; it is the bitter complaint of a distressed senior against our educational system. He is hugely disappointed in the public-school boy, and more particularly in one typical specimen. He is--if one might hazard a guess--an uncle bereft of great expectations. He finds an echo in thousands of other distressed uncles and parents. They use the most divergent and inadequate forms of expression for this vague sense that the result has not come out good enough; they put it contradictorily and often wrongly, but the sense is widespread and real and justifiable and we owe a great debt to [...] "Kappa" [...] for an accurate diagnosis of what in the <b>aggregate</b> <b>amounts</b> to a grave national and social evil.|$|E

50|$|In Viner's terminology—now {{considered}} standard—the {{short run}} {{is a period}} long enough to permit any desired output change that is technologically possible without altering {{the scale of the}} plant—but is not long enough to adjust the scale of the plant. He arbitrarily assumes that all factors can, for the short run, be classified in two groups: those necessarily fixed in amount, and those freely variable. Scale of plant is the size of the group of factors that are fixed in amount in the short-run, and each scale is quantitatively indicated by the amount of output that can be produced at the lowest average cost possible at that scale. Costs associated with the fixed factors are fixed costs. Those associated with the variable factors are direct costs. Note that fixed costs are fixed only in their <b>aggregate</b> <b>amounts,</b> and vary with output in their amount per unit, while direct costs vary in their aggregate amount as output varies, as well as in their amount per unit. The spreading of overhead is therefore a short-run phenomenon and {{not to be confused with}} the long-run.|$|E

Similarly, mergers between insured depository institutions and non-insured depository institutions that have a bad track record in combating money-laundering could be blocked.|$|E

40|$|Under the {{conventional}} approach in torts, liability for an accident is decided {{by comparing the}} injurer’s costs of precautions {{with those of the}} victim, and, under the negligence rule, also with the expected magnitude of harm. In multiplevictim cases, the current paradigm holds that courts should determine liability by comparing the injurer’s costs of precautions with the victims’ aggregate costs and with their aggregate harm. This aggregative risk-utility test supposedly results in the imposition of liability on the least-cost avoiders of the accident, and, therefore, is assumed efficient. However, this paradigm neglects the importance of the normal differences between tort victims. When victims are heterogeneous with regard to their expected harm or costs of precaution, basing the liability-decision on the <b>aggregate</b> <b>amounts</b> may be incorrect, causing in some cases over-deterrence, while in other, under-deterrence and dilution of liability. A new paradigm is therefore needed. This Article demonstrates how aggregate liability may violate aggregate efficiency, and concludes that decisions based upon <b>aggregate</b> <b>amounts</b> are inappropriate when the victims are heterogeneousâ€”as they typically are in real life. The Article then turns to an exploration of an alternative to the aggregative risk-utility test, and argues for a legal rule that would combine restitution for precaution costs, plus an added small â€œbonus,â€ with the sampling of victims’ claims. ...|$|E

In the stationary equilibrium, some workers are frictionally unemployed {{and others are}} long-term unemployed. The amounts of frictional and long-term unemployment at each location depend on its recent history of productivity shocks, producing a local hysteresis effect. Changes in the parameters affect the equilibrium <b>aggregate</b> <b>amounts</b> of frictional and long-term unemployment differently. In particular, economies with larger moving costs will have more long-term and total unemployment, but less frictional unemployment.

It is assumed that the actual dependency structure of the asset returns within each group is unknown, but assets belonging to different groups have independent returns. Instead of assuming any particular dependency structure within each group, we propose the maximin criterion as an alternative optimization criterion. The least favorable dependency structure is first identified, then we proceed to analyze the optimal portfolio problem {{as if this were}} the actual dependency structure. Sufficient conditions for ordering the <b>aggregate</b> <b>amounts</b> allocated to different groups, and for ordering the amounts allocated to different assets within each group are obtained. © 2005 Elsevier B.

Some mechanical properties of cement mortar with different crumb rubber <b>aggregate</b> <b>amounts</b> are researched including compressive strength, flexural strength, the ratio of compressive strength to flexural strength, impact resistance, and dry contraction percentage. In our tests, we consider six kinds of the rubber contents, 0 %, 7. 5 %, 15 %, 19 %, 22. 5 %, and 30 %, respectively. The optimal mixing amount of crumb rubber is determined by measuring three indices, the ratio of compressive strength to flexural strength, impact resistance, and dry contraction percentage. It is shown by test that the ratio of compressive strength to flexural strength is the smallest when the mixing amount of rubber is 19 %; meanwhile high impact resistance and rational drying shrinkage are observed. The optimal mixing amount of the rubber particles is 19 % determined by this test...|$|E

40|$|Cycle {{scavenging}} (CS) is {{the process}} of using otherwise idle computational resources to provide large, <b>aggregate,</b> <b>amounts</b> of computational power. It is the core principle of so-called desktop grids and volunteer computing, which use the idle cycles of desktop computers to do computations. However, resources in a multicluster grid likewise may have idle time, and so, multi-cluster grids go through periods of low efficiency. In addition, many practical grid applications are of the Bag-of-Tasks (BoT) type, which are large collections of embarrassingly parallel tasks. These require a vast amount of computational power, which multi-cluster grids can provide. Claiming an entire grid for one application would however not be fair to other grid users. In this thesis, we design a system for multi-cluster grids that detects and uses otherwise idle resources, specifically to execute BoTs. By combining CS with the computational power of the grid, we increase grid efficiency, we are able to provide the resources needed by BoTs, and, at the same time, we can guarantee unobtrusiveness to all grid users. The system we design, KOALA-CS, is an extension of the KOALA grid resource manager. We create a framewor...|$|E
