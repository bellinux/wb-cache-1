The school has natural day lighting in all classrooms, as well as the gymnasium and the multi-purpose room, in order to save electricity. <b>Automatic</b> <b>controls</b> <b>turn</b> off electrical lights when natural lighting is sufficient. It is equipped with low flow water fixtures and the sports fields are irrigated with reclaimed water. It is expected that it will use about half the potable water of a conventional school design of the same size.|$|R
40|$|Equipment {{manufacturing}} industry is the strategic industries of a country. And its core {{part is the}} CNC machine tool. Therefore, enhancing the independent research of relevant technology of CNC machine, especially the open CNC system, is of great significance. This paper presented some key techniques of an Intelligent <b>Automatic</b> <b>Turning</b> System and gave a viable solution for system integration. First of all, the integrated system architecture and the flexible and efficient workflow for perfoming the intelligent <b>automatic</b> <b>turning</b> process is illustrated. Secondly, the innovated methods of the workpiece feature recognition and expression and process planning of the NC machining are put forward. Thirdly, the cutting tool auto-selection and the cutting parameter optimization solution are generated with a integrated inference of rule-based reasoning and case-based reasoning. Finally, the actual machining case based on the developed intelligent <b>automatic</b> <b>turning</b> system proved the presented solutions are valid, practical and efficient...|$|R

The control law converted rotational hand controller inputs into roll rate commands, manipulated ailerons, spoilers, and the rudder to achieve the desired roll rates. The system included <b>automatic</b> <b>turn</b> coordination, track angle hold, and autopilot/autoland modes. The resulting control law produced faster roll rates (15 degrees/sec), quicker response to command reversals, and safer bank angle limits, while using a more concise program code...|$|R
