5|$|Honeyeaters {{prefer to}} forage <b>at</b> <b>individual</b> flowers which have only just opened, as these {{offer the most}} nectar. As they probe for nectar, {{honeyeaters}} end up with large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their pollen within four hours of opening, and pollen is deposited on the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata end up with pollen lodged in the stigmatic groove, a prerequisite to fertilisation.|$|E
5|$|In psychophysiological {{research}} on attachment, {{the two main}} areas studied have been autonomic responses, such as heart rate or respiration, and {{the activity of the}} hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Infants' physiological responses have been measured during the Strange Situation procedure looking <b>at</b> <b>individual</b> differences in infant temperament {{and the extent to which}} attachment acts as a moderator. There is some evidence that the quality of caregiving shapes the development of the neurological systems which regulate stress.|$|E
5|$|Very rarely, {{female worker}} bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, {{in a process}} known as the anarchic syndrome. Female {{reproductive}} workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even {{in the presence of a}} queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions <b>at</b> <b>individual</b> and group levels.|$|E

5|$|The {{goods service}} <b>at</b> <b>individual</b> {{stations}} was also withdrawn after Beeching's report. A freightliner depot opened at Aberdeen in 1966, allowing the Peterhead line to close completely on 7 September 1970. In 1969–70 {{the line between}} Aberdeen and Keith was singled, with passing loops, the line to Fraserburgh closing completely in 1979 and that from Keith to Dufftown in 1985. In the 1969 timetable there were early morning trains between Aberdeen and Inverurie, and five services a day between Aberdeen to Inverness, supplemented by two Aberdeen to Elgin services that by the late 1970s were running through to Inverness. The cross-country DMUs were replaced in 1980 by diesel locomotives hauling Mark I compartment coaches, later Mark II open saloons. These were similarly replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s by newer DMUs, first the Class 156 Super Sprinter and then Class 158 Express and Class 170 units.|$|E
5|$|The {{marginalization}} of the Iranian Bahá'ís by current governments {{is rooted in}} historical efforts by Muslim clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the Báb started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the movement from spreading by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions. Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression aimed <b>at</b> <b>individual</b> Bahá'ís, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bahá'í community and its institutions were initiated. In one case in Yazd in 1903 more than 100 Bahá'ís were killed. Bahá'í schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girls' schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 1940s, Bahá'í marriages were not recognized and Bahá'í texts were censored.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} the study on the avian fauna of the Taebaeksan (Mt.) region of the Seodeukbong of the BaekduDaegan between May and October of 2007 are as follows. A total of 1, 831 {{individuals}} of 71 bird species were observed in the study sites, and based on the average of the highest number of individuals, the most dominant species was the Brambling (Fringilla montifringilla) <b>at</b> 28. 6 <b>individuals</b> (21. 8 %), followed by the Yellow-throated bunting (Emberiza elegans) <b>at</b> 13. 5 <b>individuals</b> (10. 3 %), Long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus) <b>at</b> 11. 6 <b>individuals</b> (8. 8 %), Brown-eared bulbul (Hypsipetes amaurotis) <b>at</b> 7. 6 <b>individuals</b> (5. 8 %), Marsh tit (Parus palustris) <b>at</b> 6. 9 <b>individuals</b> (5. 3 %) and the Great tit (Parus major) <b>at</b> 6. 5 <b>individuals</b> (5. 0 %).

40|$|Prior {{research}} indicates that employees engage in organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) because of prosocial values, organizational concern, and impression management motives. Building upon and extending prior research, we investigate all 3 OCB motives by developing a categorization scheme to differentiate their distinctiveness and by building a contextualized argument regarding their interactive effects on OCB in a more collectivistic culture. In a sample of 379 Chinese employee-supervisor dyads from Taiwan, {{we found that the}} relationship between prosocial values motives and OCBs directed <b>at</b> <b>individuals</b> was strengthened by organizational concern motives; likewise, the relationship between organizational concern and OCBs directed at the organization was strengthened by prosocial values motives. However, in contrast to prior research (Grant & Mayer, 2009), the relationship between prosocial values motives and OCBs directed <b>at</b> <b>individuals</b> was weakened by impression management motives. A 3 -way interaction between all 3 motives further suggests that, in Asian cultures, impression management motives may undermine the positive effects of prosocial values and organizational concern motives on OCBs directed <b>at</b> <b>individuals</b> but not OCBs directed at the organization...|$|R

25|$|In 2005, {{an upgrade}} in {{screening}} technology and rising security concerns led to luggage-screening processes being conducted behind closed-doors, {{as opposed to}} them being done before check-in within public view.

25|$|CW {{spectroscopy}} is inefficient {{in comparison}} with Fourier analysis techniques (see below) since it probes the NMR response <b>at</b> <b>individual</b> frequencies in succession. Since the NMR signal is intrinsically weak, the observed spectrum suffers from a poor signal-to-noise ratio. This can be mitigated by signal averaging i.e. adding the spectra from repeated measurements. While the NMR signal is constant between scans and so adds linearly, the random noise adds more slowly – proportional to the square root {{of the number of}} spectra (see random walk). Hence the overall signal-to-noise ratio increases as the square-root of the number of spectra measured.|$|E

25|$|In 1903, the General Workers' Union (UGT) was {{established}} as a more moderate, less anarchist, yet more or less syndicalist rival union. Its founding coincided with a further radicalization of the FOA, which would peak in 1905. The infighting between the moderate and anarchist factions of the FOA was a contributory factor. In 1903 and 1904, Argentina saw no less than twelve general strikes and many more <b>at</b> <b>individual</b> plants, with the FOA being involved in many of them. At the 1903 FOA May Day demonstration, a clash with police left two dead and twenty-four wounded. At a bakers' strike in Rosario, one worker was shot by police. By 1904, the FOA had a possible 11,000 members.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear waste {{disposal}} {{is one of}} the most controversial facets of the nuclear power debate. Presently, waste is mainly stored <b>at</b> <b>individual</b> reactor sites and there are over 430 locations around the world where radioactive material continues to accumulate. Experts agree that centralized underground repositories which are well-managed, guarded, and monitored, would be a vast improvement. There is an international consensus on the advisability of storing nuclear waste in deep underground repositories, but no country in the world has yet opened such a site. There are dedicated waste storage sites at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico and two in German salt mines, the Morsleben Repository and the Schacht Asse II.|$|E
25|$|The first {{creations of}} towns {{are linked to}} a system of specialism <b>at</b> <b>individual</b> settlements, which is {{evidenced}} in studying place-names. Sutterton, 'shoe-makers' tun' (in the area of the Danelaw such places are Sutterby) was so-named because local circumstances allowed the growth of a craft recognised by the people of surrounding places. Similarly with Sapperton, the 'soap-makers' tun. While Boultham, the 'meadow with burdock plants', may well have developed a specialism in the production of burrs for wool-carding, since meadows with burdock merely growing in them must have been relatively numerous. From places named for their services or location within a single district, a category of which the most obvious perhaps are the Eastons and Westons, it is possible to move outwards to glimpse component settlements within larger economic units. Names betray some role within a system of seasonal pasture, Winderton in Warwickshire is the winter tun and various Somertons are self-explanatory. Hardwicks are dairy farms and Swinhopes the valleys where pigs were pastured.|$|E
