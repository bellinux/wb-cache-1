5000|$|QFE, QNH [...] - Codes for <b>altimeter</b> <b>settings.</b> (examples of the Q code system, {{originally}} morse for ships).|$|E
50|$|Many {{countries}} {{also use}} the millibar or hectopascal to give aviation <b>altimeter</b> <b>settings.</b> In practically all other fields, the kilopascal (1000 pascals) is used instead.|$|E
50|$|Class A {{begins and}} {{includes}} 18,000 ft. MSL and continues up to 60,000 ft. MSL. It {{is the most}} controlled airspace and requires a pilot to carry an Instrument Flight Rating and proper clearance no matter what type of aircraft is being flown. Pilots are also required to change their <b>altimeter</b> <b>settings</b> to 29.92 in. to ensure all pilots within the airspace have the same readings {{in order to ensure}} proper altitude separation.|$|E
50|$|Some Q {{codes are}} also used in aviation, in {{particular}} QNE, QNH and QFE, referring to certain <b>altimeter</b> <b>settings.</b> These codes are used in radiotelephone conversations with air traffic control as unambiguous shorthand, where safety and efficiency are of vital importance. A subset of Q codes {{is used by the}} Miami-Dade County, Florida local government for law enforcement and fire rescue communications, one of the few instances where Q codes are used in ground voice communication.|$|E
5000|$|On August 25, 1985, Bar Harbor Airlines Flight 1808 {{carrying}} 8 passengers (6 passengers, 2 crew) {{was attempting}} to land at the airport when it crashed 500 feet {{to the right of}} the airport's runway center line, killing all passengers and crew. It was determined that the crash was due to a mixture of weather conditions, incorrect <b>altimeter</b> <b>settings,</b> and pilot error. The accident attracted unusual public attention due to one of the passengers, Samantha Smith, a 13 year old peace activist from Houlton, Maine, ...|$|E
50|$|On July 2, 2012, Hample {{attempted}} {{to break a}} world record by catching a baseball dropped from a helicopter 1,000 feet above LeLacheur Park in Lowell, Massachusetts. Wearing catcher's gear that was donated by Rawlings, Hample established a record by catching a softball dropped from a height of 312 feet. He then caught baseballs dropped from heights of 312 feet, 562 feet, and 822 feet before the Federal Aviation Administration called off the stunt due to strong winds. The 822-foot catch was initially thought to be 762 feet, but a discrepancy in the <b>altimeter</b> <b>settings,</b> which was captured on video and discovered months later, added 60 feet to the altitude. On July 13, 2013, Hample made another attempt at LeLacheur Park and succeeded in catching a baseball dropped from an altitude of 1,050 feet.|$|E
5000|$|In {{publishing}} its report, the National Transportation Safety Board {{noted that}} the controller in Portland used [...] "poor judgment" [...] assisting the flight. However, it concluded that the captain accepted the large course correction and the crew continued flying an unstabilized approach instead of executing a missed approach. As well, the flight crew attempted to stabilize the approach while allowing the plane to fly below the instrument glide slope. The incorrect <b>altimeter</b> <b>settings</b> may have caused this descent to continue below the published decision height. At night in low visibility, the crew may have been unaware of their true position. The NTSB recommended a review of controller procedures for outlying airports without ground radar. The 60-degree turn less than one mile from the outer marker would violate approach guidelines for radar-assisted arrivals to Portland International Jetport for example. It further recommended aircraft for hire capable of carrying six or more passengers be equipped with flight recorders.|$|E
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the accident, investigators were hindered by the absence of cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder information. The Beech 99 was not a large enough plane for the FAA to require their installation. There was also no record of which pilot was to have flown the aircraft. Both pilots had used the radio during the flight instead of the non-flying pilot. Examination of radar data from Portland showed that after the plane turned to course 340 to intercept the approach, it flew through the approach and had to correct to get back on course. Investigators noted that this instruction meant the flight crew had to make a 60-degree turn less than one mile from the approach outer marker. Altitude data transmitted by the aircraft transponder showed the plane did not begin its descent along the precision glide slope until it was above it after passing Lewiston. This may have caused the flight crew to rush both the descent and the approach. The actual <b>altimeter</b> <b>settings</b> on both the captain's and the first officer's altimeters could not be determined due to fire and impact damage to the instruments. The aircraft flew into trees less than one mile from the end of runway 4 and struck the ground less than 500 ft {{to the right of the}} extended runway center line. There were no survivors.|$|E
40|$|To further {{test the}} {{practicability}} of operational mesoanalysis, the author has, {{during the past}} 3 years, accumulated and studied {{a number of cases}} concurrent with and following his case study published in this issue [l]. Of 11 cases involving meso-Lows (or, in several instances, suspected meso-Lows) all were depicted either by the intersections of two instability lines or by the intersection increment-of-time changes in weather. of an instability line with an eastward-extending line of activity which separated rain-cooled air on its north side from the tropical air on its south side. Within these 11 meso-Lows some 81 tornadoes were involved. A significant discovery was that the absolute pressure falls at the surface, as detected by <b>altimeter</b> <b>settings</b> recorded {{in the vicinity of the}} meso-Low, indicated a REFERENC...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} is the Deliverable D 10. 1 - 3 titled “Concept of Operations” for ACROSS, a European Commission 7 th Framework co-funded project. The Emergency Aircraft Control System (EACS) {{to be developed}} in ACROSS WP 10 must deal with a full flight deck crew incapacitation (Configuration 4 of the ACROSS Definitions) and should enable a safe return and automatic landing of the aircraft to a suitable airport. A potential system {{for the detection of}} the incapacitation will be investigated in ACROSS WP 9. During the phase in which the EACS is active it may be in contact with a cooperative ground segment. As defined in D 10. 1 - 1 Candidate Solutions, two solutions ere brought forward to more detailed description in this concept of operations (ConOps) document. During the identification of the candidate solutions, the full spectrum of control over the aircraft systems was considered: From a fully automated Emergency Aircraft Control System (EACS) to fully ground controlled Remotely Piloted Aircraft System. None of these extreme ends of the spectrum will by themselves constitute a satisfying solution at all levels. Therefore, for the purpose of deriving a concept of operations, the two solutions for which ConOps are developed are called “Ground Centered” and “Aircraft Centered”. For the aircraft centered solution, the EACS will navigate, aviate and land autonomously. A ground station linked to the EACS {{will be able to make}} strategic decision such as diversions to alternate airports (for example in the event of runway closure) and uplink barometric <b>altimeter</b> <b>settings.</b> The ground centered solution will have the possibility of using the aircraft as remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) with direct commands to the primary control surfaces. The electronic standby pilot onboard the aircraft still has authority to override ground control (for example in case of a TCAS alert) ...|$|E
