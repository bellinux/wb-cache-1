50|$|The next {{match was}} between Kurt <b>Angle</b> and Chris Benoit for the WWE Championship. Team <b>Angle</b> (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) were ejected from ringside after interfering.

50|$|Proof: Since <b>angle</b> BDA {{is a right}} <b>angle,</b> <b>angle</b> DBA equals π/2 minus <b>angle</b> DAB. However, <b>angle</b> DAH also equals π/2 minus <b>angle</b> DAB (since <b>angle</b> HAB is a right <b>angle).</b> Therefore triangles DBA and DAH are similar. Therefore <b>angle</b> DIA equals <b>angle</b> DOH, where I is the {{midpoint}} of BA and O is {{the midpoint}} of AH. But AOH is a straight line, so <b>angle</b> DOH and DOA are supplementary <b>angles.</b> Therefore the sum of <b>angles</b> DIA and DOA is π. <b>Angle</b> IAO is a right <b>angle.</b> The sum of the <b>angles</b> in any quadrilateral is 2π, so in quadrilateral IDOA, <b>angle</b> IDO must be a right <b>angle.</b> But ADHE is a rectangle, so the midpoint O of AH (the rectangle's diagonal) is also the midpoint of DE (the rectangle's other diagonal). As I (defined as the midpoint of BA) {{is the center of}} semicircle BA, and <b>angle</b> IDE is a right <b>angle,</b> then DE is tangent to semicircle BA at D. By analogous reasoning DE is tangent to semicircle AC at E. Q.E.D.|$|R

25|$|Let ABC be an {{isosceles}} triangle with AB and AC being the equal sides. Pick an arbitrary point D on side AB and construct E on AC so that AD=AE. Draw the lines BE, DC and DE. Consider the triangles BAE and CAD; BA=CA, AE=AD, and <b>angle</b> A {{is equal to}} itself, so by side-angle-side, the triangles are congruent and corresponding sides and <b>angles</b> are equal. Therefore <b>angle</b> ABE = <b>angle</b> ACD, <b>angle</b> ADC = <b>angle</b> AEB, and BE=CD. Since AB=AC and AD=AE, BD=CE by subtraction of equal parts. Now consider the triangles DBE and ECD; BD=CE, BE=CD, and <b>angle</b> DBE = <b>angle</b> ECD have just been shown, so applying side-angle-side again, the triangles are congruent. Therefore <b>angle</b> BDE = <b>angle</b> CED and <b>angle</b> BED = <b>angle</b> CDE. Since <b>angle</b> BDE = <b>angle</b> CED and <b>angle</b> CDE = <b>angle</b> BED, <b>angle</b> BDC = <b>angle</b> CEB by subtraction of equal parts. Consider a third pair of triangles, BDC and CEB; DB=EC, DC=EB, and <b>angle</b> BDC = <b>angle</b> CEB, so applying side-angle-side a third time, the triangles are congruent.

5|$|The Merlin {{consumed}} {{an enormous}} volume of air {{at full power}} (equivalent to the volume of a single-decker bus per minute), and with the exhaust gases exiting at 1,300mph (2,100km/h) it was realised that useful thrust could be gained simply by <b>angling</b> the gases backwards instead of venting sideways.|$|E
25|$|In the figure, {{assume the}} measure of <b>Angle</b> A = x. When two {{adjacent}} <b>angles</b> form a straight line, they are supplementary. Therefore, {{the measure of}} <b>Angle</b> C = 180 − x. Similarly, the measure of <b>Angle</b> D = 180 − x. Both <b>Angle</b> C and <b>Angle</b> D have measures equal to 180 − x and are congruent. Since <b>Angle</b> B is supplementary to both <b>Angles</b> C and D, either of these <b>angle</b> measures {{may be used to}} determine the measure of <b>Angle</b> B. Using the measure of either <b>Angle</b> C or <b>Angle</b> D we find the measure of <b>Angle</b> B = 180 − (180 − x) = 180 − 180 + x = x. Therefore, both <b>Angle</b> A and <b>Angle</b> B have measures equal to x and are equal in measure.|$|R
