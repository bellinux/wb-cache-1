The sisters began renting the facility for meetings and retreats, using the dormitory space for guest sleeping quarters and the old school kitchens to provide food service.

2500|$|Following his Lumina vine de la Răsărit lecture, Sadoveanu became {{noted for}} his {{positive}} portrayals of communization and collectivization. In particular, Sadoveanu offered praise {{to one of}} the major pillars of Stalinism, the 1936 Soviet Constitution. In 1945, claiming to have been [...] "flashed upon" [...] by [...] "Stalin's argumentation", he urged the public to read the document for its [...] "sincerity"; elsewhere, he equated reading the constitution with [...] "a mystical revelation". Adrian Cioroianu describes this as [...] "an office assignment" [...] from the ARLUS, {{at a time when the}} group was circulating free translated copies of the Soviet constitution. The enthusiasm of his writings also manifested itself in his public behavior: according to his ARLUS colleague Iorgu Iordan, Sadoveanu was emotional during the 1945 Soviet trip, shedding tears of joy upon visiting <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>center</b> in the countryside. Running in the 1946 election, Sadoveanu blamed the old political class in general for the problems faced by Romanian peasants, including the major drought of that year. By then, his political partners were making use of his literary fame, and his electoral pamphlet read: [...] "There is no doubt that the thousands of people who have read his works will rush out on [...] to vote for him." [...] After 1948, when the Romanian communist regime was installed, Sadoveanu directed his praise toward the new authorities. In 1952, as Romania adopted its second republican constitution and the authorities intensified repression against anti-communists, Sadoveanu made some of his most controversial statements. Declaring the defunct kingdom to have been a [...] "long interval of organized injustice and crooked development in all areas", he presented the new order as an era of social justice, human dignity, available culture and universal public education.|$|E
