Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved. He later said, [...] "The similarities between this show and The Wild Wild West, and my character to that show's Artemus Gordon, was an important hook for me. It {{was one of my}} favorite shows growing up, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that Brisco County was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show, I called my agent and said, 'I'll do anything I {{have to do to get}} this. Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole. Praising Clemenson's work on Brisco, Cuse said, [...] "You can't give him anything he's not capable of doing. He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast".|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, the A {{graphics}} department hired Craig Braun and Associates {{to design}} the album cover for their third album. [...] "I recognized {{it to be a}} great logo <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it", says Richard. The logo was used on every Carpenters album thereafter; Richard said it was done [...] "to keep things consistent". The logo did not appear on the front cover of Passage but a small version appeared on the back cover.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{was a tough}} fight getting upstairs. We {{searched the}} bedroom areas {{and it was very}} hot, we knew {{immediately}} that no-one could have survived the fire. We began to feel around the walls and discovered him lying on the floor between the bed and the wall. I would say he had been in bed and tried to escape. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the body clearly I knew who it was. I used to be a fan, it's difficult to put my feelings into words. The scene was horrific in that corner of the room. I saw him lying there and thought what a pity it all was. I deal with many fires but this one was like walking down memory lane. We managed to salvage all his guitars and musical equipment. I feel a bit upset, all the firemen do. It was like seeing part of our lives gone forever." [...] â€“ (Fire Officer) ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> got to Geisenheimer's {{they played}} that 'Michigan' thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That time'," [...] he repeated. [...] "Why man, I {{have but}} just {{returned}} from the arena! You reached here almost <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I.</b> Had you been much later I should indeed have been worried, and <b>as</b> it is <b>I</b> had intended asking you about how you escaped the beast <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had completed the translation of this most interesting passage." ...|$|R
60|$|I am coming over, just <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can get {{the family}} moved and settled.|$|R
6000|$|... "I? I forgave you <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> how {{the land}} really lay." [...] And perhaps he had; his {{instinct}} {{had always been}} to forgive the beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew how}} it was <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you," [...] he said. [...] "Well, I believe we could get hold of an American missionary, and the Palestrina's ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mabel is like you, as {{you used}} to be," [...] he observed. [...] "It struck me <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her; but {{when she began to}} talk there was a difference." ...|$|E
60|$|On the way home, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was free, I upbraided Miss Grant for her cruelty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> {{will come}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can. I {{will try to}} reach you by {{daylight}} to-morrow. My heart is with you. Call up the Redfields; they will help you." ...|$|R
60|$|Say to {{the gentlemen}} I will meet them {{personally}} at Fortress Monroe <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can get there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{them they}} sprang {{out of sight}} behind some trees, and this morning, when they caught sight of Mary, they hurried off in the {{direction}} of Haven Point." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} there but a few minutes when the boat from without came slowly in between the rocks; and almost <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it, its {{progress}} was suddenly stopped by a sunken bar.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, after all, you weren't successful. You {{need not}} tell me {{anything}} about that--I knew it <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you this morning. But I will ask you to answer one thing: Is the decision final?" ...|$|E
60|$|Induced by a {{despatch}} from General Grant, I {{join you}} at Fort Monroe <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can come.|$|R
6000|$|Shorty {{turned on}} him. [...] "Oh, you'll get yours <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> finish with your pardner, you little hog-wallopin' snooper, you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You may spare all {{considerations}} concerning me, gentlemen,' again repeated Charles; 'yon {{mountain of}} Criffel shall fly <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> will.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{felt the}} swing of it <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it," [...] said Vesey. [...] "Hurrah for old Calloway! He's done the Japs and every paper in town that prints {{literature}} instead of news. Take a look at that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all over. I knew it <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{her face}} when she came in. She has said something, or done something, and it's all off. It will {{be a matter of}} over twenty {{thousand}} pounds a year!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{ought to}} have gone long ago. I told Myra we should have trouble somewhere <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> what a good-looking {{creature}} she was, {{and here it is}} as bad as can be. Dear, dear! Why can't young people have a little prudence?" ...|$|E
60|$|IT is {{needless to}} tell you at what {{conclusion}} <b>I</b> arrived, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was sufficiently myself to think at all.|$|R
60|$|But <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{heard that}} the People's Revolution {{had taken place in}} Berlin I {{determined}} to make a second visit.|$|R
60|$|From {{that moment}} I was fully {{resolved}} neither should be, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{got into a}} situation to control the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's painful, but I must go on. I {{knew what}} a mistake I had made <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Olcott come in; but you don't {{understand}} yet how far my suspicions led me. I felt it my duty to see Judson about Mrs. Olcott's lease." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{felt that}} was Miss Lloyd <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her, {{although}} I {{had never seen}} her before," [...] said Sylvia dreamily. [...] "I have been wishing to see her--for a certain reason. She has a very striking face. I should like to meet her--to know her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{made the}} {{purchase}} this morning, bright and early, {{before you were}} up," [...] replied Mr. Merrick, smilingly. [...] "It is a fine new car, and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it I knew it was what I wanted. It is now being fitted up for our use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--yes. One can't deny that. And three Percycross {{doctors are}} three more misfortunes. <b>I</b> must get home <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{come back}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can," [...] she promised, {{with a little}} break in her voice,--"as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> can, Mr. Heepman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. The fact is I almost tumbled {{into a lot}} of 'em--standing like wax figures--the {{other side}} of the park lodge, the other day--and got away <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could. I think I prefer the cows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The next day," [...] {{continued}} Mrs Keswick, [...] "a lady arrived; and <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her {{drive into}} the gate I felt sure it was Roberta March, and that the two had hatched up a plot to come and work on my feelings, and so I wouldn't come near the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really did. I COULD have, you know. Come, let's all {{sit down}} on this gravestone and get acquainted. It won't be hard. I know we're going to adore each other--I knew it <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you at Redmond this morning. I wanted so much to go right over and hug you both." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In some ways, {{it might}} be better if I went home at once," [...] Blake said at last. [...] "I could come back and join you <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> how things were going. The Colonel would feel easier if I were with him; but, all the same, I'm {{inclined}} to stay away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then,' {{with some}} sulkiness, 'you won't be content without beggaring {{me of my}} trumpery twenty-five hundred <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am of age?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{decided that}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had had another morsel of cheese I would seek this Bassett {{out and be}} pretty eloquent.|$|R
60|$|I {{will send}} you my address <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am sure of it, or you can always write me to the theatre.|$|R
