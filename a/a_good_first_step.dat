40|$|Start {{from three}} premises: (1) Global Climate Change {{is a genuine}} problem; (2) the Kyoto Protocol {{constitutes}} the only multilateral framework {{we have to address}} it; and (3) the Protocol is inadequate, particularly with regard to incomplete coverage across countries (no participation of US or developing countries) and across time (nothing agreed after 2012). This paper argues that – given the combination of political, economic and scientific realities as they are – Kyoto is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> foundation, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>first</b> <b>stepping</b> stone on the most practical path if we are to address Climate Change seriously. A constructive approach asks what are the requirements for the design of a second step in the process, a successor to the Kyoto regime of 2008 - 2012, one that would build on what is good about it and fix what is most lacking. This paper offers a proposal that seeks realistically to bring in all countries and to look far into the future. It argues that the path of emission targets for the 21 st century must be selected sequentially, perhaps one decade at a time, all within a common framework. An analogy for the framework would be the post-war General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which gave us 50 years of successful rounds negotiating trade liberalization, even though the original signers did know what specifics would emerge. The paper proposes allocating relative targets across countries by means of a formula that is fairly general at first but that becomes increasingly specific as the decade in question approaches. New joiners would be obligated to adopt emissions targets, but these paths need not immediately fall below their “business as usual” growth path. Allowing new joiners to sell permits in the initial budget period would then provide them with an economic incentive to join, or at least would not penalize them. It would carry economic benefits for both rich and poor countries, while also bringing environmental benefits to all. Countries would be required in subsequent budget periods of their participation to adopt steeper reductions in their emissions targets relative to their “business as usual” paths. The extent of relative cuts across countries would depend on such factors in the formulas as the per capita income and past emission levels of the country in question. The extent of cuts in aggregate global emissions would depend – as is inevitable [...] on how strong is the international political consensus for aggressive action at that point in history. Such a scheme provides the necessary flexibility and incentives to appeal to both industrialized and developing countries. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{wave energy}} industry, {{still in its}} infancy {{compared}} to similar activities offshore, must look to {{the oil and gas industry}} for guide lines on design criteria for survival, safety and operational optimisation for installations at sea. Numerical analysis tools for prediction of the response of floating moored structures have become an important part of the design task for the offshore industry offering a low cost and low risk option compared to scale tank testing. However, rather than having only a task of station keeping and survival, the moorings for a wave energy converters (WECs) would also be required to provide the ability of not adversely affecting the power capture task. The main aim of this work is to gain an understanding and reduce the uncertainties in the numerical modelling of WECs. Experimental work designed and performed under the HydraLab III project of which the author was a member were used to evaluate the response characteristics of a 1 : 20 scale “generic WEC” device with a 3 point mooring system. The investigation was enhanced through further tests implemented by the author at Heriot-Watt wave tank using a single WEC device. The outcomes from these experiments were used to aid in the implementation of the aim identified above. Two numerical model categories were set up to understand the uncertainties apparent to the mooring simulations. The first category included only the calculation of the mooring line response using experimental data to inform the motion of the floating body. The second category included the motion response of the floating body coupling the complex behaviour to the moored system. The mooring tension results for the first category shows an error between the numerical prediction and the experimental results up to 16 times that of the experimental value. This was mainly during slack conditions where the mooring line tension was lower than the pretension in the line at still water. During the higher tension events the average error was 26 %. For the second category it was found that the numerical predictions of the WEC motion response in six degree of freedom (6 DOF) were generally over predicted. The tension predictions for the coupled simulations identified an error of between 1. 4 and 4. 5 %. The work presented here contributed to the understanding of uncertainties in numerical simu- lations for WEC mooring designs. The disparity between the simulation and experimental results re-enforced the requirement for a better understanding of highly dynamic responding moored cou- pled systems. From this work it is clear that the numerical models used to approximate the response of moored WECs could provide <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>first</b> design <b>step.</b> Whilst this work contributed to the understanding of uncertainties and consequently reduced some of these, further work is rec- ommended in chapter 6 to investigate the definition of some of the mechanical and hydrodynamic properties of the mooring line. It is also suggested that external functions should be included 2 that would allow to model the coupled effect of Power-Take-Off (PTO) system. It is intended to conduct future work deriving a fully dynamic mooring simulation including the effects of PTO. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the consequences of corruption {{for the duration of}} political regimes during the time period 1984 - 2008. I derive hypotheses following the extension of the ``selectorate theory'' (Bueno de Mesquita et. al., 2003, chap. 8) developed to investigate the situations causing threats to the institutional framework (the political regime). The welfare of societal groups and institutional preferences in light of private and public goods allocation are the main determinants of regime stability. Corruption is one of several factors that affect the welfare of societal groups through the allocation of private <b>goods.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>step,</b> a series of logistic regression models evaluate the relationship between corruption, political regimes and events linked to political instability and civil unrest. Corruption increases the likelihood of experiencing coup attempts, government crisis, revolution attempt, and demonstrations in the period 1984 - 2008. In relation to the main analyses, these events are intervening factors that under certain circumstances may lead to a change in the political regime of a country. Therefore, I test how the duration of political regimes are affected by corruption conditioned on political regimes. The main results extend ``Model 2 1900 - 2000 '' in Gates et. al. (2006, p. 901), which find that institutionally consistent regimes (democracies and autocracies) endure longer than inconsistent regimes, by including an interaction term between corruption and political regimes. I hypothesize that corruption decreases the stability of democracies and increase the stability of autocracies, and thereby evaluate further the implications of de facto political power (defined as the sum of factors affecting the distribution of resources) on the duration of political regimes. The main findings of this thesis, using survival analysis, suggest that corruption only affects the duration of democracies. This finding is consistent across model specifications and alternative operationalizations of political regimes, but there is a high degree of uncertainty linked to the estimates. Democracies are more durable, {{in the sense that they}} have a lower probability of regime change when corruption is low. An increase in corruption decreases the survival ratio of democratic regimes. The level of corruption does not affect the duration of autocratic regimes, nor are autocratic regimes more stable than inconsistent regimes in the period 1984 to 2008...|$|R
