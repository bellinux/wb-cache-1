According to Andy Greenwald, there are few women in emo bands and they have little {{influence}} on lyrical content: [...] "Though emo—and to a certain degree, punk—has always been a typically male province, the monotony of the labels' gender perspective can be overwhelming." [...] Emo's popularity and its [...] "lonely boy's aesthetic" [...] have led to a litany of one-sided songs in which men vent their fury <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> who have wronged them. Some emo bands' lyrics disguise violent anti-women sentiments with a pop-music veneer.|$|E

2500|$|Since 1988, {{the group}} has faced a legal battle for {{recognition}} {{of their right to}} pray at the Western Wall. Their presence is deemed offensive by Orthodox worshippers at the site and there have been numerous court proceedings to settle the issue. On the Fast of Esther 1989, ultra-Orthodox men, outraged by the women's singing, hurled chairs and verbal insults <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> which resulted in the deployment of tear gas to quell the violence. In 2010, police arrested two Haredi men at the Western Wall plaza on suspicion that they threw chairs at a Women of the Wall group that was praying aloud at the site. [...] In 2009, the first woman was arrested for praying with a tallit. The struggle by the Women of the Wall is seen by the Israeli Orthodox religious establishment as an attempt to undermine their influence in an effort to introduce religious pluralism.|$|E
