Prices for {{renewable energy}} technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on a robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.|$|E

25|$|Better {{dental health}} overall coupled with {{increased}} demand for more modern alternatives such as resin composite fillings (which match the tooth color), as well as public concern about the mercury content of dental amalgam, {{have resulted in a}} steady decline in dental amalgam use in developed countries, though overall amalgam use continues to rise worldwide. Given its superior strength, durability, and long life relative to the more expensive composite fillings, it will likely be used for many years to come. Over a lifetime, dietary sources of mercury <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> would ever be received from the presence of amalgam fillings in the mouth. For example, due to pollution of the world's oceans with heavy metals, products such as cod liver oil may contain significant levels of mercury.|$|E

25|$|Following the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, {{there have}} emerged {{allegations}} {{that after the}} outbreak of the Somali Civil War in late 1991, Somalia's long, remote shoreline was used as a dump site for the disposal of toxic waste. The huge waves which battered northern Somalia after the tsunami are believed to have stirred up tonnes of nuclear and toxic waste that was illegally dumped in Somali waters by several European firms – front companies created by the Italian mafia. The European Green Party followed up these revelations by presenting before the press and the European Parliament in Strasbourg copies of contracts signed by two European companies—the Italian Swiss firm, Achair Partners, and an Italian waste broker, Progresso—and representatives of the warlords then in power, to accept 10 million tonnes of toxic waste in exchange for $80 million (then about £60 million). According to a report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) assessment mission, there <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> normal cases of respiratory infections, mouth ulcers and bleeding, abdominal hemorrhages and unusual skin infections among many inhabitants of the areas around the northeastern towns of Hobbio and Benadir on the Indian Ocean coast—diseases consistent with radiation sickness. UNEP continues that the current situation along the Somali coastline poses a very serious environmental hazard not only in Somalia but also in the eastern Africa sub-region.|$|E
500|$|Sediments within large urban-industrial {{estuaries}} act as {{an important}} sink for point source and diffuse mercury pollution within catchments. A 2015 study of foreshore sediments from the Thames estuary measured total mercury at 0.01 to 12.07mg/kg with mean of 2.10mg/kg and median of 0.85mg/kg (n=351). The highest mercury concentrations [...] were shown to occur {{in and around the}} city of London in association with fine grain muds and high total organic carbon content. The strong affinity of mercury for carbon rich sediments has also been observed in salt marsh sediments of the River Mersey mean of 2mg/kg up to 5mg/kg. These concentrations <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those shown in salt marsh river creek sediments of New Jersey and mangroves of Southern China which exhibit low mercury concentrations of about 0.2mg/kg.|$|E

2500|$|Air {{pollution}} {{costs the}} world economy $5 trillion per year {{as a result of}} productivity losses and degraded quality of life, according to a joint study by the World Bank and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington These productivity losses are caused by deaths due to diseases caused by air pollution. One out of ten deaths in 2013 was caused by diseases associated with air pollution and the problem is getting worse. The problem is even more acute in the developing world. [...] "Children under age 5 in lower-income countries are more than 60 times as likely to die from exposure to air pollution as children in high-income countries." [...] The report states that additional economic losses caused by air pollution, including health costs and the adverse effect on agricultural and other productivity were not calculated in the report, and thus the actual costs to {{the world economy}} <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> $5 trillion.|$|E
2500|$|Lomborg's most {{contentious}} assertion, however, involves global warming. From the outset, Lomborg [...] "accepts {{the reality of}} man-made global warming" [...] though he refers {{to a number of}} uncertainties in the computer simulations of climate change and some aspects of data collection. [...] His main contention involves not the science of global warming but the politics and the policy response to scientific findings. Lomborg points out that, given the amount of greenhouse gas reduction required to combat global warming, the current Kyoto protocol is grossly insufficient. He argues that the economic costs of legislative restrictions that aim to slow or reverse global warming <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the alternative of international coordination. Moreover, he asserts that the cost of combating global warming would be disproportionately shouldered by [...] developing countries. Lomborg proposes that since the Kyoto agreement limits economic activities, developing countries that suffer from pollution and poverty most, will be perpetually handicapped economically.|$|E
