Most monoplace chambers can be fitted with a demand breathing system for <b>air</b> <b>breaks.</b> In low pressure soft chambers, treatment schedules may not require <b>air</b> <b>breaks,</b> because the risk of oxygen toxicity is low due to the lower oxygen partial pressures used (usually 1.3 ATA), and short duration of treatment.|$|R

A 10 min <b>air</b> <b>break</b> at 90 min into a 120 min PB that includes initial dual-cycle ergometry for 10 min will show a measurable increase in the risk of DCS and VGE after ascent to 4. 3 psia compared to a 10 min break at 15 min into the PB, or when there is no break in PB. Data collection with humans begins in 2005, but here we first evaluate the hypothesis using three models of tissue N 2 kinetics: Model I is a simple single half-time compartment exponential model, Model II is a three compartment half-time exponential model, and Model III is a variable half-time compartment model where the percentage of maximum O 2 consumption for the subject during dual-cycle ergometry exercise defines the half-time compartment. Model I with large rate constants to simulate an exercise effect always showed a late break in PB had the greatest consequence. Model II showed an early break had the greatest consequence. Model III showed {{there was no difference between}} early or late break in exercise PB. Only one of these outcomes will be observed when humans are tested. Our results will favor one of these models, and so advance our understanding of tissue N 2 kinetics, and of altitude DCS after an <b>air</b> <b>break</b> in PB...|$|E

40|$|Data from Brooks City-Base {{show the}} {{decompression}} sickness (DCS) and venous gas emboli (VGE) consequences of air breaks in a resting 100 % O 2 prebreathe (PB) {{prior to a}} hypobaric exposure. METHODS: DCS and VGE survival times from 95 controls for a 60 min PB prior to 2 -hr or 4 -hr exposures to 4. 37 psia are statistically compared to 3 break in PB conditions: a 10 min (n= 40), 20 min (n= 40), or 60 min break (n= 32) 30 min into the PB followed by 30 min of PB. Ascent rate was 1, 524 meters / min and all exposures included light exercise and 4 min of VGE monitoring of heart chambers at 16 min intervals. DCS survival time for combined control and air breaks were described with an accelerated log logistic model where exponential N 2 washin during <b>air</b> <b>break</b> was described with a 10 min half-time and washout during PB with a 60 min half-time. RESULTS: There {{was no difference in}} VGE or DCS survival times among 3 different air breaks, or when air breaks were compared to control VGE times. However, 10, 20, and 60 min air breaks had significantly earlier survival times compared to control DCS times, certainly early in the exposures. CONCLUSION: Air breaks of 10, 20, and 60 min after 30 min of a 60 min PB reduced DCS survival time. The survival model combined discrete comparisons into a global description mechanistically linked to asymmetrical N 2 washin and washout kinetics based on inspired pN 2. Our unvalidated regression is used to compute additional PB time needed to compensate for an <b>air</b> <b>break</b> in PB within the range of tested conditions...|$|E

40|$|Actual tissue {{nitrogen}} (N 2) kinetics are complex; the uptake and elimination {{is often}} approximated {{with a single}} half-time compartment in statistical descriptions of denitrogenation [prebreathe (PB) ] protocols. Air breaks during PB complicate N 2 kinetics. A comparison of symmetrical versus asymmetrical N 2 kinetics was performed using the time to onset of hypobaric decompression sickness (DCS) as a surrogate for actual venous N 2 tension. Published results of 12 tests involving 179 hypobaric exposures in altitude chambers after PB, with and without air breaks, provide the complex protocols from which to model N 2 kinetics. DCS survival time for combined control and air breaks were described with an accelerated log logistic model where N 2 uptake and elimination before, during, and after the <b>air</b> <b>break</b> was computed with a simple exponential function or a function that changed half-time depending on ambient N 2 partial pressure. P 1 N 2 -P 2 = delta P defined DCS dose for each altitude exposure, where P 2 was the test altitude and P 1 N 2 was computed N 2 pressure {{at the beginning of}} the altitude exposure. The log likelihood (LL) without DCS dose (null model) was - 155. 6, and improved (best-fit) to - 97. 2 when dose was defined with a 240 min half-time for both N 2 elimination and uptake during the PB. The description of DCS survival time was less precise with asymmetrical N 2 kinetics, for example, LL was - 98. 9 with 240 min half-time elimination and 120 min half-time uptake. The statistical regression described survival time mechanistically linked to symmetrical N 2 kinetics during PBs that also included air breaks. The results are data-specific, and additional data may change the conclusion. The regression is useful to compute additional PB time to compensate for an <b>air</b> <b>break</b> in PB within the narrow range of tested conditions...|$|E

40|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that the initial treatment of freezing cold injury (FCI) should be rapid rewarming to prevent direct injury from intracellular ice formation and protein denaturation, there is less conformity in the clinical intervention after rewarming. Medical treatment is directed towards the prevention of additional injury due to microvascular damage. With the exception of freezing cold injury, hyperbaric oxygen therapy is now accepted as an adjunct therapy {{for the management of}} all other acute traumatic peripheral ischaemias, such as crush injuries, compartment syndrome, thermal burns, compromised skin grafts and flaps, and threatened replantations.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the result of}} pilot project that creates an intelligent outage management System which accurately locates faults in real-time and send fault details to the relevant maintenance crew. Several measures of reliability indices have been developed by the electric utility industry to measure system performance. The reliability of supply is governed by the frequency and the duration of interruptions to supply {{and the number of}} customers affected by interruption. An Outage Management System (OMS) will certainly help utilities identify and restore outages sooner and more efficiently. A fault affected zone in the distribution network can be isolated from the healthy part of the network by disconnecting the affected sector using <b>Air</b> <b>Break</b> Switches, Drift down Lift Off switches, (D. D. L. O) or Autoreclosers. That equipment can be used to optimize the restoring process by isolating smallest possible section of the network affected by fault. Without confining merely to an Outage Management System (OMS), this can be further developed to a supervisory control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA) that facilitate distribution automation function with communications, help to strengthen existing distribution systems and provide a strong foundation for building a fully implemented feeder scheme. But presently Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) which is the national utility responsible for the major portion of distribution of electrical power in Sri Lanka is not taking maximum usage of automation facility of currently available equipment. There is no proper coordination between automated equipment. Also proper automatic reporting and recording system is not available. As a result of this, expected level of reliability improvement couldn't be achieved. Hence the automatic outage program can be used to overcome above shortage. Main objective of the project is to develop automatic outage reporting and controlling system for the North Western Province Branch of CEB, integrating all switching facilities like Auto recloses, GSM fault indicators, Non GSM fault indicators and Load break switch to improve distribution network reliability. The proposed outage management system has modern features such as Data acquisitioning from GSM fault indicators, storing the data for future analysis, indicating the fault location in network diagram, Generating the massage automatically and sending to nearest crew, and Capable of handling data base files. Since North Western Province has very complicated electrical network, Thulhiriya - Kuliyapitiy feeder which has large number of transformers and having long length is selected as pilot project considering distribution indices such as System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) using past outage data of year 2008 and 2009. Based on SynerGEE software reliability data, the locations to install new GSM type fault indicators, Non GSM type fault indicators were identified. So 10 number of GSM type fault indicators, 20 number of Non GSM type fault indicators, 08 number of DDLOs, were installed. The outage management system was developed using Visual Basic 6 for usage of at the Distribution Control Centre. Then program was installed in the control centre and executed for six months. Then the reported break down was compared with break down history of the feeder and Financial Feasibility Analysis was done. It was observed that the initial investment is paid back within first four years which indicates the implement of the Outage Management system is financially feasible. Also the significant improvement of reliability could be observed...|$|E
