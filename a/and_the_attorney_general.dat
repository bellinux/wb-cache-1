5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, followed in order of succession by the Secretary of State <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General.</b> Prior to the current constitution, {{the duties of the}} office would devolve upon the lieutenant governor, without that person actually becoming governor. The term begins at noon on January 1 of the year following the election. Prior to the 1963 constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected through separate votes, allowing them to be from different parties. In 1963, this was changed, so that votes are cast jointly for a governor and lieutenant governor of the same party.|$|E
5|$|No country {{recognised}} the Rhodesian republic. The RF was decisively {{returned to}} power in the first election held as a republic, on 10 April 1970, winning all 50 white seats. Hopes for an Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement were boosted two months later when the Conservatives won a surprise election victory in the UK. Edward Heath took over as Prime Minister while Douglas-Home became Foreign Secretary. Talks between Douglas-Home and Smith began with a lengthy meeting in Salisbury in April 1971 and continued until a tentative understanding was reached in early November. A UK delegation headed by Douglas-Home <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> Sir Peter Rawlinson flew to Salisbury on 15 November for negotiations over a new constitution, and after six days of discussion an accord was signed on 21 November 1971.|$|E

25|$|Miller's {{experience}} with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s he became {{very interested in the}} highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case, in which Gibbons' son Peter Reilly was convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence. City Confidential, an A Network series, produced an episode about the murder, postulating that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-ins with the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> who had initially prosecuted the case.|$|E
25|$|In 1892 the Council {{considered}} further {{reform of}} the court system to deal with growing backlogs in the Chancery Division {{and the cost of}} appeals to the House of Lords. They recommended the establishment of a Commercial Court, the creation of a Court of Criminal Appeal to take over from the Court for Crown Cases Reserved, a better division of work between the Chancery Division and Queen's Bench Division, an additional judge for the Chancery Division <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> of England and Wales to be given power to appeal against overly lenient sentencing, all of which were eventually put into practice. After this the council met irregularly; only twice between 1900 and 1907. There was a ten-year gap between meetings in 1940 and 1950 respectively, and little was done. The original Judges' Council was eventually indirectly dissolved in 1981, with the Supreme Court Act 1981, which unlike previous Acts of Parliament contained no provisions allowing for the Council's continued existence. Denis Dobson, Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, suggested this was because other bodies now existed to do what the Council had been created to achieve.|$|E

500|$|Somerset {{returned}} to Britain in late September to attend horse sales at Newmarket but suddenly left for Dieppe on 26 September, probably after {{being told by}} Newton {{that he was in}} danger of being arrested. He returned again on 30 September. A few days later, his grandmother, Emily Somerset, Dowager Duchess of Beaufort, died and he attended her funeral. The Hon. Hamilton Cuffe, Assistant Treasury Solicitor, and James Monro, Commissioner of Police, pressed for action to be taken against Somerset, but the Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury, blocked any prosecution. Rumours of Somerset's involvement were circulating, and on 19 October Somerset fled back to France. Lord Salisbury was later accused of warning Somerset through Sir Dighton Probyn, who had met Lord Salisbury the evening before, that a warrant for his arrest was imminent. This was denied by Lord Salisbury <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General,</b> Sir Richard Webster. Probyn's informant may have been the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Richard Pearson. The Prince of Wales wrote to Lord Salisbury, expressing satisfaction that Somerset had been allowed to leave the country and asking that if Somerset should [...] "ever dare to show his face in England again", he would remain unmolested by the authorities, but Lord Salisbury was also being pressured by the police to prosecute Somerset. On 12 November, a warrant for Somerset's arrest was finally issued. By this time, Somerset was already safely abroad, and the warrant caught little public attention. After an unsuccessful search for employment in Turkey and Austria-Hungary, Somerset lived {{the rest of his life}} in self-imposed and comfortable exile in the south of France. Other names mentioned by the press were Lord Ronald Gower and Lord Errol. Also implicated was the prominent social figure Alexander Meyrick Broadley, who fled abroad for four years. The Paris Figaro even alleged that Broadley took General Georges Boulanger and Henri Rochefort to the house. The allegation against Boulanger was later challenged by his supporters. In December 1889 it was reported that both the Prince and Princess of Wales were being [...] "daily assailed with anonymous letters of the most outrageous character" [...] bearing upon the scandal. By January 1890 sixty suspects had been identified, twenty-two of whom had fled the country.|$|E
