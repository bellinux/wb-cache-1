500|$|Four Swords Adventures also {{received}} criticism. Game Revolution {{said about the}} game, [...] "Graphically, Four Swords Adventures is an odd mix of cheap 2D SNES sprites and nice Gamecube particle effects. It looks <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> GBA game, but now wears fancier pants and shows off upgraded visual flourishes, like Wind Waker style curly-Q air poofs. Still, much of the technology has clearly been ported over from the GBA, creating an inconsistent feel." [...] They also criticized the requirement of the link cable, saying that [...] "the required use of the GBA for multiplayer does limit the play potential." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You Can't Stop the Beat" [...] {{was called}} a [...] "perfect ending to a perfect season premiere" [...] by Mullins. Futterman {{described}} it as a [...] "standard Glee episode finale, full of inspiration and importance for the future, and catchy as all hell." [...] Slezak enjoyed Rachel's slow opening verse, said the full performance [...] "felt <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> shiny, happy Glee of yore" [...] and gave it an [...] "A–" [...] as did Benigno, who also found it a typical final number but was less enthused by the familiarity. Votta's only disappointment with the rendition was that the televised version did not include the [...] "adorable duet" [...] between Kurt and Artie that is present on the single.|$|E
500|$|The {{technological}} advances {{incorporated into the}} Harrier II, compared with the original Harrier, significantly reduce the workload on the pilot. The supercritical wing, hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) control principle, and increased engineered [...] stability make the aircraft fundamentally easier to fly. Ed Harper, general manager for the McDonnell Douglas Harrier II development program, summarized: [...] "The AV-8B looks <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> original Harrier and it uses the same operating fundamentals. It just uses them a lot better". A large cathode-ray tube multi-purpose display, taken from the F/A-18, makes up much of the instrument panel in the cockpit. It has {{a wide range of}} functions, including radar warning information and weapon delivery checklist. The pilots sit on UPC/Stencel 10B zero-zero ejection seats, meaning that they are able to eject from a stationary aircraft at zero altitude.|$|E

500|$|The {{broadcast}} {{included a}} new tongue-in-cheek opening. The scene {{begins in the}} Simpsons' living room where the family is watching Bush's speech.

500|$|... "Bullfrog" [...] was {{the name}} Frank [...] "Shorty" [...] Harris and Ernest [...] "Ed" [...] Cross, the prospectors who started the Bullfrog gold rush, gave to their mine. As quoted by Robert D. McCracken in A History of Beatty, Nevada, Harris said during a 1930 {{interview}} for Westways magazine, [...] "The rock was green, almost like turquoise, spotted with big chunks of yellow metal, and looked <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> back of a frog." [...] The Bullfrog Mining District, the Bullfrog Hills, the town of Bullfrog, and other geographical entities in the region took their name from the Bullfrog Mine. [...] "Bullfrog" [...] became so popular that Giant Bullfrog, Bullfrog Merger, Bullfrog Apex, Bullfrog Annex, Bullfrog Gold Dollar, Bullfrog Mogul, {{and most of the}} district's other 200 or so mining companies included [...] "Bullfrog" [...] in their names. [...] The name persisted and, decades later, was given to the short-lived Bullfrog County.|$|E
500|$|Rowell {{refused to}} give General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) in Brisbane a [...] "ball to ball" [...] {{description}} of the action, sending only factual information at stated times. Failure to keep GHQ up to date could only lead to fears of the worst, which were confirmed when Major General George Kenney reported that in his opinion Port Moresby would soon fall unless something drastic was done, and Rowell was [...] "defeatist". On 17 September, the General MacArthur discussed the situation in New Guinea with Prime Minister John Curtin on the secraphone. He pointed out that while the Japanese faced all the same difficulties as the Australian troops fighting on the Kokoda Track, the Japanese were advancing and the Australians were retreating, and the whole situation seemed to MacArthur to be <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Malaya. He recommended that General Blamey be sent up to New Guinea to take personal command of the situation.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} met with largely {{positive}} reviews. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote positively of the episode and awarded it an [...] "A" [...] grade. He noted the entries' similarities with [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", noting that both deal with men [...] "who [...] too much about death for [...] own good". He also praised the characterization of Scully and Fellig; {{he noted that the}} former is [...] "no-nonsense" [...] and optimistic, whereas the latter is a [...] "creepy man" [...] who is jealous of those who are capable of dying. Handlen concluded that the episode [...] "doesn’t play out like a classic monster episode, it feels like one". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, comparing it favorably to [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose". He wrote, [...] "If imitation is the highest form of flattery, what is a fascinating offshoot of a previous incarnation? I'd say it looks <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> latest entry into Season 6 of The X-Files. The engaging 'Tithonus'." ...|$|E

[...] io9 writer Charlie Jane Anders comments, however, that [...] "as people have had a bit more time to consider the new series, more thoughtful discussions have arisen." [...] One such cited notes that {{it is unlikely that}} Children of Earth was intentionally homophobic since the writer (Davies) and lead actor (John Barrowman) are both openly gay. The same reviewer notes that however, [...] "especially when viewed on its own, Children of Earth looks <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> same heteronormative, homophobic, biphobic and gratuitous tropes that appear in so many bad representations of [...]" [...] In response to the accusations of [...] "de-gaying" [...] Torchwood, Davies advised those people do some research into his career (creator of Queer as Folk) and [...] "stop riding on a bandwagon that they actually don't know anything about".

2500|$|Dassault's {{resulting}} prototype, dubbed Mirage IV 01, looked <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Mirage IIIA, {{even though}} it had double the wing surface, two engines instead of one, and twice the unladen weight. The Mirage IV also carried three times more internal fuel than the Mirage III. The aircraft's aerodynamic features were very similar to the III's but required an entirely new structure and layout. This prototype was [...] long, had a [...] wingspan, [...] of wing area, and weighed approximately [...] It was considerably more advanced than the Mirage III, incorporating new features such as machined and chem-milled planks, tapered sheets, a small amount of titanium, and integral fuel tanks in many locations including the leading portion of the tailfin.|$|E
2500|$|The New Zealand Herald {{gave the}} record four stars out of five, stating that [...] "aside from disconcerting lyrics {{throughout}} which are droll and sometimes sharply witty – there are blasts {{of their more}} recent musical menace here too: 'Two Minutes' is mad but disciplined guitar thrash; 'Moreover' and 'Smash' are crafted Erasehead-grind metallic pop; the brooding 'Down to This' rides on electrostatic and repeated guitar and keyboard phrases. Smart, sharp, approachable and economic, Wire again give art-rock a very good name." [...] The Kansas City Star commented, [...] "virtually all aspects of Wire's varied history are covered, creating a stylistic best-of composed of new material. It may be the band's best work since 1979's 154. [...] If influence were sufficient currency to buy one's way into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Wire would be a contender. You can count bands as diverse as R.E.M., Guided By Voices, the Manic Street Preachers, Minor Threat and the Cure as among those who confess a fondness for Wire that extends to inspiration. Red Barked Tree demonstrates that Wire can be a sustained influence; it's a most worthy addition to the band's estimable catalog." [...] The Independent gave the album a 4-star rating, stated that [...] "on this showing, the feral rage of [...] punk youth has matured into a pleasingly poised disaffection, with no loss of acuity," [...] while The Guardian, reviewing a live performance, concluded that Red Barked Tree sees Wire [...] "operating at full strength. Theirs are succinct and eloquent songs; in a long career Wire continue to deal in short, sharp shocks." [...] The review by Tim Klingbiel on Australian music website FasterLouder noted that [...] "From seething political references to prophetic statements about the environment, Red Barked Tree deals {{with a range of}} subjects in a magnificently compelling and thought provoking way", and that the record [...] "serves as an indication that Wire have returned to form in a massive way, and remain just as relevant today as they were 35 years ago". By contrast, longtime music critic Robert Christgau remarked in a two-star review, [...] "Even formalists get the grays – well, especially formalists." [...] AllMusic reviewer [...] "j. poet" [...] considered the album [...] "another strong effort" [...] but commented, [...] "While Wire is still making music that shatters expectations, after 30 years they're sounding <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> mainstream rockers they once despised." [...] Mojo placed the album at number 48 on its list of the [...] "Top 50 Albums of 2011". Classic Rock reviewer John Doran awarded the album 8 points out of 10 and defined it [...] "yet another post-80s success of Wire." ...|$|E
