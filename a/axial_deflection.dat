As the nut is threaded on, the displaced sections are elastically forced back axially to their original position, the load increasing the friction between the nut and the fastener, creating the locking action. These nuts retain their locking action at temperatures limited only by the base material, as no polymeric insert is used, and as the locking action is by elastic deformation, they can be re-used multiple times. They may look similar, but differ substantially from the split beam nut because the former has a radial displacement of the deformed portion, while the Philidas nut uses <b>axial</b> <b>deflection</b> or depitching.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} a novel phased array transducer design rule for therapeutic focused ultrasound applications. This design rule uses the discretized Fermat's spiral to determine the positioning of the transducer elements for a given number of elements and f-number. Using this principle, three variations of Fermat's spiral were generated, aimed at 1) grating lobe minimization, 2) side lobe minimization, and 3) an optimized element packing efficiency. For each spiral, sparse layouts using identical circular elements and fully populated layouts based on additional Voronoi tessellation were evaluated numerically. Evaluation criteria included the element size distribution, beam steering capabilities, focal plane pressure distribution, prefocal pressure distribution, and practical considerations. Finally, one Voronoi-tessellated design with a focal length and aperture diameter of 16 cm and a natural frequency of 1. 3 MHz was evaluated experimentally through hydrophone measurements. The numerical evaluation showed that while sparse arrays possess superior beam steering capabilities for a given number of elements, the focal point quality and prefocal pressure distribution is substantially more favorable when using the Voronoi-tessellated designs. Beam steering was shown to be feasible with the tessellated designs for lateral deflections up to 10 mm and <b>axial</b> <b>deflections</b> up to 20 mm.

Several idealizations regarding brush seal configuration, flow conditions, and elastic behavior are made in the analysis in order to determine closed form parametric dependence. This formulation assumes that there is no initial interference between the bristle tip and the rotor. Also, interbristle, bristle-backing plate, and bristle-rotor friction is neglected. The bristle bundle or the brush seal as it is alternately called is assumed homogeneous and isotropic on a macroscopic scale so that a physical property like permeability is uniform. The fluid is assumed to be homogeneous, incompressible, viscous, and flowing under steady conditions. A schematic of a brush seal is shown. If the nominal bristle-shaft interference is absent then under static conditions the bristles may deflect axially due to the imposed pressure differential.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aeroelastic}} {{stability of}} flap bending, lead-lag bending and torsion of hingeless and bearingless rotor blades in forward flight is examined, using a finite element formulation based on Hamilton's principle. The hingeless blade is idealized as an elastic beam, and is discretized into beam elements. Each beam element consists of fifteen nodal degrees of freedom. Between the elements {{there is a}} continuity of displacement and slope for lag and flap bending, and a continuity of displacement for twist and <b>axial</b> <b>deflection.</b> For a bearingless rotor blade the flexbeam, the torque tube and the main blade are assumed as elastic beams, and these are discretized into beam elements. Quasisteady strip theory is {{used to evaluate the}} aerodynamic forces, and the unsteady aerodynamic effects are introduced approximately through a dynamic wake induced inflow modelling. The natural vibration characteristics of a rotating blade are calculated from the finite element equations. The blade finite element response equations are transformed to the model space {{in the form of a}} few normal mode equations. These nonlinear response equations containing periodic terms are solved iteratively using Floquet theory. The periodic perturbation equations linearized about the nonlinear response position are solved for stability using Floquet transition matrix theory as well as constant coefficient approximation in the fixed reference frame. Results are presented for both stiff-inplane and soft-inplane blade configurations. Stability results are also obtained for a bearingless blade configuration consisting of single flexbeam with a wrap-around type torque tube and the pitch links located, one on the leading edge and the other on the trailing edge of the torque tube.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the nonlinear analysis, design, fabrication, {{and testing of}} an axial-gap magnetic induction micro machine, which is a two-phase planar motor in which the rotor is suspended above the stator via mechanical springs, or tethers. The micro motor is fabricated from thick layers of electroplated NiFe and copper, by our collaborators at Georgia Institute of Technology. The rotor and the stator cores are 4 mm in diameter each, and the entire motor is about 2 mm thick. During fabrication, SU- 8 epoxy {{is used as a}} structural mold material for the electroplated cores. The tethers are designed to be compliant in the azimuthal direction, while preventing <b>axial</b> <b>deflections</b> and maintaining a constant air gap. This enables accurate measurements of deflections within the rotor plane via a computer microvision system. The small scale of the magnetic induction micro machine, in conjunction with the good thermal contact between its electroplated stator layers, ensures an isothermal device which can be cooled very effectively. Current densities over 109 A/m 2 simultaneously through each phase is repeatedly achieved during experiments; this density is over two orders of magnitude larger than what can be achieved in conventional macro-scale machines. (cont.) More than 5 Nm of torque is obtained for an air gap of about 5 zm, making this micro motor the highest torque density micro-scale magnetic machine to date. About 0. 3 buNm for the large air gap of 70 m is also achieved in systematic tests that reveal the influence of strong eddy-currents and associated nonlinear saturation within the micro motor Eddy-current effects are modeled using a finite-difference vector potential formulation. Its results demonstrate the presence of flux crowding on the stator surface, which leads to heavy saturation. To capture saturation effects, a fully nonlinear finite-difference time-domain simulation is developed to solve Maxwell's Equations within the computational space of the micro machine. To mitigate the inherent stiffness in the partial differential equations, the speed of light is artificially reduced by five orders of magnitude, taking special care that assumptions of magnetoquasistatic behavior are still met. The results from this model are in very good agreement with experimental data from the tethered magnetic induction micro motor. by Brian Lee. Thesis (Ph. D.)
