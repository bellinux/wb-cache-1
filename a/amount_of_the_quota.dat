In 2001, <b>the</b> ministry <b>of</b> education {{carried out the}} “Autonomous Recruitment Reform.” This reform allows universities {{the right to decide}} their own admission examination and interview. A certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> admission <b>quotas</b> are distributed via this autonomous recruitment scheme. By 2007, there were 57 universities participating in this reform (Zheng 2008). This reform disfavors rural students in two ways. Firstly, universities are only able to have examination or interview centers in some cities, some rural students {{may not be able to}} afford the transport and hostel fees. More importantly, as the autonomous recruitment reform stresses on all-rounded students and inner qualities, it requires students to have various kinds of knowledge that rural students have difficulties in accumulating (Zheng 2008). For example, interview questions included pop songs and <b>the</b> environment <b>of</b> establishing business in <b>the</b> admission interview <b>of</b> Peking University and the Tsinghua University in 2015 (Beijing News 2015 a, 2015 b).

A formal test {{as to whether the}} Irish dairy-processing sector could be characterised as "virtual" profit maximisers was implemented and could not be rejected. This finding was reinforced by our finding that <b>the</b> elasticity <b>of</b> milk price with respect to <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> milk processed was zero. Milk price was found to be driven mainly by exogenous changes in <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> processed output. <b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> was to obviously reduce <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> processed output but not proportionately. Our results suggest that every 10 % fall in <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> milk processed reduces processed output <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sector by 6 %. We also found a negative relationship between <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> milk raw material processed and the demand for labour implying that <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> would not <b>of</b> itself have adversely affect employment in the sector. co-operative; duality theory; initial profit maximisation; production quotas...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates <b>the</b> {{dependency}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adjustment <b>of</b> prices, exchange rates, {{and production}} on <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trade regime. We contrast the adjustment between a quota and a tariff regime for a 'semi-small' economy characterized by monopolistic competitive market structure and short-run nominal contracts under a floating exchange rate regime. Among other issues {{we focus on}} the factors determining <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> rent and <b>the</b> 'pass- through' <b>of</b> exchange rate adjustment to <b>the</b> domestic prices <b>of</b> importable goods. We demonstrate that the 'pass-through ratio' (measuring <b>the</b> elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic price <b>of</b> importable goods with respect to the exchange rate) is determined by both the commercial policy and by <b>the</b> market power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various producers. It tends to be higher in a tariff regime because <b>the</b> endogenous adjustment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> rent mitigates <b>the</b> 'pass-through'. We also show that <b>the</b> adjustment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exchange rate tends to be larger in <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> regime than in the tariff regime. In the tariff regime we observe a larger switch of domestic demand relative to <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> regime, and a corresponding smaller exchange rate adjustment. In <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> regime we observe adjustment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> rent such as to keep the net domestic demand for foreign goods intact. As a result, <b>the</b> relative price (<b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic good to the foreign good) facing the foreign consumer adjusts more in <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> regime than in the tariff regime. At the same time the relative price facing domestic consumers in <b>the</b> <b>quota</b> regime adjusts by less than in the tariff regime. ...|$|R
