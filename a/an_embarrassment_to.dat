5|$|The scandal proved <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> the {{reputation}} of the Royal Navy, then still the world's largest, and it was satirised at home and abroad through editorials, cartoons, and even a comic jazz oratorio composed by Erwin Schulhoff. One consequence of the damaging affair was an undertaking from the Admiralty to review the means by which naval officers might bring complaints against the conduct of their superiors.|$|E
5|$|After the {{violence}} of November 4, the Indianapolis Merchant's Association and other business leaders petitioned Governor Ralston to call out the Indiana National Guard. Members of both parties accused the union leaders of trying to prevent their voters from reaching the polls. The riots made national news and public leaders began to consider them <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> the state. Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them to escalate the riot and lead to more bloodshed.|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{planned for}} a {{collected}} {{edition of his}} publications as early as 1865; he believed that such an edition would help the world understand his intellectual development and artistic aims. The first such edition was published between 1871 and 1883, but was doctored to suppress or alter articles that were <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> him (e.g. those praising Meyerbeer), or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce Wagner's own account of his progress. Wagner's autobiography Mein Leben was originally published for close friends only {{in a very small}} edition (15–18 copies per volume) in four volumes between 1870 and 1880. The first public edition (with many passages suppressed by Cosima) appeared in 1911; the first attempt at a full edition (in German) appeared in 1963.|$|E

5|$|Cibber and Katherine had 12 {{children}} between 1694 and 1713. Six died in infancy, {{and most of}} the surviving children received short shrift in his will. Catherine, the eldest surviving daughter, married Colonel James Brown and seems to have been the dutiful one who looked after Cibber in old age following his wife's death in 1734. She was duly rewarded at his death with most of his estate. His middle daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, went into business. Anne had a shop that sold fine wares and foods, and married John Boultby. Elizabeth had a restaurant near Gray's Inn, and married firstly Dawson Brett, and secondly (after Brett's death) Joseph Marples. His only son to reach adulthood, Theophilus, became an actor at Drury Lane, and was <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> his father because of his scandalous private life. His other son to survive infancy, James, died in or after 1717 before reaching adulthood. Colley's youngest daughter Charlotte followed in her father's theatrical footsteps, but she fell out with him and her sister Catherine, and she was cut off by the family.|$|E
5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, has become <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All {{of us who}} serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E
5|$|Announcing his Cabinet on 17 December 1962, Field named Smith his Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Treasury. Two days later, RA Butler, the British Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State, {{announced}} that the UK government would allow Nyasaland to leave the Federation. With Northern Rhodesia now also under a secessionist black nationalist government—Kenneth Kaunda and Harry Nkumbula had formed a coalition to keep the UFP out—and Southern Rhodesia under the RF, the Federation was effectively over. The Field Cabinet made Southern Rhodesian independence on Federal dissolution its first priority, but the Conservative government in the UK was reluctant to grant this under the 1961 constitution as it knew doing so would lead to censure and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. Indeed, Southern Rhodesia's minority government had already become something of <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> the UK and it hurt Britain's reputation to even {{maintain the status quo}} there. Granting independence without major constitutional reform would furthermore provoke outcry from the Conservatives' main parliamentary opposition, the Labour Party, which was strongly anti-colonial and supportive of black nationalist ambitions.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the great}} accomplishments of the TFSDA was to smuggle out of the Soviet Union {{documents}} chronicling their persecution, which became <b>an</b> international <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|By 1968, JMWAVE was {{increasingly}} regarded as obsolete. There was also {{concern that the}} station would become <b>a</b> public <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> the University of Miami. Consequently, it was deactivated and replaced with a substantially smaller station at Miami Beach.|$|R
50|$|Robin #38 (March 1997) {{introduced}} Roy Raymond, Jr., {{the grandson}} of the original, who presented a tabloid television series in Gotham City called Roy Raymond: Manstalker. Raymond is portrayed as arrogant, inept, and <b>a</b> huge <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> his grandfather.|$|R
5|$|Chapman played {{infrequently}} in 1936, and the captaincy {{was shared}} {{between him and}} two others. He was reluctant to bat, {{to the extent of}} dropping down the batting order to avoid doing so, and his friends believed that his nerve had gone. At the end of the season, he announced that business commitments forced him to give up the captaincy. Over the following three seasons, Chapman played for Kent in three more matches: against the New Zealand touring side in 1937 and in two Championship games in 1938. He also captained a non-representative England XI in a festival game against the New Zealanders in 1937, batting at number ten in the order and scoring 61. His remaining first-class matches were low-profile games against Oxford and Cambridge Universities; he played 13 games in his final three seasons. In his last first-class game, in 1939, he captained MCC against Oxford, scoring 12 and 0. In all first-class cricket, Chapman scored 16,309 runs in 394 matches at an average of 31.97, and held 356 catches. By the time his career ended, his weight had increased even further, and Lemmon believes that he had become <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> other cricketers. Subsequently, Chapman faded away without much comment.|$|E
5|$|The four spies head to City Hall to warn Mayor West {{about the}} sleeper agent, but they {{discover}} that the mayor is the sleeper agent when Aykroyd inadvertently uses the trigger phrase. During the ensuing fight, Aykroyd plants a homing beacon on Mayor West's leg. West escapes to Russia and the four follow him. They are quickly captured under orders of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who explains that the sleeper agent plan would be <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> their government if revealed to the public. He offers to help them stop West from fulfilling his pre-programmed mission. When the four find West, they see him launch a nuclear missile aimed at the United States before he snaps out of his trance. Mayor West holds himself responsible for America's fate, though Brian comforts him {{with the knowledge that}} West was not in control of his actions, having been brainwashed by the Soviets. Aykroyd realizes that he can hack into the missile's guidance system. This allows him to aim the missile's warhead high above the Earth's atmosphere and harmlessly explode, saving the US. The fuselage, though, crashes into Cleveland's house in Stoolbend, Virginia, while Cleveland was taking a bath, eliciting confusion from his neighbor, Tim the Bear. The episode ends with Brian and Stewie in the family living room as they recount their adventure and repeat the activation phrase, which reveals Meg to be another sleeper agent.|$|E
25|$|The theft on August 22, 1911 of the Mona Lisa {{from the}} Musée du Louvre {{was more of}} <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> Lépine {{although}} initially he acted with his usual decisiveness ordering the museum to be closed for a week whilst forensic analysis was carried out.|$|E
25|$|NASA further {{leveraged}} {{their position}} {{by threatening to}} publicly reveal the heavy involvement of Mr. Kubrick's younger brother, Raul, with the American Communist Party. This would have been <b>an</b> intolerable <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Kubrick, especially since the release of Dr. Strangelove.|$|R
50|$|The Seven Bishops of the Church of England {{were those}} imprisoned and tried for seditious libel {{related to their}} {{opposition}} to the second Declaration of Indulgence, issued by James II in 1688.

25|$|The {{incident}} was <b>a</b> major <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> Soviet air defence because Flight 902 had already entered Soviet territory {{before it was}} intercepted.

25|$|A {{player who}} captures the opponent's king wins the game. In {{practice}} this rarely happens; a player will resign when loss {{is inevitable and}} the king will be taken on the opponent's next move (as in International Chess) because of the tradition that {{it is seen as}} <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> lose.|$|E
25|$|In 1889, {{tensions}} {{were high}} between the U.S. and Canada when the U.S. banned Canadians {{from engaging in}} the seal hunt in the Bering Sea {{as part of the}} ongoing Bering Sea Dispute between the U.S. and Britain. Tupper traveled to Washington, D.C. to represent Canadian interests during the negotiations and was something of <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> the British diplomats.|$|E
25|$|A {{player who}} captures the opponent's king (or emperor, {{which is a}} {{promoted}} king) or prince (when the other is already gone) wins the game.

40|$|Giffen goods {{have long}} been <b>a</b> minor <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> courses in microeconomic theory.

Giffen goods, demand theory, general equilibrium theory...|$|R

60|$|The king {{took the}} {{hand with a}} poorly {{disguised}} reluctance, and {{let go of it}} as willingly as a lady lets go of a fish; all of which had a good effect, for it was mistaken for <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> natural <b>to</b> one who was being called upon by greatness.|$|R
25|$|The Betancourt {{incident}} inflamed {{world opinion}} against Trujillo. Outraged OAS members {{voted unanimously to}} sever diplomatic relations with his government and impose economic sanctions on the Dominican Republic. The brutal murder on Friday, 25 November 1960, of the three Mirabal sisters, Patria, María Teresa and Minerva, who opposed Trujillo's dictatorship, further increased discontent with his repressive rule. The dictator had become <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> the United States, and relations became especially strained after the Betancourt incident.|$|E
25|$|You are {{not part}} of the {{community}} of Israel... You {{are not part}} of the national democratic camp which we all belong to in this house, and many of the people despise you. You are not partners in the Zionist enterprise. You are a foreign implant. You are an errant weed. Sensible Judaism spits you out. You placed yourself outside the wall of Jewish law... We say to this horrible man and those like him: you are a shame on Zionism and <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> Judaism.|$|E
25|$|Although {{corruption}} {{was hardly}} {{unknown in the}} Soviet Union, it became so widespread and blatant in Georgia that {{it came to be}} <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> the authorities in Moscow. Eduard Shevardnadze, the country's interior minister between 1964 and 1972, gained a reputation as a fighter of corruption and engineered the removal of Vasil Mzhavanadze, the corrupt First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party. Shevardnadze ascended to the post of First Secretary with the blessings of Moscow. He was an effective and able ruler of Georgia from 1972 to 1985, improving the official economy and dismissing hundreds of corrupt officials.|$|E
25|$|The failed Ethiopian {{campaign}} was <b>an</b> international <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> Italy, whose citizens had {{grown used to}} earlier colonial victories at Assab and Massawa. Ethiopia would remain independent from Italy and other colonial powers until it was occupied in 1936 but then subsequently liberated four years later in World War II.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hebblethwaite was {{undoubtedly}} annoyed. He found himself regretting {{more than ever}} the good nature which had prompted him to give this visitor an audience at a most unusual hour. He had been forced into the uncomfortable position of listening to statements the knowledge of which was <b>a</b> serious <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} shot on {{location}} in Libya, before the North African Campaign turned decisively against Italy and its Allies. Fellini may have directed some of the Libyan scenes after Gino Talamo was injured in a car accident. The film was ultimately never released due to the defeats suffered in Libya, which meant its plot was now <b>a</b> potential <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> the regime.|$|R
25|$|Bonatti was in {{the best}} {{physical}} condition of all the climbers and the natural choice to make the summit attempt, but Ardito Desio selected Lacedelli and Compagnoni. Had Bonatti joined the summit team he would likely not have used supplemental oxygen. Therefore, Lacedelli and Compagnoni's oxygen-assisted climb could have been eclipsed. Although the Bonatti-Mehdi forced bivouac was not anticipated, Compagnoni intended to discourage Bonatti from reaching the tent and participating in the final summit climb. In the morning of 31 July, after Bonatti and Mehdi had already begun their descent to the safety of Camp VIII, Compagnoni and Lacedelli retrieved the oxygen cylinders left at the bivouac site and reached the summit of K2 at 6.10pm. Ardito Desio, in his final report, mentioned the forced bivouac only in passing. Mehdi's frostbite was <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> the expedition. The Italian government provided Mehdi with a small pension for his contribution and sacrifice on the first ascent of K2. This is disputed by Mehdi's son.|$|E
25|$|In rural Amhara in 2003/04, {{there were}} strong social and {{cultural}} pressures for girls to marry before they were 14 years old. Virginity before marriage was highly valued and an unmarried girl over 14 year was stigmatized. She was <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> herself and her family and regarded as a financial burden since her contribution to domestic and agricultural activities was not valued. The age of first marriage had been declining since the mothers' average age of marriage was 11 years while their daughters' average age of marriage was 8 years. Early marriage allowed formation of bonds between families and, when families were land rich, it maintained their land holdings. Sons from land poor families, who had {{reached the age of}} 18, could obtain land from the peasants association if they married. There was no need for brides to be 18 and they were often under 11 years old. Boys, but not girls, were expected to be successful at the local school. Success for a girl was as a wife and mother and early marriage provided recognition in the community.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of his death he was a Cuban marxist revolutionary in Mexico trying to {{organize}} the overthrow of the Cuban government of General Gerardo Machado. This cause was <b>an</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> the Cuban Communist Party, which was trying to gain power by establishing a modus vivendi with Machado. What further disturbed the Cuban communists was that they felt he had fallen under Leon Trotsky's influence. Mella was assassinated on January 10, 1929, while walking home late at night with photographer Tina Modotti. The Mexican government tried to implicate Modotti in the murder, even releasing nude photographs of her by Edward Weston in an attempt to generate public opinion against her. Muralist Diego Rivera played a very active role in defending her and exposing the Mexican government's crude attempt to frame her. It is unclear whether Mella was murdered by the dictatorial Cuban government; if his death had been brought about by Trotsky-Stalin Communist Party feuding; or by a combination of these mutual interests. It is widely speculated that he died by the notoriously bloody hand of Vittorio Vidali.|$|E
25|$|The Italian army failed on the {{battlefield}} and were overwhelmed by a huge Ethiopian army at the Battle of Adwa. At that point, the Italian invasion force was forced to retreat into Eritrea. The failed Ethiopian campaign was <b>an</b> international <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> Italy, as {{it was one of}} the few major military victories scored by the Africans against an imperial power at this time.|$|R
25|$|Holdridge and {{his first}} wife Marie had {{divorced}} in the 1940s. He then married a former dancer named Julie Phelps (19 October 1908 – 24 October 2003), and adopted her daughter Cheryl. His political activities and incessant writing of public letters to newspapers and elected officials would prove <b>a</b> minor <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> his stepdaughter's acting career. Meanwhile, his son, John H. Holdridge, pursued a diplomatic career.|$|R
