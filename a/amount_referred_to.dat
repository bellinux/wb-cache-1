He further stated that eating strongly flavored foods (like soda or donuts) can raise the set point, whereas flavorless foods (like sugar water, canola oil, extra light olive oil) can lower the set point. These flavorless foods must be consumed in a [...] "flavorless window," [...] at least one hour after and one hour before consuming flavors. Consumption of 100-500 flavorless calories per day lowers the set point, and therefore, lowers weight.|$|E
40|$|Japan is {{an aging}} society, with fewer {{children}} having {{been born in}} the 21 st century than in previous centuries. In 2005 the total fertility rate was 1. 26, which is far below the necessary level (2. 08) for maintaining the present population. Among the devel-oped countries Japan has the lowest infant mortality rate (2. 8 infants per 1000 live births in 2004), 1 and the leading causes of death from 1995 to 2004 in children aged 1 – 6 years were acci-dents, congenital malformations, deformations, and chromo-somal abnormalities. 2 A high standard of pediatric health care coupled with improved treatment delivery systems has enabled children with chronic diseases to survive longer and has reduced the overall mortality rate. Care provided over the duration of an extended illness places extensive demands on the physical, men-tal, and fi nancial resources of patients and their families. Regarding fi nancial resources, unique social health care insur-ance systems are available in Japan; under the universal coverage principle, all registered residents, including foreigners, 3 must enroll {{in one of the}} social health-care insurance systems. This universal medical insurance was implemented in 1961, and insurance premiums are dependent on the income of the insured person. This insurance covers illness, injury, childbirth, and death for the insured person as well as his or her dependents. Medical care is accessible to everyone, and only a small co-payment of 30 % of the total medical expenditure (10 % for persons> 70 years) is required. If a person pays more than a designated monthly amount in medical expenses to a single medical institution within a single month, the excess <b>amount</b> (<b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as a high medical expense) is refunded. Medical services provided by this insur-ance cover a wide range of standard services. Additionally, new diagnostic tests and treatments resulting from the continual tech-nological innovation in the medical fi eld are also covered. In-home care and home-visit nursing care are also provided, and the system is structured to allow patients to freely access services at any medical institution at the same cost.
