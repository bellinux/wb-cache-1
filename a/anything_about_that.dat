500|$|In 2014 David Coulthard gave an {{interview}} to Charles Bradley in Autosport where he claimed that indeed an agreement between McLaren and Williams was in place. [...] "Ron [...] had made that deal with Frank , which none of us knew <b>anything</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that</b> if we helped Williams {{in their quest to}} beat Ferrari they wouldn't {{get in the way of}} helping McLaren. Ron would probably still deny it today. That's what happened." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Next to You" [...] was {{directed}} by Colin Tilley and filmed at the Universal Studios in Los Angeles, and upper Manhattan. On May 10, 2011, Bieber's manager confirmed plans for a music video via Twitter. In an interview with MTV News, Tilley spoke briefly about the video, saying [...] "Tomorrow, I'm shooting New Boyz and Chris Brown... then Justin Bieber and Chris Brown, together... I can't tell you <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> yet, but it's going to happen. It's gonna be big. It's gonna be big. I can't say anything else." [...] On May 21, 2011, Brown posted two photos from the shoot via Twitter, showing him and Bieber standing among overturned cars in a path of destruction. However, the unfinished version of the music video leaked onto the internet on June 6, and the final cut was premiered on June 17, 2011.|$|E
500|$|The Daddies {{have often}} been criticized for their seeming {{juxtaposition}} of lurid subject matter and profanity with jazz and swing music, though Perry has boldly defended the band's predilection towards [...] "darker" [...] lyricism and visuals, calling to attention {{his interest in the}} era's film noir and avant-garde artistic movements. A prominent example of this includes the two music videos for the Daddies' hit single [...] "Zoot Suit Riot", which – in addition to being written about the 1943 race riots – both featured pervasive surrealist imagery inspired by the films of Luis Buñuel, specifically his 1929 short Un Chien Andalou. [...] "We wanted to be darker, weirder and stranger", Perry stated in a 2012 interview, [...] "and unfortunately, with other [...] bands it was 'Back then everyone dressed nice and was nice'. That's not true. You don't know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> era at all".|$|E

500|$|On 14 and 15 April 1993, Holland was {{the mission}} {{commander}} of a two-ship training mission to a bombing range near Guam in the Pacific Ocean. During the mission, Holland flew his B-52 {{closer to the}} other B-52 than regulations allowed. Holland also asked his navigator to videotape the bombs falling from the aircraft from inside the bomb bay, also against regulations. Holland's navigator later brought the video {{to the attention of}} three Fairchild USAF officers. The first, Lieutenant Colonel Bullock, the current 325th Bomb Squadron commander, did not do anything about it and may have even tried to use the videotape as leverage to coerce the navigator into accepting a position as mission scheduler for the wing. The second, the deputy operations group commander, Lieutenant Colonel Harper, told the crew member to conceal the evidence. The third, the DO, allegedly responded to reports of the video by stating, [...] "Okay, I don't want to know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> video—I don't care." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Cabin at Collider {{called the}} short film [...] "dark, funny, {{and just a}} bit punkish", and {{compared}} it to a Saturday Night Live skit. He {{thought it was a}} smart move from Fox to release [...] "a taste of what [...] love" [...] about the first film to abate fears and rumors following the replacement of Miller with Leitch. Cabin also said it was impressive and clever that the studio managed to keep the short a surprise for general audiences to discover at the theater. Matt Rooney at JoBlo.com called the teaser great, and [...] "a great way to keep the buzz going for" [...] Deadpool 2 despite not actually revealing <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> film. Matthew Monagle of Screen Crush said the short proves that the first Deadpool was [...] "not a one-hit wonder for Reynolds and company", and praised its jokes. He also noted its release with Logan as another connection being made by Fox between its X-Men films and Deadpool, pointing toward future crossovers between the two. The Verge's Andrew Liptak said the short was [...] "a fun one", noting the visual gags in the background and the Stan Lee cameo, and saying, [...] "At the very least, [...] we can expect the same irreverent humor in" [...] Deadpool 2 as was in the first film.|$|E

2500|$|During the All-Star break, Walker {{participated in}} the Home Run Derby, placing second with 19 home runs. [...] Both he and Tony Gwynn of the Padres, also a selectee that year's All-Star Game, were batting near [...]400, and right fielders for teams in the National League West division. They were jointly interviewed, as batting [...]400 {{is one of the}} most {{difficult}} achievements in all of sports. [...] Asked just how challenging it is, Gwynn, known to be a very studious hitter, elaborated with what he later termed a [...] "complete dissertation." [...] Walker responded, [...] "I don't know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> stuff. [...] I just hit the ball." [...] While neither player wound up achieving the statistic over any full season, Gwynn won that year's National League batting championship and Walker was second.|$|E
2500|$|Even though Basayev had a $10 million bounty on his head, he gave an {{interview}} to Russian journalist Andrei Babitsky in which he described himself as [...] "a bad guy, a bandit, a terrorist ... but what would you call them?", referring to his enemies. Basayev stated each Russian had to feel war's impact before the Chechen war would stop. Basayev asked [...] "Officially, over 40,000 of our children {{have been killed and}} tens of thousands mutilated. Is anyone saying <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> ... responsibility is with the whole Russian nation, which through its silent approval gives a 'yes'." [...] This interview was broadcast on U.S. television network ABC's Nightline program, to the protest of the Russian government; on 2 August 2005, Moscow banned journalists of the ABC network from working in Russia.|$|E
2500|$|In circles {{concerned}} with copyright and intellectual property issues, Wood {{is known as}} the artist of the unsigned satirical Disneyland Memorial Orgy poster, which first appeared in Paul Krassner's magazine The Realist. The poster depicts a number of copyrighted Disney characters in various unsavory activities (including sex acts and drug use), with huge dollar signs radiating from Cinderella's Castle. Wood himself, as late as 1981, when asked who did that drawing, said only, [...] "I'd rather not say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that!</b> It was the most pirated drawing in history! Everyone was printing copies of that. I understand some people got busted for selling it. I always thought Disney stuff was pretty sexy... Snow White, etc." [...] Disney took no legal action against either Krassner or The Realist but did sue a publisher of a [...] "blacklight" [...] version of the poster, who used the image without Krassner's permission. The case was settled out of court.|$|E

2500|$|Critics have {{referred}} {{to the music of}} HIM as gothic rock, gothic metal, alternative rock, alternative metal, and dark rock. The band themselves {{have referred}} to their music as [...] "love metal", the title of their fourth studio album. According to Ville Valo, the term [...] "love metal" [...] was coined as a response to people having difficulties categorizing their music. In regards to HIM being labeled a [...] "goth band", Valo responded by stating: [...] "We can't do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> , but I think we are a special shade of goth, more tender than others. In Finnish tradition, our music is very melancholic." [...] Valo has described HIM's sound as [...] "sentimental, hard-hitting rock music". According to Valo, since the beginning the band's intent was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences. Valo has often cited Black Sabbath and Type O Negative as HIM's biggest influences. Some of the band's further influences include Paradise Lost, Anathema, My Dying Bride, Cathedral, Electric Wizard, Monster Magnet and Norwegian black metal. Regarding HIM's sound, Valo has also stated that: [...] "We never tried to claim that we have reinvented the wheel of rock 'n' roll. We've always been proud to be the torchbearers for Sabbath, Type O, Paradise Lost and Anathema, and a lot of those bands." ...|$|E
