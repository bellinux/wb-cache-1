5|$|Despite Pluto's orbit {{appearing}} to cross that of Neptune {{when viewed from}} directly above, the two objects' orbits <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> {{so that they can}} never collide or even approach closely.|$|E
5|$|Single axis {{tracking}} systems <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> along axes roughly North-South. Some use linkages between rows {{so that the}} same actuator can adjust the angle of several rows at once.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom {{will have no}} spin when it has even numbers of both {{neutrons}} and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> in random directions because of thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129) {{it is possible to}} polarize a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> in the same direction—a condition called hyperpolarization. This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E
50|$|A memory pointer that {{refers to}} {{primitive}} data that is n bytes long is said to <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> if it <b>is</b> only allowed to contain addresses that <b>are</b> n-byte <b>aligned,</b> otherwise it <b>is</b> said to be unaligned. A memory pointer {{that refers to}} a data aggregate (a data structure or array) <b>is</b> <b>aligned</b> if (and only if) each primitive datum in the aggregate <b>is</b> <b>aligned.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{discovered}} in the 1980s that Balquhain had lunar associations. The eastern flanker <b>is</b> <b>aligned</b> to the most southerly moonrise at 172 degrees, whilst the western flanker <b>is</b> <b>aligned</b> to the minor moonset at 232 degrees. The major moonset <b>is</b> <b>aligned</b> over the central hump of the recumbent stone at 190 degrees.|$|R
25|$|When the Earth's axis <b>is</b> <b>aligned</b> {{such that}} {{aphelion}} and perihelion occur near the equinoxes, axial tilt will not <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> with or against eccentricity.|$|R
5|$|Five {{overlapping}} craters <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> in a north-south line on Lastarria's main cone. Volcanic {{activity has}} migrated north during {{the history of}} Lastarria, {{and the most recent}} eruption products are found on the northern and western slopes. A lava dome sits on the northernmost crater rim. The South Spur has two craters.|$|E
5|$|Structure A-19 and Structure C-9 are ballcourts. They have a {{resemblance}} to ballcourts at Chichen Itza. Both ballcourts <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> east-west, an unusual {{feature in the}} Maya area, although the topography of the site severely restricted {{the layout of the}} city to a principally east-west orientation. BallcourtA-19 lies on the west side on the north plaza.|$|E
5|$|The {{youngest}} of the flows on Axial Seamount <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> along the two rift zones, followed by flows inside the summit caldera; the oldest appear to originate from directly around the caldera, {{where most of the}} basalt is completely covered in accumulated sediment. This suggests a bilateral growth pattern, a trend also found in Hawaiian volcanics and other well-known seamounts, for instance Jasper Seamount.|$|E
50|$|A {{memory access}} {{is said to}} <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> when the datum being {{accessed}} is n bytes long and the datum address <b>is</b> n-byte <b>aligned.</b> When a memory access <b>is</b> not <b>aligned,</b> it <b>is</b> said to be misaligned. Note that by definition byte memory accesses <b>are</b> always <b>aligned.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dror <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> {{with the}} HaKibbutz Hameuhad network, while Habonim <b>was</b> <b>aligned</b> with the Ichud kibbutzim. When the two kibbutz {{movements}} merged in 1980 {{to form the}} United Kibbutz Movement (TaKa"M), so did their respective youth movements.|$|R

5|$|Wazir Khan Mosque {{features}} South Asia's first {{example of}} a purpose-built Central Asian charsu bazaar, or four-axis bazaar - although in the Wazir Khan Mosque adaptation, {{two of the four}} axises <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> as the mosque's entryway, while the other two form the Calligrapher's Bazaar.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular surfaces of the vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the vertebral bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> along the neck and bridge multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior the neck to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus {{lasts for}} 10 to 15 minutes. Once mated, the males will defend the females {{for a short}} period (around 15 minutes). After this period, the females begin to exhibit {{aggressive}} behavior and will drive off the males. They will then bend their fourth and fifth pereonites at a 90-degree angle. Once their genital openings (located on the fifth pereonite) <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> {{with the opening of the}} brood pouches, they quickly deposit fertilized eggs into them. Females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly aggressive towards males throughout the brooding period, indicating maternal behavior intended to protect the developing embryo from male aggression.|$|E

5|$|Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Albán in Oaxaca {{state in}} Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a {{different}} orientation to other structures in the complex. Its steps <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that time, so that a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán.|$|E
5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, {{and in the case}} of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track. The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.|$|E
5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up {{in the presence of}} a field.|$|E
50|$|According to {{ordinary}} quantum theory, {{it is not}} possible to measure the spin or polarization of a particle directly; instead, the component in one direction is measured; the outcome from a single particle may be 1, meaning that the particle <b>is</b> <b>aligned</b> with the measuring apparatus, or −1, meaning that it <b>is</b> <b>aligned</b> the opposite way. For an ensemble of particles, if we expect the particles to <b>be</b> <b>aligned,</b> the results <b>are</b> all 1. If we expect them to <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> oppositely, the results are all −1. For other alignments, we expect some results to be 1 and some to be −1 with a probability that depends on the expected alignment. For a full explanation of this, see the Stern-Gerlach experiment.|$|R

5|$|In the Milky Way it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that {{the large majority of}} the low metallicity clusters <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy's halo. This result argues in favor of the view that type II clusters in the galaxy were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way's globular cluster system as had been previously thought. The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E
5|$|Khwabgah was {{the bedroom}} of Shah Jahan. It {{was built by}} Shah Jahan under the {{supervision}} of Wazir Khan in 1634 during his first visit to the city. Five sleeping chambers <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> in a single row. The chambers feature carved marble screens, and are decorated with inlaid white marble and frescoes, It is the first building built by Shah Jahan in the fort. At present its decorations have vanished except for a trace of the marble which once might have beautified the façade.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{language has}} seven monophthong vowel phonemes. They <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> into three vowel harmony groups by a parameter called ATR (advanced tongue root); {{the groups are}} ATR, +ATR, and neutral. This alignment seems to have superseded an alignment according to oral backness. However, some scholars still describe Mongolian as being characterized by a distinction between front vowels and back vowels, and the front vowel spellings 'ö' and 'ü' are still often used in the West to indicate two vowels which were historically front. The Mongolian vowel system also has rounding harmony.|$|E

5|$|The {{application}} of Blender was supplemented {{by use of}} the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which was used on August 30 and November 15, 2010, to further define Kepler-10's light curve {{at the point where}} KOI 072.02 appeared to transit it. It was found that the transiting object did not produce a color, an aspect that is characteristic of stars. This suggested even further that KOI 072.02 was a planet. In addition, the IRAC instrument found no difference in the transit signal when comparing the star's light curve in the infrared and in visible light; stars that <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> with Kepler-10 might appear visibly similar, but would appear different in the infrared.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider {{the case in}} which liquid crystal molecules <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> parallel {{to the surface and}} an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.|$|E
5|$|The main axes of {{the museum}} grid that is offset by 22.5 degrees begins with the arrival plaza, carries through {{the edge of the}} stairs up to the main entrance, aligns with the columns {{supporting}} the rotunda as well as the center point of the rotunda, aligns with travertine benches in the courtyard between the pavilions, includes a narrow walkway between the west and south pavilions, a staircase down to the cactus garden and ends in the garden. The corresponding cross axis starts with the center point of the circle forming the GRI library garden, then passing {{to the center of the}} entrance rotunda, and aligning with the south wall of the rotunda building. Although all of the Museum is aligned on these alternative axes, portions of the exhibitions pavilion and the east pavilion <b>are</b> <b>aligned</b> on the true north-south axis as a reminder that both grids are present in the campus.|$|E
