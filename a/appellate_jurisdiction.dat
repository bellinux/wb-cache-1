5|$|United States v. More, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that it had no {{jurisdiction}} to hear appeals from criminal cases in the circuit courts by writs of error. Relying on the Exceptions Clause, More held that Congress's enumerated grants of <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power to eliminate all other forms of <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{is true that}} repeals by {{implication}} are not favored, but we cannot escape the conclusion that, tested by its scope, its obvious purpose, and its terms, the act of March 3, 1891, covers the whole subject-matter under consideration, and furnishes the exclusive rule in respect of <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> on appeal, writ of error or certificate.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States issued {{almost no}} {{constitutional}} criminal procedure decisions {{for its first}} century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights two reasons for this. First, the Court's decision in Barron v. Baltimore (1833) meant that the federal constitution did not apply in state proceedings until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, the Court lacked general <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over federal criminal cases until 1891.|$|E

40|$|Interlocking Constitutions {{delivers}} a highly articulate {{analysis of the}} dynamic interaction between European final <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> at the international and national level. Through a series of case studies, Gordillo examines how various international and national jurisdictions have interacted with one another over the past fifty years. The historical inheritance of these dialogues is a European-wide interlocked legal system that includes national and international jurisdictions as well as international {{institutions such as the}} UN Security Council. The interactions between these institutions take a functional approach that seeks to prevent conflicts ex ante or to minimise their consequences ex post. An important corollary of this is that the book provides an argument against the cognitive persuasiveness of epistemic models such as constitutional cosmopolitanism and constitutional pluralism. Constitutional cosmopolitanism, Gordillo argues, is unsuitable for explaining horizontal interactions between final <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> because it assumes, implicitly or explicitly, the existence of a global order based on shared values. However, from the analysis of the very large sample of cases considered in Interlocking Constitutions, it appears that constitutional and international courts either resist the idea of global values or, in the few instances in which they might qualify as shared, judgments are nonetheless grounded in courts' pre-existing lines of authority. ...|$|R

5|$|During Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court had no general <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in {{criminal}} cases. The Court could review criminal convictions {{from the state}} courts, but not the lower federal courts, via writs of error. It only did so twice. The Court could hear original habeas petitions, but disclaimed the authority to grant the writ post-conviction unless the sentence had already been completed. Thus, {{the majority of the}} Marshall Court's opinions on criminal law were issued in response to questions certified by divided panels of the circuit courts by a certificate of division.|$|E
5|$|Judicial: India has {{a unitary}} three-tier {{independent}} judiciary that comprises the Supreme Court, {{headed by the}} Chief Justice of India, 24 High Courts, {{and a large number}} of trial courts. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre; it has <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over the High Courts. It has the power both to declare the law and to strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution, as well as to invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|The Provisional Government also {{included}} a judiciary. The forerunner of the Oregon Supreme Court consisted of a single Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace. The Supreme Judge was elected by the people, but the legislature could select someone as presiding judge as a replacement if needed. This Supreme Court had original and <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over legal matters, whereas the lower probate court and justice courts that were also created could only hear original jurisdictional matters when the amount in controversy was less than $50 and did not involve land disputes. Some judges under the Provisional Government were Nathaniel Ford, Peter H. Burnett, Osborne Russell, Ira L. Babcock, and future United States Senator James W. Nesmith.|$|E

25|$|Marshall first {{examined}} the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{and determined that}} the Act purported to give the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over writs of mandamus. Marshall then looked to Article III of the Constitution, which defines the Supreme Court's original and <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> (see Relevant Law above). Marbury had argued that the Constitution was only intended to set a floor for original jurisdiction that Congress could add to. Marshall disagreed and held that Congress {{does not have the}} power to modify the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. Consequently, Marshall found that the Constitution and the Judiciary Act conflict.|$|R

5|$|The Supreme Court had other, limited {{sources of}} <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in {{criminal}} cases. The Court could hear criminal appeals {{from the state}} courts by writ of error, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Court could hear federal criminal appeals by certificate of division, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1802, original habeas petition, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789, and mandamus, as authorized by the same act. Between 1867 and 1868, and after 1885, the Court had jurisdiction to hear writs of error from habeas petitions (a civil action) in the circuit courts. Beginning in 1850, the Court also entertained such appeals from the territorial courts. Attempts to utilize other prerogative writs as sources of jurisdiction were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} writs {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in civil cases. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except {{insofar as it}} required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms (1803), without any discussion of the jurisdictional issue, in United States v. More (1805), the Court held {{that it had no}} such jurisdiction. More held that Congress's piecemeal statutory grants of <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted.|$|E
5|$|Through the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress {{established}} a six-member Supreme Court. The court {{was composed of}} one Chief Justice and five Associate Justices. It was given exclusive original jurisdiction over all civil actions between states, or between a state and the United States, as well as over all suits and proceedings brought against ambassadors and other diplomatic personnel; and original, but not exclusive, jurisdiction over all other cases in which a state was a party and any cases brought by an ambassador. The Court was given <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over decisions of the federal circuit courts as well as decisions by state courts holding invalid any statute or treaty of the United States; or holding valid any state law or practice that was challenged as being inconsistent with the federal constitution, treaties, or laws; or rejecting any claim made by a party under a provision of the federal constitution, treaties, or laws.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two kinds}} of intent analysis, {{reflecting}} two meanings of the word intent. The first, a rule of common law construction during the Founding Era, is functional intent. The second is motivational intent. To understand the difference, one can use the metaphor of an architect who designs a Gothic church with flying buttresses. The functional intent of flying buttresses is to prevent the weight of the roof from spreading the walls and causing a collapse of the building, which can be inferred from examining the design as a whole. The motivational intent might be to create work for his brother-in-law who is a flying buttress subcontractor. Using original intent analysis of the first kind, we can discern that the language of Article III of the U.S. Constitution was to delegate to Congress the power to allocate original and <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdictions,</b> and not to remove some jurisdiction, involving a constitutional question, from all courts. That would suggest that the decision was wrong in Ex Parte McCardle.|$|R

5|$|A major {{reform to}} the Court {{happened}} {{soon after the}} restoration, {{with the introduction of}} a right of appeal to the House of Lords from the Chancery. Before this there had been no records of appeals to the Lords, and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give the Lords jurisdiction over equity matters, except when problems and cases were sent directly to Parliament (as occasionally had been the case). In 1660 the Convention Parliament claimed for itself the right of <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over equity matters, and also the right of original jurisdiction to hear equity cases at first instance. After disputes which lasted into the next Parliament, this second measure was dropped, but the right to hear equity appeals was confirmed. Horowitz writes that despite these changes, one of the academic certainties is that the problems which had dogged the court for the last two centuries persisted; Observations on the Dilatory and Expensive Proceedings in the Court of Chancery, written in 1701, listed 25 different procedures, areas and situations which contributed to the problems of high fees and slow processes.|$|E

5000|$|The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit {{made two}} rulings. Firstly, it held {{that under the}} Federal Arbitration Act, the {{decision}} of the District Court was a [...] "final decision", thus giving the <b>appellate</b> court <b>jurisdiction.</b> Secondly it held that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it was silent with respect to the payment of filing fees, arbitrators' costs and other arbitration-related expenses.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to fill the}} gaps in the Nigerian constitution 1999 relating to Islamic Banking and Finance (IBF) Litigations, using the system as an inter-faith bridge in pluralist Nigeria as well as using Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to supplement the limited court system. The doctrinal methodology was the main method but some interviews were conducted to support it. This research found that the Constitution fell short of, among others, not providing original Jurisdiction to the Sharia Court of Appeal on matters of IBF; rather, it vested the same on the Federal High Court and <b>appellate</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> on the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, whose constitutional requirements for the appointment of their Benchers do not include general knowledge of the Sharia. This work also found that amendments to the constitution, enactment of separate IBF Act, ADR, emulating Malaysia {{and the establishment of}} IBF Court or Tribunal will help in filling the lacunae in the Constitution. It was also found that having IBF is within constitutional right to worship and {{can be used as a}} bridge to unite Muslims and Christians in Nigeria. The study presented three contributions to legal research on IBF; Firstly, a microscopic view was made in the constitutional problems of incompetent Benchers in IBF litigations. Secondly, proposal was made for the use of ADR, special courts and laws to handle IBF matters. Thirdly, hypothesis was made to prove that IBF is the constitutional right of both Muslims and Christians. In conclusion, it is hoped that these findings and suggestions will be used by the government to legally enhance IBF operations in Nigeria for national harmony...|$|R
