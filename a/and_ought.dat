5000|$|In an interview, {{he remarked}} that [...] "I'm a great believer both {{politically}} and aesthetically in pluralism. There {{ought to be}} movies for everybody.

25|$|On June 20, Mardian and Fred LaRue {{met with}} Liddy in LaRue's {{apartment}} in the Watergate complex, where Liddy told him the full story of all the activities of 'the plumbers'. Mardian suggested to Liddy that he {{was likely to be}} traced <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> to give himself up; he also said that Mitchell was unlikely to let CRP funds be used to bail the Cuban burglars, but the Cuban community in Florida might help.|$|E
25|$|Parnell's intrigue should not, Biggar said, {{be allowed}} {{to stand in the}} way of {{political}} obligations, and no seat should be sold to a worthless woman's husband. Biggar was not a purist, but urged that private vices should be kept private, <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> not to be imported into political issues. He was prepared to bring about the downfall of Parnell, in spite of the fact that Gladstone was in treaty with him for a Home Rule Bill. I differed.|$|E

5000|$|Before his {{addiction}} became known, Limbaugh had condemned {{illegal drug}} use on his television program, stating that [...] "Drug use, some might say, is destroying this country...

25|$|Historian Martin H. Folly {{argues that}} Bevin was not {{automatically}} pro-American. Instead {{he pushed his}} embassy in Washington to project a view of Britain that neutralized American criticisms. He felt Britain's problems were in part caused by American irresponsibility. He was frustrated with American attitudes. His strategy was to bring Washington around to support Britain's policies, arguing Britain had earned American support <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> to compensate it for its sacrifices against the Nazis. Bevin was not coldly pragmatic, says Folly, nor was he uncritically pro-American; nor was he a puppet manipulated by the British Foreign Office.|$|E
25|$|In 1840, Campbell {{published}} the book A British army, as it was, - is, - <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> to be, which recounts {{some of his}} experience in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Plattsburgh (see Bibliography below). In Volume 1 of Excursions, Adventures, and Field-sports in Ceylon Campbell notes that, {{from the start of}} his service in the army, he was in the habit of keeping a journal. However the night before the Battle of Talavera, thinking that he would be likely to die the next day and not wanting his journal to fall into enemy hands, he burnt it, and thus destroyed the record of events from the previous eight years.|$|E
25|$|In 1861, it {{was renamed}} the New Royalty Theatre, {{and the next}} year it was leased by Mrs Charles Selby, who {{enlarged}} it from 200 seats to about 650. The theatre continued to change hands frequently. In the 1860s, it featured F. C. Burnand's burlesque of Black-Eyed Susan, which ran for nearly 500 nights, and a burlesque by W. S. Gilbert, The Merry Zingara. The theatre was managed by Henrietta Hodson during the early 1870s, who also produced mostly burlesques and comedies, including Gilbert's The Realm of Joy <b>and</b> <b>Ought</b> We to Visit Her? On 25 March 1875 the Royalty, under the direction of Selina Dolaro, enjoyed an historic success with Trial by Jury.|$|E

25|$|Leicestershire Foxes {{took the}} win at Trent Bridge in a low-scoring match. Nottinghamshire Outlaws {{had won the}} toss and bowled first, <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> to have been pretty pleased with restricting the Foxes to 150 for 4, even though they conceded 15 extras. The opening {{partnership}} of HD Ackerman and Darren Maddy for 67 runs had promised more for Leicestershire. However, West Indian Ottis Gibson dug out two early wickets in Graeme Swann and Stephen Fleming - Darren Maddy and David Masters then took wickets at leisure, and Nottinghamshire were 96 for 7. Despite a rescue mission from Gareth Clough who hit 30 off 16 balls, there was no hitting power from the other players, and Nottinghamshire finished on 129 for 8.|$|E
25|$|The reports {{created a}} sensation. Oliver was not slow to try adrenal {{extracts}} in patients, orally again and rather indiscriminately, from Addison's disease, hypotension (″loss of vasomotor tone″), Diabetes mellitus and Diabetes insipidus to Graves' disease (″exophthalmic goitre″). It seems he adhered to contemporary ideas of organotherapy, believing that powerful substances existed in tissues <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> {{to be discovered}} for medicinal use. In fact he immediately went on to extract the pituitary gland and, again with Schäfer, discovered vasopressin. In 1903 adrenaline, meanwhile purified, was first used in asthma. The use was based, not on the bronchodilator effect, which was discovered later, but on the vasoconstrictor effect, which was hoped to alleviate the “turgidity of the bronchial mucosa” – presumably vascular congestion and edema. Also as of 1903, adrenaline was added to local anesthetic solutions. The surgeon Heinrich Braun in Leipzig showed that it prolonged the anesthesia at the injection site and simultaneously reduced ″systemic″ effects elsewhere in the body.|$|E
25|$|Kritiks: The {{negative}} {{can claim}} that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> to be rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue {{that it would be}} good to reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that {{it would be good to}} reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.|$|E

The first column is for choice of subject, the second for arrangement, the third for colouring. And these are the conditions of the match. You must give three crosses to two or three pictures. You must give two crosses to four or five----" ...|$|R

25|$|Henry was in France {{with the}} Emperor Maximilian at {{the siege of}} Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV's letter of 26 July to him. James asked him to desist from attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry's {{exchange}} with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, Henry said that James {{had no right to}} summon him, <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> to be England's ally, as James was married to his (Henry's) sister, Margaret. He declared:And now, for a conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And one thing I ensure him by the faith that I have to the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace with me that ever his part shall be in it. Moreover, fellow, I care for nothing but for misentreating of my sister, that would God she were in England on a condition she cost the Schottes King not a penny.|$|E
25|$|Unexpectedly {{confronted by}} a large Austro-Russian army, MacDonald was in a dilemma. He {{believed}} that his 22,000 available soldiers were outnumbered <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> to retreat, but he anticipated that Moreau might soon arrive to pitch into the Allied rear. So he hoped to hold out until his last divisions could arrive on the field. MacDonald was also aware {{of the presence of}} a force under Jean François Cornu de La Poype that was in position to threaten the Allied south flank. On the 18th, Veletsky's detached force surprised La Poype's 1,500 French and 2,000 Genoese at Bobbio, sending them fleeing back to Genoa. On morning of 18 June the injured MacDonald inspected his army. He found his men ready to fight and the enemy inactive. Meanwhile, Suvorov and Chasteler planned to throw three columns at the French, with the main strength on the right to break down MacDonald's flank by advancing from the Tidone to the Trebbia and finally {{all the way to the}} Nure, the next river to the east. With luck, the French would be driven back against the Po. The First Column on the right was headed by Bagration's Advance Guard followed by Schveikovsky's division. The Second Column in the center was made up of Förster's division. The Third Column included the divisions of Ott and Fröhlich. Ott was ordered to drive straight ahead to the Trebbia supported by his colleague. At some point Fröhlich's grenadiers were supposed to reinforce the right flank in order to give more weight to its attack.|$|E

500|$|The minority—in a dissent {{written by}} Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II and joined by Associate Justices Tom C. Clark, Potter Stewart, and Byron White—argued that Perez had been {{correctly}} decided, that {{nothing in the}} Constitution deprived Congress of the power to revoke a person's citizenship for good cause, and that Congress was within its rights to decide that allowing Americans to vote in foreign elections ran contrary to the foreign policy interests of the nation <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> to result in loss of citizenship.

500|$|Lord Phillips {{noted that}} expert {{witnesses}} (unlike witnesses giving evidence of facts) {{had volunteered to}} give evidence and were doing so for payment. [...] He saw [...] "no justification" [...] for the assumption that experts would be discouraged from providing their services {{if they could be}} sued. As for the effect on an expert's willingness to give frank evidence, there was no empirical evidence either way, he said. However, a witness of integrity would concede a change of view where necessary to do so <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> not to be concerned about being sued.|$|E
500|$|Hay was {{disgusted by}} Bryan's speeches, writing in {{language}} that Taliaferro compares to The Bread-Winners that the Democrat [...] "simply reiterates the unquestioned truths that every {{man with a}} clean shirt is a thief <b>and</b> <b>ought</b> to be hanged: {{that there is no}} goodness and wisdom except among the illiterate & criminal classes". Despite Bryan's strenuous efforts, McKinley won the election easily, with a campaign run by himself and Hanna, and well-financed by supporters like Hay. Henry Adams later wondered, [...] "I would give sixpence to know how much Hay paid for McKinley. His politics must have cost." ...|$|E
