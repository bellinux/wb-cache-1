5|$|As the {{tradition}} of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors <b>and</b> <b>role,</b> as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women, such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the Punic wars of the 2nd century BC, this form of {{organisation}} was found to be inefficient. In a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the principes being older veterans with a greater degree of experience. Their equipment <b>and</b> <b>role</b> was very similar to the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each princeps also carried two pila, heavy javelins that bent on impact to prevent them being removed from the victim or thrown back.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the concept languages or description logics (DLs) ofthe KLONE family. The concept languages allow {{to represent the}} knowledge of a domain by the concepts <b>and</b> <b>roles,</b> where the concepts model individual classes <b>and</b> <b>roles</b> determine relationships between the classes. Of the combination of atomic concepts <b>and</b> atomic <b>roles</b> with suitable constructors can be generated concept expressions. The concept languages are given a Tarski style declarative semantics where the concepts are interpreted as subsets of a domain <b>and</b> <b>roles</b> as binary relations. The semantics of concepts identifies concept languages as fragments of first order predicate logic. The reasoning overthe concepts is based in the subsumption relationship. Which implicitly defines a taxonomic between the concepts...|$|R
5|$|The series {{features}} {{a number of}} recurring character archetypes.

However, two characteristics many versions of Cid have in common are 1) being a scientist or engineer, and 2) being tied {{in some way to}} an airship the party eventually acquires. Every Cid has {{at least one of these}} two traits.|$|E

5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the water quality parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics <b>and</b> <b>role</b> of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The test results indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but the water quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Both Berman and Piller {{sought to}} have Forbes {{sign on to}} portray Ro as a main {{character}} in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation, but {{did not want to}} tie herself down to a five- to six-year main cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, {{and did not want to}} undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine. The producers of Deep Space Nine decided to create a new character to fit a similar mould, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story <b>and</b> <b>role.</b>|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Pyramid Head has been favorable {{because of his}} distinctive appearance <b>and</b> <b>role</b> as an element of James' psyche. Critics cite him as an iconic villain of the Silent Hill series, a favorite among fans, {{and part of the}} appeal of Silent Hill 2. GameSpot compared Pyramid Head's appearance to Leatherface, the main antagonist of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series of slasher films, and found him the most terrifying monster in Silent Hill 2. Computerworld named Pyramid Head {{as one of the most}} terrifying villains in computer and video games. GamesRadar felt that the scene in which he rapes the two other monsters was unsettling, since the subject of rape is not often tackled in video games, and disliked the final battle with him because of how anti-climactic it was, in comparison with his role throughout the rest of the game.|$|E
5|$|Each dream {{acts as a}} {{character}} study, exploring the fears and future of the dreamer. Willow, Xander, and Giles are stalked by a shadowy figure, then killed within their dreams. The way in which each is killed {{is directly related to}} the role they had assumed when melding with Buffy in the previous episode—that role is indicated by the Tarot-like card used to symbolize the character's essence. Willow's card had been Spiritus, representing her magical powers; she is killed by having her spirit sucked out of her. Xander's card had been Animus, representing his heart; he is killed by having his heart ripped out. Giles had been represented by the card Sophus, a symbol of his intellect <b>and</b> <b>role</b> as teacher; he is killed by being scalped. Buffy's card, Manus, was representative of her physical strength. In her dream the stalker is revealed as the primitive, first slayer, who confronts her aggressively. The two fight, but the First Slayer is defeated when Buffy realizes a key difference between them: the First Slayer was alone and isolated, while Buffy is unique among Slayers in that she has friends and a life beyond slaying, factors which make her the greatest Slayer ever.|$|E
5|$|Following the Federation of Australia in 1901, the {{amalgamation}} of {{the military}} forces controlled by the six separate, self-governing British colonies to form a unified force controlled by the Commonwealth was an inevitable, albeit slowly realised, consequence, given that the new Constitution of Australia assigned the defence power solely to the Commonwealth. Indeed, this process took some time as, to a large extent, matters of defence were not necessarily a priority of the new Australian legislature at the time, {{and there was also}} a considerable diversity in opinion regarding the composition and size of the new national army <b>and</b> <b>role</b> it would play at home and indeed within the wider Imperial defence system. Nevertheless, the official transfer of forces from the states to the Commonwealth occurred on 1 March 1901, and this date is today celebrated as the birthday of the modern Australian Army. At the outset, the bulk of the Commonwealth military force was to be made up of part-time volunteers. This was arguably due to two factors. Firstly, there was a widespread desire amongst Australian policymakers to keep defence expenditure low, while secondly there was a widespread mistrust or suspicion surrounding the idea of a large standing army.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} creative writing of 180 {{elementary school children}} for evidence of sex difference and sex-role perceptions. Stories were analyzed for frequency {{of male and female}} characters, attributes, <b>and</b> <b>roles.</b> Writers were equally divided by sex and into three age groups—grades 1 – 2, 3 – 4, and 5 – 6. Results suggest that the total number of characters, <b>roles,</b> <b>and</b> attributes was equivalent. However, the distribution of male <b>and</b> female characters, <b>roles,</b> <b>and</b> attributes differed with male and female writers. Female writers included significantly more female characters and assigned more attributes <b>and</b> <b>roles</b> to these characters. Nevertheless, in the stories of both male and female writers, there was a predominance of male characters and assignment of attributes <b>and</b> <b>roles</b> to male characters.
