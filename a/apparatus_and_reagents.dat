40|$|In the 1980 s, {{capillary}} electrophoresis (CE) joined {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) {{as the most powerful}} separation technique available to analytical chemists and biochemists. Published research using CE grew from 48 papers in the year of commercial introduction (1988) to 1200 in 1997. While only a dozen major pharmaceutical and biotech companies have reduced CE to routine practice, the applications market is showing real or potential growth in key areas, particularly in the DNA marketplace for genomic mapping and forensic identification. For drug development involving small molecules (including chiral separations), one CE instrument can replace 10 liquid chromatographs in terms of speed of analysis. CE also uses aqueous rather than organic solvents and is thus environmentally friendlier than HPLC.

40|$|A {{kinetic study}} {{has been made of}} the reactions: O + O 2 + M → O 3 + M (M = O 2, CO 2, He, Ar) 1. 1; O + SO 2 + M → SO 3 + M (M= SO 2, N 2, He,Ar) 2. 1; and the rate {{constants}} determined at different temperatures. An improved discharge flow apparatus was designed and used for the work; the first order decay of oxygen atoms was followed by chemiluminescence techniques. Rate constants for surface reactions were measured by an extension of the technique; this permitted the measurement of surface recombination efficiencies in the presence and absence of O 2. Recombination coefficients for each third body were determined and the corresponding recombination efficiencies were evaluated. For reaction 1. 1, the rate of reaction decreased with increasing temperature. The Arrhenius plots in the presence of all third bodies, except CO 2, were non-linear; this was indicative of the presence of different reactions each with its own energy of activation. A possible mechanism for the reaction is advanced. The high surface recombination efficiency depended on the ambient gas, decreasing in the order Ar > He > CO 2. This suggests that physical adsorption reduces the catalytic efficiency; this could explain the large range of values of the catalytic efficiency reported in the literature. The rate of reactions 2. 1 increased with increase of temperature; the energy of activation (M = SO 2), determined for the first time, is compared with literature values using other third bodies. The importance of the complete exclusion of water from the <b>apparatus</b> <b>and</b> <b>reagents</b> was essential. Unless great precautions are taken, an oily film, possibly of H 2 SO 4, is formed {{on the walls of the}} reactor; this has a pronounced catalytic effect on the reaction. The mechanism of this reaction is discussed in terms of the attainment of a steady state concentration of SO 3. <p...|$|E
40|$|PhDThe {{thesis is}} devoted to {{developing}} optimization of the chiral resolution and quantitation of some amino alcohol compounds namely propranolol, celiprolol,tertatolol, indenolol, nadolol and labetalol, using direct liquid chromatographic method of analysis. The developed methods were applied for determination of these drugs in human plasma, rat plasma and / or rat serum (either in vivo or in vitro) The principles of the proposed procedures {{as well as the}} experimental parameters were studied, discussed, explained and the data obtained were statistically analyzed. The different experimental parameters that affected the development and the stability of the enantiomers were carefully studied. The results were statistically analyzed. The thesis is divided into six main parts:PART I: This part presents a general introduction about chirality and its major role in biological processes, the importance of chiral separations, the development of methods for enantiomers separation. It includes an overview on various chiral separation principles on chiral stationary phases with emphasis on immobilized polysaccharidebased chiral phases. PART II: In this part, a sensitive and selective chiral HPLC method for separation and determination of propranolol enantiomers in rat serum and pharmaceutical formulations has been developed. The degradation behavior of propranolol was investigated under different stress conditions recommended by International conference of Harmonization's (ICH). Resolution of propranolol enantiomers from its degradation products are successfully achieved on cellulose tris(3, 5 -dimethylphenylcarbamate) CSP known as Chiralpak IB column. The method was based on the resolution of propranolol enantiomers using mobile phase composed of (n-hexane-ethanol-triethylamine, 95 / 5 / 0. 4, v/v/v) with a flow rate of 0. 6 mL/min and fluorescence detection at 290 nm for excitation and 375 nm for emission. The method was linear in the range of 10 - 400 ng/mL. The mean relative standard deviation (RSD) of the results of within and intraday precision and accuracy of the drug were < 2 %. The method was highly specific, where by the coformulated compounds did not interfere. Furthermore, molecular modeling studies including energy minimization, and docking studies were performed. First, to illustrate the mechanism by which the active enantiomer binds to the b-adrenergic receptor, second; to find a suitable interpretation of how both enantiomers are interacting with cellulose tris(3, 5 -dimethylphenyl carbamate) during the process of resolution depending on calculation of both the binding affinities and interaction distances between propranolol enantiomers and chiral selector. PART III: In this part, a sensitive and selective chiral HPLC method for separation and determination of celiprolol in human plasma, urine and in pharmaceutical formulation has been developed. Resolution of celiprolol enantiomers are successfully achieved on cellulose tris(3, 5 -dichlorophenylcarbamate) CSP known as Chiralpak IC column, mobile phase composed of (n-hexane-ethanol-triethylamine, 70 / 30 / 0. 4, v/v/v), a flow rat of 0. 5 mL/min and fluorescence detection at 350 nm for excitation and 480 nm for emission were used. The method was linear in the range of 5 - 250 ng/mL. The mean RSD of the results of within and intra-day precision and accuracy of the drug were < 2 %. The method was highly specific, where by the coformulated compounds did not interfere. PART IV: This part presents a sensitive and a selective chiral HPLC method for separation and determination of tertatolol enantiomers in human plasma and pharmaceutical products. Resolution of the tertatolol enantiomers was achieved on cellulose tris(3, 5 - dichlorophenylcarbamate) CSP and mobile phase composed of (n-hexane- ethanoltriethylamine, 60 / 40 / 0. 1, v/v/v) with a flow rate of 0. 3 mL/min and UV detector set at 254 nm. The method was linear in the range of 25 - 1000 ng/mL. PART V: This part presents the study of efficiency of the three immobilized polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases Chiralpak IA, Chiralpak IB and Chiralpak IC to separate all possible stereoisomers of multiple stereogenic centers of some amino alcohol compounds (indenolol, nadolol and labetalol). The condition affording the best resolution has been investigated by selection and variation of different mobile phases and their compositions.
