5000|$|Puzder {{has been}} {{critical}} of substantially raising the federal minimum wage, arguing that a $15 per hour minimum wage would increase costs for consumers and increase automation, leading to fewer jobs. He is also reported to oppose raising the $2.13 per hour minimum wage for tipped workers. In an interview published by Fox Business in May 2016, Puzder said: [...] "There are solutions to this problem, and increasing the minimum wage {{is not the best}} solution. If we are going to increase the minimum wage at all, we’ve got to keep a lower minimum wage for entry-level workers, or these people are just going to be shut out of the workforce….The Congressional Budget Office came out with <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>last</b> year that said you could raise the minimum wage to about $9 without much impact on jobs, and you probably could do that".

I am pleased to discuss three informative papers dealing with the taxation of electronic commerce. These papers are very well written and timely as not only the American states but also national governments are beginning to grapple with the issue of how to tax electronic commerce transactions.

When John Gifford was wounded his brother Arthur wrote on August 1 “I this moment learnt from Mary that you were wounded at the late victory, so glorious to your army collectively and so honorable to yourself individually”. A letter dated at New York, August 14 states “…we had <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>last</b> week by a British deserter that the enemy was on their way to attack this city which gained some credit…the fortifications on Sandy Hook and Brooklin heights go on rapidly, the citizens volunteer with such alacrity that merchants, lawyers, doctors and divines are seen digging trenches. ” The British invasion of Washington in August 1814 is mentioned in a letter dated September 1. Arthur Gifford writes to his brother “…you have heard of the capture of Washington, this is rather disgraceful and I think plainly indicates something rotten in the Cabinet.

40|$|In last year's Mars Society {{convention}} {{we introduced}} {{the results of}} five years of studies of space launch capability for the second millennium. We concluded that Single Stage to Orbit (SSTO) vehicles such as the Delta Clipper X 33, and X 34 cannot make it to orbit from the Earth's surface. Whether taking off vertically or horizontally or landing vertically or horizontally, the rocket equations, the performance of available fuels, and {{the realities of the}} weight and strength of materials leave no margin for payload. The promised savings from SSTO systems are illusory. However, a configuration that is able to deliver useful payload to orbit is the Single step to Orbit, SsTO, a rocket plane that is released fully fueled, from 35, 000 to 40, 000 feet altitude. Three approaches have been proposed. The Hot'l and Molnya Corporation designs carry the fueled rocket plane to altitude {{on the back of a}} carrier aircraft. In this design the carrier aircraft is Russia's Antonov 225 the world's largest cargo plane. The rocket plane is a modified version of the Buran, Russia's own space shuttle. Another configuration is Kelly Aviation's concept in which the fully fueled rocket plane is towed to altitude by the cargo plane and then released. A third approach is based on the early "X" planes, which were dropped from the belly of the carrier plane. While the rocket equations indicate that these three concepts can deliver useful payloads, the Stanford review found significant advantages to the approach of Pioneer Rocket, in which the rocket plane flies up to the carrier plane with conventional jet engines, docks, and then loads on the oxidizer for the flight to orbit. This architecture has more reasonable abort modes in case of system failure in either aircraft and can deliver a larger final payload to orbit for a given sized carrier. The Stanford recommendation is that the carrier aircraft be the Antonov 225. A design based on this was presented in <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>last</b> year. Refinements to the design notably an improved re-entry cooling system and fueling stability analysis were done this year. More technical detail and a proposed international consortium to develop the SSTO is presented in another session of this year's Mars convention. We believe that there will be no human exploration of Mars based on the Shuttle or Expendable launch vehicles, and no resources available except for a cooperative international program. However, just as the world is learning to cooperate in peacekeeping, we hold out the hope that similar cooperation will develop for Mars exploration. With that in mind, this year we asked the question- "How will the human mission get to Mars if it has to use the SsTO for transportation?...|$|E

We positively identified 7245 deep moonquakes, more than a five-fold increase from the previous 1360. We also found at least 88 previously unknown deep-moonquake nests.
