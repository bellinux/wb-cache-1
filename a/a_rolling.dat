5000|$|Most authors use epitrochoid {{to mean a}} {{roulette}} of <b>a</b> circle <b>rolling</b> {{around the}} outside of another circle, hypotrochoid to mean a roulette of <b>a</b> circle <b>rolling</b> around the inside of another circle, and trochoid to mean a roulette of <b>a</b> circle <b>rolling</b> along <b>a</b> line. However, some authors (for example http://www.monmouth.com/~chenrich/Trochoids/Trochoids.html following F. Morley) use [...] "trochoid" [...] to mean a roulette of <b>a</b> circle <b>rolling</b> along another circle, though this is inconsistent with the more common terminology. The term Centered trochoid as adopted by http://www.mathcurve.com/courbes2d/trochoid/trochoidale.shtml combines epitrochoid and hypotrochoid into a single concept to streamline mathematical exposition and remains consistent with the existing standard.|$|R

Inflation gradually fell throughout 1980 to below 100%.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the evaluation, the Tri-partite pilots {{developed}} a typical sortie routine for the Kestrel of conducting short take-offs (STO) and returning to base on vertical landings. This manner of operation (STOVL) was judged to be the optimal practice. Operating from rough airstrips was also trialled at nearby RAF Bircham Newton, where the aircraft proved adept at traversing boggy ground and taking off from a variety of temporary ground coverings. During testing one aircraft was lost when a pilot tried to do <b>a</b> <b>rolling</b> take-off with the parking brake on; the evaluations were finalised in November 1965.|$|E
5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream. Its {{watershed}} {{is relatively}} narrow.

In Blakely, it follows Pennsylvania Route 347 closely and crosses it several times. A gas line crosses the creek upstream of US Route 6. There are several patches of wetlands in the watershed's upper reaches, and two more in the middle and lower reaches. Upstream of Blakely, the watershed contains forested land and pastures on <b>a</b> <b>rolling</b> plateau.|$|E
