5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes. On 39, Compton fell to <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> catch by Lindwall. Hutton managed to continue resisting before edging Miller to Tallon for 64, having top-scored in both innings, to leave England at 153/4. Thereafter, England collapsed in the fading light, prompting the umpires to call off play. The ground was then hit by rain, resulting in a premature end to the day's play. England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178/7.|$|E
5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator {{is applied to}} the glans penis to trigger <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E
5|$|Morris thus {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge with a century under his belt. He held his {{position}} {{at the top of}} the order along with Barnes, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. Morris bowled three overs for four runs in the first innings as England were bowled out for 165 on the first day after winning the toss and electing to bat. During the innings, Morris took <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> catch when Godfrey Evans hit a ball strongly, directly to him at short leg to leave England at 7/74.|$|E
5000|$|The {{withdrawal}} reflex (nociceptive or flexor withdrawal <b>reflex)</b> is <b>a</b> spinal <b>reflex</b> {{intended to}} protect the body from damaging stimuli. [...] Spinal reflexes are often monosynaptic and are mediated by <b>a</b> simple <b>reflex</b> arc. <b>A</b> withdrawal <b>reflex</b> is mediated by <b>a</b> polysynaptic <b>reflex</b> resulting in the stimulation of many motor neurons {{in order to give}} a quick response.|$|R

5|$|The {{effort to}} develop a lighter, quieter camera with <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> {{viewfinder}} led {{to the introduction of}} the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) in 1967. The camera could provide a shutter angle of up to 200 degrees. Many refinements were made to the PSR during the first few years after its introduction, and it soon {{became one of the most}} popular studio cameras in the world. Panavision also began manufacturing spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography, garnering a significant share of the market.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E
5|$|Sales of plug-in {{passenger}} cars, excluding imports, totaled 207,380 {{units in}} 2015, making China the world's best-selling plug-in electric car country market in 2015. The plug-in electric passenger car segment market share rose to 0.84% in 2015, up from 0.25% in 2014. The top selling passenger models in 2015 were the BYD Qin plug-in hybrid with 31,898 units sold, {{followed by the}} BYD Tang (18,375). As <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> of the explosive growth of the Chinese plug-in electric car market in 2015, BYD Auto ended 2015 as the world's best selling manufacturer of highway legal light-duty plug-in electric vehicles, with around 60,000 units sold, ahead of Tesla (50,580). During {{the first three quarters}} of 2016, BYD continued as the world's top selling plug-in car manufacturer with over 74,000 units delivered in China.|$|E
50|$|Dogs have <b>a</b> scratch <b>reflex,</b> {{meaning that}} they reflexively scratch an irritated skin region without {{direction}} from the brain. A limb (usually their hind leg) is extended to the irritated part of the body; because this is <b>a</b> spinal <b>reflex,</b> <b>a</b> dog will do this even if spinal connection to the brain is severed.|$|R

25|$|Two {{types of}} sensory fibers have cell {{bodies in the}} mesencephalic nucleus: {{proprioceptor}} fibers from the jaw and mechanoreceptor fibers from the teeth. Some of these incoming fibers go to the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (V), bypassing the pathways for conscious perception. The jaw jerk reflex is an example; tapping the jaw elicits <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> closure of the jaw {{in the same way}} that tapping the knee elicits <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> kick of the lower leg. Other incoming fibers from the teeth and jaws go to the main nucleus of V. This information is projected bilaterally to the thalamus and available for conscious perception.|$|E
25|$|An angle {{that is part}} of {{a simple}} polygon is called an {{interior}} angle if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon. A simple concave polygon has at least one interior angle that is <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> angle.|$|E
40|$|Neurological {{signs were}} {{assessed}} in 178 patients satisfying NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer's disease. <b>A</b> snout <b>reflex</b> {{was present in}} 4 1 %, extrapyramidal signs in 12 ° 0) drug-induced extrapyramidal signs in 3 ° 0) myoclonus in 5 °o, {{and a history of}} epileptic fits in 3 ° 0. <b>A</b> grasp <b>reflex,</b> extrapyramidal signs and symptoms were associated with severe cognitive impairment. On CT scanning, extrapyramidal signs were associated with increased 3 rd ventricular size and basal ganglia calcification, <b>a</b> grasp <b>reflex</b> with frontal lobe atrophy and a history of epilepsy with left temporal lobe atrophy. Lateral ventricular size was greater in patients developing <b>a</b> grasp <b>reflex</b> during <b>a</b> 1 2 month follow-up. Extrapyramidal signs and primitive reflexes were associated with a higher mortality...|$|R
50|$|Individuals {{with normal}} hearing have <b>an</b> {{acoustic}} <b>reflex</b> threshold (ART) around 70-100 dB SPL. People with {{conductive hearing loss}} (-i.e. bad transmission in the middle ear) have <b>a</b> higher acoustic <b>reflex</b> threshold.|$|R
50|$|Another {{significant}} difference between Hoffmann's reflex and the Babinski sign are their mechanism of reflex. Hoffman's <b>reflex</b> is <b>a</b> deep tendon <b>reflex</b> (spindle fibre) with <b>a</b> monosynaptic <b>reflex</b> pathway in Rexed lamina IX of the spinal cord. On the other hand, the plantar <b>reflex</b> is not <b>a</b> deep tendon <b>reflex,</b> and its pathway is both more complicated and not fully understood.|$|R
25|$|Hypercapnia {{normally}} triggers <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> {{which increases}} breathing {{and access to}} oxygen (O2), such as arousal and turning the head during sleep. A failure of this reflex can be fatal, for example as a contributory factor in sudden infant death syndrome.|$|E
25|$|An over-tight {{neck seal}} can put {{pressure}} on the carotid artery, causing <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> which slows the heart, resulting in poor oxygen delivery to the brain, light-headedness and eventual unconsciousness. For this reason, neck seals should be stretched or trimmed to the correct size.|$|E
25|$|Honey bee {{sensitivity}} to different concentrations of sucrose {{is determined by}} <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> known as the proboscis extension response or PER.

50|$|Oropharyngeal airways are {{indicated}} only in unconscious people, {{because of the}} likelihood that the device would stimulate <b>a</b> gag <b>reflex</b> in conscious or semi-conscious persons. This could result in vomit and potentially lead to an obstructed airway. Nasopharyngeal airways are mostly used instead as they do not stimulate <b>a</b> gag <b>reflex.</b>|$|R
25|$|In healthy humans (and {{many other}} animals) {{the process of}} {{urination}} is under voluntary control.

25|$|Blood-shift: Blood {{flow and}} volume is redistributed towards vital organs {{by means of}} <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> vasoconstriction. Blood vessels distend and become engorged, which {{in the case of}} the {{pulmonary}} capillaries assists with pressure compensation that comes with increasing diving depth, and without which a largely air-filled chest cavity would simply collapse for lack of compliance.|$|E
25|$|A {{person who}} is {{interested}} in having intercourse, and finds that her vagina responds with <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> that makes intercourse impossible, is likely to experience {{a wide range of}} emotions, from amazement to grief to embarrassment.

25|$|The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city {{is first}} {{recorded}} in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). It is mostly explained as a Slavic name of the dubrava type, referring to an oak grove or oak forest; but Putanec (1993) interprets it as a corruption of a name derived from Epidaurus (i.e. dubr- as <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> of -daur-).|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that ultrasound in the range emitted by bats causes flying moths to make evasive maneuvers because bats eat moths. Ultrasonic frequencies trigger <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> action in the noctuid moth that causes it to drop a few inches in its flight to evade attack. Tiger moths also emit clicks which can foil bats' echolocation.|$|E
25|$|With both {{having won}} their opening games – against Czechoslovakia and Romania, {{respectively}} – Brazil met England in the group's most famed match. Although Gordon Banks in the English goal denied Pelé from close range with <b>a</b> <b>reflex</b> save that Pelé himself {{cited as the}} greatest of his career, a second half goal from Jairzinho won the match for Brazil after England squandered several excellent opportunities to equalise. Both teams then won their final group games to progress to the knockout stage.|$|E
