5|$|Brown's main {{contribution}} to the game, however, was not {{to the development of}} new plays but to the organization and administration of teams. Before Brown, football was seen as a chaotic affair where winning was a product mostly of physical prowess. Few coaches took strategy and preparation seriously. Brown, by contrast, hired a full-time staff of assistants, tested his players on their intelligence and their knowledge of plays, instituted strict organization of practices <b>and</b> <b>analyzed</b> game film to get an edge on opponents. Brown created a detailed system for scouting college talent as a means to improve the Browns' college draft.|$|E
