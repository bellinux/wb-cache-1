50|$|ATR is a serine/threonine-specific {{protein kinase}} that is {{involved}} in sensing DNA damage and activating the DNA damage checkpoint, leading to cell cycle arrest. ATR is activated in response to persistent single-stranded DNA, which is a common intermediate formed during DNA damage detection and repair. Single-stranded DNA occurs at stalled replication forks and as an intermediate in DNA repair pathways such as nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination repair. ATR works with a partner protein called <b>ATRIP</b> to recognize single-stranded DNA coated with RPA. Once ATR is activated, it phosphorylates Chk1, initiating a signal transduction cascade that culminates in cell cycle arrest. In addition to its role in activating the DNA damage checkpoint, ATR is thought to function in unperturbed DNA replication.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} DNA-damage-signaling {{pathways}} that shelterin represses: the ATR kinase pathway, blocked by POT1, and the ATM kinase pathway, blocked by TRF2. In the ATR kinase pathway, ATR and <b>ATRIP</b> sense the presence of single-stranded DNA and induce a phosphorylation cascade that leads to cell cycle arrest. To prevent this signal, POT1 [...] "shelters" [...] the single-stranded region of telomeric DNA. The ATM kinase pathway, which starts from ATM and other proteins sensing double strand breaks, similarly ends with cell cycle arrest. TRF2 may also hide the ends of telomeres, just as POT1 hides the single-stranded regions. Another theory proposes the blocking of the signal downstream.

Their experiments suggested that hTIM plays an integral role in the G2/M and intra-S cell cycle checkpoints. With respect to the G2/M checkpoint, hTIM binds to the <b>ATRIP</b> subunit on ATR - a protein kinase sensitive to DNA damage. This binding between hTIM and ATR then leads to the phosphorylation of Chk1, resulting in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. This process serves as an important control to stop the proliferation of cells with DNA damage prior to mitotic division. The role of hTIM in the intra-S checkpoint is less clear at the molecular level; however, down-regulation of hTIM leads to an increase in the rate of generation of replication forks - even in the presence of DNA damage and other regulatory responses.|$|E

Deletion of the ssDNA–RPA interaction domain of <b>ATRIP</b> greatly diminished accumulation of <b>ATRIP</b> into foci. However, the ATRIP–RPA–ssDNA interaction is not sufficient for <b>ATRIP</b> recognition of DNA damage. A splice variant of <b>ATRIP</b> that cannot bind to ATR revealed that ATR association is also essential for proper <b>ATRIP</b> localization. Furthermore, the ATRIP–RPA–ssDNA interaction is not absolutely essential for ATR activation because ATR phosphorylates Chk 1 in cells expressing only a mutant of <b>ATRIP</b> that does not bind to RPA–ssDNA.

However, in egg extracts, only the RPA-dependent mode of binding to DNA can be detected. <b>ATRIP</b> adopts an oligomeric state in egg extracts that depends upon binding to ATR. In addition, ATR and <b>ATRIP</b> are mutually dependent on one another for stable binding to DNA in egg extracts. The ATR-dependent oligomerization of <b>ATRIP</b> does not require an intact coiled-coil domain in <b>ATRIP</b> and does not change in the presence of checkpoint-inducing DNA templates.

40|$|SummaryThe ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad 3 -related (ATR) kinase {{checkpoint}} pathway maintains genome integrity; {{however, the}} role of the sirtuin 2 (SIRT 2) acetylome in regulating this pathway is not clear. We found that deacetylation of ATR-interacting protein (<b>ATRIP),</b> a regulatory partner of ATR, by SIRT 2 potentiates the ATR checkpoint. SIRT 2 interacts with and deacetylates <b>ATRIP</b> at lysine 32 (K 32) in response to replication stress. SIRT 2 deacetylation of <b>ATRIP</b> at K 32 drives ATR autophosphorylation and signaling and facilitates DNA replication fork progression and recovery of stalled replication forks. K 32 deacetylation by SIRT 2 further promotes <b>ATRIP</b> accumulation to DNA damage sites and binding to replication protein A-coated single-stranded DNA (RPA-ssDNA). Collectively, these results support a model in which <b>ATRIP</b> deacetylation by SIRT 2 promotes ATR-ATRIP binding to RPA-ssDNA to drive ATR activation and thus facilitate recovery from replication stress, outlining a mechanism by which the ATR checkpoint is regulated by SIRT 2 through deacetylation...|$|E
40|$|ATR (ATM and Rad 3 -related), a PI kinase-related kinase (PIKK), {{has been}} implicated in the DNA {{structure}} checkpoint in mammalian cells. ATR associates with its partner protein <b>ATRIP</b> to form a functional complex in the nucleus.

The expression of dimerization-defective <b>ATRIP</b> diminishes the maintenance of replication forks during treatment with replication inhibitors. By contrast, it does not compromise the G 2 /M checkpoint after IR-induced DNA damage. These results show that there are two critical functions of ATR-ATRIP after the exposure to genotoxic stress: maintenance of the integrity of replication machinery and execution of cell cycle arrest, which are separable and are achieved via distinct mechanisms.

40|$|The ATR (ATM and Rad 3 -related) kinase is {{essential}} to maintain genomic integrity. ATR is recruited to DNA lesions in part through its association with ATR-interacting protein (<b>ATRIP),</b> which in turn interacts with the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA (replication protein A). In this study, a conserved checkpoint protein recruitment domain (CRD) in <b>ATRIP</b> orthologs was identified by biochemical mapping of the RPA binding site in combination with nuclear magnetic resonance, mutagenesis, and computational modeling. Mutations in the CRD of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>ATRIP</b> ortholog Ddc 2 disrupt the Ddc 2 -RPA interaction, prevent proper localization of Ddc 2 to DNA breaks, sensitize yeast to DNA-damaging agents, and partially compromise checkpoint signaling.

40|$|Although the {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) genome might be {{expected}} to induce a DNA damage response, the ATR kinase is not activated in infected cells. We previously proposed that spatial uncoupling of ATR from its interaction partner, <b>ATRIP,</b> could be the basis for inactivation of the ATR kinase in infected cells; however, we now show that ATR and <b>ATRIP</b> are in fact both recruited to HSV- 1 replication compartments and can be coimmunoprecipitated from infected-cell lysates. <b>ATRIP</b> and replication protein A (RPA) are recruited to the earliest detectable prereplicative sites, stage II microfoci. In a normal cellular DNA damage response, ATR/ATRIP are recruited to stretches of RPA-coated single-stranded DNA in an RPA- and kinase-dependent manner, resulting in the phosphorylation of RPA by ATR in damage foci. In contrast, in HSV- 1 -infected cells, RPA is not phosphorylated, and endogenous phosphorylated RPA is excluded from stage II microfoci; in addition, the recruitment of ATR/ATRIP is independent of RPA and the kinase activity of ATR. Furthermore, we show that ATR/ATRIP play a beneficial role in viral gene expression and virus production. Although ICP 0 {{has been shown to be}} important for partial inactivation of other cellular DNA repair pathways, we show that ICP 0 is not responsible for the inactivation of ATR signaling and, furthermore, that neither ATR nor <b>ATRIP</b> is a target of ICP 0 degradation.

Mutations in the mismatch-binding domain of MSH 3 abolish the binding of MutSβ to DNA hairpin loops and its ability to promote ATR activation by ssDNA.

Here, we provide the first identification of a Seckel Syndrome patient with mutations in <b>ATRIP,</b> the gene encoding ATR-Interacting Protein (<b>ATRIP),</b> the partner protein of ATR required for ATR stability and recruitment {{to the site of}} DNA damage. The patient has compound heterozygous mutations in <b>ATRIP</b> resulting in reduced <b>ATRIP</b> and ATR expression. A nonsense mutational change in one <b>ATRIP</b> allele results in a C-terminal truncated protein, which impairs ATR-ATRIP interaction; the other allele is abnormally spliced. We additionally describe two further unrelated patients native to the UK with the same novel, heterozygous mutations in ATR, which cause dramatically reduced ATR expression. All patient-derived cells showed defective DNA damage responses that can be attributed to impaired ATR-ATRIP function. Seckel Syndrome is characterised by microcephaly and growth delay, features also displayed by several related disorders including Majewski (microcephalic) osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (MOPD) type II and Meier-Gorlin Syndrome (MGS). The identification of an ATRIP-deficient patient provides a novel genetic defect for Seckel Syndrome. Coupled with the identification of further ATR-deficient patients, our findings allow a spectrum of clinical features that can be ascribed to the ATR-ATRIP deficient sub-class of Seckel Syndrome. ATR-ATRIP patients are characterised by extremely severe microcephaly and growth delay, microtia (small ears), micrognathia (small and receding chin), and dental crowding. While aberrant bone development was mild in the original ATR-SS patient, some of the patients described here display skeletal abnormalities including, in one patient, small patellae, a feature characteristically observed in Meier-Gorlin Syndrome.

40|$|When DNA {{replication}} is stalled {{at sites}} of DNA damage, {{a cascade of}} responses is activated in the cell to halt cell cycle progression and promote DNA repair. A pathway initiated by the kinase Ataxia teleangiectasia and Rad 3 related (ATR) and its partner ATR interacting protein (<b>ATRIP)</b> {{plays an important role}} in this response. The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is also activated following genomic stress, and defects in this pathway cause a cancer-prone hematologic disorder in humans. Little is known about how these two pathways are coordinated.

In cells lacking the core complex, ATR-mediated phosphorylation of two functional response targets, <b>ATRIP</b> and FANCI, is defective. We also provide evidence that the canonical ATR activation pathway involving RAD 17 and TOPBP 1 is largely dispensable for the FA pathway activation.

40|$|ATM and ATR are two {{redundant}} checkpoint kinases {{essential for}} the stable maintenance of telomeres in eukaryotes. Previous studies have established that MRN (Mre 11 -Rad 50 -Nbs 1) and <b>ATRIP</b> (ATR Interacting Protein) interact with ATM and ATR, respectively, and recruit their partner kinases to sites of DNA damage. Here, we investigated how Tel 1 (ATM) and Rad 3 (ATR) recruitment to telomeres is regulated in fission yeast. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays unexpectedly revealed that the MRN complex could {{also contribute to the}} recruitment of Tel 1 (ATM) to telomeres independently of the previously established Nbs 1 C-terminal Tel 1 (ATM) interaction domain. Recruitment of Tel 1 (ATM) to telomeres in nbs 1 -c 60 Delta cells, which lack the C-terminal 60 amino acid Tel 1 (ATM) interaction domain of Nbs 1, was dependent on Rad 3 (ATR) -Rad 26 (<b>ATRIP),</b> but the kinase domain of Rad 3 (ATR) was dispensable. Thus, our results establish that the Rad 3 (ATR) -Rad 26 (<b>ATRIP)</b> complex contributes to the recruitment of Tel 1 (ATM) independently of Rad 3 (ATR) kinase activity, by a mechanism redundant with the Tel 1 (ATM) interaction domain of Nbs 1. Furthermore, we found that the N-terminus of Nbs 1 contributes to the recruitment of Rad 3 (ATR) -Rad 26 (<b>ATRIP)</b> to telomeres. In response to replication stress, mammalian ATR-ATRIP also contributes to ATM activation by a mechanism that is dependent on the MRN complex but independent of the C-terminal ATM interaction domain of Nbs 1. Since telomere protection and DNA damage response mechanisms are very well conserved between fission yeast and mammalian cells, mammalian ATR-ATRIP may also contribute to the recruitment of ATM to telomeres and to sites of DNA damage independently of ATR kinase activity...|$|E

Here, we show that <b>ATRIP</b> contains a TopBP 1 -interacting region that {{is necessary for the}} association of TopBP 1 and ATR, for TopBP 1 -mediated activation of ATR, and for cells to survive and recover DNA synthesis following replication stress. We demonstrate that this region is functionally conserved in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>ATRIP</b> ortholog Ddc 2, suggesting a conserved mechanism of regulation. In addition, we identify a domain of ATR that is critical for its activation by TopBP 1. Mutations of the ATR PRD (PIKK [phosphoinositide 3 -kinase related kinase] Regulatory Domain) do not affect the basal kinase activity of ATR but prevent its activation. Cellular complementation experiments demonstrate that TopBP 1 -mediated ATR activation is required for checkpoint signaling and cellular viability. The PRDs of ATM and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) were shown previously to regulate the activities of these kinases, and our data indicate that the DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit) PRD is important for DNA-PKcs regulation.

Bid is found with replication protein A (RPA) in nuclear foci and associates with the Atr/Atr-interacting protein (<b>Atrip)</b> /RPA complex following replicative stress. Furthermore, Bid-deficient cells show an impaired response to replicative stress manifest by reduced accumulation of Atr and <b>Atrip</b> on chromatin and at DNA damage foci, reduced recovery of DNA synthesis following replicative stress, and decreased checkpoint kinase 1 activation and RPA phosphorylation.

40|$|ATR is an {{essential}} protein that functions as a damage sensor and a proximal kinase in the DNA damage checkpoint response in mammalian cells.

Recently, it was found that ATM is an oligomeric protein that is converted to an active monomeric form by phosphorylation in trans upon DNA damage, and this raised the possibility that other members of the PIKK family may be regulated in a similar manner. Here we show that ATR is a monomeric protein associated with a smaller protein called <b>ATRIP</b> with moderate affinity. The ATR protein by itself or in the form of the ATR-ATRIP heterodimer binds to naked or replication protein A (RPA) -covered DNAs with comparable affinities.

40|$|ATR kinase {{activation}} {{requires the}} recruitment of the ATR-ATRIP and RAD 9 -HUS 1 -RAD 1 (9 - 1 - 1) checkpoint complexes to sites of DNA damage or replication stress. Replication protein A (RPA) bound to single-stranded DNA is {{at least part of}} the molecular recognition element that recruits these checkpoint complexes. We have found that the basic cleft of the RPA 70 N-terminal oligonucleotide-oligosaccharide fold (OB-fold) domain is a key determinant of checkpoint activation. This protein-protein interaction surface is able to bind several checkpoint proteins, including <b>ATRIP,</b> RAD 9, and MRE 11. RAD 9 binding to RPA is mediated by an acidic peptide within the C-terminal RAD 9 tail that has sequence similarity to the primary RPA-binding surface in the checkpoint recruitment domain (CRD) of <b>ATRIP.</b> Mutation of the RAD 9 CRD impairs its localization to sites of DNA damage or replication stress without perturbing its ability to form the 9 - 1 - 1 complex or bind the ATR activator TopBP 1. Disruption of the RAD 9 -RPA interaction also impairs ATR signaling to CHK 1 and causes hypersensitivity to both DNA damage and replication stress. Thus, the basic cleft of the RPA 70 N-terminal OB-fold domain binds multiple checkpoint proteins, including RAD 9, to promote ATR signaling...|$|E
40|$|ATR kinase is a {{critical}} upstream regulator of the checkpoint response to various forms of DNA damage. Previous {{studies have shown that}} ATR is recruited via its binding partner ATR-interacting protein (<b>ATRIP)</b> to replication protein A (RPA) -covered single-stranded DNA (RPA-ssDNA) generated at sites of DNA damage where ATR is then activated by TopBP 1 to phosphorylate downstream targets including the Chk 1 signal transducing kinase. However, this critical feature of the human ATR-initiated DNA damage checkpoint signaling has not been demonstrated in a defined system. Here we describe an in vitro checkpoint system in which RPA-ssDNA and TopBP 1 are essential for phosphorylation of Chk 1 by the purified ATR-ATRIP complex. Checkpoint defective RPA mutants fail to activate ATR kinase in this system, supporting the conclusion that this system is a faithful representation of the in vivo reaction. Interestingly, we find that an alternative form of RPA (aRPA), which does not support DNA replication, can substitute for the checkpoint function of RPA in vitro, thus revealing a potential role for aRPA in the activation of ATR kinase. We also find that TopBP 1 is recruited to RPA-ssDNA in a manner dependent on <b>ATRIP</b> and that the N terminus of TopBP 1 is required for efficient recruitment and activation of ATR kinase...|$|E
40|$|Human histone H 2 AX {{is rapidly}} {{phosphorylated}} on serine 139 {{in response to}} DNA double-strand breaks and {{plays a crucial role}} in tethering the factors involved in DNA repair and damage signaling. Replication stress caused by hydroxyurea or UV also initiates H 2 AX phosphorylation in S-phase cells, although UV induced H 2 AX phosphorylation in non-cycling cells has recently been observed. Here we study the UV induced H 2 AX phosphorylation in human primary fibroblasts under growth-arrested conditions. This reaction absolutely depends on nucleotide excision repair (NER) and is mechanistically distinct from the replication stress-induced phosphorylation. The treatment of cytosine-β-D-arabinofuranoside strikingly enhances the NER-dependent H 2 AX phosphorylation and induces the accumulation of replication protein A (RPA) and ATR-interacting protein (<b>ATRIP)</b> at locally UV-damaged subnuclear regions. Consistently, the phosphorylation appears to be mainly mediated by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad 3 -related (ATR), although Chk 1 (Ser 345) is not phosphorylated by the activated ATR. The cellular levels of DNA polymerases δ and ε and proliferating cell nuclear antigen are markedly reduced in quiescent cells. We propose a model that perturbed gap-filling synthesis following dual incision in NER generates single-strand DNA gaps and hence initiates H 2 AX phosphorylation by ATR with the aid of RPA and <b>ATRIP...</b>|$|E

The ATR-Chk 1 checkpoint pathway is activated by UV-induced DNA lesions and replication stress. Little was known about the spatio and temporal behaviour of the proteins involved, and we, therefore, examined the behaviour of the ATRIP-ATR and Rad 9 -Rad 1 -Hus 1 putative DNA damage sensor complexes and the downstream effector kinase Chk 1. We developed assays for the generation and validation of stable cell lines expressing GFP-fusion proteins. Photobleaching experiments in living cells expressing these fusions indicated that after UV-induced DNA damage, <b>ATRIP</b> associates more transiently with damaged chromatin than members of the Rad 9 -Rad 1 -Hus 1 complex. Interestingly, <b>ATRIP</b> directly associated with locally induced UV damage, whereas Rad 9 bound in a cooperative manner, which {{can be explained by}} the Rad 17 -dependent loading of Rad 9 onto damaged chromatin. Although Chk 1 dissociates from the chromatin upon UV damage, no change in the mobility of GFP-Chk 1 was observed, supporting the notion that Chk 1 is a highly dynamic protein. 1...|$|E
