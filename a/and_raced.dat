5|$|The {{defenders}} in {{the cattle}} pen retreated into the horse corral. After discharging their weapons, the {{small band of}} Texians scrambled over the low wall, circled behind the church <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> on foot for the east prairie, which appeared empty. As the Mexican cavalry advanced on the group, Almaron Dickinson and his artillery crew turned a cannon around and fired into the cavalry, probably inflicting casualties. Nevertheless, all of the escaping Texians were killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{teams were}} as evenly matched {{in the third}} quarter as they had been in the first, with Vanderbilt gaining only two first downs. Soon after the start of the fourth quarter Neely intercepted a pass, weaving for a 25-yeard return to Georgia's 40-yard line. Two long pass {{attempts}} failed, and Thomas Ryan lined up to punt. Rupert Smith sneaked in behind Ryan, rushing to recover the 25-yard onside kick from scrimmage. Smith jumped up to get the ball from a horde of Bulldogs after they let it bounce, <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> for a 15-yard touchdown. After he added an extra point, the game ended in a 7–7 tie.|$|E
5|$|As {{the time}} went past 90 minutes, {{an injury to}} Kevin Richardson held up play. TV cameras showed Liverpool midfielder Steve McMahon telling his team-mates there was one minute remaining. The injury itself meant there would, in fact, be two minutes and 39 seconds of injury time played. Liverpool adopted time-wasting tactics, {{including}} an unnecessary backpass from McMahon to Grobbelaar. In the second minute of injury time, Arsenal launched their final attack. A Barnes run was intercepted by Richardson, and he passed the ball back to his goalkeeper John Lukic. Lukic bowled the ball out to Dixon, his long ball to Alan Smith was flicked on, finding Michael Thomas charging through the midfield. Thomas evaded a challenge by Nicol <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> into the penalty area, slipping the ball past the advancing Grobbelaar to score Arsenal's second.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Raglan wished to {{reinforce}} the Turks and British infantry, and ordered Lucan to detach {{four of the five}} Heavy Brigade cavalry regiments and send them to the defensive line. This further angered Lucan, since splitting the force in half merely reduced the cavalry's overall effectiveness, but he again complied. The result was that the first fork of the Russian cavalry attack encountered The Thin Red Line and were driven off, while the second fork, crossing the heights above the plain, encountered four regiments of the Heavy Brigade. The Russians – with between 1,500 and 2,000 men – were initially surprised to see the 800 British cavalry approaching, allowing Scarlett, the commander of the Heavy Brigades, to charge the Russians uphill. By this point Lucan had left Lord Cardigan in charge of the Light Brigade <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> over to the Heavies, later claiming that his duty trumpeter had ordered the British charge, which eventually forced the Russians to flee.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, George Washington owned <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> a Narragansett Pacer, {{while in}} 1772, Edmund Burke asked an American friend for a pair. Paul Revere {{possibly}} rode a Pacer during his 1775 ride {{to warn the}} Americans of a British march. The extinction was due mainly to the breed being sold in such large numbers to sugarcane planters in the West Indies that breeding stock was severely diminished in the United States. The few horses that were left were crossbred to create and improve other breeds and the pure strain of the Narragansett soon became extinct. North Carolina was also a noted to have breeders of the Narragansett, with breeding stock having {{been brought to the}} area as early as 1790 by early pioneers. The last known Pacer, a mare, died around 1880.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Formby Sr {{allowed his}} son to appear on screen, taking the lead in By the Shortest of Heads, a thriller {{directed}} by Bert Haldane in which Formby played a stable boy who outwits a gang of villains and wins a £10,000 prize when he comes first in a horse race. The film is now considered lost, with the last-known copy having been destroyed in 1940. Later in 1915, and with {{the closure of the}} English racing season because of the First World War, Formby moved to Ireland where he continued as a jockey until November 1918. Later that month he returned to England <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> for Lord Derby at his Newmarket stables. Formby continued as a jockey until 1921, although he never won a race.|$|E

40|$|Glutamate {{racemase}} {{activity in}} Bacillus anthracis is of significant interest {{with respect to}} chemotherapeutic drug design, because l-glutamate stereoisomerization to d-glutamate is predicted to be closely associated with peptidoglycan and capsule biosynthesis, which are important for growth and virulence, respectively. In contrast to most bacteria, which harbor a single glutamate racemase gene, the genomic sequence of B. anthracis predicts two genes encoding glutamate racemases, <b>racE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>racE</b> 2. To evaluate whether <b>racE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>racE</b> 2 encode functional glutamate racemases, we cloned <b>and</b> expressed <b>racE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>racE</b> 2 in Escherichia coli. Size exclusion chromatography of the two purified recombinant proteins suggested differences in their quaternary structures, as RacE 1 eluted primarily as a monomer, while RacE 2 demonstrated characteristics of a higher-order species. Analysis of purified recombinant <b>RacE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>RacE</b> 2 revealed that the two proteins catalyze the reversible stereoisomerization of l-glutamate and d-glutamate with similar, but not identical, steady-state kinetic properties. Analysis of the pH dependence of l-glutamate stereoisomerization suggested that <b>RacE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>RacE</b> 2 both possess two titratable active site residues important for catalysis. Moreover, directed mutagenesis of predicted active site residues resulted in complete attenuation of the enzymatic activities of both <b>RacE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>RacE</b> 2. Homology modeling of <b>RacE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>RacE</b> 2 revealed potential differences within the active site pocket that might affect the design of inhibitory pharmacophores. These results suggest that <b>racE</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>racE</b> 2 encode functional glutamate racemases with similar, but not identical, active site features...|$|R
5|$|O'Brien {{grew up in}} {{the rural}} town of Wellington, 360 {{kilometres}} (225 miles) from Sydney. Neither of his parents were skilled swimmers. His father Roy knew only one swimming stroke—the breaststroke—and his mother Thelma did not take her first swimming lesson until she was 55. O'Brien's sister Ann was a talented swimmer in her childhood years, but she preferred horseback riding. The local pool was an old-style facility that had no pump system and was only manually drained once a week. Aged four, O'Brien got his first swimming lessons from the local Learn to Swim program. There were not many non-sporting activities for children in Wellington, and O'Brien played basketball and rugby league, did athletics and swimming, and rode horses. In 1954, a chlorinated pool was built in the town, leading to the formation of Wellington Swimming Club. At the age of 10, O'Brien began competitive swimming under local coach Bert Eslick, <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> in regional country swimming carnivals at Dubbo, Bathurst and Orange.|$|E
5|$|On September 2009, Glickenhaus {{announced}} {{his intention to}} race {{a new version of}} the P4/5 in the 2010 24 Hours Nürburgring. The car, called the P4/5 Competizione, would not be a conversion of his road car but instead an entirely new car with a Ferrari chassis, VIN and drivetrain. On May 2010 however, it was revealed that the Competizione would in fact be raced in 2011, based on a 430 Scuderia. It would be built to FIA GT2 standards <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> by Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus in an Experimental Class under the direction of Paolo Garella, former Head of Special Projects at Pininfarina. Ferrari completely distanced themselves from the P4/5 Competizione project in 2011, refusing to sell the team parts for vital engine rebuilds between races. The car finished 39th in the 2011 24 Hours Nürburgring (after bursting into flames) and in 2012 won its class and finished 12th overall.|$|E
5|$|Rush {{was unique}} in early Australian {{sculling}} {{in that he}} provided opportunities for others to compete and excel, by organising regattas and other rowing events, though financially he gained little. He raised <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> horses, organised athletic carnivals, and was a generous supporter of charities, churches, and schools. His background {{as the son of}} Irish tenant farmers, a class traditionally debarred by law from owning land and hence accumulating wealth, gave Rush little understanding of the management of money. Rush and his wife had fourteen children, and the Rush family lived in grand, if not extravagant style; most Rush enterprises were financed by mortgages or promissory notes. When the Banks Crash of 1893 came, Rush was not only deeply in debt, he did not even own the house he lived in.|$|E
50|$|These {{bearings}} {{make use}} of both ceramic balls <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> These bearings are impervious to corrosion and rarely require lubrication if at all.

5|$|To {{accomplish}} her goal, Varian {{sought the}} assistance of British horse breeder Patricia Lindsay, who traveled to Poland and purchased three mares on Varian's behalf. The mares arrived in California in December 1961. They were Bachantka (sired by Wielki Szlem out of Balalajka, who was by Amurath Sahib), purchased from the Albigowa stud; Ostroga (Duch × Orda by Omar 11), from the Nowy Dwór stud; and Naganka (Bad Afas × Najada by Fetysz), from the Michalow stud. Bachantka and Naganka had been trained <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> in Poland. Bachantka had a record of 2/15 (0-1-3), and Naganka a record of 2/12 (3-4-1). After her arrival in the USA, Bachantka also had a brief but successful horse show career.|$|E
5|$|Once the commandos {{finally got}} out of the tunnel, they both swam towards the {{broadside}} of Card which anchored near the opening of the sewer. As planned, Nao and Hung attached two bombs on the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the engine compartment, just above the water surface. After the bombs had been attached to Cards hull, Nao inspected both bombs to ensure they had been assembled properly. After that Nao stuck the battery onto a pole and connected it to the bombs with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated back into the sewer tunnel, and climbed into their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police patrol boat was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the patrol boat, an explosion was heard and a bright light could be seen in the commercial port area. The South Vietnamese police patrol boat than started its engine <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe.|$|E
5|$|Smith also {{purchased}} <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> Thoroughbred horses {{under the}} name Pleasant Valley Stable. His racing colors during the early 1890s were royal-purple and canary yellow. Smith's brother, Bill, became his principal horse trainer during the 1890s and early 1900s. One of his most successful horses was a two-year-old bay colt named King Cadmus. Smith purchased King Cadmus as a yearling in 1890 for $4,000 at the stable dispersal sale of the late August Belmont. The colt was a son of Kingfisher and was a full brother to another popular racehorse named King Crab. The horse only won two races in his entire racing career, but Smith won $195,000 from Cadmus' two victories. The first win occurred on September 3, 1891 at Sheepshead Bay Race Track and resulted in Smith winning approximately $115,000, which was the largest payout from a horse race recorded in the US at that time. Cadmus' other win occurred at Morris Park Racetrack in 1892 with Smith netting another $80,000. King Cadmus was a fast runner {{but he had a}} vicious temperament, seriously injuring several of Smith's employees, in addition to weak legs and was sold as a three-year-old in 1892.|$|E
40|$|Background: A human {{proteome}} {{is relatively}} dynamic compared with its corresponding genome. Our {{aim was to}} study the heterogeneity of a human pituitary proteome {{as a function of}} gender, age, <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> Methods: Pituitary control tissues (n � 8) were used to extract proteins; each control tissue was analyzed (n � 3 – 5) with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DGE) and PDQuest software. We obtained 30 high-resolution 2 DGE gels and conducted a comparative analysis as a function of gender, age, <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionizationquadrupole-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry were used to characterize the protein in each differential spot. Results: We detected � 1000 protein spots in each 2 DGE map, and 51 differential spots (7 differing with gender, 17 with age, 15 with <b>race,</b> <b>and</b> 12 with the coeffect of age <b>and</b> <b>race).</b> Among those 51, we characterized 28 proteins [5 differing with gender, 8 with age, 6 with race, 8 with the coeffect of age <b>and</b> <b>race,</b> <b>and</b> 1 (somatotropin chain 1) with all of these]. Somatotropin was related to gender, age, <b>and</b> <b>race,</b> <b>and</b> prolactin was higher in females than males. The differentially expressed proteins that were related to age were mainly those proteins associated with cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and death; those proteins showed no difference with gender <b>and</b> <b>race.</b> Age <b>and</b> <b>race</b> affected some proteins associated with hormone regulation (e. g., follistatin, thyroid hormone receptor �- 2, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G � protein).

5|$|The {{conditions}} for the race were dry, with a capacity crowd of some 40,000 fans turning out to watch the race. The drivers took to the track on Sunday morning for a 30-minute warm-up session. Both Williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying; Coulthard was fastest with teammate Hill in second. Schumacher completed the top three positions. Herbert and Katayama both suffered from gearbox problems with their race cars, and elected to start the race with their teams' spare cars. The Simtek team did not {{take part in the}} session, as both drivers waited for stronger suspension components flown out from the United Kingdom to be fitted to the cars for the race. Minutes before the race started, a press release from the FIA was given to all media and team personnel, notifying them that the chromatographic analysis of the Elf fuel samples taken from Schumacher's Benetton and the Coulthard's Williams during qualifying did not match the sample provided by the fuel company {{before the start of the}} season for reference purposes, thus rendering both cars illegal. Both teams were fined $30,000 <b>and</b> <b>raced</b> under appeal, as the standard penalty for the offence was disqualification from the event. Neither Schumacher nor Coulthard were informed of the situation, as the teams did not want to unsettle their drivers before the race start. Hill and Herbert's races were not affected by the judgement, despite using the same type of fuel. Samples from Ferrari's Agip and McLaren's Mobil fuel were also tested; both were in accordance with the regulations. Though 26cars qualified for the race, only 25 took the start: Martini retired on the parade lap, his Minardi car suffering a gearbox problem.|$|E
