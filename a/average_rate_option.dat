"July 2011 "Financial derivatives have had a phenomenal growth in trading and research in the last three decades. New markets, with niche products have created interesting trading opportunities. The Tokyo Grain Exchange created a non-GMO soybean futures market in 2001, yet have delayed in creating an options market to accompany the futures contract. The non-GMO soybean market is thinly traded and has possible price manipulations. Also the market suffers from high volatility. Therefore an exotic derivative could benefit this market highly. Through mathematically simulation two Asian (<b>averaging)</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> are compared through measures of dispersion to the Black-Scholes option and the futures market. The research proves that <b>averaging</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> consistently had lower income volatility as well as increased stability in yearly fluctuations over the actual futures contract. This study has also displayed that thinly traded markets can have large variances in the futures price near-contract maturation. Lastly the study has shown with the high fluctuation in soybean prices near contract maturity, an <b>averaging</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> can help protect against possible market manipulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a discrete-time two-factor model {{of interest rates}} with analytical solutions for bonds and many interest rate derivatives when the volatility of the short rate follows a GARCH process that can be correlated {{with the level of}} the short rate itself. Besides bond and bond futures, the model yields analytical solutions for prices of European options on discount bonds (and futures) as well as other interest rate derivatives such as caps, floors, <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options,</b> yield curve options, etc. The advantage of our discrete-time model over continuous-time stochastic volatility models is that volatility is an observable function {{of the history of the}} spot rate and is easily (and exactly) filtered from the discrete observations of a chosen short rate/bond prices. Another advantage of our discrete-time model is that for derivatives like <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options,</b> the <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> can be exactly computed because, in practice, the payoff at maturity is based on the <b>average</b> of <b>rates</b> that can be observed only at discrete time intervals.; Calibrating our two-factor model to the treasury yield curve (eight different maturities) for a few randomly chosen intervals in the period 1990 – 96, we find that the two-factor version does not improve (statistically and economically) upon the nested one-factor model (which is a discrete-time version of the Vasicek 1977 model) in terms of pricing the cross section of spot bonds. This occurs although the one-factor model is rejected in favor of the two-factor model in explaining the time-series properties of the short rate. However, the implied volatilities from the Black model (a one-factor model) for options on discount bonds exhibit a smirk if option prices are generated by our model using the parameter estimates obtained as above. Thus, our results indicate that the effects of random volatility of the short rate are manifested mostly in bond option prices rather than in bond prices.

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a method to compute {{the density of the}} {{arithmetic}} average of a Markov process. This approach is then applied to the pricing of <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> (Asian options). It is demonstrated that as long as a closed form formula is available for the discount bond price when the underlying process is treated as the riskless interest rate, analytical formulas for the density function of the arithmetic average and the Asian option price can be derived. This includes the affine class of term structure models. The Cox et al. (1985) square root interest rate process is used as an example. When the underlying process follows a geometric Brownian motion, a very efficient numerical method is proposed for computing the density function of the average. Extensions of the techniques to the cases of multiple state variables are also discussed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{collection}} of functions to valuate Asian options. Asian options are path-dependent options, with payoffs that depend on the average price of the underlying asset or the average exercise price. There are two categories or types of Asian options: <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> (also known as average price options) and average strike options. The payoffs depend on the average price of the underly-ing asset over a predetermined time period. An average is less volatile than the underlying asset, therefore making Asian options less expensive than standard European options. Asian options are commonly used in currency and commodity markets. Asian options are of interest in markets with thinly traded assets. Due to the little effect it will have on the option’s value, options based on an average, such as Asian options, have a reduced incentive to manipulate the underlying price at expiration. The functions are...|$|R
40|$|The normal inverse Gaussian {{process has}} been used to model both stock returns and {{interest}} rate processes. Although several numerical methods are available to compute, for instance, VaR and derivatives val-ues, these are in a relatively undeveloped state compared to the techniques available in the Gaussian case. This paper shows how a Monte Carlo valuation method may be used with the NIG process, incorporating stratified sampling together with an inverse Gaussian bridge. The method is illustrated by pricing <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options.</b> We find the method is up to around 200 times faster than plain Monte Carlo. These efficiency gains are similar to those found in a related paper, Ribeiro and Webber (02) [20], which developes an analogous method for the variance-gamma process. ∗Corresponding author.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} pricing of options when a need arises {{to carry a}} path {{dependent}} auxiliary state variable. Examples of such problems include the pricing of interest rate claims in a Heath Jarrow Morton paradigm, where the underlying forward rates follow a Markovian process, and the pricing of equity options, when the underlying asset price follows a GARCH process. In the former case, the primary state variable is the spot interest rate, and the auxiliary state variable is the accrued variance of the current spot rate. In the latter case, the primary state variable is the asset price, and the auxiliary state variable is the path dependent statistic representing local volatility. An efficient algorithm is developed for pricing claims under these type of processes. Illustrative examples are presented that demonstrate {{the efficiency of the}} algorithm and conditions are developed that ensure the algorithm will produce accurate prices. This article is concerned with the efficient pricing of contingent claims when a need arises to carry a path dependent auxiliary state variable. These problems are often encountered when pricing specialized derivative claims such as <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options,</b> where the auxiliary state variable is the average price to date, or lookback options, where the auxiliary state variabl...|$|R
40|$|Arithmetic Asian or <b>average</b> price (<b>rate)</b> <b>options</b> deliver payoffs {{based on}} the average {{underlying}} price over a pre-speciÞed time period. Asian options are an important family of derivative contracts {{with a wide variety}} of applications in cur-rency, equity, interest rate, commodity, energy, and insurance markets. We derive two analytical formulae for the price of the arithmetic Asian option when the underlying asset price follows geometric Brownian motion. The mathematics of the Asian option turns out to be related to the Schrödinger equation with Morse (1929) potential. Our derivation relies on the spectral theory of singular Sturm-Liouville (Schrödinger) operators and associated eigenfunction expansions. The Þrst formula is an inÞnite series of terms involving Whittaker functions M and W. The sec-ond formula is a single real integral of an expression involving Whittaker function W plus (for some parameter values) a Þnite number of additional terms involving incomplete Gamma functions and Laguerre polynomials. The two formulae allow exact computation of Asian option prices...|$|R
40|$|The Variance-Gamma {{model has}} {{analytical}} formulae for {{the values of}} European calls and puts. These formulae have to be computed using numerical methods. In general, option valuation may {{require the use of}} numerical methods including PDE methods, lattice methods, and Monte Carlo methods. We investigate the use of Monte Carlo methods in the Variance-Gamma model. We demonstrate how a gamma bridge process can be constructed. Using the bridge together with stratified sampling we obtain consider-able speed improvements over a plain Monte Carlo method when pricing path-dependent options. The method is illustrated by pricing lookback, <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> and barrier <b>options</b> in the Variance-Gamma model. We find the method is up to around 400 times faster than plain Monte Carlo. ∗Corresponding author.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{issues in}} discretization and variance reduction methods for Monte Carlo simulation. For the discretization methods, we investigate the convergence properties of various Itˆo-Taylor schemes {{and the strong}} Taylor expansion (Siopacha and Teichmann [77]) for the LIBOR market model. We also provide an improvement on the strong Taylor expansion method which produces lower pricing bias. For the variance reduction methods, we have four contributions. Firstly, we formulate a general stochastic volatility model nesting many existing models in the literature. Secondly, we construct a correlation control variate for this model. Thirdly, we apply the model {{as well as the}} new control variate to pricing <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> and barrier <b>options.</b> Numerical results demonstrate the improvement over using old control variates alone. Last but not least, with the help of our model and control variate, we explore the variations in barrier option pricing consistent with the implied volatility surface.

40|$|In recent years, Indian {{corporates}} {{and institutions}} have issued {{a large number}} of exotic bonds with a variety of embedded interest <b>rate</b> <b>options.</b> Pricing the embedded interest <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> is a pre-requisite for valuing these bonds. The pricing of interest <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> is quite complex and depends crucially on the dynamics of interest rates. International studies show that no model of these dynamics is valid world-wide. Drawing on the author’s earlier study of Indian interest rate dynamics (Varma, 1996), this paper expounds a practical methodology for pricing interest <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> in India and valuing bonds with embedded interest <b>rate</b> <b>options.</b> The Black-Derman-Toy model (Black et al., 1994) is shown to be the most attractive tool for valuing interest <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> in India. A real-life application of the proposed approach shows its practical usability in valuing complex instruments with multiple embedded options. This also serves to show that embedded options in bonds {{can make a big difference}} to their valuation...|$|R
