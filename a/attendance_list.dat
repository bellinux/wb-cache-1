The open cabildo, celebrated on May 22, discussed the different proposals: to maintain the status quo, to appoint other people to rule with Cisneros, to remove him and appoint a new governor, to appoint a government junta, etc. The dismissal of Cisneros and the appointment of a Junta got the majority of votes.

50|$|During the {{campaign}} for the 2009 European Parliament election, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) criticised Koch-Mehrin for attending only 39% of the parliamentary debates, not counting maternity leave. She answered back and gave a statutory declaration that she had participated in 75% of the debates. The European Parliament then published a corrected number of 62%, with maternity leave taken into consideration. this figure would later be corrected to 75% without maternity leave, like she had stated earlier. Since giving a wrong statutory declaration is a criminal act, the European Parliament's administration reviewed additional <b>attendance</b> <b>lists</b> Koch-Mehrin provided. Mehrin's party urged a preliminary injunction against the FAZ, but withdrew it soon after, {{due to the fact}} of her stating a true statement.|$|R

40|$|Abstract | i Today we use an {{obsolete}} way {{of handling}} information regarding which student and/or teacher is attending which class/lab/seminar, attendance is written {{down on a}} piece of paper and collected so that an administrator can manually enter this information to some data processing system. This method is far from optimal and demands a lot of time and resources from administrators, teachers, and students. Correct gathering of attendance is important since it is required for specific parts of some courses. We propose to automate the collection of this attendance data, thus enabling students and teachers to simply swipe their NFC-enabled KTH access card in order to enter their name on an <b>attendance</b> <b>list.</b> This will be achieved by creating an application that adds a student to an <b>attendance</b> <b>list</b> by reading information using a NFC/RFID reader and mapping the card’s UID to a KTHID (a locally unique identifier used within the university) using a database. The resulting <b>attendance</b> <b>list</b> should be formatted in such a fashion that it can easily be uploaded to systems such as KTH Social and Daisy. Ideally these systems will be extended so that instructors/teachers can use this <b>attendance</b> <b>list</b> to automatically create the appropriate entries in these systems to record th...|$|E
40|$|The Access Grid is a group-to-group {{videoconferencing}} {{technology deployed}} at over 150 locations worldwide. We {{believe that there}} is a need for the Access Grid and other real-time collaboration technologies to provide a richness of interaction that goes beyond just audio, video and simple data sharing. This paper starts by describing in general terms possible extensions to real-time collaboration technology for achieving this and then describes two specific enhancements in the context of the Access Grid, namely speaker identification and participant tracking for the automatic generation of dynamically updated <b>attendance</b> <b>lists.</b> These extensions replace vital perceptual cues lost when videoconferencing, and also have a number of other important benefits, particularly for archiving. We make a case for why these improvements are required in an Access Grid environment and describe current and planned implementation work on a prototype system...|$|R

50|$|The Litchfield Female Academy in Litchfield, Connecticut, {{founded in}} 1792 by Sarah Pierce, {{was one of}} the most {{important}} institutions of female education in the United States. During the 30 years after its opening the school enrolled more than 2,000 students from 17 states and territories of the new republic, as well as Canada and the West Indies.

Many more, unidentified to date, attended, especially before 1814, when formal <b>attendance</b> <b>lists</b> were first kept. The longevity of the school, the size of the enrollments, the wide geographic distribution of the student body, the development of the curriculum and the training of teachers, all distinguish it from the numerous other female academies of the Early Republic.
