5|$|The theologian Sallie McFague {{believes}} that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased secularisation of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both idolatrous because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant</b> because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.|$|E
25|$|Israeli {{archaeologists have}} {{developed}} a method of detecting objects buried dozens of meters underground {{using a combination of}} seven technologies, among them echomagnetic soundings, radio transmissions and temperature measurements, able to distinguish between relevant <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant</b> objects such as pipes in the ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground of}} failing {{to take into account}} {{relevant}} considerations and taking into account irrelevant ones may overlap with other grounds of judicial review such as deciding for an improper purpose and irrationality. For example, in Lines International, the High Court considered the ground of relevant <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant</b> considerations together with Wednesbury unreasonableness.|$|E

25|$|Most {{scholars}} today {{consider all}} such theories {{not so much}} wrong— they occasionally offer peripheral insights— as comically naïve <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant.</b> The problem with these theories {{is that they are}} so narrowly mechanistic. They assume that once our ancestors had stumbled upon the appropriate ingenious mechanism for linking sounds with meanings, language automatically evolved and changed.|$|E
25|$|Adolf Hitler never claimed {{any part}} of the Southern Tyrol for his Third Reich, even before the {{alliance}} with Benito Mussolini; in fact in Mein Kampf (1924) he claimed that Germans were just a small <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant</b> minority in Southern Tyrol (this definition including also Trentino) and he acknowledged the German portion of Southern Tyrol as a permanent possession of Italy.|$|E
25|$|To try {{and define}} climate policy as a {{trade-off}} against foreign aid {{is thus a}} forced choice that bears no relationship to reality. No government is proposing that the marginal costs associated with, for example, an emissions trading system, should be deducted from its foreign aid budget. This way of posing the question is both morally inappropriate <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to the determination of real climate mitigation policy.|$|E

25|$|Conceptually, {{taking an}} {{irrelevant}} consideration {{into account in}} a decision may be equivalent to deciding for an improper purpose. In Hanks v. Minister of Housing and Local Government (1962), the overlap {{was thought to be}} so pronounced as to merit a suggestion that improper purpose should be subsumed under the heading of relevant <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant</b> considerations. However, this suggestion has not yet been taken up, and the two grounds remain separate from each other.|$|E
25|$|Firefox {{has passed}} the Acid2 standards-compliance test since version 3.0. Mozilla had {{originally}} stated {{that they did not}} intend for Firefox to pass the Acid3 test fully because they believed that the SVG fonts part of the test had become outdated <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant,</b> due to WOFF being agreed upon as a standard by all major browser makers. Because the SVG font tests were removed from the Acid3 test in September 2011, Firefox 4 and greater scored 100/100.|$|E
25|$|The {{party had}} a tense and {{complicated}} {{relationship with the}} American Federation of Labor. The American Federation of Labor leadership, headed by Samuel Gompers, was strongly opposed to the SPA, but many rank and file unionists in the early party of the 20th Century saw in the Socialists reliable political allies. Many moderate Socialists, such as Victor Berger and International Typographical Union President Max S. Hayes, urged close cooperation with the American Federation of Labor and its member unions. Others in the Socialist Party's ranks dismissed the American Federation of Labor and its craft unions as antiquated <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant,</b> instead favoring the much more radical IWW and the syndicalist path to socialism.|$|E

25|$|PETA opposes animal testing—whether {{toxicity}} testing, basic or applied research, or {{for education}} and training—on both moral and practical grounds. Newkirk told the Vogue magazine in 1989 that even if animal testing resulted in a cure for AIDS, PETA would oppose it. The group also believes that it is wasteful, unreliable, <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to human health, because artificially induced diseases in animals are not identical to human diseases. They say that animal experiments are frequently redundant and lack accountability, oversight, and regulation. They promote alternatives, including {{embryonic stem cell research}} and in vitro cell research. PETA employees have themselves volunteered for human testing of vaccines; Scott Van Valkenburg, the group's Director of Major Gifts, said in 1999 that he had volunteered for human testing of HIV vaccines.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{he married}} Jane Auer, {{an author and}} playwright. It was an {{unconventional}} marriage; each of their intimate relationships were with people of their own sex, but the couple maintained close personal ties with each other. Bowles has frequently been featured in anthologies as a gay writer, but during his life, he always regarded such typecasting as both absurd <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant.</b> After a brief sojourn in France, the couple were prominent among the literary figures of New York throughout the 1940s. Paul Bowles also worked under Virgil Thomson, as a music critic at the New York Herald Tribune. His light opera The Wind Remains, based on a poem by Federico García Lorca, was performed in 1943 with choreography by Merce Cunningham and conducted by Leonard Bernstein. His translation of Jean-Paul Sartre's play Huis Clos ("No Exit"), directed by John Huston, won a Drama Critic's Award in 1943.|$|E

500|$|Coleen also {{underlines the}} larger {{question}} of how the ground of insufficiency of evidence relates to, and arguably may be subsumed under, other more established grounds of judicial review. The High Court in Fong Thin Choo drew a link between this ground and that of relevant <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant</b> considerations. Justice Chan held that the [...] "insufficient inquiry" [...] by the Director-General, which satisfied the ground of lack of evidence, constituted a [...] " [...] to take into account relevant considerations".|$|E

500|$|The 20th century saw no revival for Garfield. Thomas Wolfe {{deemed the}} presidents of the Gilded Age, {{including}} Garfield, [...] "lost Americans" [...] whose [...] "gravely vacant and bewhiskered faces mixed, melted, swam together." [...] The politicians of the Gilded Age faded from the public eye, their luster eclipsed by those who had influenced America outside of political office during that time: the robber barons, the inventors, those who had sought social reform, and others who had lived as America rapidly changed. Current events and more recent figures occupied America's attention: according to Ackerman, [...] "the busy Twentieth Century has made Garfield's era seem remote <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant,</b> its leaders ridiculed for their very obscurity." ...|$|E
500|$|The High Court will enquire {{whether all}} {{considerations}} relevant to an act or decision {{have been taken}} into account by the decision-maker, <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant</b> ones ignored. If so, the act or decision stands, subject to other administrative law rules having been complied with. The primary concern of this {{ground of judicial review}} is not the merits of the decision itself. Rather, {{the focus is on the}} reasoning process by which the decision was reached. However, in the UK context it has been noted that [...] "case law on relevant considerations can sometimes take the courts to the fringes of difficult social and economic choices and that (arguably) the courts have not always adopted a position of self-restraint".|$|E
500|$|Though {{their musical}} style had changed {{somewhat}} since the 1990s, the Orb {{continued to use}} their odd synthetic sounds on 2004's Bicycles & Tricycles, to mixed reviews. The Daily Telegraph praised Bicycles & Tricycles as being [...] "inclusive, exploratory, and an enjoyable journey"; other publications dismissed it as [...] "stoner dub" [...] <b>and</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to current electronic music. Like Cydonia, Bicycles & Tricycles featured vocals, including female rapper MC Soom-T who added a hip hop contribution to the album. The Orb left Island Records and released the album on Cooking Vinyl and Sanctuary Records. To promote the album, the band began a UK tour with dub artist Mad Professor. Though the Orb still pulled in large crowds, The Guardian noted that they lacked the intensity found in their earlier performances.|$|E
