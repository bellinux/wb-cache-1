5|$|The fortifications of Malta {{consist of}} a number of walled cities, citadels, forts, towers, batteries, redoubts, entrenchments and pillboxes. The fortifications were built over {{thousands}} of years, from around 1450 BC to the mid-20th century, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> result of the Maltese islands' strategic position and natural harbours, which have made them very desirable for various powers.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the species}} of Marginatae {{associated}} with willow, five (I.salicis-herbaceae, I.substellata, I.praetervisa, I.salicis and I.mixtilis) {{can be readily}} distinguished from I.saliceticola as their spores feature distinct, strongly protruding excrescences. In addition, they are found in vastly different habitats: I.mixtilis and I.praetervisa favour willow only in montane habitats, while I.salicis-herbaceae and I.substellata grow exclusively in montane habitats. I.salicis is rare in Nordic countries, and is typically collected from dunes. Of the other two listed by Vauras and Kokkonen, the spores of I.dunensis are distinctly larger and of a different shape to those of I.saliceticola, and the cystidia are shorter. While the species is typically found on the beach, it grows on fine sand, {{and has not been}} recorded in Finland. I.obtusiuscula also has larger spores of a different shape, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> darker colour, owing to their thick cell walls. Phylogenetic analysis of the respective internal transcribed spacer sequences has confirmed that I.obtusiuscula and I.saliceticola are separate species.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> major cause of {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E

5|$|The Andean condor is a {{national}} symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuelan Andes states. It is the national bird of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. It {{plays an important role}} in the folklore and mythology of the South American Andean regions, and has been represented in Andean art from c. 2500 BCE onward, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> part of indigenous Andean religions. In Andean mythology, the Andean condor was associated with the sun deity, and was believed to be the ruler of the upper world. The Andean condor is considered a symbol of power and health by many Andean cultures, and it was believed that the bones and organs of the Andean condor possessed medicinal powers, sometimes leading to the hunting and killing of condors to obtain its bones and organs. In some versions of Peruvian bullfighting, a condor is tied to the back of a bull, where it pecks at the animal as bullfighters fight it. The condor generally survives and is set free.|$|E

25|$|Gödel's {{completeness}} theorem (Gödel 1929) {{established the}} equivalence between semantic and syntactic definitions of logical consequence in first-order logic. It shows {{that if a}} particular sentence is true in every model that satisfies {{a particular set of}} axioms, then there must be a finite deduction of the sentence from the axioms. The compactness theorem first appeared as a lemma in Gödel's proof of the completeness theorem, and it took many years before logicians grasped its significance and began to apply it routinely. It says that a set of sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset has a model, or in other words that an inconsistent set of formulas must have a finite inconsistent subset. The completeness and compactness theorems allow for sophisticated analysis of logical consequence in first-order logic and the development of model theory, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> key reason for the prominence of first-order logic in mathematics.|$|E

25|$|Lika and Gorski Kotar {{are marked}} by several {{significant}} rivers draining north towards the Pannonian Basin. Those are the Kupa, tracing the northern boundary of the region, Dobra, Mrežnica and the Koranaforming travertine barriers and waterfalls before discharging into Kupa in area of Karlovac, as well as Una, {{in the eastern part}} of the region, at the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, there are losing streams such as Gacka, Krbava and Lika rivers, reflecting a high degree of karstification of the terrain in the region, resulting in increased permeability of soil and rocks. Ingress of water underground resulted in formation of subterranean watercourses and lakes. Probably the finest example of interaction of karst terrain and watercourses in the area are Plitvice Lakes16 interlinked lakes between Mala Kapela and Plješevica, through which Korana River flows. The area is abundant in travertine barriers, waterfalls and caves of biological origincreated through deposition of calcium carbonate through agency of moss, algae and aquatic bacteria. The Plitvice Lakes are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> part of one of three Croatia's national parks located in the Mountainous Croatia, along with Risnjak and Sjeverni Velebit.|$|E
500|$|Motor vehicle crashes were a {{major factor}} {{that led to the}} {{development}} of emergency medicine in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> major factor leading countries to develop their own emergency medical systems today. Such crashes represent a leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults, with the majority of deaths occurring in the developing world. In recent decades, while traffic fatalities have declined in industrialized nations, they have been on the rise in developing ones. Furthermore, developing nations tend to have a higher proportion of fatalities per number of vehicles for various reasons, including lower safety standards for vehicles. The lack of available emergency care in many developing countries only serves to exacerbate this problem. This higher rate of accident mortality per vehicle exists despite the fact that there are fewer cars in Asia and Africa than in the West. Odero et al. argue that this shows a need to improve emergency medical care.|$|E
500|$|Like other boletes, porcini can be dried {{by being}} strung {{separately}} on twine and hung {{close to the}} ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placing them in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer {{on top of a}} boiler or hot water tank. Another method is drying in an oven at [...] for two to three hours, then increasing the temperature to [...] until crisp or brittle. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. Importantly for commercial production, porcini retain their flavour after industrial preparation in a pressure cooker or after canning or bottling, and are thus useful for manufacturers of soups or stews. The addition of a few pieces of dried porcino can significantly add to flavour, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> major ingredient of the pasta sauce known as carrettiere (carter's sauce). The drying process is known to induce the formation of various volatile substances that contribute to the mushroom's aroma. Chemical analysis has shown that the odour of the dried mushroom is a complex mixture of 53 volatile compounds.|$|E
