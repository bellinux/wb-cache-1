50|$|Shoulder <b>arthrography</b> {{can be used}} {{to study}} tears of the rotator cuff, glenoid labrum and biceps. The type of {{contrast}} injected into the joint depends on the subsequent imaging that is planned. For pneumoarthrography, gas is used, for CT or radiographs, a water-soluble radiopaque contrast, and for MRI, gadolinium. Double-contrast <b>arthrography</b> can be used for more anatomically complex cases, though its use is relatively infrequent. The needle is radiographically guided into the glenohumeral joint space, after which the patient is evaluated by fluoroscopy, CT or MRI. The gadolinium in the contrast fluid yields a bright signal on T1 weighted images allowing for better evaluation of the joint capsule, the articular surface of the bones and, in particular, the labral cartilage. MR <b>arthrography</b> is most often used in evaluation of the hip and acetabular labrum, of the shoulder rotator cuff and glenoid labrum, and less often in the wrist. Arthrograms can be diagnostic and therapeutic. Therapeutic arthrograms often distend the joint with cortisone and lidocaine, with a common site being the shoulder. Diagnostic arthrograms can be direct, as described above with penetration of the joint, or indirect, by a venous injection of contrast material and delayed imaging with CT or MRI.|$|E

50|$|Hydrodilatation or {{hydraulic}} arthrographic capsular distension or distension <b>arthrography</b> is {{a medical}} treatment for adhesive capsulitis of shoulder. The treatment is applied by a radiologist assisted by a radiographer. Contrast medium, a local anaesthetic and cortisone are injected into the joint.

50|$|X-ray images (normally during weightbearing) can be {{obtained}} to rule out other conditions or {{to see if the}} patient also has osteoarthritis.

50|$|Imaging {{features}} of adhesive capsulitis are seen on non-contrast MRI, though MR <b>arthrography</b> and invasive arthroscopy are more accurate in diagnosis. Ultrasound and MRI {{can help in}} diagnosis by assessing the coracohumeral ligament, with a width of greater than 3 mm being 60% sensitive and 95% specific for the diagnosis. The condition can also be associated with edema or fluid at the rotator interval, a space in the shoulder joint normally containing fat between the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons, medial to the rotator cuff. Shoulders with adhesive capsulitis also characteristically fibrose and thicken at the axillary pouch and rotator interval, best seen as dark signal on T1 sequences with edema and inflammation on T2 sequences. A finding on ultrasound associated with adhesive capsulitis is hypoechoic material surrounding the long head of the biceps tendon at the rotator interval, reflecting fibrosis. In the painful stage, such hypoechoic material may demonstrate increased vascularity with Doppler ultrasound.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE. The {{purpose of}} this article is to assess the {{diagnostic}} effectiveness of MDCT <b>arthrography</b> in the preoperative planning of anterior shoulder instability compared with MR <b>arthrography</b> and arthroscopy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Shoulder MDCT <b>arthrography</b> and MR <b>arthrography</b> examinations prospectively performed in 40 consecutive patients (30 male and 10 female patients; mean age, 26 years) were independently evaluated by two musculoskeletal radiologists who were blinded to the arthroscopic findings, which represented the reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and agreement with arthroscopy were determined for osseous, cartilage, and labroligamentous injuries. RESULTS. In detecting glenoid rim fractures, MDCT <b>arthrography</b> had a sensitivity of 100 % (12 / 12), a specificity of 96 % (27 / 28), and better agreement with surgery (kappa = 0. 94) than did MR <b>arthrography</b> (kappa = 0. 74). For the depiction of glenoid cartilage lesions, MDCT <b>arthrography</b> had a sensitivity of 82 % (18 / 22), a specificity of 89 % (16 / 18), and slightly better agreement with surgery (kappa = 0. 70) than did MR <b>arthrography</b> (kappa = 0. 66). In identifying anterior labral periosteal sleeve avulsion lesions, MDCT <b>arthrography</b> had a sensitivity of 93 % (26 / 28), a specificity of 100 % (12 / 12), and better agreement with surgery (kappa = 0. 89) than did MR <b>arthrography</b> (kappa = 0. 74).

CONCLUSION. MDCT <b>arthrography</b> showed better accuracy than did MR <b>arthrography</b> in the detection of osseous, cartilage, and labroligamentous injuries related to anterior shoulder instability. Because MDCT <b>arthrography</b> was particularly reliable for the detection of glenoid rim fractures and humeral avulsion of the inferior glenohumeral ligament lesions, which represent crucial findings in the preoperative planning, this technique may beneficially affect treatment by means of selecting the proper surgical treatment...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the value of direct {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) <b>arthrography</b> of the wrist for detecting full-thickness tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). Twenty-four consecutive patients who had ulnar-sided wrist pain and clinical suspicion of TFCC tear were included in the study. All patients underwent direct MR <b>arthrography</b> and then wrist arthroscopy, and the results of MR <b>arthrography</b> were compared with the arthroscopic findings. The positive predictive value of MR <b>arthrography</b> in detecting TFCC full-thickness tear was 0. 95, and the negative predictive value was 0. 50.

40|$|PURPOSE To {{evaluate}} the feasibility {{and performance of}} SPECT/CT <b>arthrography</b> of the wrist in comparison with MR <b>arthrography</b> in patients with suspected ulnocarpal impaction. METHODS This prospective study included 28 wrists of 27 patients evaluated with SPECT/CT <b>arthrography</b> and MR <b>arthrography.</b> Iodine contrast medium and gadolinium were injected into the distal radioulnar and midcarpal joints. Late-phase SPECT/CT was performed 3. 5 h after intravenous injection of approximately 650 MBq (99 m) Tc-DPD. MR and SPECT/CT images were separately reviewed in relation to bone marrow oedema, radionuclide uptake, and tears in the scapholunate (SL) and lunotriquetral (LT) ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), and an overall diagnosis of ulnar impaction. MR, CT and SPECT/CT imaging findings were compared with each other, with the surgical findings in 12 patients and with clinical follow-up. RESULTS The quality of MR <b>arthrography</b> and SPECT/CT <b>arthrography</b> images was fully diagnostic in 23 of 28 wrists (82 %) and 25 of 28 wrists (89 %), respectively. SPECT/CT <b>arthrography</b> was not diagnostic for ligament lesions due to insufficient intraarticular contrast in one wrist. MR and SPECT/CT images showed concordant findings regarding TFCC lesions in 22 of 27 wrists (81 %), SL ligament in 22 of 27 wrists (81 %) and LT ligament in 23 of 27 wrists (85 %). Bone marrow oedema on MR images and scintigraphic uptake were concordant in 21 of 28 wrists (75 %). MR images showed partial TFCC defects in four patients with normal SPECT/CT images. MR images showed bone marrow oedema in 4 of 28 wrists (14 %) without scintigraphic uptake, and scintigraphic uptake was present without MR bone marrow oedema in three wrists (11 %). Regarding diagnosis of ulnar impaction the concordance rate between CT and SPECT/CT was 100 % and reached 96 % (27 of 28) between MR and SPECT/CT <b>arthrography.</b> The sensitivity and specificity of MR, CT and SPECT/CT <b>arthrography</b> were 93 %, 100 % and 100 %, and 93 %, 93 % and 93 %, respectively.

We assessed the value of MR <b>arthrography</b> of the hip as a minimally-invasive diagnostic technique, in a prospective study and compared the findings with those at subsequent operations. All the patients complained of groin pain; 22 had a positive acetabular impingement test and 15 had radiological evidence of hip dysplasia.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to prospectively compare the diagnostic performance of MR <b>arthrography</b> and conventional MRI with surgical correlation in the same patient for detecting labrum and articular cartilage defects.

Labrum and cartilage defects were evaluated at MRI by two independent readers. A McNemar test and kappa statistics were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS. At surgery, 31 labral tears were identified. MR <b>arthrography</b> had an advantage over conventional MRI for detecting labral tears at the anterosuperior quadrant (sensitivity of MR <b>arthrography,</b> 81 % and 69 % for readers 1 and 2, respectively; sensitivity of conventional MRI, 50 % for both readers); this difference in performance between MR <b>arthrography</b> and conventional MRI was statistically significant for reader 1 (p = 0. 02) but not for reader 2 (p = 0. 2). Interobserver agreement for labral tears was higher for MR <b>arthrography</b> (κ = 0. 81) than for conventional MRI (κ = 0. 63). Surgery showed 31 acetabular cartilage defects and nine femoral cartilage defects. MR <b>arthrography</b> had an advantage over conventional MRI for detecting acetabular cartilage defects (sensitivity of MR <b>arthrography,</b> 71 % and 92 % for readers 1 and 2, respectively; sensitivity of conventional MRI, 58 % and 83 %), whereas there was no advantage to using MR <b>arthrography</b> for detecting femoral cartilage defects with statistically significant difference for the acetabular cartilage or femoral cartilage. Interobserver agreement was slightly higher for MR <b>arthrography</b> (κ = 0. 50) than for conventional MRI (κ = 0. 40) for assessing the acetabular cartilage and was almost identical for the femoral cartilage (κ = 0. 62 and 0. 63, respectively).

40|$|Objective: To {{summarize}} {{and compare}} the diagnostic accuracy of contrast and subtraction <b>arthrography</b> {{in the assessment of}} aseptic loosening of total hip arthroplasties. Design: This meta-analysis was performed using methods described by the Cochrane Methods Group on Systematic Reviews of Screening and Diagnostic Tests. We included original, English-language papers published between January 1975 to October 2004 that examined contrast-enhanced <b>arthrography</b> with or without subtraction for diagnosis of loosening of total hip prostheses. A qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed by two investigators. Results: With regard to the acetabular component, pooled sensitivity and specificity for contrast <b>arthrography</b> was 70 % (95 % confidence interval, 52 - 84) and 74 % (95 % CI, 53 - 87), respectively. Subtraction <b>arthrography</b> had a significantly higher sensitivity of 89 % (95 % CI, 84 - 93) (p = 0. 01), with a similar specificity of 76 % (95 % CI, 68 - 82). For the femoral component, pooled sensitivity and specificity for contrast <b>arthrography</b> were 63 % (95 % CI, 53 - 72) and 78 % (95 % CI, 68 - 86). Pooled estimates for subtraction <b>arthrography</b> revealed a significantly higher sensitivity of 86 % (95 % CI, 74 - 93) (p = 0. 003).

Materials and Methods: T 1 -weighted, fat suppressed (FS) proton density plus T 2 -weighted (FS PD/T 2), 3 D multiple-echo data image combination (MEDIC) sequences and direct MR <b>arthrography</b> were performed in 53 patients with wrist pain. Images were evaluated for the presence and location of TFCC, scapholunate ligament (SLL) and lunatotriquetral ligament (LTL) tears, and imaging findings were compared with operative findings in 16 patients who underwent arthroscopy or open surgery (gold standard). Results: Sixteen patients underwent arthroscopy/open surgery: 12 TFCC tears were detected arthroscopically out of which 9 were detected on FS PD/T 2 sequence, 10 on MEDIC sequence, and all 12 were detected on MR <b>arthrography.</b> The sensitivities of FS PD/T 2, MEDIC sequences, and MR <b>arthrography</b> in the detection of TFCC tears were 75 %, 83. 3 %, and 100 %, respectively.
