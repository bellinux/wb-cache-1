5|$|M-59 {{was first}} {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 between M-10 (now Bus. US24) in Pontiac and M-19 (later US25 and now M-3) in Mt. Clemens. It would {{be moved to}} follow Hall Road exclusively on the east end in 1932. The west end was extended in 1936 to end at the Livingston–Oakland county line. The extension to US 23 in Hartland was finished by 1938. The east end was extended again in 1939 along US25 <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> M-29 in New Baltimore. The east end was rerouted again between Mt. Clemens and New Baltimore over another former alignment of M-29 in late 1947 or early 1948. The eastern terminus was truncated to M-29 east of US25/Gratiot Avenue in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Applicants {{can change}} their gender {{identity}} documents by simply filing an affidavit with a notary, eliminating any requirement for medical gender reassignment procedures under the Gender Identity, Gender Expression And Sex Characteristics Act. In December 2016, the Act was amended to allow minors who are sixteen <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> have their gender changed without needing to file and application {{in court and}} parental approval. In November 2015, the Minister of Home Affairs informed that 40 people had legally changed their gender since enactment of the law mentioned above.|$|E

More notably, the election's results opened the debate on constitutional reform, particularly in amending Article 9 of Japan's pacifist constitution, with pro-revisionist parties gaining the two-thirds majority being necessary for reform, alongside a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives, which would ultimately lead to a nationwide referendum.|$|E

Following the Arms (Military Style Semi-automatic Firearms and Import Controls) Amendment Act 2012 (Which came into effect on December 1, 2013), fully automatic Paintball guns are legal to purchase and use, although a permit to procure from the New Zealand Police is required in order to legally import them into the country. Military replicas require a permit for import.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the station, guests boarded a large, open-air aerial tram vehicle. There, a live guide aboard the tram informed {{them that they were}} being evacuated off of Manhattan Island <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Roosevelt Island during Kong's attack. The tram's radio was tuned to the police emergency frequency so that guests could be informed of Kong's location in the city. The tram traveled above the streets of downtown New York City where guests could view Kong's path of destruction. There was a water geyser from a broken fire hydrant, broken steam pipes, crashed and overturned cars, and a subway train partly derailed from its elevated track. A police chopper described the scene around the tram over the radio, alerting that Kong was approaching the tramway and that he was grabbing a power pole. Kong's silhouette could briefly be seen as a spotlight shone on a building ahead of the tram. As the tram passed the power pole, it tipped over and its electrical transformer exploded, unleashing a shower of sparks and fire, which ignited the derailed elevated subway train.|$|E
25|$|As of the June 26, 2014 city {{officials}} and civilians officially celebrated {{the completion of}} the second phase of construction and redevelopment of the Old Colony housing project {{that took place in the}} neighborhood of South Boston that began construction back in 2009. The phase two completion is huge milestone because this phase included important aspects such as: high-efficiency affordable housing in town-house style and four-story elevator buildings. Part of this project was funded by a HOPE VI grant which ensured $22-million dollars for the project to build these new public houses for the citizens of South Boston 223 original apartments along Old Colony Ave up to Dorchester Street <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Reverend Burke Street. These affordable housing units are some of the greenest and most environmentally friendly public houses in the entire Commonwealth. In the future the Boston Housing Authority and its partners are looking to redevelop the remaining 453 original housing units in South Boston.|$|E

25|$|The battery was {{surrendered}} {{with the}} Vicksburg garrison on July 4, 1863. General Ulysses S. Grant initially demanded the conditional surrender of the Vicksburg garrison, but {{faced with the}} necessity of feeding 30,000 starving Confederates and having the idea that these soldiers might do more harm to the Confederate cause by being released to return home rather than being exchanged as whole units, he relented and allowed for the immediate parole of the unit. According to the Confederate War Department, the Union leader encouraged the surrendered Confederates to simply return home, rather than being officially paroled and exchanged. The able bodied Confederate soldiers who were released on parole walked out of Vicksburg (they {{were not allowed to}} proceed in any military formations) on July 11, 1863. Paroling of these able bodied men was completed in their respective camps inside Vicksburg prior to July 11. Those who were wounded or sick in the various hospitals in Vicksburg were paroled, and were released, as soon as they could leave on their own. July 15/16 is the most common date of these Vicksburg hospital paroles. Some of the most seriously wounded and sick were sent by steamship down the Mississippi River <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Mobile, Alabama, where they were delivered on parole to Confederate authorities.|$|E

25|$|Federer next {{traveled}} to Melbourne {{for the first}} Grand Slam of the season, the Australian Open. The Swiss advanced through the first four rounds without {{the loss of a}} set, starting his campaign by defeating qualifier Alexander Kudryavtsev, receiving a walkover into the third round when Andreas Beck withdrew with a lower back injury prior to their second round match, and beating Ivo Karlović to improve to a 10–1 head-to-head record against the Croat. Federer then faced Australian teenager Bernard Tomic and downed him in less than two hours to extend his record streak of Grand Slam quarterfinals consecutive appearances to 31. In the quarterfinals, Federer faced world no. 11 Juan Martín del Potro in his 1000th career match. It was their first meeting in a major tournament since Del Potro defeated Federer in five sets in the 2009 US Open men's final. As the tight match slowly progressed, Federer took control and flew by del Potro in straight sets. With his win, Federer becomes the first player at age 30 <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> reach the Australian Open semifinals since Andre Agassi, and extends his match winning streak (started in September 2011) to 24 consecutive victories. Federer played world no. 2 and archrival Rafael Nadal in the semifinals. He opened up the match by winning the first set, but ultimately lost momentum and dropped the next three sets after a failed attempt {{to get back in the}} match by taking the third set, committing 63 unforced errors. Federer's loss to Nadal saw his winning streak of 24 consecutive matches end and his record against Nadal slip to 9–18.|$|E

500|$|According to {{literary}} scholar Anne Myles, {{the life of}} Mary Dyer [...] "functions as a powerful, almost allegorical example of a woman returning, over <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> <b>to</b> the same power-infused site of legal and discursive control." [...] The only first-hand evidence available as to the thoughts and motives of Dyer lie in the letters that she wrote. [...] But Myles sees her behavior as [...] "a richly legible text of female agency, affiliation, and dissent." [...] Looking at Burrough's account of the conversation between Dyer and Governor Endicott, Myles views {{the two most important}} dimensions as being agency and affiliation. The first is that Dyer's actions [...] "can be read as staging a public drama of agency," [...] a means for women, including female prophets, to act under the power and will of God. [...] While Quaker women were allowed to preach, they were not being assertive when doing so because they were actually [...] "preaching against their own wills and minds." ...|$|E
