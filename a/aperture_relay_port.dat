50|$|The SWIR {{spectrometer}} {{was designed}} and built by the Optical Payloads Group of Surrey Satellites (SSTL); it employs an immersed grating design in which light impinges upon an etched grating from within a high-index substrate (silicon in this case). The reduced wavelength within the refractive medium permits an efficient, space-saving design. The SWIR grating was provided by SRON (Netherlands), who also provided the Front-End Electronics (FEE). The SWIR spectrometer receives light from the main instrument via an intermediate pupil, and directs this - via a telescope - towards a slit which defines the along-track footprint of the instrument on the ground. Light from the slit is re-collimated, diffracted by the immersed-grating at high-order and finally imaged onto a two-dimensional detector by a high <b>aperture</b> <b>relay</b> lens. The SWIR detector (furnished by Sofradir, France) has 256 elements in the across-track direction and 1024 elements in the spectral direction (the element pitch is 30 microns); it is operated cold (typically 140 K). The SWIR spectrometer optics are mounted on a cooled optical bench (approximately 200K) and the instrument is insulated by a multiple-layer insulation (MLI) blanket. The SWIR instrument was aligned, focussed and characterised at the Mullard Space Science laboratory thermal vacuum facility in Surrey, UK.|$|R

40|$|Analysis of a {{commercial}} network Maritime trade, tied to long-distance commerce and organized around cities of the eastern Mediterranean, also implies interior routes and relays. From a comparative perspective, this paper draws attention to {{a commercial}} channel originating in a village deep in the steppes country, "a desert port", isolated, but located on a major trade route, which developed a tradition of peddling, of transit and transport, associated with its history of migration. The paper describes the efficient and hierarchical organization, and the savoir-faire that made this community the carrier of trade between the farming region (which produced mutton and wool) and the large urban markets of the Near East, where Cyprus was often the <b>relay</b> <b>port.</b> The commercial activities of these people from the interior fringes were firmly linked to mobility. These activities were dependent on client relations established with the steppe producers and carefully maintained through the practice of "advance". They rest on lineage and identity networks joining the mother city to the archipelago of cities where clusters of their community settled during successive exoduses, {{in accordance with the}} model of a diasporic society.

40|$|In this work, the outage {{performance}} {{analysis of a}} dual-hop transmission system composed of asymmetric radio frequency (RF) channels cascaded with free-space optical (FSO) links is presented. The RF links are modeled by the Rayleigh fading distribution and the FSO links are modeled by Malaga (M) turbulence distribution. The FSO links account for pointing errors and both types of detection techniques (i. e. heterodyne detection as well as intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD)). Transmit diversity is applied at the source, selection combining is applied at the destination, and the relay is equipped with single RF receive antenna and single <b>aperture</b> for <b>relaying</b> the information over FSO links. With this model, a new exact closed-form expression is derived for the outage probability of the end-to- end signal-to-noise ratio of such communication systems {{in terms of the}} Meijer's G function under fixed amplify-and-forward relay scheme.

50|$|With {{a service}} brake relay valve installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery <b>port</b> and the <b>relay</b> valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the <b>relay</b> valve's supply <b>port,</b> which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service brake chambers, and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service brake chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the <b>relay</b> valve's supply <b>port</b> to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service brake chambers.|$|R
50|$|Some common {{features}} of 35mm SLR photography were first {{seen on the}} Topcon RE Super. Among these is the through-the-lens exposure metering. This enabled improved exposure accuracy, especially in close-up macro photography using bellows or extension rings, and in telephotography with long lenses. In addition to this feature, the metering is at full aperture. For this purpose the RE-lensese have an <b>aperture</b> simulator that <b>relays</b> the preset <b>aperture</b> to the exposure meter at full aperture, retaining a bright viewfinder image while determining the correct exposure, avoiding the stop-down method. The meter also works independently of the pentaprism finder, which allows for different viewfinder configurations. The meter cell is actually incorporated in the camera's reflex finder mirror. This was accomplished by milling narrow slits in the mirror surface letting {{a fraction of the}} light through to the CdS cell placed just behind it.|$|R
50|$|While {{the network}} {{neutrality}} debate continues, network providers often enter into peering arrangements among themselves.

In addition, network providers often implement various policies such as blocking of port 25 to prevent insecure systems from serving as spam <b>relays,</b> or other <b>ports</b> commonly used by decentralized music search applications implementing peer-to-peer networking models. They also present {{terms of service}} that often include rules {{about the use of}} certain applications as part of their contracts with users. Most consumer Internet providers implement policies like these. The MIT Mantid Port Blocking Measurement Project is a measurement effort to characterize Internet port blocking and potentially discriminatory practices. However, the effect of peering arrangements among network providers are only local to the peers that enter into the arrangements and cannot affect traffic flow outside their scope.|$|R

40|$|Physical {{layer network}} coding (PNC) {{improves}} the throughput in wireless networks by enabling two nodes to exchange information using a {{minimum number of}} time slots. The PNC technique is proposed for two-way relay channel free space optical (TWR-FSO) communications {{with the aim of}} maximizing the utilization of network resources. The multipair TWR-FSO is considered in this paper, where a single antenna on each pair seeks to communicate via a common receiver <b>aperture</b> at the <b>relay.</b> Therefore, chip interleaving is adopted as a technique to separate the different transmitted signals at the relay node to perform PNC mapping. Accordingly, this scheme relies on the iterative multiuser technique for detection of users at the receiver. The bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed system is examined under the combined influences of atmospheric loss, turbulence-induced channel fading, and pointing errors (PEs). By adopting the joint PNC mapping with interleaving and multiuser detection techniques, the BER results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a significant performance improvement against the degrading effects of turbulences and PEs. It is also demonstrated that a larger number of simultaneous users can be supported with this new scheme in establishing a communication link between multiple pairs of nodes in two time slots, thereby improving the channel capacity...|$|R

5000|$|For {{the first}} time, shutter {{information}} was displayed via an internal {{liquid crystal display}} (LCD) inside the viewfinder. <b>Aperture</b> information was <b>relayed</b> through Nikon's [...] "ADR" [...] (Aperture Direct Readout) which was a window at the top center of the viewfinder that got its information from a micro-prism that read small numbers {{at the top of}} the mounted lens, of which type 'AI' (Aperture Indexing) or 'AIS' (Aperture Indexing Shutter Priority) lenses had printed behind the normal aperture numbers. Though widely used today, LCDs were very hi-tech at the time. They proved somewhat difficult to see at night, so Nikon installed a button-operated light for use at night. The LCD is one of the few problem areas of the F3 design, since with age, LCDs lose contrast, blur, and become inoperative after a number of years. Fortunately, unlike modern autofocus cameras with LCD 'Command Center' panels, malfunction of the F3's LCD viewfinder display does not prevent full operation of the camera, since this is accomplished with manual dials and indicators. Many F3 cameras built in the 1980s were never used professionally, and therefore are still in perfect working order, including the LCD. On early production models the autoexposure lock button, originally a simple push-in part, is often missing; Nikon later redesigned this part so it was securely attached from inside the body. The later part can be fitted to early bodies but a partial stripdown is required.|$|R

The aim of this project was to design and develop a Radiation 			Protection Assistant Robot (RPAR) for assisting radiation workers in 			a radioactive environment for routine work as well as in emergency 			situation. During an emergency situation, where higher doses are 			likely to be received, RPAR can be used effectively to perform 			various tasks, such as radiation mapping, sampling and handling 			radioactive waste/materials. 			To accomplish these tasks a mobile robot having 4 Degree-Of-Freedom 			(DOF) articulated robotic arm was designed and developed using 			locally available components and indigenous resources. The 			mechanical segments, i. e. gripper, wrist, elbow, shoulder and waist 			were developed at Pakistan Institute of Engineering Applied 			Sciences (PIEAS) and Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science 			Technology (PINSTECH). The main platform was developed to carry 			on-board computer, rechargeable battery, controlling electrical and 			electronics modules/circuits. The electronic modules have been 			developed using components available in local market. These modules 			include H-bridge, <b>relay</b> logic, parallel <b>port</b> interface and limit 			switch modules. Control panel and remote console are developed to 			control and operate the RPAR. An embedded controller card was also 			developed to determine the positions of various links of RPAR. 			RPAR weighs 55. 6 kg. It is powered by a 12 V DC rechargeable dry 			battery. Its maximum payload capacity and reach are 2. 1 kg and 1. 04 			m, respectively. It can be controlled by a wired remote control or 			an off-board PC via wireless Ethernet. 			Three Software namely RPARSOFT, RPAR-DEMO and SEDAS were designed 			and developed using Visual Basic 6. 0. RPARSOFT was developed to 			operate the RPAR from the keyboard of an off-board computer.
