40|$|Abstract. Can You See Me Now? was {{a mobile}} mixed reality game {{that took place}} on-line and {{on the streets of}} a city. On-line players moved across a map of the city that they {{accessed}} over the Internet. Runners equipped with wireless handheld computers with GPS receivers chased them by running through the city streets. Players communicated with one another using text messages and also received walkie-talkie communication from the runners as an audio stream. Can You See Me Now? was staged publicly. Evaluation based on ethnography, discussion with participants and analysis of system logs, revealed a number of design issues for future citywide mixed reality games. Gameplay issues focus on the tactics of the runners and players, the need to enhance local knowledge for the players, the role of <b>audio,</b> and designing <b>entry</b> into and exit from the game. Orchestration focus on improving monitoring interfaces in the game control room and better supporting participants on the streets. ...|$|R
50|$|Schools {{wishing to}} compete for the {{championship}} first submitted a written, <b>audio</b> or video <b>entry</b> to the CBC on a topic announced on the CBC's SmartAsk page. A major grievance against the selection process, however, was the subjectivity of evaluation of entries, with no clear criteria for judging. Nevertheless, 124 schools were chosen from these entries from across the nation (the defending champion received an automatic berth into the next season). 122 of these 125 schools then competed with another school in their province or region on CBC Radio for a berth in the television round. The 3 teams chosen from the territories received a bye into the television round. Teams then competed in a 64-team single-elimination tournament, culminating in the championships. The championship games were not taped until all of the first 60 games, to determine the four teams in the championships, had been aired. Schools fielded teams of up to 4 players for the competition, 3 players playing on-air, and up to 1 alternate.|$|R
40|$|Context: During clerkships, {{teaching}} and learning in day-to-day activities occur in many moments of interaction among doctors, patients, peers and other co-workers. How people talk with one another influences their identity, their position {{and what they are}} allowed to do. This paper focuses on the opportunities and challenges of such moments of interaction between doctors and students during a clerkship characterised by short supervisory relationships. Methods: This study was conducted in a 10 -week internal medicine clerkship. Nine students and 10 doctors who worked with these nine students participated by regularly describing moments of interaction, using dictaphones. We performed critical discourse analysis of material sourced from a total of 184 <b>audio</b> diary <b>entries</b> and seven student debriefing interviews to reveal how participants discursively shaped the way they could think, speak and conduct themselves. Results: The ways in which doctors and students posed and answered questions represented a recurrent and influential feature in the diaries. This Question and Answer dynamic revealed six discourses of Basic Learning Need, Care and Attention, Power Game, Exchange of Currency, Distance, and Equality and Reciprocity. These discourses and the interplay among them revealed both students' and doctors' frameworks of needs and expectations in a culturally defined power structure. The interplay among the discourses reflected the ways in which doctor-student interactions afforded meaningful contributions to their medical or educational practice such as in the exchange of authentic professional or personal experience. Conclusions: By purposefully bringing power structures to the surface, we have addressed the complexity of learning and teaching as it occurs in day-to-day moments of interaction in a clerkship with little continuity in supervision. Both doctors and students should be supported to reflect critically on how they contribute to supervisory relationships with reference to, for example, {{the ways in which they}} ask or answer questions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} provide an insight into aspects of Vietnamese {{classroom}} interaction and teaching practices which are identified as fundamental by language teachers. It examines the responses, among Vietnamese high school teachers, to in-service teacher education using elements of the reflective model to inform the longitudinal research design. The subjects for the study are 15 teachers nominated for an in-service course at the Binh Dinh Department of Education. The focus of this research, the primary data, comprises diaries and questionnaires collected before, during, and after the in-service programme {{over a period of}} seven months. Supplementary information, secondary and peripheral data, used to interpret and inform the analysis of primary sources, comprises observation notes, <b>audio</b> diary <b>entries,</b> teacher belief questionnaires and student questionnaires. Content analysis reveals that teachers are concerned primarily with student response in class, that is, the displays of emotion in relation to the lesson, and student language performance. Performance is conceptualised as accurate reproduction of prescribed texts. In addition, the teachers' reflections foreground the primacy of the teacher-student relationship and the collective orientation of classroom activity. In a culture that does not emphasise trial and adaptation teachers also show a correspondingly low tolerance of ambiguity and a rejection of anything judged to be ad hoc. "Tried and true" methods are preferred. Confidence is cited as a major reason for not attempting new techniques in the classroom pointing to a need for a mentoring relationship between teacher educators and teachers in future in-service programmes. There is a higher than expected rate of reflectivity in diary entries though this is confined chiefly to evaluations of directly observable student behaviour. There are few attempts to probe reasons for performances that fail to meet teacher expectations. The study concludes with a model of the reflective teacher educator process...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a unique prison participatory research project, in which incarcerated women formed a research team, the research activities and the lessons learned. The participatory action research project was conducted in the main short sentence minimum/medium security women’s prison located in a Western Canadian province. An ethnographic multi-method approach was used for data collection and analysis. Quantitative data was collected by surveys and analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data was collected from orientation package <b>entries,</b> <b>audio</b> recordings, and written archives of research team discussions, forums and debriefings, and presentations. These data and ethnographic observations were transcribed and analysed using iterative and interpretative qualitative methods and NVivo 7 software. Up to 15 women worked each day as prison research team members; a total of 190 women participated at some time in the project between November 2005 and August 2007. Incarcerated women peer researchers developed the research processes including opportunities for them to develop leadership and technical skills. Through these processes, including data collection and analysis, nine health goals emerged. Lessons learned from the research processes were confirmed by the common themes that emerged from thematic analysis of th...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 This {{research}} project followed an ethnically and culturally diverse, sixth-grade classroom as they shared and constructed meaning from a selected text {{through a variety}} of drama activities. Unlike most studies on drama in the classroom, this {{research project}} examined the relationship between social construction of meaning through multiple literacies and the influence this has on student engagement. This study is centered in sociocultural theory, the central premise of which describes human thought as constituted by and originating from language-based social interactions with others. This research project also addressed the concept of multiple literacies and how it applied to the extension of communication choices beyond that of just language. It included drama, film, video, computer technology, visual arts, and music. As traditional forms of reading, writing, and communicating take on new literary forms, students need to be prepared and encouraged to critically think about the information they are exploring, especially in the area of media literacy. Through participant observation, field notes, fieldwork journal <b>entries,</b> <b>audio</b> and video recording, and interviews, I analyzed the students' social learning experiences, and their use of a variety of literacies to enhance and extend the traditional methods of reading, writing, speaking, and listening...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Methodological Innovation to Study Occupation: Daily activities, Neighborhood Stressors, and Stress in a Post-Industrial Riskscape In {{the current}} {{socio-cultural}} contexts {{of globalization and}} multiculturalism, {{there is a need}} to apply the concept of occupation at the community and population level. To do so allows examination of issues caused or aggravated by the forces of neoliberalism, globalization, structural violence, and social inequities (Frank, 2011). One such issue is how the global socio-economic changes of the last few decades have resulted in the development of urban ‘riskscapes’ that are disproportionately inhabited by older minorities (Mair, Cutchin, 2 ̆ 6 Peek, 2011; United Nations Centre for Human Settlements, 2007). Urban environments such as Detroit, Michigan exemplify this issue. Changes have created residential environments containing numerous industrial hazards related to previous/current industrial activity. However, equally important, are the socio-economic stressors such as crime rates, derelict infrastructure, pervasive poverty, and the decay of social capital that are encountered in the course of daily occupations. The purpose of this paper is to present and describe the use of multiple methods strategically configured to examine the intersection of daily occupations, exposure to urban stressors, and associated stress responses in 100 African-Americans aged 55 and older living in Detroit. To this aim, we describe methods and discuss their integration for understanding the role of occupation in urban risk and health. Methods to be discussed include: (a) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) using the movisensSX application for android devices; (b) participant-generated photos and <b>audio</b> journal <b>entries</b> about environments and stress using the Android phones; (c) collection of stress biomarkers via saliva samples at four times a day across a week to establish comprehensive diurnal cortisol curves; and (d) a pilot of the electronically activated ear and the collection of hair cortisol. We discuss the potential and problems for such methods in studying occupations in the context of urban life and environmental issues. The paper thus contributes knowledge about the potential of innovative combinations of multiple methods to more fully examine the role of occupation in larger socio-cultural processes.

40|$|Promoting Mathematical Understanding Through Open-Ended Tasks; Experiences of an Eighth-Grade Gifted Geometry Class by Carol H. Taylor Gifted {{students}} of mathematics served through acceleration often lack {{the opportunities to}} engage in challenging, complex investigations involving higher-level thinking. This {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the ways mathematically gifted students think about and do mathematics creatively as indicators of deep understanding through collaborative work on four open-ended tasks with high-level cognitive demand. The study focused on the mathematical thinking involved in students’ construction of mathematical understanding through the social interaction of group problem solving. This case study used ethnographic methodology within a social constructivist frame with gifted education and sociocultural contextual influences. Participants were 15 gifted students in an 8 th-grade gifted geometry class. Data collection included field notes, student artifacts, student journal <b>entries,</b> <b>audio</b> recordings, and reflections. Transcribed audio recordings were segmented (Tesch, 1990) into phases of interaction, coded by function, then coded by levels of exhibited mathematical thinking from observable cognitive actions (Dreyfus, Hershkowitz, 2 ̆ 6 Schwarz, 2001; Williams, 2000; Wood, Williams, 2 ̆ 6 McNeal, 2006), and analyzed for maintenance or decline of high-level cognitive demand (Stein, Smith, Henningsen, 2 ̆ 6 Silver, 2000). Interpretive data analysis was connected to data analysis of transcribed recordings. Results indicated social interaction among students enabled them to talk through the mathematics to understand mathematical concepts and relationships, to construct more complex meaning, and exhibit mathematical creativity, inventiveness, flexibility, and originality. Students consistently exhibited these characteristics indicating mathematical thinking at the levels of building-with analyzing, building-with synthetic-analyzing, building-with evaluative-analyzing, constructing synthesizing, and occasionally constructing evaluating (Dreyfus et al., 2001; Williams, 2000; Wood et al., 2006). The results of the study support the claim of a relationship between mathematical giftedness and the ability to abstract and generalize (Sriraman, 2003), provide evidence that given the opportunity, students can construct deep mathematical understanding, and indicate the importance of social interaction in the construction of knowledge. This study adds to the body of knowledge needed in research on gifted education, problem solving, small-group interaction, mathematical thinking, and mathematical understanding, through empirically assessed classroom practice (Friedman-Nima et al., 2005; Good, Mulryan, 2 ̆ 6 McCaslin, 1992; Hiebert 2 ̆ 6 Carpenter, 1992; Lester 2 ̆ 6 Kehle, 2003; Phillipson, 2007; Wood, Williams, 2 ̆ 6 McNeal, 2006) ...|$|R
