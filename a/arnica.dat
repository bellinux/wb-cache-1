25|$|The typical flora of a páramo are frailejones, {{that are}} plants {{of the genus}} Espeletia. The lower {{altitude}} parts of the páramo are characterised by Espeletia barclayana, Espeletia jaramilloi, Espeletia congestiflora and Espeletia argentea, while Espeletia grandiflora is growing in a wider altitude distribution. Chusquea tessellata is characteristic of the Eastern Ranges. On the Ocetá Páramo, formerly written as Oseta, various species have been described by Thomas van der Hammen; Bryum argenteum, Breutelia polygastrica, Calamagrostis effusa, Ceratodon stenocarpus, Didymodon laevigatus, Leptodontium flexifolium and Sphagnum sancto-josephense.

Information was taken from sources published between 1970 - 2010, especially from the database PubMed, drugsafetysite. com, and from publications in The Essential Guide To Herbal Safety and Léčiva v těhotenství - vliv léků a vitamínů na zdravý vývoj plodu. Absolutely contraindicated drugs found were <b>Arnicae</b> flos, Absinthii herba and Boldo folium. The paper also briefly discussed the inappropriateness of substance abuse during pregnancy and lactation. The issue of safety for pregnant women has not been clearly answered among other plants such as Rubi idei folium, Leonuri cardiacae herba, Ginkgo folium, Angelicae sinensis radix or Andrographis paniculatae herba. The work also included an overview of positive and harmful effects of vitamins and minerals in pregnancy. Keywords: pregnancy, {{medicinal plants}}, drug, contraindication...|$|R

5000|$|Monte Pelpi is a {{mountain}} 1,495 metres (4,905 ft) high {{located in the}} Tuscan-Emilian Apennines in northern Italy. The mountain overlooks the towns of Bedonia {{to the south and}} Bardi to the north, and rises like a cone between the Taro, Toncina and Ceno valleys. The vegetation is very diverse with forests consisting of beech, oak, hazel, hornbeam and black aspen and includes rare species of <b>arnicas,</b> orchid, daffodils, gentian, daphne and anemones. The forest gives way to a 1 km stretch of grassland at the summit on which stands a large steel cross. It is said that the mountain protects the towns of Bedonia and Compiano from the cold northern winds during winter. The view from this peak exceeds that of the taller Monte Penna nearby and it offers an extraordinary panorama of both valleys and the other peaks of the Liguran-Emilian Apennines, ranging from Monte Penna, Monte Tomarlo, Monte Maggiorasca, Monte Ragola. On clear days it is possible to observe the Mediterranean Sea.|$|R
2500|$|The {{process of}} homeopathic {{dilution}} results in no objectively detectable active ingredient in most cases, but some preparations (e.g. calendula and <b>arnica</b> creams) do contain pharmacologically active doses.

Elevation varies from 3,000to6,000feet (914to1,829m). Loess and ash soils over a substrate of basalt retain sufficient moisture to support forest cover at lower elevations than elsewhere in the Blue Mountains. A dense and diverse shrub layer grows beneath the relatively open canopy of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, which may delay tree regeneration after logging. Vegetation is dominated by Western ponderosa pine forests, with some Douglas-fir and grand fir. The understory and riparian shrub cover feature snowberry, spiraea, ninebark, serviceberry, and red-twig dogwood. The herbaceous ground cover features heartleaf <b>arnica,</b> pinegrass, elk sedge, Idaho fescue, Sandberg's bluegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass. The region covers [...] in Oregon, as well as small areas across the border in Washington, and includes public land within the Umatilla National Forest.|$|E
2500|$|The Fremont Pine/Fir Forest {{ecoregion}} [...] contains steeply to moderately sloping {{mountains and}} high plateaus that rarely exceed timberline. Elevation varies from 5000 to 8000 feet (1524 to 2439 m). Residual soils {{are common in}} the region, {{in contrast to the}} Pumice Plateau, where soils have been deeply buried by pumice and ash. Reservoirs, a few glacial rock-basin lakes, many springs, and high gradient intermittent and ephemeral streams occur. The continental climate and diverse terrain support a range of vegetation types. Ponderosa pine and western juniper woodlands are common at lower elevations. White fir, sugar pine, whitebark pine, lodgepole pine, and California incense-cedar are found on north slopes and at higher elevations. Understory plants include snowberry, heartleaf <b>arnica,</b> Wheeler bluegrass, antelope bitterbrush, and longstolon sedge. The region covers [...] in Oregon, mainly on public land within the Fremont-Winema National Forest. Contiguous areas in California have not been mapped yet.|$|E
2500|$|The Canyons and Dissected Highlands {{ecoregion}} {{is characterized}} by steeply sloping, upper river canyons and dissected plateaus in the rain shadow of the mountains. It includes the southern Seven Devils Mountains and pieces of the uplifted Columbia Plateau, where the basalt has been eroded {{to a series of}} knife-edge ridges flanked by deep canyons. The region occupies the elevational zone above the unforested Canyons and Dissected Uplands, at an elevation of 4,000to6,400feet (1,219to1,951m). The steep terrain limits human activities. The region is drier than the marine-influenced Mesic Forest Zone that exists at similar elevations to the west. Moisture retaining loess and ash soils support Douglas-fir, larch, and grand fir on relatively level benches and Douglas-fir in unstable colluvial soils on steep canyon slopes. Western ponderosa pine forest is also present, with ninebark, snowberry, oceanspray, heartleaf <b>arnica,</b> elk sedge, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and bluegrass. Riparian areas support mountain alder, stinking and prickly currant, thimbleberry, and Columbia monk’s hood. The region covers [...] in Oregon, [...] in Idaho, and smaller areas in Washington, including parts of the Wallowa-Whitman, Nez Perce, and Payette National Forests, the Wenaha–Tucannon Wilderness, and the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area.|$|E
2500|$|The Melange {{ecoregion}} {{is characterized}} by dissected mid-elevation mountains with the complex geology typical of mélange formations. Elevation varies from 3,500to7,500feet (1,067to2,286m). The mountains are mostly blanketed in Tertiary basalt but have a core of mixed metamorphic, metavolcanic, metasedimentary, and sedimentary rocks. Soils are droughty and high in magnesium, creating a poor medium for plant growth; reforestation problems limit logging. Placer mining for gold altered the structure of many stream channels and left extensive tailings piles in riparian areas. Lithology affects soil, vegetation, and {{the quantity and quality}} of surface water, which vary across the region. Forests are dominated by Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine, with subalpine fir, western larch, and grand fir; elsewhere, juniper steppe woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands are found. Understory plants include mountain-mahogany, snowberry, serviceberry, grouse huckleberry, snowberry, prince’s pine, sidebells pyrola, twinflower, pinegrass, elk sedge, heartleaf <b>arnica,</b> Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. Riparian areas support mountain alder, red-twig dogwood, prickly currant, black currant, Columbia monk’s hood, and bluebells.

60|$|By {{the time}} we reached the farmhouse, I had {{satisfied}} myself that there was nothing very serious the matter with me after all. The soft snow had broken the force of the concussion. I had strained my spine a good deal, and hurt the tendons of the thighs and back, but had not broken any bones, nor injured any vital organ. So when they laid me on the old-fashioned sofa in my little sitting-room, lighted a fire in the wide hearth, and covered me over with a few rugs, I felt comparatively happy and comfortable under the circumstances.

6000|$|He {{continued}} his systematic exercise, eating regularly and with care {{in order that}} he should keep his health.

It was a very ticklish matter, though the audience knew nothing about it. I saw it, and the gasman and Dolby saw it, and stood at that side of the platform in agonies. We all three calculated that there would be just time to finish and save it; when the gas was turned out the instant I had done, the whole thing was at its very last and utmost extremity. Whom it would have tumbled on, or what might have been set on fire, it is impossible to say.|$|E

Mrs. Westmacott had been left sleeping peacefully with a small chloral draught to steady her nerves and a handkerchief soaked in <b>arnica</b> bound round her head. It was with some surprise, therefore, that the Admiral received a note from her about ten o'clock, asking him to {{be good enough to}} step in to her. He hurried in, fearing that she might have taken some turn for the worse, but he was reassured to find her sitting up in her bed, with Clara and Ida Walker in attendance upon her. She had removed the handkerchief, and had put on a little cap with pink ribbons, and a maroon dressing-jacket, daintily fulled at the neck and sleeves.|$|E

His varied knowledge of life and his long experience had satisfied him that there were very few things to be afraid of in this world. Such womanish weaknesses as shying and starting were far from him, and he regarded the boisterous behavior of locomotives with indifference.
