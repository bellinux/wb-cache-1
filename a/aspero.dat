40|$|RESUMEN: Durante la Edad Moderna se dio en Europa una expansión de la ciencia de la ciencia penal y de desarrollo de los aparatos judiciales. Este proceso ha sido llamado de penalización o incriminación, incluso revolución jurídica. Cantabria ofrece un modelo {{particular}} de concreción de este proceso. En esta regla española estuvieron vigentes en el Antiguo Régimen formas privadas de justicia, formas que eran legitimadas por la costumbre, aunque escaparan a los jueces, y formas que aproximan el ejemplo cántabro al de algunas regiones rurales del Norte de Europa como las escocesas, finlandesas y polacas. Sin embargo, las intervenciones judiciales fueron más numerosas en Cantabria que en esas otras áreas europeas, y parecidas a las del área rural holandés. La trayectoria del número de causas judiciales en la región española citada es un excelente indicador de la evolución de la conflictividad social, pues el número de pleitos se manifestó con gran independencia del crecimiento de la población en los siglos XVII y XVIII. Además, los habitantes de Cantabria acudían a los jueces, incluso en los años más <b>ásperos,</b> con el fin de lograr un arbitraje de los jueces tendente a facilitar negociaciones entre las partes fuera de los juzgados. Todo esto hizo que en Cantabria ocurrieron más actos judicíales que en otras regiones rurales europeas, también hizo que pervivieran formas consuetudinarias de corrección o disciplina de la desviación social e, igualmente, hizo que esas formas disciplinarias afectaran al significado de términos como desviación social o crimen. Este es el principal asunto de este artículo. ABSTRACT: During the lóth, 17 th and 18 th centuries {{there was}} an expansion of penal law and a development of judicial intimions in Europe. This general process has been thought {{as it was a}} slow judicial revolution. In Cantabria it had a particular shape. There were private versions of justice out of the court in this Spanish region. The private justice had its legitimation in local customs. Another rural regions of Europe, such as Scotland, Finland or Poland, had a very important framework of private justice too. All these cases also point out a competition between the penal law and the local custom. Nevertheless, we can still see differences between Cantabria and the others. One of these differences was the ratio between the population rates and the number of judicial actions. In Cantabria this relationship was more similiar to the rural areas of Holland, which had smaller judicial districts than the others. The trend of judicial actions in Cantabria is a very good indicator of how the social struggles were changing along the time. Moreover, w can add others evidences for this argument, because, first, the relationship between population trend and judicial actions tendency was weak in Cantabria during the 17 th and 18 th centuries. Secondly, the people of Cantabria went to the court even in the worst times. Therefore, neither the population trend nor the harshest circumstances were distorting the rates of conflict in the courts. In most of the cases, after the beginning of the juditial action, the solution was out of the court but with the arbitration of the judge. All of these reasons let show us why there were more judicial actions in Cantabria than in some other rural areas of Europe such asScotland, but these reasons also show how strong the customary means of social discipline were against the deviant behaviour. If we know the way in which all these questions were linked each other along the time we will know how the social meaning of deviance and crime in a rural context and in preindustrial time was. This is the point in this article. </p...|$|R
40|$|Silenciosamente, alguns materiais cromáticos omitem qualidades potentes. Um simples olhar mais demorado pode ativá- -las. Outras vezes, é necessário o envolvimento de todo o corpo, numa relação de aproximação e convivência, para que o potencial se apresente. O pau-brasil - ou ibirapitanga, como denominada pelos indígenas - é uma árvore cujo cerne do tronco possui uma matéria orgânica, a brasilina, que produz cor, primeiro por entrar em contato com o oxigênio, depois por outros processos químicos. Uma cor? Não, diversas, a depender do {{modus operandi}} das ações e reações escolhidas. Essas cores podem ser fixadas e ter certa permanência quando usadas como corante para têxteis e papéis ou como pigmento em diferentes suportes. Por quanto tempo? Segundo os especialistas em tingimento, não muito. Numa perspectiva histórica, a ibirapitanga foi apreciada e utilizada como corante por conta de uma herança cultural: o gosto pelo púrpura e pelo carmim, tonalidades adoradas pelos povos antigos. Sua exploração no território brasileiro se deu de maneira agressiva, conflituosa e cheia de contradições a partir do éncontro,́ não apenas do homem com o material, mas de homens com homens, quando os navegantes europeus do século xvi fizeram as primeiras viagens para a América do Sul e entraram em contato com os povos locais. O estudo de documentos antigos, o toque no papel amarelado dessas publicações e o abrir o {{envelope}} de uma carta assinada pelo rei numa biblioteca em Lisboa adensaram o conteúdo teórico desta pesquisa, assim como contribuíram enquanto dado sensorial e imagético. De fato, resquícios do corante do pau-brasil em pinturas ou tecidos de acervos históricos não foram encontrados presencialmente apesar das tentativas. Foi somente a partir da reprodução de receitas, com as necessárias adaptações ao contexto contemporâneo, e dos desdobramentos destes experimentos em outros processos análogos, que o sentido da investigação poética se deu. Produzir cor com uso da ibirapitanga foi o centro das experimentações em ateliê. Como podemos atualizar a presença desse material cromático hoje? Foi por meio de diversas leituras, dos processos práticos no ateliê e de importantes conversas que o conteúdo da pesquisa ganhou sentido e se tornou possível estruturar este texto, que contém um breve histórico do pau-brasil, um caderno de receitas e a produção poética com o uso da ibirapitanga. Selecionamos ainda quatro conversas relevantes para a atualização do tema: a primeira realizada com Ana Cristina de Siqueira Lima, presidente da Funbrasil - Fundação Nacional do Pau-Brasil, que realiza ações de preservação da espécie; a segunda, com Eva Eis, pesquisadora e técnica em restauro da Universidade Técnica de Munique (tum), que desenvolve no momento pesquisa acerca de receitas de pigmentos de pau-brasil e que trabalha na fábrica Kremer Pigmente; com o artista Carlos Vergara, que se utiliza de materiais naturais para a produção de suas telas, valendo-se da monotipia e outros processos para revelar a presença da cor; e com a pintora e escultura Amelia Toledo, que evidencia sutis diferenças cromáticas enquanto matéria construtiva e propositiva de suas obras de arte. Esta publicação é fruto destes e de outros encontros que aconteceram nos últimos anos, e, por meio de diferentes materiais, tonalidades e palavras, celebra de maneira ambivalente (já que tratamos da ibirapitanga e sua memória de <b>ásperos</b> conflitos) essas aproximações, que imprimem e deixam seus rastros. Silently, some chromatic materials omit powerful qualities. A simple, longer look may activate them. In other situations, {{the involvement of}} the whole body is necessary, in a closer relationship, during some days or weeks, for the potential to present itself. The brazilwood - or ibirapitanga, as it was called by the natives - is a tree which has a heartwood with an organic material, the brazilin. It produces colour, first by coming into contact with oxygen, then by other chemical processes. One colour? No, several, depending on the modus operandi, the actions and reactions that are chosen. Colours that can be fixed and have certain permanence when used as a dye for textiles and papers, or as pigment in different supports. How long? According to experts in dyeing techniques, not much. Ibirapitanga was appreciated and used as a dye because it produces purple and carmine. Historically, ancient peoples adored those colours. The exploration of ibirapitanga in the Brazilian territory took place in an aggressive, conflictive way, full of contradictions from the ḿeetingńot only of men with this material, but of men with men: when European navigators of the sixteenth century made the first voyages to South America and came into contact with local people. The study of ancient documents, the touch on the yellowish papers of those publications and the opening of the envelope of a letter signed by the king, in a library in Lisbon, added theoretical content to this research and contributed as sensorial and imaginary data. In fact, we could not find and see residues of brazilwood in paintings or fabrics from historical collections, despite the attempts. It was only from the reproduction of recipes - with the necessary adaptations to the contemporary context - and from the development of these experiments in other similar processes, that the meaning of poetic investigation occurred. Producing colour with the use of ibirapitanga was the centre of experimentation in the atelier. How can we update the presence of this chromatic material today? It was through reading, practical processes in the atelier and through important conversations that the content of this research made sense and it became possible to structure this text, which contains a brief chapter about the history of brazilwood, a recipe book and the poetic production with the use of ibirapitanga. We selected four relevant conversations to update the subject: the first one held with Ana Cristina de Siqueira Lima, president of Funbrasil - Brazilwood National Foundation, which works to preserve the species; the second, with Eva Eis, researcher and restoration technician at the Technical University of Munich (tum), who is currently developing studies on the production of brazilwood lake pigments and works at the Kremer Pigment factory; with the artist Carlos Vergara, who uses natural materials for the production of his paintings, using monotype prints and other processes to reveal the presence of colour; and with the painter and sculptor Amelia Toledo, who shows delicate chromatic differences as constructive material and as a purpose of her art. This publication is the result of these and other meetings that have taken place in the last years, and, through different materials, shades and words, celebrates in an ambivalent way (since we are talking about ibirapitanga and its memory of conflicts) the approximations, which imprint and leave traces...|$|R

50|$|These {{connections}} {{have led}} archaeologists {{to believe that}} <b>Aspero</b> wasn't mainly a maritime culture, but an agriculture based community with more local maritime traits.
