5|$|As {{with nearly}} all primates, strepsirrhines {{typically}} reside in tropical rainforests. These habitats allow strepsirrhines and other primates to evolve diverse communities of sympatric species. In the eastern rainforests of Madagascar, {{as many as}} 11 or 12species share the same forests, and prior to human arrival, some forests had nearly double that diversity. Several species of lemur are found in drier, seasonal forests, including the spiny forest on {{the southern tip of}} the island, although the lemur communities in these regions are not <b>as</b> <b>rich.</b>|$|E
5|$|General Tilney {{returns home}} from a trip away and orders Eleanor to send Catherine home to Fullerton that night. Catherine endures the trip alone and {{believes}} that Henry told the General about her suspicions. A few days later, Henry comes to Fullerton and explains that the General discovered that Catherine's family were not <b>as</b> <b>rich</b> as John led him to believe. He apologises for his father's actions and explains that even though he will probably be disinherited, he loves Catherine and proposes. Catherine accepts and the couple marry.|$|E

5|$|Moving towards energy {{sustainability}} {{will require}} changes {{not only in}} the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are <b>as</b> <b>rich</b> and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{attorney}} William Shea {{was attempting}} to create the Continental League, a rival league to Major League Baseball. Hunt met with him, and Shea suggested Harry Wismer, a minority shareholder in both the Washington Redskins and Detroit Lions, as a potential New York franchise owner for the new football league. Wismer was willing; he was feuding at the time with the Redskins' principal owner, George Preston Marshall, and realized he would never own the Washington franchise. Wismer, while wealthy, was not nearly <b>as</b> <b>rich</b> as the other potential team owners.|$|E
5|$|The wealthy {{families}} {{living on the}} estates of these scholar-officials – as well <b>as</b> <b>rich</b> merchants, princes, and nobles—often maintained a massive entourage of employed servants, technical staffs, and personal favorites. They hired personal artisans such as jewellers, sculptors, and embroiderers, while servants cleaned house, shopped for goods, attended to kitchen duties, and prepared furnishings for banquets, weddings, and funerals. Rich families also hosted literary men such as secretaries, copyists, and hired tutors to educate their sons. They were also the patrons of musicians, painters, poets, chess players, and storytellers.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} {{paintings}} on {{the north and south}} walls depicting the Camoys family. Camoys was the lord of the manor and it appears he had the church built primarily for his family. This would explain the unusual detail in the paintings. They were intended <b>as</b> <b>rich</b> decoration rather than simply for educating an illiterate congregation.|$|E
5|$|After swiftly {{recovering}} from the sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. Despite their successes, their mastery of the whole of Italy {{was by no means}} assured. The Samnites were a people just as martial and <b>as</b> <b>rich</b> as the Romans and had the objective of their own to secure more lands in the fertile Italian plains on which Rome itself lay. The First Samnite War of between 343 BC and 341 BC that followed widespread Samnite incursions into Rome's territory was a relatively short affair: the Romans beat the Samnites in both the Battle of Mount Gaurus in 342 BC and the Battle of Suessula in 341 BC but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War.|$|E
5|$|Burges's two finest gothic {{churches were}} also {{undertaken}} in the 1870s, the Church of Christ the Consoler, Skelton-on-Ure, and St Mary's, Studley Royal. His patron, George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, although not <b>as</b> <b>rich</b> as Bute, was his equal in romantic medievalism and had been a friend of Bute's at Oxford, which {{may account for the}} choice of Burges as architect. Both churches were built as memorial churches for Ripon's brother-in-law, Frederick Grantham Vyner, who was murdered by Greek bandits in 1870. Vyner's mother commissioned the Church of Christ the Consoler and his sister St Mary's. Both begun in 1870, Skelton was consecrated in 1876 and Studley Royal in 1878.|$|E

5|$|In-game {{characters}} {{were inspired by}} illustrations from adventure and pirate stories such as Captain Blood (1922), the work of Charles Dana Gibson, and mugshots from Edwardian London and Australia. An anatomy expert helped ensure the morphology of character faces represented Great Britain, while Arkane maintained a sense of realism and political incorrectness. Mitton established defining groups for characters such <b>as</b> <b>rich,</b> poor, and hostile with specific anatomy and posture designs, and animators created stylized movements for each social class and specific characters to help convey emotions. The city guards, for example, have small heads, low shoulders, and big hands, with animations that blend human and monkey movements. Antonov and Mitton employed a textile carpet designer in Russia to design and paint some of the in-game art.|$|E
5|$|The second sub-plot {{depicts the}} lives of Charles W. Grannis and Miss Anastasia Baker. Grannis and Baker are two elderly {{boarders}} who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall {{and listen to the}} other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just <b>as</b> <b>rich</b> as Trina. But this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.|$|E
