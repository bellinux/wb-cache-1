40|$|International audienceUltrasonic {{non-destructive}} testing (NDT) {{is a standard}} process for detecting flaws or discontinuities in industrial parts. A pulse is emitted by an ultrasonic transducer through a material, and a reflected wave is produced at each impedance change. In many cases, echoes can overlap in the received signal and deconvolution {{can be applied to}} perform echo separation and to enhance the resolution. Common deconvolution techniques assume that the shape of the echoes is invariant to the propagation distance. This can cause poor performances with materials such as plastics or composites, in particular because acoustic propagation suffers from frequency-dependent attenuation. In geophysics, biomedical imaging or NDT, various frequency-dependent attenuation models have been proposed under different formulations. This communication compares the related possible constructions in order to account for attenuation in deconvolution methods. Especially, we introduce a discrete model for the data, that includes an <b>attenuation</b> <b>matrix</b> in the standard convolution model. Experimental data acquired from Plexiglas plates show that, for this material, attenuation varies roughly linearly with frequency, leading to the identification of a unique parameter. Finally, we show that such an advanced model manages a better fitting of the data, and promises improvement for the deconvolution of complex ultrasonic data...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough gross total {{resection}} in low-grade glioma surgery {{leads to}} a better patient outcome, the in-vivo control of resection borders remains challenging. For this purpose, navigated beta-probe systems combined with 18 F-based radiotracer, relying on activity distribution surface estimation, have been proposed to generate reconstructed images. The clinical relevancy has been outlined by early studies where intraoperative functional information is leveraged although inducing low spatial resolution in reconstruction. To improve reconstruction quality, multiple acquisition models have been proposed. They involve the definition of <b>attenuation</b> <b>matrix</b> for designing radiation detection physics. Yet, they require high computational power for efficient intraoperative use. To address the problem, we propose a new acquisition model called Partition Model (PM) considering an existing model where coefficients of the matrix are taken from a look-up table (LUT). Our model {{is based upon the}} division of the LUT into averaged homogeneous values for assigning attenuation coefficients. We validated our model using in vitro datasets, where tumors and peri-tumoral tissues have been simulated. We compared our acquisition model with the o-the-shelf LUT and the raw method. Acquisition models outperformed the raw method in term of tumor contrast (7. 97 : 1 mean T:B) but with a difficulty of real-time use. Both acquisition models reached the same detection performance with references (0. 8 mean AUC and 0. 77 mean NCC), where PM slightly improves the mean tumor contrast up to 10. 1 : 1 vs 9. 9 : 1 with the LUT model and more importantly, it reduces the mean computation time by 7. 5 %. Our model gives a faster solution for an intraoperative use of navigated beta-probe surface imaging system, with improved image quality. © 2016 SPIE...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{mitochondrial}} matrix copper ligand (CuL) complex, conserved in mammalian cells, is {{the likely}} source of copper for assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod 1) within the intermembrane space (IMS) in yeast. Targeting the copper-binding proteins human Sod 1 and Crs 5 to the mitochondrial matrix results in growth impairment on non-fermentable medium caused by decreased levels of CcO. This effect is reversed by copper supplementation. Matrix-targeted Crs 5 diminished Sod 1 protein within the IMS and impaired activity of an inner membrane tethered human Sod 1.

40|$|A {{rigorous}} perturbative {{transport equation}} for ballistic particles in thin films with random rough walls is derived by the diagrammatic Keldysh technique for both quasiclassical and quantized motion across the film. The derivation {{is based on}} canonical Migdal transformation that replaces a transport problem with random rough walls by an equivalent problem with flat boundaries and randomly distorted bulk. The rigorous derivation requires a modification of our previously used transformation to avoid non-Hermitian perturbations. The unusual nondiagonal structure of the effective scattering operator makes the transport equation different from the standard Waldmann-Snider equation when the distance between quantized levels for the motion across the film {{is comparable to the}} wall-induced perturbation. Outside of this anomalous quantum resonance region, the transport equation is similar to that for scattering by bulk impurities. The magnitude of the anomaly is calculated for degenerate particles and Gaussian correlations of surface inhomogeneities. The transport problem is solved analytically for the single-band occupancy and in the limiting cases of very large and very small correlation radii of inhomogeneities for an arbitrary correlation function of surface roughness. Elsewhere, the transport equation is analyzed numerically for the Gaussian correlation function. Transport coefficients are expressed explicitly via the angular harmonics of the surface correlation function; in the anomalous region, the results contain certain supplemental correlators. The results reveal various effects of interwall correlations on transport including an oscillatory dependence on the number of occupied minibands. The transition from quantum to quasiclassical description of ballistic motion across the (thick) film can be hindered by residual interwall interference effects similar to those in classical optic problems for thick films without bulk <b>attenuation.</b> Erroneous <b>matrix</b> elements in our previous calculations have been corrected...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMesangiolysis {{is defined}} as “dissolution or <b>attenuation</b> of mesangial <b>matrix</b> and {{degeneration}} of mesangial cells” [1]. In essence, it is an injurious process which affects the glomerular mesangium without causing obvious damage to the capillary basement membranes. The matrix swells, loosens, and eventually dissolves; the mesangial cells may show only edema and vacuolization, or may undergo severe degeneration and necrosis. Mesangiolysis appears to {{play a significant role}} in a wide variety of glomerular diseases, from those caused by toxins and poisons to several forms of glomerulonephritis. With light microscopy mesangiolysis is recognized by widening and poor staining of the mesangial areas (see Fig. 8). However, this change can be transitory and inconspicuous. A much more obvious manifestation is dilatation of the capillary lumina which attain aneurysmatic proportions and often end as a huge “blood cyst” occupying most of the glomerular space. As has been shown by electron microscopy, formation of blood cysts is secondary to the dissolution of mesangial matrix and loss of the “anchoring points” of the capillary walls. As a result, the basement membranes are no longer held in a fixed position by their attachments to the mesangium: They unfold and the adjoining capillary lumina merge...|$|R

30|$|Portable XRF, {{while being}} widely {{used for the}} {{investigation}} of paintings [21 – 24], should be interpreted with care as physical processes such as <b>attenuation,</b> absorption and <b>matrix</b> effects can influence the outcome. Furthermore, so-called escape peaks, scatter peaks, peaks originating from the instrument as well as overlapping peaks can complicate interpretation, which is especially challenging when investigating non-homogeneous multilayer materials such as paintings. Given these limitations, while peak areas are used to facilitate interpretation, {{the results of this}} study should be considered as qualitative, showing merely trends. A notorious difficulty, applicable to white paint, is the overlap between Ti K-lines and Ba L-lines [21]. This overlap can challenge the identification of titanium when barium is also present [7]. Hence, in this study, the applicability of PyMCA (Python MultiChannel Analyzer) [25] for deconvolution of these overlapping peaks is evaluated with self-made reference paints. As comparison of XRF spectra can be challenging, more and more accounts of additional multivariate data analysis are reported, mostly on processed data extracted from spectra (such as elemental concentrations) [26 – 31]. It is in this scope that, principal component analysis (PCA) has been used in this paper to enhance the interpretability of the pXRF dataset.|$|R
40|$|Lead- 210 (210 Pb) can {{be present}} at high {{activity}} concentrations, in residues arising from the petroleum, mineral processing and chemical industries. Although 210 Pb itself poses a low radiological risk, the nuclide decays via 210 Bi to the alpha emitting and highly radiotoxic 210 Po. Therefore, rapid, accurate determination of 210 Pb is essential for assessing the radiological risk to plant operators and appropriate sentencing of waste. Unfortunately, direct measurement of 210 Pb by gamma spectrometry is hindered by its weak gamma-ray emission at 46. 5 keV, which is readily attenuated by mineral matrices. This paper demonstrates {{the extent to which}} 210 Pb can be underestimated during routine analysis by an inter-laboratory exercise involving five accredited laboratories and a wide range of scales from diverse industrial sources.

The second method, requiring calculation of <b>matrix</b> <b>attenuation</b> factors for a representative fingerprint sample, was applied successfully to deposits from the steel and gas industries.

WIT uses various computed tomography (CT) methods for both NDE and NDA of nuclear waste drums. Low level waste (LLW), transuranic (TRU), and mixed radioactive waste can be inspected and characterized without opening the drums. With externally transmitted x-ray NDE techniques, WIT {{has the ability}} to identify high density waste materials like heavy metals, define drum contents in two- and three-dimensional space, quantify free liquid volumes through density and x-ray attenuation coefficient discrimination, and measure drum wall thickness.

The mobile feature of WIT allows inspection technologies to be brought to the nuclear waste drum storage site without the need to relocate drums for safe, rapid, and cost-effective characterization of regulated nuclear waste. The combination of these WIT characterization modalities provides the inspector with an unprecedented ability to non-invasively characterize the regulated contents of waste drums as large as 110 gallons, weighing up to 1, 600 pounds.

The precise mechanism of DN is not yet fully understood and the effective blockade of the progression of nephropathy remains a therapeutic challenge. Application of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for diabetes and its related complications has received increasing attention due to its wide availability, low side effects, and proven therapeutic mechanisms and benefits. In the current review, we mainly focus on the recent laboratory studies of the TCM formulas including Wu-Ling-San (Poria Five Powder; 五苓散 Wǔ Líng Sǎn), Danggui-Buxue-Tang (Tangkuei and Astragalus Decoction; 當歸補血湯 Dāng Guī Bǔ Xuè Tang), and Danggui-Shaoyao-San (Tangkuei and Paeonia Formula; 當歸芍藥散 Dāng Guī Sháo Yào Sǎn), conducted by the Committee on Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy at the Department of Health of Taiwan Government, in the amelioration of DN. These selected TCM formulas have anti-diabetic properties, with antihyperglycemic activity accompanied by amelioration of advanced glycation end product–mediated renal damage in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. However, the renoprotective effects of the selected TCM formulas did not correlate with suppressing renal renin–angiotensin system hyperactivity in diabetic rats. These TCM formulas also {{have the capacity to}} ameliorate the defective antioxidative defense system, leading to modulation of the oxidative stress, thereby resulting in downregulation of nuclear factor-κB as well as transforming growth factor-β 1 and, consequently, <b>attenuation</b> of extracellular <b>matrix</b> components such as fibronectin or type IV collagen expression in diabetic renal cortex tissue.

40|$|A {{quick and}} {{accurate}} method of measuring elastic and viscoelastic constants of a material {{is the essential}} first step for characterizing the material. This is more challenging for composite materials because unlike homogeneous metals and ceramics the material properties change from specimen to specimen for composite materials as the volume fraction of fibers and their orientations change. Anisotropic properties of composite materials add another difficulty in the measurement technique, since anisotropy increases the number of independent material constants. Polymer composites exhibit {{a high degree of}} <b>attenuation</b> in the <b>matrix</b> material; as a result, these composite materials cannot be assumed to be pure elastic material, so they should be modeled as viscoelastic materials by making the material constants complex. The real part is associated with the elastic behavior and the imaginary part is associated with the viscoelastic or attenuative behavior of the material. The number of independent material constants for a unidirectional (UD) composite, which is transversely isotropic, is ten (five real and five imaginary). Naturally, it is not practical and almost impossible to measure all these material constants by the traditional engineering method of applying stresses and measuring strains in different directions. Because of the measurement difficulty the imaginary parts of the material constants are often ignored. However, it should be mentioned here {{that it is important to}} measure the imaginary components of material constants because porosity and microcracking in the matrix due to material fatigue and aging affect the attenuation more than the elastic properties. In other words, the imaginary components of the material constants are a better indicator of material aging compared to the real components. Hence, an efficient technique to measure both real and imaginary components of the material constants is warranted and developed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, extracting {{environmental}} information from diffuse ambient noise {{has become an}} increasingly viable alternative to traditional active source methods. Due to uncontrollable factors such as noise field directionality, presence of spatially compact sources and unknown medium properties, results from ambient noise processing are often biased and need careful interpretation. Thus {{it is important to}} develop robust approaches that can perform well in the presence of such detriments. The first part of the dissertation focuses on interpreting the coherence and attenuation estimates from seismic arrays. Adaptive array processing using stations from the Southern California Seismic Network is used to identify the presence of multiple seismic waves, namely the fundamental and first mode Rayleigh wave, and body waves. The spatial coherence function (SCF) is modeled as a linear superposition of these waves, with the proportions estimated from data. The SCF shows beating and phase cancellation effects due to the interactions between wavenumbers, which could be misinterpreted as attenuation. The array geometry is also shown to limit the ranges at which the coherence can be estimated well. The second part of the dissertation focuses on developing statistical techniques to mitigate the effects of spatially compact sources on the noise processing. Analytical expressions are derived for the asymptotic eigenvalues of the true spatial covariance matrix (CM) for a uniform line array in three and two dimensional isotropic noise fields with and without <b>attenuation.</b> Using random <b>matrix</b> theory, the asymptotic probability density of the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix (SCM) also is derived in each of these scenarios. These analytical results provide upperbounds for the noise eigenvalues of the SCM. In the third part of the dissertation, the analytical results are combined with a sequential hypothesis testing framework. This then is used to identify the outliers (which correspond to strong and spatially compact sources) in shallow water ocean acoustic data. The cross-correlation results after rejecting these outliers are shown to be unbiased and converge faster with a higher signal-to-noise ratio. The performance of the eigenvalue rejection technique under different noise model assumptions also is investigate...|$|R
40|$|A {{computed}} tomography (CT) scanner is a device which {{is capable of}} mapping the variation in linear attenuation coefficient in a slice through an object. This is achieved by the multiple measurement of the attenuation of an X-ray beam at various positions and angles through the body. In medical diagnostic imaging using CT, contrast agents are administered to patients resulting in increased attenuation of the beam in the areas where the contrast agent resides. The increased contrast results in the easier and more accurate visualisation of abnormalities. In contrast-enhanced CT, iodine is almost universally used as the contrast agent when imaging the heart and associated arteries / veins. This is due to its low toxicity and high enhancement. It has been used extensively in traditional diagnostic radiology prior {{to the introduction of}} CT. A study was performed to determine whether iodine was the optimum element, in terms of the minimum concentration needed for visualisation, to use in contrast-enhanced CT scanning of the myocardium / heart wall. The results of this study show that gadolinium, and not iodine, is the optimum element to use as a CT contrast agent. Gadolinium, chelated to DTPA, is presently used as a contrast agent in MRI. The above study concentrated only on the particular case of imaging the myocardium. A theoretical study was undertaken to determine the minimum concentration of any element when scanned using two different imaging methods. The situation studied was that of administering the contrast agent / analyte to a cylinder, which is itself contained inside another cylinder, the space between filled with some matrix. By varying the size of the inner cylinder, administration of a contrast agent to various organs or arteries can be simulated. By varying the size of the outer cylinder, various object / patient sizes can be studied. In the first imaging method, two scans are performed at any energy, one with and one without the analyte present. These scans are subtracted to yield an image of the analyte alone. In the second method two scans are performed; one on the high side and one on the low side of the K absorption edge of the analyte. Again these are subtracted to yield an image of the analyte since the variation in the <b>attenuation</b> of the <b>matrix</b> across the K-edge is minor compared to that of the analyte. The equations were verified by both computer simulations and experimental scans. Two important results were obtained. As the relative size of the inner cylinder decreases, firstly the optimum element shifts towards higher atomic number transition elements and secondly, the ratio of the minimum concentration of the optimum elements to the minimum concentration of iodine needed decreases making the case for using the transition elements as contrast agents stronger when imaging low relative size objects...|$|R
