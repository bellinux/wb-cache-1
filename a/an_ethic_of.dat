5|$|Sensibility in {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, of the eighteenth century. But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two shorter parts (I and II) and a longer main part III.

In part II the nature and limits <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> responsibility are discussed. Part III begins with {{a survey of the}} development of discourse-ethical ("Diskursethik") strategies to justify <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> responsibility. Then it argues that a transcendental-pragmatic ("transzendentalpragmatisch") strategy is successful as a foundation for <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> responsibility, for this strategy avoids the solipsistic pitfalls <b>of</b> kantian <b>ethics</b> while incorporating its deontological universalism. If this argument succeeds, then: 1) Max Weber´s challenge that ethics must relate to concrete consequences can be met on a universalistic basis, 2) Hans Jonas´ question how ethical responsibility of the future should be assumed can be answered, 3) philosophical solipsism can be avoided by means of a speech act theory, and 4) a conceptual frame for the synthesis of kantian morality and hegelian "Sittlichkeit" can be developed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I argue for <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> {{machines}}.

Thus, I attempt to argue for <b>a</b> decentering <b>of</b> <b>ethics,</b> urging us to move beyond any centre, whatever it may be-anthropological, biological, etc. I argue that if we take ethics seriously we must admit that our only measure cannot be that of man. To develop the argument I use an episode in Star Trek where {{the fate of the}} highly sophisticated android Commander Data is to be decided.

500|$|Shelley's {{writings}} {{focus on}} the role of the family in society and women's role within that family. She celebrates the [...] "feminine affections and compassion" [...] associated with the family and suggests that civil society will fail without them. Shelley was [...] "profoundly committed to <b>an</b> <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> cooperation, mutual dependence, and self-sacrifice". In Lodore, for example, the central story follows the fortunes of the wife and daughter of the title character, Lord Lodore, who is killed in a duel at the end of the first volume, leaving a trail of legal, financial, and familial obstacles for the two [...] "heroines" [...] to negotiate. The novel is engaged with political and ideological issues, particularly the education and social role of women. [...] It dissects a patriarchal culture that separated the sexes and pressured women into dependence on men. In the view of Shelley scholar Betty T. Bennett, [...] "the novel proposes egalitarian educational paradigms for women and men, which would bring social justice as well as the spiritual and intellectual means by which to meet the challenges life invariably brings". However, Falkner is the only one of Mary Shelley's novels in which the heroine's agenda triumphs. The novel's resolution proposes that when female values triumph over violent and destructive masculinity, men will be freed to express the [...] "compassion, sympathy, and generosity" [...] of their better natures.|$|E

40|$|The <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> care, {{adopted in}} much of the nursing literature, is usually framed in {{opposition}} to the Kantian <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> principle. Irrespective <b>of</b> whether the <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> care is grounded in gender, as with Gilligan and Noddings, or inscribed on Heidegger's ontology, as with Benner, Kant remains the philosophical adversary, honouring reason rather than emotion, universality rather than context, and individual autonomy rather than interdependence. During the past decade, however, a great deal of Kantian scholarship – including feminist scholarship – has rendered this series of oppositions questionable, challenging the view that <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> care and Kant's moral law are irreconcilable. This paper therefore re-examines Kant's writings, drawing on recent scholarship, and argues both that they provide the care ethicists with everything they require, and that they offer something beyond <b>an</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> care, something that repairs the deficits in philosophies of caring. It concludes by suggesting that <b>a</b> Kantian <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> care has significant implications for the construction of nursing knowledge...|$|R
