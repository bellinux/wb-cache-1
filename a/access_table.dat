30|$|Related to {{the last}} {{category}} “Others” in Fig.  1, Hill (2011) developed several tools for automated grading in terms of Microsoft Office software, particularly an automated assessment system for Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft Excel Automated Grader—MEAGER) and an automated assessment system for Microsoft Office Access (Microsoft Access Database Automated Grading System—MADBAGS) (Hill 2004). Recently, his focus is on Microsoft Office Word and Microsoft Office PowerPoint programs. These grading systems exploit the Microsoft Word “Compare and Combine” function. This latter feature of Microsoft Office Word allows systems to merge documents to identify differences between them. Thus, the document of the correct version of the assignment given by the instructor is merged with the document produced by the student, and the differences are then recorded in a Microsoft Office <b>Access</b> <b>table.</b> The Word Grader counts obtained errors and embeds a grade report in the marked-up document. Even though Hill’s developments are powerful, they are limited {{by the use of}} Microsoft Office programs only, and as the author stated, the ability to assess new skills (e.g., manipulating text boxes) that are not compared by the Microsoft Word “Compare and Combine” function will be more difficult.|$|E

One of them is Tarok Puskesmas {{which is one of}} the public health centers in Payakumbuh. Currently the outpatient service system in Tarok Puskesmas is still done manually so that there is often a long process of information exchange or the occurrence of misinformation between sections in the puskesmas.

30|$|At an {{high level}} of abstraction, the {{rationale}} of view generation is aligned with the basic principles proposed in [17], but the schemaless nature of the document-based model requires a different rewriting mechanism {{as well as a}} different view derivation approach. As pointed out in Sect. 3, Lefevre et al. approach [17] requires to know in advance the scheme of the <b>accessed</b> <b>tables.</b> This cannot occur within the NoSQL scenario, where the structure of each accessed document is potentially unique and thus may differ from the ones of all other accessed documents. For instance, within the email dataset previously considered, the emails can have a varying number of to/cc/bcc receivers, whereas some of them may have no to/cc/bcc receiver. The goal is thus carrying out the projection, without knowing in advance the fields which characterize the accessed documents. As such, a possible solution is the one that operates by analyzing the structure of each document at execution time and thus differs from the methodology in [17], which relies on the a priori knowledge of the <b>accessed</b> <b>tables</b> schema. The idea is to consider the candidate documents as JSON objects, characterized by properties representing the document fields. These properties, which are modeled as key-value pairs, are iteratively accessed and modified by means of JSON manipulation functions. Different from [17], where the attributes to be projected are referred to by name within the rewritten queries, a possible approach for the NoSQL scenario consists in referring to the fields to be projected by position, iteratively considering any property of the documents.|$|R
