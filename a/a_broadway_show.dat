25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century Hawaiians began touring the United States, often in small bands. <b>A</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>show</b> called Bird of Paradise {{introduced}} Hawaiian music to many Americans in 1912 and the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco followed in 1915; one year later, Hawaiian music sold more recordings {{than any other}} style in the country. The increasing popularization of Hawaiian music influenced blues and country musicians; this connection can still be heard in modern country. In reverse, musicians like Bennie Nawahi began incorporating jazz into his steel guitar, ukulele and mandolin music, while the Kalama Quartet introduced a style of group falsetto singing. The musician Sol Hoʻopiʻi arose during this time, playing both Hawaiian music and jazz, Western swing and country, and developing the pedal steel guitar; his recordings helped establish the Nashville sound of popular country music. Lani McIntyre was another musician who infused a Hawaiian guitar sound into mainstream American popular music through his recordings with Jimmie Rodgers and Bing Crosby.|$|E

25|$|Greenwich's {{affiliation}} with Ellen Foley and Nona Hendryx indirectly led to <b>a</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>show</b> that resurrected her 1960s music. When Foley and Hendryx performed at The Bottom Line cabaret in New York City, Greenwich {{was there to}} see them. The Bottom Line owner Allan Pepper convinced Greenwich to meet him and discuss putting together a revue showcasing her hits. In 1984, Leader of the Pack, a show based on Greenwich's life and music, opened at The Bottom Line. Greenwich appeared as herself in the second act, which focused on her early years in Long Island and her marriage and partnership with Barry. The show was revamped for Broadway and opened at the Ambassador Theater the following year. Cast members included Greenwich, Darlene Love, Annie Golden, Dinah Manoff as young Ellie, and Patrick Cassidy as Jeff Barry. Leader of the Pack {{was nominated for a}} Tony Award for Best Musical and a Grammy Award for the cast album, and the play garnered The New York Music Critics' Award for Best Broadway Musical. During the 1990s and into the new millennium, the musical has enjoyed several revivals and continues to be performed at schools and community theaters. Leader Of The Pack is still performed all over the world.|$|E

500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle {{gave the}} program a rave review and saying that, [...] " [...] good you can't help {{wondering}} {{why no one}} thought of it before, a compelling mix of credible real-life melodrama with a fictionalized approximation {{of what it takes}} to get <b>a</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>show</b> from the idea stage to opening night. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "Unless you're allergic to musicals in general and Broadway in particular, you should find that a compelling central story, a strong cast, an out-of-the-procedural-mold premise and some rousing, roof-raising numbers more than compensate for any lingering problems." [...] He ultimately gave it three and a half stars out of four. The A.V. Club reviewer Noel Murray praised the cast and Eileen's divorce storyline. He mainly criticized the staging and arrangement of the musical numbers saying they threatened the realism of the show and wrote they weren't completely [...] "digetic". He ultimately gave the episode a B. Another A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff criticized the series for not avoiding clichés but also wrote [...] "the show is so damned sincere about how much it embraces the clichés of the backstage Broadway story that those inclined to like this sort of thing—and I'm very much one of them—will forgive it some of these excesses." [...] He also criticized the adoption storyline. Despite this, he went on to compare the series to Hill Street Blues, ER and The West Wing.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the time}} of Henson's characters' final {{appearances}} on SNL, he began developing two projects featuring the Muppets: <b>a</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>show</b> and a weekly television series. In 1976, the series was initially rejected by the American networks who believed that Muppets would appeal to only a child audience. Then Henson pitched the show to British impresario Lew Grade to finance the show. The show would be shot in the United Kingdom and syndicated worldwide. That same year, he scrapped plans for his Broadway show and moved his creative team to England, where The Muppet Show began taping. The Muppet Show featured Kermit as host, {{and a variety of}} other memorable characters, notably Miss Piggy, Gonzo the Great, and Fozzie Bear, along with other characters such as Animal. Kermit's role on The Muppet Show was often compared by his co-workers to Henson's role in Muppet Productions: a shy, gentle boss with [...] "A whim of steel" [...] who [...] " [...] things as firmly as it is possible to run an explosion in a mattress factory." [...] Caroll Spinney, the puppet performer of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, remembered that Henson [...] "would never say he didn't like something. He would just go 'Hmm.' That was famous. And if he liked it, he would say, 'Lovely!' [...] " [...] Henson himself recognized Kermit as an alter-ego, though he thought that Kermit was bolder than he; he once said of the character, [...] "He can say things I hold back." ...|$|E
500|$|Barbara Ellen of The Observer {{said the}} song was [...] "of the {{exemplary}} standard" [...] of the band's previous albums, Survivor (2001) and The Writing's on the Wall.

Erika Ramirez and Jason Lipshutz writing for Billboard magazine felt that the group [...] "cemented their street and chart credibility" [...] with the song. Another reviewer from the same magazine felt that the band's [...] "personal transition from teen-dom to womanhood" [...] was most evident on [...] "Soldier" [...] and two other songs from the album. Jenny Eliscu from Rolling Stone wrote in her review, [...] "It's a hot track, even if the message feels affected coming from these church girls." [...] For the same reason, Vibe writer Dimitri Ehrlich described it as <b>a</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>show</b> tune about thug life. Gil Kaufman from MTV News described the song as a [...] "bouncy homage to thug love that featured the signature DC mix of urban grit and slick production". Rashod Ollisong writing for The Baltimore Sun gave a more mixed review for the song, writing [...] "It is catchy, but the beat is trite, and the lyrical message is downright trifling" [...] before adding that it glorifies a [...] "warped" [...] image of black masculinity which he heavily criticized. He further argued that the group [...] "should put more thought into their lyrics" [...] due to the background and image each member created throughout their career.|$|E

500|$|... "Cherish" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and released {{as the third}} single from Like a Prayer (1989). The song is built around the themes of love and relationships, with William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet one of its major inspirations. Madonna was reading Romeo and Juliet during the breaks during rehearsals for Speed the Plow, <b>a</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>show</b> {{in which she was}} starring in 1988. On the third day of the Like a Prayer recording sessions, she presented Leonard with the lyrics of [...] "Cherish", and explained that she had written the song [...] "one sunny afternoon by the beach", but later confessed that it was actually written in her make-up room. [...] "I wrote it in a superhyper-positive state of mind that I knew was not going to last", the singer recalled. Leonard introduced one line from the similar titled song by the 1960s band The Association, [...] "Cherish is the word I use", after which Madonna decided to include it on Like a Prayer. The B-side of the single release of [...] "Cherish" [...] was a previously unreleased track called [...] "Supernatural", initially composed during the recording sessions of her third studio album, True Blue and later completed in 1989. In 2009, during an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna confessed that she {{had never been able to}} predict if her songs would be successful, irrespective of her personal opinion of them. As an example, she cited [...] "Cherish" [...] as one of the most [...] "retarded" [...] songs she had written, but noted it became a commercial success. The song was also included on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection and the two-disc edition of her 2009 compilation Celebration.|$|E
500|$|MacDermot {{followed}} Hair {{with three}} successive rock scores: Two Gentlemen of Verona (1971); Dude (1972), a second collaboration with Ragni; and Via Galactica (1972). [...] While Two Gentlemen of Verona found receptive audiences and a Tony for Best Musical, Dude failed after just sixteenperformances, and Via Galactica flopped after a month. [...] According to Horn, {{these and other}} such [...] "failures {{may have been the}} result of producers simply relying on the label 'rock musical' to attract audiences without regard {{to the quality of the}} material presented." [...] Jesus Christ Superstar (1970) and Godspell (1971) were two religiously themed successes of the genre. [...] Grease (1971) reverted to the rock sounds of the 1950s, and black-themed musicals like The Wiz (1975) were heavily influenced by gospel, R and soul music. [...] By the late 1970s, the genre had played itself out. [...] Except for a few outposts of rock, like Dreamgirls (1981) and Little Shop of Horrors (1982), audience tastes in the 1980s turned to [...] with pop scores, like Les Misérables (1985) and The Phantom of the Opera (1986). [...] Some later rock musicals, such as Rent (1996) and Spring Awakening (2006), as well as jukebox musicals featuring rock music, like We Will Rock You (2002) and Rock of Ages (2009), have found success. [...] But the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after Hair. [...] Critic Clive Barnes commented, [...] "There really weren't any rock musicals. [...] No major rock musician ever did a rock score for Broadway. ... You might think of the musical Tommy, but it was never conceived as <b>a</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>show.</b> ... And one can see why. [...] There's so much more money in records and rock concerts. [...] I mean, why bother going through the pain of a musical which may close in Philadelphia?" ...|$|E
