5|$|Expecting <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> {{continuation}} of the battle, three Allied brigades arrived within twenty-four hours to reinforce the beachhead, but no subsequent attack materialised. Instead, on 20 and 24 May two truces were declared to collect the wounded and bury the dead in no man's land. The Turks never succeeded in capturing the bridgehead; instead the ANZACs evacuated the position {{at the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|Following the Union {{defeat at}} Bull Run, panicked {{efforts were made}} to {{strengthen}} the forts built by Barnard in order to defend Washington from what was perceived as <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> Confederate attack. Many of the makeshift trenches and blockhouses that resulted would later be renovated and expanded into permanent defenses surrounding Fort Runyon.|$|E
5|$|In September 1841, Hermano Pule {{traveled}} from Manila to Bay, Laguna {{to meet with}} the cofradía members that evaded capture. Anticipating <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> attack, Pule and Purgatorio rallied 4,000 followers at Barrio Isabang on the slopes of Mount Banahaw. A group of pagan Aetas from Sierra Madre also allied themselves with the cofradía.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on October 8, optimistic field reports expecting <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> Egyptian {{collapse}} caused Gonen to alter {{plans for the}} attack. Adan would now attack {{in the direction of}} the strongpoints at Firdan and Ismailia. The change was not formulated on precise tactical intelligence, and would come to cause some confusion among Israeli commanders for the rest of the day.|$|E
5|$|The {{transport}} convoy reached Guadalcanal {{and successfully}} unloaded its cargo on 30–31 January. The rest of Halsey's warships took {{station in the}} Coral Sea south of the Solomons {{to wait for the}} approach of any Japanese warship forces supporting what the Allies believed to be <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> offensive. The departure of TF18 from the Guadalcanal area removed a significant potential threat to the Ke operation.|$|E
5|$|Viewership for {{the second}} season premiere on January 9, 2005 was down by two-thirds to 1.81 million. The ratings never {{recovered}} to their first-season highs, although the season two finale experienced an upswing with 2.40 million viewers on March 27, 2005. Season 2 averaged 1.7 million viewers, not enough to avert <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> cancellation.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} damage, Henderson {{personnel}} {{were able to}} restore one of the runways to operational condition within a few hours. Over the next several weeks, the CAF gradually recovered as Allied forces delivered more aircraft, fuel, and aircrew personnel to Guadalcanal. Observing the Japanese deliveries of troops and supplies to the island, American forces were expecting <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> offensive by Japanese ground forces, {{but they were not}} sure where and when it would take place.|$|E
5|$|Following the Union {{defeat at}} Bull Run, panicked {{efforts were made}} to {{strengthen}} the forts built by Barnard in order to defend Washington from what was perceived as <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> Confederate attack. Many of makeshift trenches and blockhouses that resulted would later be renovated and expanded into permanent defenses surrounding Fort Corcoran. On July 23, President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward visited Fort Corcoran in an effort to revive morale after the defeat at Bull Run.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the defence}} {{measures}} {{appear to have}} prevented the final destruction and collapse of the Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in ca. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event {{marked the end of}} Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale. The palace of Pylos, in the southwestern Peloponnese, faced destruction in c. 1180 BC. The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> attack without giving any detail about the attacking force.|$|E
50|$|The Jin attack {{occurred}} during a heavy downpour. Ming dispatched a small relief contingent of 100 men, {{but they were}} intercepted by a Jin force and suffered 32 casualties. The Jin army besieged Kaiyuan and attacked Ma Lin's outer defenses, which had been heavily strengthened in preference to a safer position on the walls. However the strategy ended badly for Ma Lin, who's forces were defeated. As too many men were already outside, there weren't enough men to man the walls. <b>As</b> <b>imminent</b> defeat became apparent, the Censor Zheng Zhifan fled.|$|R

500|$|The colonial {{authorities}} {{received two}} warnings that <b>a</b> revolt was <b>imminent.</b> <b>A</b> disaffected follower of Chilembwe reported the preacher's [...] "worrying intentions" [...] to Philip Mitchell, a colonial civil servant (and future governor of Uganda and Kenya), in August 1914. A Catholic mission was also warned but neither took any action.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, Congress Heights (so called because the Capitol building in downtown Washington could {{be seen from the}} tops of the hills) were owned by the Berry family, who also owned much of the Anacostia River bottomland {{to the west of the}} Heights. In the days following the First Battle of Bull Run, panicked efforts by the Union were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> Confederate attack. These makeshift entrenchments were largely confined to the direct approaches to Washington and the bridges that spanned the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|Some Gabonese mistakenly {{identified}} the United States as a co-conspirator in the coup. Time asserted that French officials helped spread the rumor of American involvement. This {{reached a point}} which some automobile stations refused to help Darlington and other Americans. After William F. Courtney, deputy chief of the United States Embassy, {{received a call from}} a man identifying himself as DuPont and threatening <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> attack, a hand grenade exploded outside the embassy. The explosion, which occurred {{at a time when the}} building was closed and locked on 3 March, resulted in damage to the embassy sign and the cracking of two windows.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{refused to}} yield, and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil {{prepared for what}} was seen as <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> conflict. PedroII was {{the main reason for}} Brazil's resistance; he rejected any suggestion of yielding. This response came as a surprise to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented its demands and, upon seeing the British government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E

5|$|The {{fact that}} a person prepares a weapon in order to defend {{themselves}} against expected attack does not preclude the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, {{it may not be}} expected from a defender to wait and rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. The defender may use proportionate accessible means in order to prevent <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> attack and disarm the attacker.|$|E
5|$|The first Allied {{attempt to}} break through the Gustav Line in the Battle of Monte Cassino in January 1944 met with early success, with the British X Corps {{breaking}} through the line held by the 94th Infantry Division and imperilling the entire Tenth Army front. At the same time, Kesselring was receiving warnings of <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> Allied amphibious attack at Anzio. Kesselring rushed his reserves, the 29th and 90th Panzergrenadier Divisions, to the Cassino front. They were able to stabilise the German position there but left Rome poorly guarded.|$|E
5|$|The group {{agrees that}} Randall is <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> threat, and Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) {{believes}} {{he should be}} executed but waits until sunset. Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) finds most of the group agree with Rick's decision, and attempts {{to change their minds}} by appealing to their humanity, civilization and morality. Most agree with Rick's choice for various reasons, but Shane (Jon Bernthal) agrees to support Dale should he be able to convince the others to change their minds.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} Copperhead is unclear. The visit was {{reported}} up the German chain of command, and some double agents later received {{requests for information}} about Montgomery's movements. There {{is no indication that}} Montgomery's appearance affected German views of the imminent invasion threat. Writing in 2011, historian Joshua Levine attributes this {{to the fact that the}} deception was carried out ten days before D-Day, arguing that there would be no reason for a flying visit to North Africa to preclude <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> invasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{unpredictability of}} the show and Banksy's elusive nature stirred {{excitement}} amongst fans, while defacement from competing street artists and vandals became <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> problem. While Banksy's works were inherently illegal, no official complaints were reported to the police; most property owners praised the art and some took measures to protect it. The month-long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its more politically strong pieces, and received mixed reviews from critics. A documentary film covering this period titled Banksy Does New York was released in 2014.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{religious}} overtones similar to Swift's sermons, {{such as the}} Drapier's combination of a duty to God with duty to one's king and country. Many critics compare the language and rhetorical style of the first letter to a Hebrew prophet or to an evangelical preacher who warns the masses of <b>an</b> <b>imminent</b> threat to their soul. However, the final judgment had not yet come, so the Drapier also included arguments claiming that Wood's halfpence would destroy the Irish economy and {{the souls of the}} citizenry.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> Independence became <b>imminent,</b> <b>a</b> {{comprehensive}} Malayanisation programme was {{embarked on}} {{to ensure the}} Department {{would continue to be}} run by capable local personnel. From as early as 1954, no less than 21 Malaysians were pursuing studies in telecommunications related areas in Britain and Australia. Their numbers were boosted by youth enrolling at the Department’s Gracelyn Training School.|$|R
