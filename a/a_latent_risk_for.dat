40|$|Background: Health {{management}} or health promotion programs are limited, particularly for workers in small-sized industries. Objectives: This study aimed {{to identify the}} 10 -year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using the general Framingham Risk Score and examine predictors of CVD <b>risk</b> adjusted <b>for</b> age among male workers. Methods: Routine health screening data and self-reported questionnaires were collected from 12 933 male workers in 1041 industries from 2009 to 2011 in South Korea. Results: The proportion of high CVD risk (Framingham Risk Score ? 20 %) was 7. 1 % (n = 919). Most (83. 5 %) subjects were manufacturing workers, engaged in manual labor, with a mean (SD) age of 42. 1 (9. 2) years (range, 30 - 70 years). Younger workers {{were more likely to}} smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol heavily, and be physically inactive. A logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for age, occupation type, body mass index, physical activity, and alcohol consumption were significant predictors of 10 -year CVD risk. Conclusion: To reduce CVD risk, education regarding lifestyle modification should be emphasized for small-sized industrial workers who are overweight, physically inactive, and heavy alcohol drinkers and who work as bus or taxi drivers. Careful attention is also needed for younger workers who are <b>a</b> <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> group <b>for</b> the development of CVD.

To date, {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) studies of children have mainly focused on institutionalisation and investigated conscious processing of affect. Aims: To investigate neural response to pre-attentively presented affect cues in a community sample of children with documented experiences of maltreatment in the home. Method: A masked dot-probe paradigm involving pre-attentive presentation of angry, happy and neutral facial expressions was employed. Eighteen maltreated children were compared with 23 carefully matched non-maltreated peers. Results: Increased neural response was observed in the right amygdala for pre-attentively presented angry and happy faces in maltreated v. non-maltreated children. Level of amygdala activation was negatively associated with age at onset for several abuse subtypes. Conclusions: Maltreatment {{is associated with}} heightened neural response to positive and negative facial affect, even to stimuli outside awareness.

However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued a warning on VAR-induced depression and suicide. In the present study, utilizing the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), we searched for antidepressants (ADs) used during SCT that cause fewer suicide-related events (SRE) (Study 1). We also investigated whether VAR concomitantly administered with ADs increases the risk of SRE (Study 2). In addition, we investigated whether the use of VAR alone is <b>a</b> <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> factor of SRE. The backgrounds of cases with and without SRE were matched using the Propensity Score. In Study 1, the highest integrated Reporting Odds Ratio (iROR) was noted in concomitantly administered mirtazapine (iROR 6. 98; 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 1. 57 – 30. 99), while the lowest ratio was noted in concomitantly administered amitriptyline (iROR 0. 59; iROR 95 %CI 0. 23 – 1. 50). Study 2 clarified that SCT increases the risk of SRE in AD-treated cases (iROR 8. 02; iROR 95 %CI 5. 47 – 11. 76; not significance). Of ADs concomitantly used during SCT with VAR, amitriptyline and mirtazapine showed the lowest and highest risks, respectively (Study 1). It was clarified that concomitant use of VAR in the treatment of depression with ADs increased the risk of SRE (Study 2).

We find that the entire ‘abnormal return’ is associated with the high volatility regime, so the presence of <b>a</b> <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> factor cannot be ruled out. Moreover, any market inefficiencies identified by the dynamic indexing model are temporary and occur only in special market circumstances.

Traditional approaches consider macroeconomic variables as drivers of aggregate credit risk (ACR). However, recent literature suggests the existence of <b>a</b> <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> factor influencing ACR, which is regularly interpreted as the latent credit cycle. We explicitly model this latent factor by adding an unobserved component to our models, which already include macroeconomic variables. In this paper we make use of insolvency rates of Austrian corporate industry sectors to model realized probabilities of default. The contribution of this paper to the literature on ACR risk is threefold. First, in order to cope with the lack of theory behind ACR drivers, we implement state-of-the-art variable selection algorithms to draw from a rich set of macroeconomic variables. Second, we add an unobserved risk factor to a state space model, which we estimate via a Kalman filter in an expectation maximization algorithm.

Bacterial biofilms have been suggested to play an important role in the infection of EVD, but direct evidence is as yet lacking. We report the case of a 17 - year-old male with Dandy-Walker malformation who presented with headache, nausea and drowsiness; a CT scan revealed enlarged ventricles. The patient had a history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision 3 weeks prior to admission. The shunt was removed on suspicion of infection and an EVD placed. Daily surveillance cultures through the EVD were negative and the EVD was replaced on day 5. Examination of the initial EVD by confocal microscopy demonstrated clear intraluminal biofilm formation; molecular analysis by PCR identified Staphylococcus aureus resident on the catheter.

A 51 -year-old man complained of rigidity of both of the upper and lower extremities due to anoxic brain damage. His rigidity was exhibited as flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticate rigidity. Prior to electroacupuncture, his decorticate rigidity was treated with dantrolene sodium and baclofen. However, his rigidity had not improved. This patient received total 41 sessions of electroacupuncture. The patient’s Modified Ashworth’s Scale changed from 4 at baseline to 2 after the treatment, indicating an improvement in the rigidity of the upper limbs.

40|$|We use {{data from}} a survey of {{residents}} of five Italian cities conducted in late Spring 2004 to estimate the discount rates implicit in (a) money v. future risk reductions and (b) money v. money tradeoffs. We find that the mean personal discount rate is 2 % in (a) and 8. 7 % in (b). The latter {{is lower than the}} discount rates estimated in comparable situations in many recent studies, greater than market interest rates in Italy at the time, and exhibits modest variation with age and gender. The discount rate implicit in money v. risk tradeoffs is in line with estimates from studies in the US and Europe, and does not depend on observable individual characteristics.

40|$|Introduction Medical {{errors are}} major hazards, and lapses in non-technical {{skills such as}} {{situational}} awareness contribute to most incidents. Risks are concentrated in acute care, and in crisis situations clinicians can apparently ignore vital information. Poor workplace ergonomics contributes to risk. </p Existing work into perceptual errors offers insights, but these phenomena have been little researched in medicine. This thesis considers medical non-technical skills {{and how they are}} taught, and explores vulnerability to inattentional and change blindness. </p Methods</p Medical human factors and the psychology of perceptual error were reviewed, and a mixed-methods assessment of postgraduate medical curricula completed. </p Experiments assessed cliniciansâ interaction with clinical monitoring devices using eye-tracking, and studies were conducted exposing clinicians to various perceptual error stimuli using non-clinical and clinical videos, and simulation. A survey was also conducted to assess cliniciansâ insight into the phenomena of perceptual error. </p Results</p Non-technical skills feature poorly in medical curricula, and equipment is poorly standardised in critical care areas. Unfamiliar devices slow response times and increase error rate. </p Clinical training confers no generalisable advantage in perceptual reliability. Even expert clinicians miss important events. Two out of every three life-support instructors for example missed a critical failure in the patientâs oxygen supply when watching a recorded emergency simulation. </p The insight and understanding healthcare staff have of perceptual errors is poor, leading to significant overestimates of perceptual reliability that could have consequences for clinical practice. </p Conclusions</p Perceptual errors represent <b>a</b> <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> factor contributing to loss of situational awareness. High rates of perceptual error were observed in the video-based experiment. Although lower rates were observed in simulation, important events were still missed by participants that could have serious consequences. </p The incidence of perceptual error appears sensitive to the method used to test for it, and this has important implications for the design of future experiments testing for these phenomena. </p Mitigating perceptual error is likely to be challenging, but relatively simple adjustments to team practices in emergency situations may be fruitful. </p...|$|R
