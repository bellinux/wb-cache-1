500|$|The plot of Man of Steel {{employs a}} {{nonlinear}} narrative, and tells {{parts of the}} story in flashback. During story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises in 2008, David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context. Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio, who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight. Nolan admired Bryan Singer's work on Superman Returns for its connection to Richard Donner's version, stating that [...] "A {{lot of people have}} approached Superman in <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> I only know the way that has worked for us that's what I know how to do," [...] emphasizing the idea that Batman exists in a world where he is the only superhero and a similar approach to the Man of Steel would assure the integrity needed for the film. [...] "Each serves to the internal logic of the story. They {{have nothing to do with}} each other." [...] Nolan, however, clarified that the new film would not have any relationship with the previous film series.|$|E

AddressSanitizer {{on the other hand}} is created on compile-time and inserts error-checking code inline into a program during compilation. Its shadow-memory implementation uses a huge reservation of virtual memory for its shadow memory, giving very different performance characteristics.|$|E

In 2007, Rapinoe suffered her second season-ending ACL injury two games into the season. She was granted a medical hardship waiver by the NCAA, but did not use it.|$|E
