This study describes the short-term variability of microphytobenthic production in an estuarine mudflat (the Canche estuary of the English Channel) by using an autonomous acquisition system for oxygen microprofiles. More than 240 profiles were measured at low and high tide during three deployments performed within a 3 -week period (April-May 2007). Additional measurements characterised the surficial sediments (granulometry, porosity, chlorophyll a, temperature, salinity) and incident light. Depth-integrated gross production values were correlated with light intensity and reached up to 146 mg C m- 2 h- 1, while the turbidity of the overlying water prevented any primary production during immersion.

40|$|Abstract. A transfer-function {{method has}} been applied to {{determine}} solute-transport parameters from earlier sections of complete breakthrough data. Time-domain reflectometry allows the measurement of breakthrough data in unsaturated soil. In fine-textured soils, the flow of water must be kept low to maintain unsaturated conditions, and so experiments for a complete breakthrough of solute may last a very long time. Substantial savings of time and computer memory might be achieved if data could be analysed from an earlier section of breakthrough data. Data at 2 vertical positions (input at upper and response at lower position) from a complete breakthrough of calcium chloride applied as <b>a</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>input</b> to 4 unsaturated soils (coarse sand, sandy loam, clay loam, clay) were divided into 4 sets of increasing duration. Transport parameters of calcium chloride were determined by a transfer function, which results in similar values of the parameters from the last 3 datasets in all 4 soils. In the clay soil, however, because of erroneous breakthrough data the fit between the measured and estimated breakthrough curves (BTCs) was poor, but the transport parameters were consistent among different segments of data. We show {{that it is possible to}} determine successfully solute-transport parameters from partial breakthrough data, which include the peak of the response BTC.

Generally speaking, in reactor science unsteady-state tests may often appear preferable to steady-state since they are made up of a chain of intermediate ones; but without any theoretical necessity holding. In RTD studies, however, non-steady state tests are the only conceivable ones if conservative tracers are employed, because once a transition is over {{there is no way to}} reconstruct it and assess the hydraulic behaviour of the tank.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{physical}} model {{to explain the}} behavior of long-term, time series measurements of chloride, a natural passive tracer, in rainfall and runoff in catchments [Kirchner et al., Nature 403 (524), 2000]. A spectral {{analysis of the data}} shows the chloride concentrations in rainfall to have a white noise spectrum, while in streamflow, the spectrum exhibits a fractal 1 /f scaling. The empirically derived distribution of tracer travel times h(t) follows a power-law, indicating low-level contaminant delivery to streams for a very long time. Our transport model is based on a continuous time random walk (CTRW) with an event time distribution governed by ψ(t) ∼ A_βt^- 1 -β. The CTRW using this power-law ψ(t) (with 0 <β< 1) is interchangeable with the time-fractional advection-dispersion equation (FADE) and has accounted for the universal phenomenon of anomalous transport in a broad range of disordered and complex systems. In the current application, the events can be realized as transit times on portions of the catchment network. The travel time distribution is the first passage time distribution F(t; l) at a distance l from <b>a</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>input</b> (at t= 0) at the origin.

40|$|Catchment {{travel time}} {{distributions}} reflect how precipitation from different storms is stored and mixed {{as it is}} transported to the stream. Catchment travel time distributions can be described by the mean travel time and {{the shape of the}} distribution around the mean. Whereas mean travel times have been quantified in a range of catchment studies, only rarely has the shape of the distribution been estimated. The shape of the distribution affects both the short-term and long-term catchment response to <b>a</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>input</b> of a soluble contaminant. Travel time distributions are usually estimated from conservative tracer concentrations in precipitation and streamflow, which are analyzed using time-domain convolution or spectral methods. Of these two approaches,spectral methods are better suited to determining the shape of the distribution. Previous spectral analyses of both rainfall and streamflow tracer time series from several catchments in Wales showed that rainfall chemistry spectra resemble white noise, whereas the stream tracer spectra in these same catchments exhibit fractal 1 /f scaling over three orders of magnitude. Here we test the generality of the observed fractal scaling of streamflow chemistry, using spectral analysis of long-term tracer time series from 22 catchments in North America and Europe. We demonstrate that 1 /f fractal scaling of stream chemistry is a common feature of these catchments. These observations imply that catchments typically exhibit an approximate power-law distribution of travel times, and thus retain a long memory of past inputs. The observed fractal scaling places strong constraints on possible models of catchment behavior, because it is inconsistent with the exponential travel time distributions that are predicted by simple mixing models...|$|E

40|$|The {{high dose}} {{requirements}} of biopharmaceutics {{have led to}} the development of mammalian cell culture technologies to increase biomanufacturing capacity. Among them, disposable bioreactors are attracting attention, particularly the Wave bioreactor. This system induces an undulation movement to the culture, ensuring good mixing and oxygen transfer without shear damage, and requires no cleaning/sterilization, providing simpler operation and no cross-contamination. However, this new reactor still needs further characterization. In this sense, the residence time distribution (RTD) was evaluated, allowing the characterization of the mixing/flow and the comparison with ideal models and a commercial stirred tank reactor (STR). RTD was determined using methylene blue with <b>a</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>input</b> methodology, at three mammalian culture flow rates: low (L: 3. 3 x 10 - 5 m 3 /h), intermediate (I: 7. 9 x 10 - 5 m 3 /h), and high (H: 1. 25 x 10 - 4 m 3 /h). Samples were taken and absorbance read at 660 nm. Results show that Wave behaviour approximates the ideal and experimental STR at flow L, but deviates from ideal models at flows I and H. The comparison of average residence time (tr) with time of passage (τ) provides a possible explanation for this non-ideality. For STR at all flows and Wave at flow H, tr was lower than τ, indicating dead zones inside the reactor. For Wave at flows L and I, tr was higher than τ, indicating short-circuiting. In conclusion, the choice of flow rate will strongly influence the behaviour of the Wave bioreactor. The use of a low flow seems to be a choice that provides behaviour closer to the ideal continuous STR model...|$|E

For sorption measurements, {{a range of}} concentrations of pesticide solutions in 0. 1 M calcium chloride were shaken with soil samples at a soil:solution ratio of 1 : 10 for 4 h at 25 °C. The movement of pesticides was examined using re-packed soil columns following a step input of 2, 4 -D and tritiated water (3 H 2 O) and <b>a</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>input</b> of 2, 4 -D, atrazine, phorate and terbufos. A convection-dispersion equation (CDE), either with an equilibrium or a bicontinuum non-equilibrium sorption process, was used to simulate the measured effluent breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained by simultaneous displacement of a non-sorbed solute (3 H 2 O) and a sorbed solute (2, 4 -D). The Patua soil sorbed more pesticide than did the Tokomaru soil. This is attributed to the larger amounts of organic matter {{and the presence of}} short-range order clays (allophane) in the former soil compared to the latter. Kinetic sorption data for pesticides showed an initial rapid rate followed by a slower rate of sorption. In column experiments, the pesticide in the leachate appeared later in the Patua than in the Tokomaru soil. Movement of pesticides in soils decreased with an increase in Kd values. The step-function experiments showed a symmetrical BTC for the non-sorbed solute (3 H 2 O) with a sigmoidal shape, whereas there was an asymmetrical BTC with extensive tailing for the sorbed solute (2, 4 -D). The CDE with an equilibrium sorption process adequately described the 3 H 2 O BTC, but failed to simulate the BTC for 2, 4 -D. The CDE with a bicontinuum non-equilibrium sorption process provided a good description of the BTC for 2, 4 -D.

40|$|The loss of {{pesticides}} from land to waterways is a well-studied {{problem at the}} plot or paddock scale and also within waterways. However, no coherent theory exists to scale {{the data from the}} plot and paddock scales to that of catchment scale for water quality. Here we develop a theoretical basis for that scaling. This is a complex problem as pesticides will usually be applied to different paddocks at different times, and there can be numerous paddocks in a catchment. The mass of pesticide in the topsoil for a periodical applied pesticide was described at the paddock scale as <b>a</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>input</b> with first-order kinetic decay. At the catchment scale, a summation of pulse inputs during an application window is shown to converge to a convolution integral. From the convolution solution, the residual mass, mean mass and maximum mass of pesticide can be determined. Results show that (1) maximum mass is reduced at the catchment scale compared to the paddock scale, (2) the mean mass is the same for all application functions with the same total mass per period, and (3) the residual mass is dependent on the half-life of the pesticide and the periodicity of its application. As an example the convolution method was applied to two agricultural catchments draining into the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, to predict the concentrations and annual masses of pesticide lost compared with measured losses. In these examples, runoff was assumed to occur after a threshold of 50. mm of rainfall/irrigation was received, based on 100 year climate records for the catchments. A simple transfer of mass from the topsoil to runoff was used with the amount of mass transferred being a ratio of that in the topsoil. Even with the highly simplified description of paddock and catchment hydrology, the convolution method gave concentrations in the same order of magnitude as measured values. The method developed here using convolution integrals has applications in explaining the results of pesticide measurements made at paddock and catchment scale, and can be linked to more complex models of catchment hydrology.

40|$|Circulating cell {{adhesion}} amidst the high shear {{environment of the}} vasculature is central to several physiological and pathophysiological processes, including leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation, stem cell homing and cancer metastasis. This process is initiated by selectin-mediated adhesion, the molecular “brakes” that slow cells down relative to bulk fluid flow to facilitate cell-cell signaling and eventual firm {{cell adhesion}}. Selectin recognition therefore represents a critical step whereby therapeutic interventions aimed towards the interference of cell homing could be targeted. While the force dependency of these high kon and koff rate interactions has been well described, little understanding exists of the long time- and length-scale interactions of different cell subtypes that would best describe the functional capacity of different cell homing via selectins to systemic peripheral tissues. This limits the adequate description of sustained cell adhesion efficiencies in physiological conditions that predicates the effectiveness of cell homing {{as well as the}} design effective therapeutic interventions to selectively attenuate metastasis but not normal cell homing using such criteria. To address this issue, we developed a so-called “cell adhesion chromatography” system, a microfluidic-based device designed for use in conjunction with videomicroscopy for the interrogation of the adhesion behavior of cells over long time- and length-scales. In order to achieve uniform contact of a pulse cell suspension input into a selectin-functionalized parallel plate flow chamber, we designed a feature that enables complete cell settling to the chamber bottom based on Stoke’s flow predictions, increasing contact uniformity of the pulse cell input with the substrate upon entry into the main chromatography channel from ~ 50 to > 95 %. Using this configuration, residence time distributions for <b>a</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>input</b> of cells perfused at defined shear stresses were generated based on cell elution times from the cell adhesion chromatography system. Selectin-functionalized substrates delayed cell elution times relative to bovine serum albumin coated-substrates by orders of magnitude in a selectin concentration, shear and cation dependent fashion. Preliminary experiments were also performed to begin to define the differences in efficiencies of healthy (human monocyte) versus malignant (human colon carcinoma) cell adhesion to selectins in shear flow. Our results suggest significant differences in the functional capacity of healthy versus malignant cells to sustain adhesion in shear flow and that cell adhesion chromatography is a new tool that provides unique insight into the process of cell adhesion in fluid flow.

Compared to the 30 meter resolution of Landsat 5 TM, {{the amount of information}} in the output image was dramatically increased. In this era of high spatial resolution, the estimation of spatial quality of images is gaining attention. Historically, the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) concept has been used to estimate an imaging system's spatial quality.

On-orbit sensor MTF estimation was performed on 30 -meter GSD Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper (TM) data from the bridge pulse target as <b>a</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>input.</b> Because of a high resolution sensor s small Ground Sampling Distance (GSD), reasonably sized man-made edge, pulse, and impulse targets can be deployed on a uniform grassy area with accurate control of ground targets using tarps and convex mirrors. All the previous work cited calculated MTF without testing the MTF estimator's performance. In previous report, a numerical generic sensor model had been developed to simulate and improve the performance of on-orbit MTF estimating techniques. Results from the previous sensor modeling report that have been incorporated into standard MTF estimation work include Fermi edge detection and the newly developed 4 th order modified Savitzky-Golay (MSG) interpolation technique. Noise sensitivity had been studied by performing simulations on known noise sources and a sensor model. Extensive investigation was done to characterize multi-resolution ground noise.

The relationship between pulse width and MTF value at Nyquist was studied including error detection and correction schemes. Pulse target angle sensitivity was studied by using synthetic targets angled from 2 to 12 degrees. In this report, from the ground and system noise simulation, a minimum SNR value was suggested for a stable MTF value at Nyquist for the pulse method.

Synapses use current generators controlled by <b>an</b> <b>input</b> <b>Pulse</b> Stream. Net charge generated {{is the product}} of synaptic current by pulse width. Neurons accumulate synaptic contributions and convert internal activation into <b>an</b> output <b>Pulse</b> Stream. <b>A</b> system optimized for lowest computation energy and highest recon gurability has been designed, manufactured and tested. ...|$|R
