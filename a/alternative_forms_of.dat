5|$|A motte-and-bailey castle is a {{fortification}} with {{a wooden}} or stone keep situated on a raised earthwork called a motte, accompanied by an enclosed courtyard, or bailey, surrounded by a protective ditch and palisade. Relatively easy to build with unskilled, often forced, labour, but still militarily formidable, these castles were built across northern Europe from the 10th century onwards, spreading from Normandy and Anjou in France, into the Holy Roman Empire in the 11th century. The Normans introduced the design into England and Wales following their invasion in 1066. Motte-and-bailey castles were adopted in Scotland, Ireland, the Low Countries and Denmark in the 12th and 13th centuries. By {{the end of the}} 13th century, the design was largely superseded by <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> fortification, but the earthworks remain a prominent feature in many countries.|$|E

25|$|Adler (1995) cautioned {{the failure}} of modern {{medicine}} to implement the biopsychosocial model, which incorporates all aspects of a patient’s experience in a scientific approach into the clinical picture, often results in chronically-ill patients deferring to non-traditional and <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> therapy, seeking {{to be understood as}} a whole, not a part, which may be problematic among patients with FSS.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{progress}} in <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> irrigation, agricultural {{dependence on the}} monsoon remains far from insignificant. Therefore, the agricultural calendar of India is governed by the monsoon. Any fluctuations in the time distribution, spatial distribution, or quantity of the monsoon rains may lead to floods or droughts, causing the agricultural sector to suffer. This has a cascading effect on the secondary economic sectors, the overall economy, food inflation, and therefore the general population's quality and cost of living.|$|E
25|$|To {{complement}} E2Max @ L9 and to {{meet with}} consumer demands, Cathay Cineplexes opened three new E-cinemas at Cathay Cineleisure Orchard. These electronically enabled cinema halls allow for alternative showcase <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> entertainment i.e. live sporting events like the World Cup, Premier League and Champions League matches, awards ceremonies like the Oscars and Golden Globes and even local entertainment events like Singapore Idol. With these 3 new screens, Cathay Cineplexes Cineleisure Orchard had largest number of screens under one roof.|$|E

In Tibetan Buddhism, women officially take the vows of śrāmaṇerīs (novitiates); Theravadin women may choose to take an informal and limited set of vows similar to the historical vows of the sāmaṇerī, like the maechi of Thailand and thilashin of Myanmar.|$|E

25|$|The current trend {{appears to}} be that DNA barcoding needs to be used {{alongside}} traditional taxonomic tools and <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> molecular systematics so that problem cases can be identified and errors detected. Non-cryptic species can generally be resolved by either traditional or molecular taxonomy without ambiguity. However, more difficult cases will only yield {{to a combination of}} approaches. And finally, as most of the global biodiversity remains unknown, molecular barcoding can only hint at the existence of new taxa, but not delimit or describe them (DeSalle, 2006; Rubinoff, 2006).|$|E
25|$|In his 2003 book Our Final Hour, British Astronomer Royal Martin Rees {{argues that}} {{advanced}} {{science and technology}} bring as much risk of disaster as opportunity for progress. However, Rees does not advocate a halt to scientific activity. Instead, he calls for tighter security and perhaps an end to traditional scientific openness. Advocates of the precautionary principle, such as many in the environmental movement, also favor slow, careful progress or a halt in potentially dangerous areas. Some precautionists believe that artificial intelligence and robotics present possibilities of <b>alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> cognition that may threaten human life.|$|E
25|$|All {{versions}} of the GBP bypass the duodenum, which is the primary site of absorption of both iron and calcium. Iron replacement is essential in menstruating females, and supplementation of iron and calcium is preferable in all patients. Ferrous sulfate is poorly tolerated. <b>Alternative</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> iron (fumarate, gluconate, chelates) are less irritating and probably better absorbed. Calcium carbonate preparations should also be avoided; calcium as citrate or gluconate (with 1200mg as calcium) has greater bioavailability independent of acid in the stomach, and will likely be better absorbed. Chewable calcium supplements that include vitamin K are sometimes recommended by doctors as {{a good way to}} get calcium.|$|E

25|$|Camel meat {{has been}} eaten for centuries. It has been {{recorded}} by ancient Greek writers as an available dish at banquets in ancient Persia, usually roasted whole. The ancient Roman emperor Heliogabalus enjoyed camel's heel.

Camel blood is also consumable, as is the case among pastoralists in northern Kenya, where camel blood is drunk with milk and acts as a key source of iron, vitamin D, salts and minerals. Camel meat is also occasionally found in Australian cuisine: for example, a camel lasagna is available in Alice Springs.|$|E
