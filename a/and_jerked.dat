5|$|The duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester, began {{a routine}} interrogation. Himmler {{admitted}} who he was, and Selvester had the prisoner searched. Himmler {{was taken to}} the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, where Doctor Wells conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it <b>and</b> <b>jerked</b> his head away. Himmler then bit into a hidden cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes. Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an unmarked grave near Lüneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|In {{the game}} with Auburn, Tech piled up 472 yards {{on the ground in}} 84 rushes and 145 yards in the air. Guyon scored four {{touchdown}}s, and Strupper had a 65-yard touchdown run. According to the Atlanta Journal,It was not the length of the run that featured it was the brilliance of it. After getting through the first line, Stroop was tackled squarely by two secondary men, and yet he squirmed <b>and</b> <b>jerked</b> loosed from them, only to face the safety man and another Tiger, coming at him from different angles. Without checking his speed Everett knifed the two men completely, running between them and dashing on to a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Traditional dishes include caruru, vatapá, acarajé, bobó-de-camarão, moqueca baiana, and abará. Some {{of these}} dishes, like the acarajé and abará, {{are also used}} as {{offering}}s in Candomblé rituals. But Salvador is not only typical food. Other recipes created by the slaves were the Haussá Rice (rice <b>and</b> <b>jerked</b> beef cooked together), the Munguzá, used as offering to the Candomblé deity Oxalá (who {{is the father of}} all deities, according to the religion) pleased the matrons very much. So did the Bolinhos the Fubá, the Cuscuz (cornmeal) and the Mingau (porridge). According to Arany Santana, the African Ipetê (used in the rituals to the deity Oxum) became the Shrimp bobó, and the Akará (honoring the deities Xangô and Iansã) became the world-famous Acarajé. The city has restaurants specialized on international cuisine also. There are also places that serve dishes from other states of Brazil, especially from Minas Gerais and the Northeast region.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} the biomechanical {{characteristics of the}} log lift <b>and</b> clean <b>and</b> <b>jerk.</b> Six experienced male strongman athletes performed log lifts <b>and</b> clean <b>and</b> <b>jerks</b> at 70 % of their 1 RM clean <b>and</b> <b>jerk.</b> Significant (p< 0. 05) between-exercise kinematic differences were observed throughout all the lifting phases, except at lift completion. The log lift demonstrated significantly greater trunk (↑ 24 %) and hip (↑ 9 %) range of motion than the clean <b>and</b> <b>jerk.</b> Significantly greater peak bar velocities were achieved in the clean <b>and</b> <b>jerk</b> in the second pull (16 %) <b>and</b> the <b>jerk</b> (↑ 14 %). While similarities existed in ground reaction force data between the lifts, mean and peak powers were significantly greater (↑ 40 % to ↑ 64 %) in propulsive phases of the clean <b>and</b> <b>jerk.</b> The log lift may be an effective conditioning stimulus to teach rapid triple extension while generating similar vertical and anteriorpropulsive forces as the clean <b>and</b> <b>jerk</b> with the same given load...|$|R
