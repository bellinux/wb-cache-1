40|$|The {{buyer of}} a house trailer gave a chattel {{mortgage}} {{as part of the}} purchase price and received title. The sheriff attached the trailer pursuant to an order of attachment obtained by two creditors of the buyer. The holder of the chattel mortgage, who was the original seller, brought an action to replevin the trailer. The defense of usury was raised. Held for plaintiff. An <b>attaching</b> <b>creditor</b> does not stand in privity with the debtor and therefore cannot raise the debtor’s defense of usury. The general rule is that the plea of usury as a defense is personal to the borrower and those in legal privity with him. But privity here seems to have an unusual connotation...|$|E

50|$|In September 1908, Paluskar went to Bombay (now Mumbai) to {{establish}} another {{branch of the}} school. As the work-load increased, he shifted the school from Lahore to Bombay. To accommodate all the students, he took loans, built a new building for the school and hostel as well. To settle debts, he gave several public concerts. But while on a concert tour in 1924, Paluskar's <b>creditors</b> <b>attached</b> his properties and auctioned off the school.|$|R
40|$|This Comment {{seeks to}} discuss {{the impact of the}} {{revisions}} made to North Carolina trust law effective January, 2006, {{in the context of their}} incongruity with the common law and the potential for favoritism toward federal tax liens over prior liens <b>attached</b> by state <b>creditors</b> (including liens for state taxes). In order to rectify the problems created by the revisions, North Carolina should either clarify the impact of these changes so as not to leave settlors, trustees, or beneficiaries with unrealistic expectations or revise the code to fill in the gaps created by the revisions...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concepts}} of universalism and modified universalism have, predictably, shifted and evolved over time. In English law {{the concept of}} universalism is usually used {{in contrast to the}} alternative theory of judicial cooperation in cross-border insolvencies referred to as the doctrine of unity. [...] As has been judicially noted: [...] "The meaning of the expression 'universalism' has undergone a change since the time it was first used in the 19th century, and it later came to be contrasted with the 'doctrine of unity.' In 1834 Story referred to the theory that assignments under bankrupt or insolvent laws were, and ought to be, of universal operation to transfer movable property, in whatever country it might be situate, and concluded that there was great wisdom in adopting the rule that an assignment in bankruptcy should operate as a complete and valid transfer of all his movable property abroad, as well as at home, and for a country to prefer an <b>attaching</b> domestic <b>creditor</b> to a foreign assignee or to foreign creditors could 'hardly be deemed consistent with the general comity of nations … The true rule is, to follow out the lead of the general principle that makes the law of the owner's domicil conclusive upon the disposition of his personal property,' citing Solomons v Ross as supporting that doctrine: Story, Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws, 1st ed (1834), pp 340-341, para 406." ...|$|R
25|$|Hereford were {{expelled}} from the Conference on 10 June 2014 due to financial irregularities. It was revealed a week later that the club's debts could total as much as £1.3million. The club was accepted into the Southern League Premier Division for the 2014–15 season on 19 June 2014. However, financial worries continued, including a winding-up petition started by Martin Foyle, who resigned as manager in March 2014. Hearings of the winding-up petition were adjourned a number of times, including on 7 July 2014. A number of other <b>creditors</b> <b>attached</b> themselves to the Foyle petition, including Andy Porter, former assistant manager, and HMRC. A CVA was proposed {{by the board of}} directors of the company, but was rejected by creditors. Many Hereford fans chose to boycott the club due to clashes between fans and the board. Many fans felt anger over the board's choice not to pay a bond to remain in the Conference Premier and other management choices that the fans felt were not in the club's best interests.|$|R
40|$|Offshore asset {{protection}} trusts (APTs) {{are an important}} planning tool in protecting and managing accumulated wealth. These trusts, if properly drafted, can effectively protect assets from being <b>attached</b> by a <b>creditor</b> or a plaintiff following a successful court judgment. The use of offshore APTs has become very popular {{as the result of}} increasing litigation and the resulting awards within the court system within the United States. For those who wish to protect their assets but are wary of placing their trust in foreign jurisdictions, Alaska and Delaware enacted trust legislation in 1997 allowing {{asset protection}} trusts in their states without the cost and complexity usually associated with the offshore structure. Alaska and Delaware trust law is distinguishable from other U. S. trust law in that Alaska and Delaware will enforce spendthrift provisions in respect of a settlor who is a discretionary beneficiary of a self-settled trust. This means that settlors may maintain some access to their assets while still insulating the assets from creditors and having the assets deemed removed from their estates for estate tax purposes...|$|R
60|$|I {{must first}} make your Lordships acquainted {{with a little}} {{preliminary}} matter. A man named Roy Rada Churn had been appointed vakeel, or agent, to manage the Nabob's affairs at Calcutta. One of this man's <b>creditors</b> <b>attached</b> him there. Roy Rada Churn pleaded his privilege as the vakeel or representative of a sovereign prince. The question came to be tried in the Supreme Court, and the issue was, Whether the Nabob was a sovereign prince or not. I think the court did exceedingly wrong in entertaining such a question; because, in my opinion, whether he was or was not a sovereign prince, any person representing him ought to be left free, {{and to have a}} proper and secure means of concerting his affairs with the Council. It was, however, taken otherwise; the question was brought to trial, whether the Nabob was a sovereign prince sufficient to appoint and protect a person to manage his affairs, under the name of an ambassador. In that cause did Mr. Hastings come forward to prove, by a voluntary affidavit, that he had no pretensions, no power, no authority at all,--that he was a mere pageant, a thing of straw,--and that the Company exercised every species of authority over him, in every particular, and in every respect; and that, therefore, to talk of him as an efficient person was an affront to the common sense of mankind: and this you will find the judges afterwards declared to be their opinion.|$|R
