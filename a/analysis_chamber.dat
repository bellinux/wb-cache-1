The attachment of HP was done through its amino groups to N-hydroxy succinimide functionalities on the gold surface. First SPRi system was filled running buffer solution followed by placing of SPRi -biochip into the <b>analysis</b> <b>chamber.</b> Two solutions of different concentrations of GP was 1g/L and0.1 g/L were injected in the flow cell. The association and the dissociation of both polymers can be monitored in real-time {{on the basis of}} change in reflectivity and images from SPRM can be differentiated on the basis of white spots (association phase) and black spots (dissociation phase). PEG without adamantyl groups didn’t show adsorption on β-cyclodextrin cavities. On the other hand, there wasn’t any adsorption of GP without HP on the chip. Change in SPRi response on the reaction sites is provided by the capturing of kinetic curves and real time images from the CCD camera. Local changes in light reflectivity are directly related to quantity of target molecules on each point. Variation at the surface of the chip provide comprehensive knowledge on molecular binding and kinetic processes.|$|E

A detailed description of the prototype instrument is presented with experimental validation of its use and novel ex situ experimental results using the HV-TERS system. The HV-TERS system includes three chambers held under a 10 (- 7) Pa vacuum. The three chambers are an <b>analysis</b> <b>chamber,</b> a sample preparation chamber, and a fast loading chamber. The <b>analysis</b> <b>chamber</b> is the core chamber and contains a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and a Raman detector coupled with a 50 x 0. 5 numerical aperture objective. The sample preparation chamber is used to produce single-crystalline metal and sub-monolayer molecular films by molecular beam epitaxy. The fast loading chamber allows ex situ preparation of samples for HV-TERS analysis. Atomic resolution can be achieved by the STM on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite. We demonstrate the measurement of localized temperature using the Stokes and anti-Stokes TERS signals from a monolayer of 1, 2 -benzenedithiol on a gold film using a gold tip. Additionally, plasmonic catalysis can be monitored label-free at the nanoscale using our device. Moreover, the HV-TERS experiments show simultaneously activated infrared and Raman vibrational modes, Fermi resonance, and some other non-linear effects that are not observed in atmospheric TERS experiments.
