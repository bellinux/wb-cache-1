5|$|A {{suite of}} fossils {{known as the}} Small shelly fossils <b>are</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> the Ediacaran, most famously by Cloudina a shelly tube-like fossil that often shows {{evidence}} of predatory boring, suggesting that, while predation {{may not have been}} common in the Ediacaran Period, it was at least present.|$|E
5|$|Local {{industries}} and trades likely included pottery production, metal working, construction, spinning and weaving cloth, fishing, trade, {{and possibly the}} production of salt, which <b>are</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> the archaeological and historical record {{at a number of}} coastal sites. In addition, the local coral architecture using limestone mortar also indicates the presence of local trades associated with construction and masonry.|$|E

5|$|A {{sport or}} {{discipline}} {{appears on the}} Pan American Games program if it is included on the Olympic program. For the traditional Pan American Games sports, PASO determines if they are widely practised around the Americas; that is, the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport's prevalence. PASO's requirements reflect participation in the Pan American Games as well, especially more stringent toward men (as they <b>are</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> higher numbers).|$|E

5|$|Aarhus has {{developed}} in stages, from the Viking age to modern times, all {{visible in the}} city today. Many architectural styles <b>are</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> {{different parts of the}} city such as Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, National Romantic, Nordic Classicism, Neoclassical, Empire and Functionalism. The city has grown up around the main transport hubs, the river, the harbour and later the railway station, and as a result, the oldest parts of the city are also the most central and busiest today.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{citizens}} <b>are</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> {{the city council}} by 44 councilpersons who represent each of the 44 districts within the city. No members {{of the city council}} are selected through at-large election. Like the mayor, each member of the city council serves a four-year term and all seats are up for election at the same time. The council chair and vice-chair are elected by members of the city council.|$|E

Article 39A empowers the Legislature to ensure {{that members of the}} Malay, Indian and other minority communities <b>are</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> Parliament by enacting a law to create Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). Each voter in a GRC casts his or her ballot for a team of candidates, at least one of whom must be from a minority community. Article 39A(3) exempts any provision enacted by Parliament pursuant to Article 39A from being void due to inconsistency with Article 12.|$|E

5|$|Four major Chinese-speech groups <b>are</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia: Hokkien, Mandarin, Hakka and Cantonese. In {{addition}} to these, the Teochew people speak their own dialect {{that has some}} degree of mutual intelligibility with Hokkien. Distinctions between the two, however, are accentuated outside of their regions of origin. There were an estimated 2.2 million native speakers of various Chinese varieties in Indonesia in 1982: 1,300,000 speakers of Southern Min varieties (including Hokkien and Teochew); 640,000 Hakka speakers; 460,000 Mandarin speakers; 180,000 Cantonese speakers; and 20,000 speakers of the Eastern Min varieties (including Fuzhou dialect). Additionally, an estimated 20,000 spoke different dialects of the Indonesian language.|$|E
5|$|In a discography of the LPO {{published}} in 1997, Philip Stuart listed 280 recordings made at Kingsway Hall and 353 at Abbey Road. By the early 2000s the late 20th-century boom in classical recordings had ended, and with studio work in decline for all orchestras, the LPO set {{up its own}} CD label in 2005, featuring recordings taken mainly from live concerts. With the exception of Steinberg, all the orchestra's principal conductors from Beecham to Jurowski <b>are</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> the label's releases. The orchestra lists among its best-selling recordings Mahler's Eighth Symphony, conducted by Tennstedt, and works by Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky with Jurowski.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that of 92 potentially possible modes of life – combinations of feeding style, tiering and motility — no more than a dozen are occupied {{by the end of the}} Ediacaran. Just four <b>are</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> the Avalon assemblage. The lack of large-scale predation and vertical burrowing are perhaps the most significant factors limiting the ecological diversity; the emergence of these during the Early Cambrian allowed the number of lifestyles occupied to rise to 30.|$|E

5|$|Maya {{textiles}} {{are very}} poorly {{represented in the}} archaeological record, although by comparison with other pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Aztecs and the Andean region, {{it is likely that}} they were high-value items. A few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists, but the best evidence for textile art is where they <b>are</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> other media, such as painted murals or ceramics. Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths, generally these would have been cotton, but jaguar pelts and deer hides are also shown.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{concealed}} shoes {{found to}} date {{are made of}} leather, but wooden clogs and rubber galoshes have also been reported, among others. The overwhelming majority (almost 98 per cent) have been worn, and many show signs of repair. All ages <b>are</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> the shoe sizes, from babies to adults, {{but there is little}} difference in the ratio of adult male to female shoes, at 21.5 per cent and 26.5 per cent respectively.
