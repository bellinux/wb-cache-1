50|$|Alkalimetry and <b>acidimetry</b> are {{a kind of}} {{volumetric}} analysis in which the fundamental reaction is a neutralization reaction. Alkalimetry is the specialized analytic use of acid-base titration to determine the concentration of a basic (synonymous to alkaline) substance. <b>Acidimetry,</b> sometimes spelled acidometry, is the same concept of specialized analytic acid-base titration, but for an acidic substance.|$|E
50|$|Sulfamic acid is a {{moderately}} strong acid, Ka = 1.01 x 10âˆ’1. Because the solid is non-hygroscopic, {{it is used}} as a standard in <b>acidimetry</b> (quantitative assays of acid content).|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} on calcium (II) oxalate {{is carried out}} in order to study its solubility in different ionic media. In the same conditions the protonation constants of oxalate and the stability of complex species have been determined. As the stoichiometric composition of the solid calcium (II) oxalate prepared for the investigation was accurately checked, the salt CaC 2 O 4. H 2 O is proposed as universal (chelometry, redox, <b>acidimetry)</b> standard. Results of titrations support this possibility...|$|E
