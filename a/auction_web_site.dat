It {{is difficult to}} digest the poorly organized and vast amount of information contained in the auction sites. We develop a unified framework aiming at automatically extracting the product features and summarizing the hot item features across different <b>auction</b> <b>Web</b> <b>sites.</b> One challenge of this problem is to extract useful information from the product descriptions provided by the sellers, which vary largely in the layout format. We formulate the problem as a single graph labeling problem using conditional random fields which can model the relationship among the neighbouring tokens in a Web page, the tokens from different pages, as well as various information such as the hot item features across different auction sites. We have conducted extensive experiments from several real-world <b>auction</b> <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. ...|$|R

We develop a two-phase framework which aims at mining and summarizing hot items from multiple <b>auction</b> <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> to assist decision making. The objective of the first phase is to automatically extract the product features and product feature values of the items from the descriptions provided by the sellers. We design a HMM-based learning method to train an extended HMM model which can adapt to the unseen Web page from which the information is extracted. The goal of the second phase is to discover and summarize the hot items based on the extracted information. We formulate the hot item mining task as a semi-supervised learning problem and employ the graph mincuts algorithm to accomplish this task. The summary of the hot items is then generated by considering the frequency and the position of the product features being mentioned in the descriptions. We have conducted extensive experiments from several real-world <b>auction</b> <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. 1...|$|R

Unfortunately, they also provide opportunities for criminals to distribute illicit goods, launder money or commit other types of fraud. This calls for methods to mitigate this threat. The following paper discusses the methods of identifying the accounts of users participating in internet auctions that have been hijacked (taken over) by malicious individuals and utilised for fraudulent purposes. Two primary methods are described, monitoring users’ activities (e. g. the number of auctions created over time) with EWMA and clustering similar auction categories into groups for the purpose of assessing users’ sellers profiles and detecting their sudden changes. These methods, utilised together allow for real-time detection of suspicious accounts. The proposed models are validated on real data gathered from an <b>auction</b> <b>web</b> <b>site...</b>|$|E

To overcome such a prob-lem, this research proposes a neural network model called SOM to segment online auction cus-tomers into homogenous groups. Based on the segmented groups, the behavior of online bidders {{can be divided into}} three types: patient deals, impulsive deals and analytic deals. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology, 1470 records retrieved from Taiwan eBay are used to conduct an empirical study. In conclusion, the percentages of each customer type are 39. 3 % (impulsive deals), 27. 8 % (analytic deals) and 32. 2 % (patient deals).

Out of all the placements we eliminate the 3 that place all data in the cloud as it contradicts the constraints to have privacy sensitive information on-premise. Also, we consider deployments with only data partitioned as a subset of deployments with both code and data partitioned, and thus do not provide separate deployments for them. The remaining four models deployed for evaluations were as follows: (i) both code and data are deployed to the premise (Private-Premise); (ii) data is on-premise and code is in the cloud (Naive-Hybrid); (iii) data is on-premise and code is partitioned (Split-Code); and (iv) both data and code are partitioned (Cross-Tier).|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Today’s shared hosting {{platforms}} often employ virtualization {{to allow}} multiple enterprise applications with time-varying resource demands {{to share a}} common infrastructure {{in order to improve}} resource utilization. Meeting application-level quality of service (QoS) goals becomes a challenge in such an environment as enterprise applications often have a multi-tier architecture and complex interactions and dependencies among individual tiers. In addition, when the shared infrastructure becomes overloaded, appropriate resource control needs to be performed at these individual tiers in a coordinated fashion in order to provide differentiated services to co-hosted applications. In this paper, we present an adaptive multivariate controller that dynamically adjusts the resource shares to individual tiers of multiple applications in order to meet a specified level of service differentiation. The controller parameters are automatically tuned at runtime based on a quadratic cost function and a system model that is learned online using a recursive least-squares (RLS) method. To evaluate our controller design, we built a testbed hosting two instances of the RUBiS application, a multi-tier online <b>auction</b> <b>web</b> <b>site,</b> using Xen virtual machines. Our results indicate that our controller is able to meet given QoS differentiation targets between co-hosted applications while the total demand from these applications exceeds the capacities of the shared systems.

40|$|This is an {{exploratory}} empirical {{study with the}} aim to identify the factors that affect the adoption of online auctions by Internet users in Hong Kong. The frameworks used were the TAM (Technology Acceptance Model), TCE (Transaction Cost Economics) and SERVQUAL (Service Quality). It {{was found that the}} dimensions that affected the customer’s perceived value of the online auction are benefits, costs, risks and service quality. Data was collected from four pilot focus groups, one online survey and a final focus group. The subjects in the focus groups were 21 undergraduates, whereas the subjects in the online survey were 152 internet users. The results of the pilot focus groups guided the design of the online survey. The results of the survey was analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The final focus group was used to seek explanations to some issues arose from the online survey. It was found that the factors in the benefit dimension were liquidity, enjoyment, and price transparency. The factors in the cost dimension were time, effort, service charge and reputation of the user. The factor in the risk dimension was financial risk. The factors in the service quality dimension were efficiency and system availability. The final focus group revealed that the auctioneer’s role in policing the <b>auction</b> <b>web</b> <b>site</b> was important.

This section also featured an extensive list of sexual deviations which included pedophilia and homosexuality (in terms of the game, a traumatic event could potentially induce a character to convert from one sexual orientation to another), despite the latter having been officially declassified as a mental illness more than a decade before. After parents of younger players objected to the list of sexual deviations - which had previously appeared in the Palladium Role-Playing Game and Heroes Unlimited rulebooks - Palladium Books covered it with a plain white sticker.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical analysis of price determinants and bidders' behaviour in on-line auctions eBay. de and Aukro. cz. We {{focus on the}} effect of sellers' feedback rating score and the phenomenon of sniping. Our dataset used for the analysis consists of 7054 auctions with 209449 bids from eBay, and 2223 auctions with 8779 bids from Aukro. Buyers in on-line auctions cannot personally inspect the quality of the product, so they have to rely on the seller's honesty. In this setting, the seller's rating may significantly contribute to the final price formation. Sniping is a bidding strategy, whereby a bidder waits until the last moment of the bidding period to place her bid. According to a theory, sniping should cause a reduction in the final price, and there should be a positive relationship between the probability of bidding and bidder's experience. The empirical results for both <b>auction</b> <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> show that the seller's feedback rating score has {{a significant impact on the}} final price. The tests regarding sniping provide distinctive results only for eBay. The effect of sniping on the final price is not clear since we have obtained different results for different specifications, but we found out that experience of a bidder increases the probability of placing a sniping bid.

40|$|An {{extension}} of wrapper adaptation is developed to collectively extract information from multiple Web pages. There exists mutual influence between text fragments of different Web pages and hence {{they should be}} considered collectively during extraction. Extending from the dependence model, a framework which can consider the dependence between text fragments within a single Web page and the dependence between text fragments from different pages. One characteristic of this model is that additional information {{can be incorporated into}} the model and multiple tasks earl be tackled simultaneously. As a result, a global solution which can optimize the quality of the tasks, at the same time, eliminate the conflict between them can he obtained. Experiments on product feature extraction and hot item mining from multiple <b>auction</b> <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework. One problem of most existing Web information extraction methods is that the extraction knowledge learned from a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> can only be applied to Web pages from the same site. This thesis first investigates the problem of wrapper adaptation which aims at adapting a wrapper previously learned from a source site to new unseen sites. A dependence model that can model the dependence between text fragments in Web pages is developed. Under this model, two types of text related features are identified. The first type of features is called site invariant features. These features likely remain unchanged in Web pages from different sites in the same domain. The second type of features is called site dependent features. These features are different in Web pages collected from different <b>Web</b> <b>sites,</b> while they are similar in Web pages originated from the same site. Based on this model, two frameworks are developed to solve the wrapper adaptation problem. The first framework is called Information Extraction Knowledge Adaptation using Machine Learning approach (IEKA-ML). Machine learning methods are employed to derive site invariant features from the previously learned extraction knowledge and items previously collected or extracted from the source <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> Both site dependent features and site invariant features in new sites are considered for learning of new information extraction knowledge tailored to the new unseen site. The second framework, called Information Extraction Knowledge Adaptation using Bayesian learning approach (IEKA-BAYES), solves the problem of wrapper adaptation as well as the issue of new attribute discovery. The new attribute discovery problem aims at extracting new or previously unwell attributes that are not specified in the wrapper. To harness the uncertainty, a probabilistic generative model for the generation of text fragments and layout format related to attributes in Web pages is designed. Bayesian learning and expectation-maximization (EM) techniques are developed under the proposed generative model to accomplish the wrapper adaptation task. Previously unseen attributes together with their semantic labels earl be discovered via another EM-based Bayesian learning on the generative model. Extensive experiments on over 30 real-world <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> in three different domains and comparison between existing works have been conducted to evaluate the IEKA-ML and IEKA-BAYES frameworks.

We have designed a verification scheme composed of zero knowledge proofs that extends the basic SGVA secure auction protocol to permit users to verify offline that the protocol has been executed correctly.
