As {{part of the}} marketing strategy to promote the collection and concert series, Universal Music Catalogue developed a [...] "treasure hunt" [...] video for YouTube where visitors identified clues, and navigated links within a collage of Wainwright's music videos. According to Wainwright, the rarities box set was a [...] "little Rufus blast" [...] before he began work on his next pop album. Wainwright also said the following of the collection: [...] "There's my old demos, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were recorded in Montreal... when I had a very, very different voice, I kind of sounded like a little old man. There's that and there's a lot of fabulous collaborations with my mother, my father and some other great artists." [...] Wainwright had originally intended to call the box set The Rufus Cycle. After being told the title was [...] "too sophisticated", he went with House of Rufus, partly inspired by Lady Gaga's Haus of Gaga.

500|$|On {{his arrival}} in the United States, Woo went through several scripts before {{deciding}} on Hard Target. Describing the scripts he received, Woo stated that [...] "Some of them were good—some of them were very good—but the rest were simply martial-arts movies and I told producers that I {{had no interest in}} doing those kinds of films anymore. I'd done <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> already." [...] One of the scripts offered to Woo at this period was for Face/Off, which he turned down at the time, turned off by the science fiction aspect of the story. The script for Hard Target was written by Chuck Pfarrer. Director Andrew Davis was interested in the script, but ultimately turned it down. Woo read Pfarrer's script for Hard Target appreciating that it was a [...] "simple but powerful story, with a lot of feeling underneath. For a good action film you need a solid structure. Chuck gave me that". Woo also stated that the story is [...] "less John Woo" [...] but the visual aspect would be [...] "very John Woo". Pfarrer wrote the script originally basing it on the film The Naked Prey. After the script did not turn out Pfarrer worked on a script influenced by the film Aliens that became the basis for his comic Virus. The final attempt was a script based on the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game. Pfarrer had the story take place in New Orleans to give an explanation of Jean-Claude Van Damme's accent.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Butch Vig {{stated that}} the album is a [...] "much simpler record than Version 2.0": [...] "All of the songs sort of came from us playing live downstairs [...] with guitar, bass and drums ... That was the only {{conscious}} decision we made – to make the songs simpler. Some of the songs are still layered in spots; compared to the last record, there're about half as many tracks. As far as sounds go, it's basically drums, bass, some heavy guitars and Shirley singing." [...] Erikson agreed that a more organic sound and simplistic approach with respect to production is embodied by the final mix of the album. [...] "A lot of songs took shape {{in just a few}} hours as opposed to a few months with the last record.Some of the songs obviously took a long time, or we wouldn't have been in the studio for a full year. But <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> happened very quickly. 'Silence Is Golden' we recorded basically in three days and it was done. 'So Like a Rose,' for the most part, was recorded in three hours. I think we spent a lot of time just trying to resist adding stuff to [...] Because that was our tendency on the other two records.” On the lyrical content of the songs, Vig remarked that [...] " [...] aren't specifically responses to the industry, but they could be read that way. Shirley has said that, for example, 'Shut Your Mouth' is about all the bullshit that's out there, but it's also a sort of note to self to keep your mouth shut, because she says she's the biggest, most opinionated loudmouth of anyone around. So they work on multiple levels." ...|$|E
