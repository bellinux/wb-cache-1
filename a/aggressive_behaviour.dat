5|$|Elephants can exhibit {{bouts of}} <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{and engage in}} {{destructive}} actions against humans. In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive. In parts of India, male elephants regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. Elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in Jharkhand while in Assam, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviour,</b> encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move at high speed and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E
5|$|Cockfighting {{is said to}} be the world's oldest spectator {{sport and}} may have {{originated}} in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals.|$|E

40|$|Over the years, {{researchers}} have investigated direct, conditional, and meditational pathways of adolescent aggression {{in relation to}} both temperament and parenting behaviours. However, no study to date has considered these relations {{with respect to a}} measure of aggression differentiated by form (e. g., overt, relational) and function (e. g., proactive, reactive). The present study examined the differential association of adolescent temperament and authoritative parenting on four subtypes of aggression. Participants included mothers, fathers, and one adolescent (between the ages of 10 - 19) from 663 families, recruited through random digit dialing. Parents reported on their child's temperament and occurrence of <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in addition to the perception of their own authoritative parenting. Adolescents reported on their own temperament and <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> as well as on both their mother and father's authoritative parenting. Multiple regression analyses confirmed predictions that some aspects of temperament and authoritative parenting provide motivation towards the engagement of different <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> For example, higher negative affect was related to reactive type...|$|R

5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviour.</b>|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviour</b> in males, {{even in the absence of}} urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Together, this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E
40|$|Neuropsychiatric {{behaviours}} occur {{frequently in}} Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and {{are thought to}} arise from the neurodegenerative process. However, {{it is unclear whether}} neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus are associated with neuropsychiatric behaviours such as aggression. In this study, semiquantitative measurements of cell loss, atrophy, neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle load in the postmortem hippocampus were taken for dementia patients, prospectively assessed for neuropsychiatric behaviours. It was found that increased tangle load, but not other hippocampal neuropathological variables, was associated with increased severity of <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> and presence of chronic aggression. This study suggests a pathogenic link between neurofibrillary tangle load and <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in the hippocampus of dementia patients...|$|R

40|$|Background: Violence {{in health}} care has been widely {{reported}} and health care workers, particularly nurses in acute care settings, are ill-equipped to manage patients who exhibit aggressive traits. Aim: The aim of this systematic review was to establish best practice in the prevention and management of <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in patients admitted to acute hospital settings. Data Sources: An extensive search of the major databases was conducted from 1990 to 2007. The search included published and unpublished studies and papers in English. Review Methods: This review considered any quantitative research study design that evaluated the effectiveness of interventions in the prevention and management of patients who exhibit <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in an acute hospital setting. Each included study was quality assessed by two independent reviewers and data were extracted using the relevant tools developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and {{were included in the}} review. The evidence identified from the studies includes: the benefit of education and training of acute care nurses in aggression management techniques; use of “as required” medications is effective in minimising harm to patients and staff; and that specific interventions such as physical restraint {{may play a role in}} managing <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> from patients in the acute care setting. Conclusions: This review makes several recommendations for the prevention and management of <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in acute hospital patients. However, due to the lack of high-quality studies conducted in the acute care setting there is huge scope for future research in this area...|$|R

40|$|Aggression is a transnosographic {{dimension}} of many psychiatric disorders. According to their aims and manifestations, <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{may be considered}} as adaptive (defensive aggression) or maladaptive (impulsive and proactive pathological aggression). The specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying aggression haven't been clarified yet. Aggression and impulsivity seem {{to be influenced by}} the unbalance between serotonin inhibitory action and dopamine activating action on behaviour. Pharmacological treatment of <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> consist in acute and preventive, long-term interventions. Typical and atypical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, Î²-blockers and SSRI, entered in mono-therapy or in combination, are the most frequently used medications. The object of our study is to review, analyzing scientific literature, the use of typical and atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of aggression in children and adolescents...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Early onset {{aggression}} {{is a public}} health problem. We aimed to investigate the associated factors of <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in preschool children. Patients and Methods: Seventy two children (aged between 1 and 6) with primary complaints of severe <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> by their parents and 72 healthy controls {{were included in the}} study. A semi-structured inquiry-form on demographic features, personal and psychiatric characteristics of parents and mother-child relationship patterns were given to the mothers. The Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were given to the mothers. Results: Parental education levels were lower in the patient group. Parents' problematic experiences with anger, mothers' feelings of insufficiency in parenting and marital quarreling were found to be higher in the patient group. The frequency of depressive and/or anxiety symptoms during pregnancy and the postnatal period as well as mothers' current BDI scores were higher in the patient group. According to a logistic regression analysis, the ABC hyperactivity score, mothers' feelings of insufficiency in parenting and fathers' problematic experiences with anger were found to be associated with <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in the patients. Conclusion: Aggression in preschool children is associated with multiple factors. The examination of parental characteristics appears to be especially important in the evaluation of affected children. (Marmara Medical Journal 2011; 24 : 172 - 8...|$|R

25|$|A {{range of}} options have been {{proposed}} as possible alternatives to beak trimming including modifying the genetics of domesticated poultry to reduce cannibalistic tendencies. For confined housing where light control is possible, lowering light intensity so that birds cannot see each other as easily reduces antagonistic encounters and <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Enrichment devices, introduced at an early age, such as simple objects hung in a habitat, can reduce aggressive behavior. Dividing the population into smaller group sizes reduces cannibalism. Proper body weight management that avoids underweight pullets reduces the probability of underweight pullets with uterine prolapse that leads to cloacal cannibalism.|$|E
25|$|Other {{neurological}} {{symptoms include}} confusion, tremor, general muscle weakness, hemiparesis and paralysis of a limb. Parkinson-like movements might arise due to non-specific movement disorders and speech disorders. Individuals may also exhibit psychiatric {{symptoms such as}} irritability, psychotic reactions, <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviour,</b> or apathy which can sometimes dominate the clinical diagnosis. Without treatment, the disease is invariably fatal, with progressive mental deterioration leading to coma, systemic organ failure, and death. An untreated infection with T. b. rhodesiense will cause death within months whereas an untreated infection with T. b. gambiense will cause death after several years. Damage caused in the neurological phase is irreversible.|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{investigated}} {{a phenomenon}} in South Korea, which corresponds to bullying {{with respect to}} terms, perceptions, origins and moral reasoning. These were examined by three main studies across various age-ranges. Study 1 examined terms for and perceptions of bullying-like behaviours in South Korea using a qualitative approach, from young children to adults. Results showed that wang-ta was the term predominantly used to describe bullying-like behaviour in South Korea. Depending on types of aggression and participants’ ages, different terms emerged showing historical changes within a culture. 10 - 15 years old pupils used their own terms, different from wang-ta; and workplace personnel and 10 - 15 year old pupils showed negative attitudes towards victims. Previous studies showed that bullying–like behaviours among young children differ in some ways from those of older children. Study 2 investigated bullying-like behaviours among 6 year olds in South Korea using peer, self, and teacher reports; and examined bullying roles in relation to various types of aggression and peer status. Results showed that depending on informants, bullying roles were nominated differently; the role of aggressors showed higher consistency across informants than other roles. Relational victimisation was seen differently depending on informants. One of the theories for why some people engage in bullying-like behaviours has focused on their moral understanding about <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Study 3 investigated moral reasoning about <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in terms of types of aggression, age, gender, and experience of aggression. Sixty 7 year olds and ninety 11 year olds from South Korea participated. Results indicated that moral reasoning about <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> differed by type of aggression and children’s age. Social exclusion was regarded as less wrong and less harmful than other types of <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Gender differences were rarely found. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} pupils’ attitudes toward wang-ta in South Korea. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

25|$|According to {{the journal}} of <b>Aggressive</b> <b>Behaviour,</b> an {{analysis}} across 9 countries found boys reported more {{in the use of}} physical aggression. At the same time no consistent sex differences emerged within relational aggression. It has been found that girls are more likely than boys to use reactive aggression and then retract, but boys are more likely to increase rather than to retract their aggression after their first reaction. Studies show girls' aggressive tactics included gossip, ostracism, breaking confidences, and criticism of a victim's clothing, appearance, or personality, whereas boys engage in aggression that involves a direct physical and/or verbal assault. This could be {{due to the fact that}} girls' frontal lobes develop earlier than boys, allowing them to self-restrain.|$|E
25|$|Bailey claimed at {{his trial}} {{that he had no}} memory of the attack and had been acting in a state of {{automatism}} caused by hypoglycaemia as he had not eaten since his last insulin dose. His general practitioner gave evidence that this might cause <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviour</b> and loss of memory but was unlikely to have caused the sudden loss of awareness claimed by the defendant. The prosecution's case was that although theoretically possible, this was not what had happened. They argued that Bailey had armed himself with the iron bar and gone to the boyfriend's house with the intention of harming him. Evidence was given that shortly after the attack he had been interviewed by the police and seemed to behave quite normally.|$|E
25|$|Mares {{exist in}} a hierarchy, with the alpha female being the first to mate with the {{stallion}} and being the one to lead the group. When new mares {{are added to the}} group, they are met with hostility by the other mares. Thus, the stallion must shield the new mares until the aggression subsides. The most recently added females rank lowest. Females that become unfit or weak may drop in their rank, though. The female membership of a harem stays intact even if a new stallion takes over. Zebras strengthen their social bonds with grooming. Members of a harem nip and scrape along the neck, withers, and back with their teeth and lips. Mothers and foals groom the most often, followed by siblings. Grooming shows social status and eases <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviour.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background Despite peer {{conflict}} and <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in school-age {{children and adolescents}} have received long-standing attention, the research of strategies to reduce tension and aggressiveness still represents a crucial question. Rough-and-tumble play (R&T) seems to provide a functional-adaptive account to cope with <b>aggressive</b> and violent <b>behaviours</b> (Scott & Panksepp, 2003; Carraro, Mauro & Ventura, 2006). The present study aimed to compare the effects of traditional physical education (PE) classes with R&T play on primary school children’ physical aggression. Method Participants were 21 boys and 21 girls from 4 th and 5 th grades of primary school (10 - 11 years old), they filled in the short version of the Buss & Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ- 12; Bryant & Smith, 2001). Moreover, we asked classroom teachers to indicate {{by means of a}} 7 -item questionnaire, based on DSM criteria, the frequency of pupils <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The AQ- 12 was completed at three different times (t 0, t 1 and t 2), three weeks away from each other. Children participated in traditional PE classes between t 0 and t 1 and in R&T between t 1 and t 2. Six pupils (all boys) were indicated by teachers with high frequency of <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours,</b> they were also monitored by a researcher in the breaks during the school day using a structured observation grid. Results No significant differences by gender were observed.

25|$|Executive {{dysfunction}} {{appears to}} consistently involve disruptions in task-oriented behavior, which requires executive {{control in the}} inhibition of habitual responses and goal activation. Such executive control is responsible for adjusting behaviour to reconcile environmental changes with goals for effective behaviour. Impairments in set shifting ability are a notable feature of executive dysfunction; set shifting is the cognitive ability to dynamically change focus between points of fixation based on changing goals and environmental stimuli. This offers a parsimonious explanation for the common occurrence of impulsive, hyperactive, disorganized, and <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviour</b> in clinical patients with executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction, particularly in working memory capacity, may also lead to varying degrees of emotional dysregulation, which can manifest as chronic depression, anxiety, or hyperemotionality. Russell Barkley proposed a hybrid model {{of the role of}} behavioural disinhibition in the presentation of ADHD, which has served as the basis for much research of both ADHD and broader implications of the executive system.|$|E
25|$|Monogyne workers kill foreign queens {{and aggressively}} defend their territory. However, not all {{behaviours}} are universal, primarily because worker behaviours {{depend on the}} ecological {{context in which they}} develop, and the manipulation of worker genotypes can elicit change in behaviours. Therefore, behaviours of native populations can differ from those of introduced populations. In a study to assess the <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviour</b> of monogyne and polygyne red fire ant workers by studying interaction in neutral arenas, and to develop a reliable ethogram for readily distinguishing between monogyne and polygyne colonies of red imported fire ants in the field, monogyne and polygyne workers discriminated between nestmates and foreigners as indicated by different behaviours ranging from tolerance to aggression. Monogyne ants always attacked foreign ants independently if they were from monogyne or polygyne colonies, whereas polygyne ants recognised, but did not attack, foreign polygyne ants, mainly by exhibiting postures similar to behaviours assumed after attacks by Pseudacteon phorids. Hostile versus warning behaviours were strongly dependent on the social structure of workers. Therefore, the behaviour toward foreign workers was a method of characterising monogyne and polygyne colonies. Most colonies in the southeastern and south-central US tend to be monogynous.|$|E
25|$|The {{brains of}} Onychophora, though small, are very complex; consequently, the organisms {{are capable of}} rather {{sophisticated}} social interactions. Behaviour may vary from genus to genus, so this article reflects the most studied genus, Euperipatoides. They form social groups of up to fifteen individuals, usually closely related, which will typically live and hunt together. Groups usually live together; an example in drier regions {{would be in a}} region of the moist interior of a rotting log. Group members are extremely aggressive towards individuals from other logs. Dominance is achieved through aggression and maintained through submissive behaviour. After a kill, the dominant female always feeds first, followed in turn by the other females, then males, then the young. Social hierarchy is established by a number of interactions: higher-ranking individuals will chase and bite their subordinates while the latter are trying to crawl on top of them. Juveniles never engage in <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviour,</b> but climb on top of adults, which tolerate their presence on their backs. When assessing other individuals, individuals often measure one another up by running their antennae {{down the length of the}} other individual. Once hierarchy has been established, paired individuals will often cluster together to form an aggregate; this is fastest in male-female pairings, followed by pairs of females, then pairs of males. Hierarchy is quickly established among individuals from a single group, but not among organisms from different groups; these are substantially more aggressive and very rarely climb one another or form aggregates. Individuals within an individual log are usually closely related; especially so with males. This may be related to the intense aggression between unrelated females.|$|E
40|$|Purpose Offence {{paralleling}} behaviour (OPB) is {{a relatively}} new concept that emphasizes the assessment and modification of behavioural patterns that parallel criminal offending. Extant empirical research into OPB has typically focussed on the similarity between <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours</b> observed in custody and violent index offences perpetrated in the community; the results of these studies have been inconsistent, with the degree of similarity varying within subjects and across studies; (Daffern, Howells, Stacey, Hogue, & Mooney, 2008; Daffern, Howells, Mannion, & Tonkin, 2009). The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the level of similarity between OPB predictions and actual in-patient <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Method This prospective pilot study used a novel practice algorithm (Jones, 2010 a) to develop a reference formulation from which OPBs and Pro-social alternate behaviours (PABs), the pro-social variants of OPBs, were predicted. Participants were five mentally disordered offenders resident in a UK medium secure psychiatric unit. Following generation of a reference formulation and OPB and PAB predictions the participants were monitored for 6 months. The degree of similarity between predicted and actual OPBs and PABs was calculated using Jaccard's coefficient. Results Results indicated considerable similarity between matched (pairing predictions and their corresponding actual behaviours) OPBs, which were also more similar than random pairs (pairing randomly selected predictions and <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviours).</b> Conclusion This study revealed the existence of OPB in mentally disordered offenders and has provided the first test of a novel practice algorithm, revealing its potential to guide OPB formulations...|$|R
