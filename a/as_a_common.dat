5|$|All {{corticosteroid}} hormones share cholesterol <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> precursor. Therefore, {{the first}} step in steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The other source of cholesterol is synthesis in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low. In the lysosome, cholesterol esters are converted to free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.|$|E
5|$|All ground {{stations}} {{are connected to}} KSAT's Tromsø Network Operation Center, which is also connected to the TSS and TrollSat. This allows for redundancy as also TSS and TrollSat {{can be used to}} communicate with the satellites. Some customers have direct access to their installations in Longyearbyen without having to route via the Tromsø Network Operation Center. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution. The facility uses interoperability and shared ground services, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E

5|$|As a multirole aircraft, the Tornado {{is capable}} of {{undertaking}} more mission profiles than the anticipated strike mission; various operators replaced multiple aircraft types with the Tornado <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> type– the use of dedicated single role aircraft for specialist purposes such as battlefield reconnaissance, maritime patrol duties, or dedicated electronic countermeasures (ECM) were phased out– either by standard Tornados or modified variants, such as the Tornado ECR. The most extensive modification from the base Tornado design was the Tornado ADV, which was stretched and armed with long range anti-aircraft missiles {{to serve in the}} interceptor role.|$|E

5|$|Carbon is the 15th most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, and the fourth {{most abundant}} element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> element of all known life. It {{is the second most}} abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.|$|E

40|$|The idea of code <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>commons</b> {{is usually}} {{asserted}} in relation with two specific, technical fields: software and genetic code. The question {{of intellectual property}} may appear very specialized, indeed. However, as it concerns the wider subject of freedom of information, {{it may be useful}} to see it from the perspective of Western philosophy tradition. In it, communism of knowledge is a marginal opinion, or is it intertwined in the mainstream? It is possible to outline arguments for the idea of knowledge <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>commons</b> both in Kant's and in Plato's thought. An analysis di those arguments shows the continuity of a tradition that is much more respectable and ancient than the claims of intellectual private property...|$|R
5|$|Elliott's funeral {{took place}} on 25 March. Following a short service at his home, his casket was drawn, with full {{military}} honours, including bands and an escort party, on a gun carriage pulled by horses resplendent with black plumes, to the Burwood Cemetery, a march of some four miles. Stanley Bruce, whose Prime Ministership {{had come to an}} end in late 1929, marched <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> returned soldier.

5|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} {{has been}} established by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for each known human gene {{in the form of}} an approved gene name and symbol (short-form abbreviation), which can be accessed through a database maintained by HGNC. Symbols are chosen to be unique, and each gene has only one symbol (although approved symbols sometimes change). Symbols are preferably kept consistent with other members of a gene family and with homologs in other species, particularly the mouse due to its role <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> model organism.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} bidirectional data communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the Hot Plug Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> mode component of the pair.|$|E

5|$|Iron {{provided}} by dietary supplements is often found as iron(II) fumarate, although iron(II) sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one-third to two-thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate), is often added to {{foods such as}} breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available to the body when chelated to amino acids and is also available for use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> iron supplement. Glycine, the cheapest and most common amino acid is most often used to produce iron glycinate supplements.|$|E
5|$|PHP code may be {{embedded}} into HTML or HTML5 markup, {{or it can}} be used {{in combination}} with various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Common</b> Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server software combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page.
