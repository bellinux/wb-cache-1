500|$|Mike Joseph, {{in review}} of Thriller 25 for PopMatters, {{described}} the track {{listing of the}} reissue as [...] "pleasant" [...] but West's [...] "lazy" [...] remix was the only exception. He added, [...] "You've been {{given the opportunity to}} remix the most iconic single from one of the most iconic albums of all time, and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is stick a drum machine on top of the song's original arrangement?". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone disliked the removal of the original bassline, and compared it to [...] "putting Bobby Orr on the ice without a hockey stick". IGN's Todd Gilchrist praised West's remix and stated that it was a [...] "pretty great track". He added, [...] "it almost overplays the track's originally understated drama, his additions enhance the song and demonstrate that in a contemporary context." ...|$|E
500|$|The National Wildlife Federation {{described}} her as [...] "a passionate, articulate, and tireless {{voice for the}} environment". Chairman of the Florida Audubon Society Ed Davison remembered her, saying, [...] "She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be, and she didn't {{give a lot of}} credibility to excuses about why they're not like that. She would give these wonderful, curmudgeonly speeches to which there was no response. You can't holler back to grandmotherly scolding. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is shuffle your feet and say, 'Yes, Ma'am.'" [...] She was aware of it; she was reported saying, [...] "People can't be rude to me, this poor little old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me." [...] Her ashes were scattered over the [...] of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in Everglades National Park.|$|E
500|$|Follow the Leader {{received}} generally positive reviews. Stephan Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, saying that it [...] "is an effective follow-up to their first two alt-metal landmarks." [...] Erlewine also said that the songs were [...] "vehicles for the metal grind". Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B–. Reviewer Jim Farber said that the lyrics [...] "provide a new blend of metal and remnants of alt-rock." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times said the album was [...] "choppy", and also said that lead singer Jonathan Davis was [...] "wrestling with self-hatred, violent impulses, parental execration, and a confused sexual identity..." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said that, although Korn [...] "deny they're metal", they [...] "nevertheless demonstrate that the essence of metal ... is self-obliterating volume and self-aggrandizing display." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, while saying that Korn [...] "have an ideal record for those long, black days when <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is say 'What the Fuck! What the Fuck! What the Fuck!' at bloody murder volume". The album is featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E

5000|$|Video Games in March 1983 criticized Activision for not {{enhancing}} the Intellivision version's graphics: [...] "We <b>all</b> know <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> more with graphics on Intellivision {{than on the}} VCS. So why no improvements in Pitfall?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Give her <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> to <b>do,</b> {{and do not}} be over-careful to {{keep your}} anxieties from her knowledge. She is very much of a woman, and if you leave her too much to herself, she will grow more introspective.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fred's {{right for}} once," [...] said George, [...] "that's <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> as the matter stands now. If he won't say that, call {{him out and}} have done with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said reassuringly, [...] "no one {{can tell}} exactly how a game of this kind will go. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to hold tight and keep your eyes open." ...|$|E
6000|$|HAROLD. I can't stand your sort, John. When a {{thing like}} this happens, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to cry out: Why didn't he--? Why didn't she--? What's to be done--that's the point! ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{remaining}} tracks originally {{appeared on}} the band's early 7" [...] vinyl EPs: tracks 8-10 from We <b>All</b> Know <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> It (released on the band's own Bicycle Records) and tracks 11-15 from Big City Life (Asian Man Records).|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah no! No!' cried Dragomiroff at my side. I {{could feel}} the old man tremble. 'I do not know <b>all</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> but be kind! I ask {{you to be a}} little kind to them below! This is horrible--horrible!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A broken jug," [...] said he; [...] "--you'll never mend her. She's {{going to}} a cousin in London {{to see if she}} can get help; you've given her the means of getting there--it's <b>all</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> One knows too well what'll become of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alas! no. I fear her minutes are numbered. School yourself, my {{dear old}} friend! God {{will help you}} in this bitter hour. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> now is to make her last moments happy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don’t you trouble about me," [...] said Fraser; [...] "you’ve got <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to {{look after}} yourself. I’ve come out {{to look for a}} policeman; at least, that’s what I told them." ...|$|E
60|$|You would {{cultivate}} a taste at the impressionable age?--Especially {{in the education}} of children, that being just the first question, I suppose, which lies at the root of <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for the workman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Girl!" [...] said Redlaw, sternly, [...] "before this death, of {{all such}} things, was brought about, was there no wrong done to you? In spite of <b>all</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> does no remembrance of wrong cleave to you? Are there not times upon {{times when it}} is misery to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be it so," [...] he said. [...] "It is not much, {{but it is}} <b>all</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> {{and after}} a fashion it will mend the honour you have torn. See that you wed her within the week. Should she not consent, {{it will be the}} worse for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if you'll be said by me," [...] {{continued}} Handy, [...] "you'll {{not write}} your name {{to it at}} all, but just put your mark like the others;"--the cloud began to clear from Skulpit's brow;--"we <b>all</b> know <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it if <b>you</b> like, but maybe you wouldn't like to seem uppish, you know." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} business, your {{work will be}} the same as hers," [...] he said; [...] "you're not qualified. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> will be visiting, noting the state of the houses and the {{condition}} of the children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thank you. You'll have <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to {{keep from}} freezing." [...] She studied his thin coat and worn gloves with keen glance. He could see only her pink cheeks, strong nose, and dark, smiling eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've thought over <b>all</b> {{the harm}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> me," [...] Madame Merle answered. [...] "Your wife {{was afraid of}} me this morning, but in me it was really you she feared." ...|$|R
6000|$|She laughed gayly. This {{was more}} {{the man as}} he had been before the days of their engagement! [...] "I think it is the smell of the powder," [...] she said. [...] "You men are all like schoolboys for your holidays. Father says that the birds are much too wild, and that it will be <b>all</b> even <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to hit them." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “Now, here, you see, {{it takes}} <b>all</b> the running <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> {{to keep in}} the same place. If {{you want to get}} somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that”.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{thought you}} had gone,' she said at length. 'It is <b>all</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for me--to go. It is all I ever asked of you. And you still stay. But do you know, that every day heaps up the peril of death, not only on your head, but on ours? A report has gone about the mountain; it is thought you love me, and the people will not suffer it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Jane, {{entering}} {{and taking}} the chair Canler placed for her. [...] "I only wanted to tell papa that Tobey is {{coming down from the}} college tomorrow to pack his books. I want you to be sure, papa, to indicate <b>all</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> without until fall.

6000|$|... 'Yes, John, {{you are too}} old, and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> now is to {{sit here}} and--and take care of me. You knew all about it quite clearly this morning. We stood {{together}} upstairs by the window listening to the aircraft guns.' ...|$|E
