5|$|A convoy {{to return}} the 9th Division to Australia was <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Red Sea near Massawa from late January to early February 1943. The ships began their voyage across the Indian Ocean on 4 February and, after {{refuelling}} at Addu Atoll, arrived safely at the Western Australian port of Fremantle on 18 February. Four of the transport ships continued to the Australian east coast, one docking at Melbourne on 25 February and the remainder arriving at Sydney two days later. After its return to Australia, the 9th Division made {{an important contribution to}} operations in New Guinea during late 1943.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{collection}} of maps <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1570s, {{many of which}} are assembled from portions of Mercator's earlier maps: 9 constructed from Europe (1554), 6 from British Isles (1564) and 2 from the world map (1569). The map of Europe on pages 1 and 2 is taken from the 1569 world map. There are also 2 manuscript maps of Mercator and 13 maps are from the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of Abraham Ortelius.) Note that Mercator did not term this {{collection of}} maps an atlas.|$|E

5|$|After having {{declined}} in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation {{in the late}} Republic to meet several new demands. Under Caesar, an invasion fleet was <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English Channel to allow the invasion of Britain; under Pompey, a large fleet {{was raised in the}} Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of Cilician pirates. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue {{operations}} of the Soviet Union were not coordinated {{with those of the}} United States, South Korea, and Japan. Consequently no information was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels in the event that they were found. International boundaries are not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number of opposing naval ships that were <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the horses}} were nearly blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers charged the third line, which they also broke. The Russian cossacks, <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reserve, entered the melee, but their light horses were {{no match for the}} French mounts, big horses confiscated from the Prussians the {{previous}} year. The Russian infantry had started to reform their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During this charge, d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot and badly wounded. Several of his men managed to carry or drag him back to French lines.|$|E

5|$|Barbara Caspersen {{has served}} as trustee (currently as an emeritus trustee) of Drew University and as both {{chairwoman}} and vice-chairwoman of the liberal arts college's board. In 1999, the Caspersens provided a $5 million gift for expanding graduate education programs at Drew. In honor of their service to the university, Drew renamed its graduate school as the Caspersen School of Graduate Studies. The university's Rose Memorial Library houses a collection of books, manuscripts, artifacts and papers of Nebraska-born author Willa Cather (1873–1947) assembled from items given by several donors—including significant contributions by Caspersen and his wife. It is {{regarded as one of}} the best collection of Cather's papers <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
5|$|In the Convict Establishment of 1855, the {{day began}} with the wakeup bell at 4:30 am, and the {{officers}} and prisoners <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parade ground at 5:25 am. Prisoners were sent to work before and after breakfast (in their cells), before assembling for muster at midday. This was followed by dinner in the exercise yard or the work site, and more work throughout the afternoon, until supper at 6:00 pm in the cells. Night officers took over at 7:15 pm.|$|E
5|$|The Persian fleet was duly <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{spring of}} 499 BC, and sailed to Ionia. Artaphernes put his (and Darius's) cousin Megabates {{in charge of}} the expedition, and {{dispatched}} him to Miletus with the Persian army. They were joined there by Aristagoras and the Milesian forces, and then embarked and set sail. In order to avoid warning the Naxians, the fleet initially sailed north, towards the Hellespont, but when they arrived at Chios they doubled back and headed south for Naxos.|$|E

A three-man hostage negotiation team had been <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air traffic control tower. NYPD detective Dominick Misino spoke with Demeke over the radio, assisted by FBI special agent John Flood and Port Authority detective sergeant Carmine Spano. After 70 minutes of negotiation, Demeke traded his pistol for the pilot's sunglasses and surrendered peacefully to authorities. All 94 passengers and ten crew were unharmed.|$|E

Nine days later they moved to Bournemouth to film some exterior sequences. One Foot had used Bournemouth since the show's beginning because of its favourable climate, easy access to London, and lower costs compared to filming in the capital. The exterior scenes of the Meldrews' home were filmed, {{as they had been}} since series two, at Tresillian Way in Walkford (a village near New Milton in Hampshire).|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{seems to}} have been laid out on a single occasion and used for only a short time afterwards. It is thought that the mourners would have entered through the south side and <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> empty south-western area of the cemetery before proceeding to the shrine to carry out the burial rites. After interring the deceased in a grave they may have used the eastern entrance to leave the cemetery. Alternatively, different groups of people may have used the two entrances, perhaps reflecting {{the fact that some of}} the graves do not fit into the overall square plan and may therefore belong to a different group.|$|E

However, he was denied a visa due to his communist convictions and decided to paint them in Rio de Janeiro. They were later <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> headquarters. After their completion in 1957, Portinari, who was already ill when he started the masterpiece, succumbed to lead poisoning from the pigments his doctors advised him to abandon.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, the UK's Phantoms were {{a special}} batch built {{separately}} and containing {{a significant amount}} of British technology as a means of easing the pressure on the domestic aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations. Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity of second-hand F-4J aircraft were purchased to augment the UK's air defences following the Falklands War.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were <b>assembled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
