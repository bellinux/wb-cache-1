5|$|The highway {{crosses the}} Colorado River {{at the site}} of the Dewey Bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This bridge was the longest {{suspension}} bridge in Utah until April 2008 when it was destroyed by a fire started by a child playing with matches. The future of the bridge is uncertain, with Grand County conducting <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> determine the feasibility of reconstructing it.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Army Material Command (AMC) {{conducted}} <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> {{determine if}} the development objectives were feasible and also established a program office for the Fire-support Aerial System (FAS). AMC recommended to narrow the competition to compound helicopters, as they were considered the only helicopter configuration at the time capable of being developed to meet the objectives. In March 1964, the Secretary of the Army advised DDRE that modification of existing aircraft would not approach the required performance of the FAS program; the Army would continue using the armed UH-1B until development of the FAS could proceed.|$|E
5|$|Frank Brittan sold Linwood House to Hiorns in 1889, who {{commissioned}} architect John Whitelaw {{to design}} an extension. This {{resulted in a}} drawing room, a billiard room and <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> {{be added to the}} house. In 1898, Hiorns leased Linwood House to Sir John Denniston for five years. Hiorns had retired from business and spent some of his time in Sydney. Denniston, the oldest son of Thomas Denniston and married to the daughter of John Bathgate, was a judge at the Supreme Court in Christchurch.|$|E

5|$|In February 2002, the US Marine Corps {{commenced}} <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> identify potential replacement rotorcraft for {{the aging}} Sikorsky VH-3D presidential transport helicopters. On 18 December 2003, the United States Department of Defense issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for {{the supply of}} 23 helicopters {{to be used as}} a replacement for the 11 VH-3Ds and 8 VH-60Ns of the Marine Corps' HMX-1 squadron, which performs the role of Presidential helicopter transportation; this requirement was given the designation of VXX, or the Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program. Two companies, AgustaWestland and Sikorsky Aircraft responded to the VXX RFP; additionally, that had been interest in a potential Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey-based bid, however the rotorcraft was deemed to be non-transportable by military airlift and thus unsuitable to qualify.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to studies and accounts {{that showed the}} bad condition of the lake, the state restored the fish population of the lake in 1978. In 1985, a study recommended ecological restoration {{of the lake and}} forest, which had been overtaken by invasive species introduced during highway construction. Since then, there have been seven plans for restoring natural elements of the park, as well as three plans for park restoration. Gradual improvements began taking place in the late 1980s, including the addition of new pathways, signage, and security, as well as the restoration of playgrounds and other recreational facilities. In January 1988, NYC Parks conducted <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> determine the specific elements of the park that needed restoration. Highway structures were also reconfigured to clean runoff from these structures. An excavation in the 1990s yielded over 2,500 artifacts.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, 2008, {{a seven-year-old}} boy accidentally started {{a fire in}} a nearby {{campground}} while playing with matches. The fire moved up the riverbank and destroyed the bridge's wooden deck and rails. The county funded <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> determine the feasibility and cost of reconstructing the bridge. The engineers determined that the steel cables and towers most likely did not suffer structural damage and could be reused. The study estimated reconstruction costs at $850,000. The engineers determined the original blueprints, preserved in a museum, were of sufficient quality that only minimal engineering work would be required. The county agreed to direct the effort, but will not fund it with taxpayer money. As replicas do not qualify for historical status, historians are debating if using the original towers and cable is enough for the structure to qualify as historical. Grand County has set up an account for interested parties to donate to the reconstruction effort.|$|E

The study will also examine how such an extension will impact an existing intermodal transportation hub at Bishop International Airport and a rail terminal being built at the former Buick City complex.

5|$|The tribe {{resolved}} {{to place the}} site on the National Historic Registry. In 1976, the National Park Service designated the site as a National Historic Site.

The U.S. government acknowledged {{that some of the}} thirty-five buildings were in poor shape, but maintained that the rest were properly maintained.

Mengele isolated the patients in a separate barrack and had several afflicted children killed so that their preserved heads and organs could be sent to the SS Medical Academy in Graz and other facilities for study. The research was still ongoing when the Romani camp was liquidated and its remaining occupants killed in 1944.|$|E
