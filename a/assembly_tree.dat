40|$|We are {{interested}} in the memory usage of sparse direct solvers. We particularl- y focus on the parallel multifrontal scheme. In the multifrontal approach two kinds of memory can be distinguished: a static one which corresponds to the result of the factorization process (ie, the factors), and a dynamic or active one, usually handled by a stack mechanism, which corresponds to the working space of the factorization process. For some problems the stack size may be as large as and even greater than the final factors. The size of the stack depends on the <b>assembly</b> <b>tree</b> and on how the computation is distributed.

40|$|The use of Automated Multilevel Substructuring (AMLS), for the {{analysis}} of constantly bigger models created the need for the extension of the method to systems of parallel processing. The main characteristic of the method is that for an efficient implementation a number of choices have to be made regarding the algorithms used in the intermediate steps. In this dissertation a fully distributed version of the general AMLS methodology has been designed and implemented (called MLDS) and the factors which influence the efficiency of the algorithm have been analyzed. For this purpose, the solution of static problems and symmetric eigenproblems has been studied as well. Initially, the Cholesky factorization of dense matrices and the multifrontal method for the factorization of sparse matrices were presented. For the parallelization of the latter a static weighted subtree to subcube mapping has been used. As the number of processors increases the efficiency decreases due to the growth of the volume of communication and the load imbalance because of the static mapping. Afterwards, the Lanczos method was described and two methods of its parallelization were discussed. With the first method, the frequency interval of interest is divided in subintervals each of which is processed by one processor. Although, no communication between the processors is required, the efficiency is limited because of the different calculation cost if each subinterval. In addition, the distributed execution usually involves a greater number of numerical operations than the corresponding serial one. With the second method, the most time consuming operations of the solution of static problems and orthogonalization are individually parallelized. The efficiency is low because of the high cost of communication. Finally, the MLDS algorithm was presented. First the identification of the mathematical substructures and the creation of the <b>assembly</b> <b>tree</b> were discussed. Then the parallelization of the intermediate steps was described. Briefly, all the processors are divided in groups, except for one, which is called main global process. Each substructure is assigned to a group. The purpose of the main global process is to prepare, send and collect the data involved in the various staged of the processing of each substructure. Generally, the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm depends on the number of levels of the <b>assembly</b> <b>tree</b> and the cut-off frequency of the individual eigenproblems. ...|$|E

Given the potentially complex topologies of molecular systems, though, automatically generating such hierarchical decompositions may be difficult. In this article, we present a fast general algorithm for the complete construction of a hierarchical representation of a molecular system. This two-step algorithm treats the input molecular system as a graph in which vertices represent atoms or pseudo-atoms, and edges represent covalent bonds. The first step contracts all cycles in the input graph. The second step builds an <b>assembly</b> <b>tree</b> from the reduced graph. We analyze the complexity of this algorithm and show that {{the first step is}} linear in the number of edges in the input graph, whereas the second one is linear in the number of edges in the graph without cycles, but dependent on the branching factor of the molecular graph. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a set of specifically tailored difficult cases as well as on a large subset of molecular graphs extracted from the protein data bank. In particular, we experimentally show that both steps behave linearly in the number of edges in the input graph (the branching factor is fixed for the second step).

Here, we consider the solution of sparse symmetric positive-definite linear systems by Cholesky factorization.

Our sparse algorithm is built on the <b>assembly</b> <b>tree</b> and subdivides the work at each node into tasks on blocks of the Cholesky factor.

The key difficulty is to manage {{the order of the}} task executions so that we can achieve high parallelism while staying below the memory bound.

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} {{complexity}} of traversing tree-shaped workflows whose tasks require large I/O files. Such workflows typically arise in the multifrontal method of sparse matrix factorization. We target a classical two-level memory system, where the main memory is faster but smaller than the secondary memory. A task in the workflow can be processed if all its predecessors have been processed, and if its input and output files fit in the currently available main memory. The amount of available memory {{at a given time}} depends upon the ordering in which the tasks are executed. What is the minimum amount of main memory, over all postorder schemes, or over all possible traversals, that is needed for an in-core execution? We establish several complexity results that answer these questions. We propose a new, polynomial time, exact algorithm which runs faster than a reference algorithm. Next, we address the setting where the required memory renders a pure in-core solution unfeasible. In this setting, we ask the following question: what is the minimum amount of I/O that must be performed between the main memory and the secondary memory? We show that this latter problem is NP-hard, and propose efficient heuristics.

Assembly models are developed for viral capsids built from protein building blocks that can assume different local bonding structures in the capsid. This situation occurs, for example, for viruses in the family of Papovaviridae, which are linked to cancer and are hence of particular interest for the health sector. More specifically, the viral capsids of the (pseudo-) T = 7 particles in this family consist of pentamers that exhibit {{two different types of}} bonding structures. While this scenario cannot be described mathematically in terms of Caspar–Klug theory (Caspar D L D and Klug A 1962 Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Assembly {{planning}} {{is a crucial}} task for every manufacturing product. In general, assembly operations consume more than 30 % of the total manufacturing time and cost. Therefore, any effort in optimizing assembly will {{have a significant impact}} on the economic success of manufacturing. Finding an optimal assembly plan by hand is tedious and perhaps impractical for the large models. This research introduces an automatic computational tool in automated assembly planning (AAP) to automatically transform a CAD assembly into a set of assembly instructions. The goal is to make this transformation with as little user commitment as possible. Thus, automation is applied on every detail of the work. The work has five main divisions: geometric reasoning, complex geometry detection, graph representation, AI Planning and post–planning. To have the most general assembly planning tool, tessellation is considered as the representation of the input model. A revolutionary reasoning scheme is implemented to efficiently derive geometric and mating constraints from the tessellated models along with detection of complex geometries including fasteners, gears and springs. The mating information between assembly parts are stored in a liaison graph which is the starting point of an artificial intelligence planning procedure. Various graph–based algorithms are implemented to generate feasible assembly candidates. The AI planning evaluates every assembly candidate with complex statistical models and produces multiple instructions in terms of a detailed <b>assembly</b> <b>tree</b> or called Treequence.

40|$|We {{present a}} distributed-memory {{parallel}} algorithm for 2 D visco-acoustic full-waveform inversion of wide-angle seismic data. Our code {{is written in}} fortran 90 and use MPI for parallelism. The algorithm was applied to real wide-angle data set recorded by 100 OBSs with a 1 -km spacing in the eastern-Nankai trough (Japan) to image the deep structure of the subduction zone. Full-waveform inversion is applied sequentially to discrete frequencies by proceeding from the low to the high frequencies. The inverse problem is solved with a classic gradient method. Full-waveform modeling is performed with a frequency-domain finite-difference method. In the frequency-domain, solving the wave equation requires resolution of a large unsymmetric system of linear equations. We use the massively parallel direct solver MUMPS ([URL] for distributed-memory computer to solve this system. The MUMPS solver {{is based on a}} multifrontal method for the parallel factorization. The MUMPS algorithm is subdivided in 3 main steps: a symbolic analysis step that performs re-ordering of the matrix coefficients to minimize the fill-in of the matrix during the subsequent factorization and an estimation of the <b>assembly</b> <b>tree</b> of the matrix. Second, the factorization is performed with dynamic scheduling to accomodate numerical pivoting and provides the LU factors distributed over all the processors. Third, the resolution is performed for multiple sources. To compute the gradient of the cost function, 2 simulations per shot are required (one to compute the forward wavefield and one to back-propagate residuals). The multi-source resolutions can be performed in parallel with MUMPS. In the end, each processor stores in core a sub-domain of all the solutions. These distributed solutions can be exploited to compute in parallel the gradient of the cost function. Since the gradient of the cost function is a weighted stack of the shot and residual solutions of MUMPS, each processor computes the corresponding sub-domain of the gradient. In the end, the gradient is centralized on the master processor using a collective communation. The gradient is scaled by the diagonal elements of the Hessian matrix. This scaling is computed only once per frequency before the first iteration of the inversion. Estimation of the diagonal terms of the Hessian requires performing one simulation per non redondant shot and receiver position. The same strategy that the one used for the gradient is used to compute the diagonal Hessian in parallel. This algorithm was applied to a dense wide-angle data set recorded by 100 OBSs in the eastern Nankai trough, offshore Japan. Thirteen frequencies ranging from 3 and 15 Hz were inverted. Tweny iterations per frequency were computed leading to 260 tomographic velocity models of increasing resolution. The velocity model dimensions are 105 km x 25 km corresponding to a finite-difference grid of 4201 x 1001 grid with a 25 -m grid interval. The number of shot was 1005 and the number of inverted OBS gathers was 93. The inversion requires 20 days on 6 32 -bits bi-processor nodes with 4 Gbytes of RAM memory per node when only the LU factorization is performed in parallel. Preliminary estimations of the time required to perform the inversion with the fully-parallelized code is 6 and 4 days using 20 and 50 processors respectively...|$|E

Our phylogenetic analyses showed that most of the traits which showed the shift in traits metrics also showed significant phylogenetic signal (Additional file 1 : Table S 13), indicating the conservative evolution of leaf, wood, and reproductive traits influence the <b>assembly</b> of <b>tree</b> communities among wet and dry tropical forest. Moreover, the congruent pattern of functional trait metrics and phylogenetic structure between wet and dry habitat tree communities further support the above argument.|$|R
30|$|Improved {{understanding}} of the processes shaping the <b>assembly</b> of tropical <b>tree</b> communities is crucial for gaining insights into the evolution of forest communities and biological diversity. The climate {{is thought to be}} the first order determinant of abundance and distribution patterns of tree species with contrasting traits such as evergreen and deciduous leaf phenology. However, the relative role of neutral, and niche-based processes in the evolution of these patterns remain poorly understood.|$|R
