5|$|Croc: Legend of the Gobbos {{received}} average {{reviews from}} critics; praise was directed towards the game's visuals and its music, while criticism was directed towards the game's controls <b>and</b> <b>camera.</b> The game was a commercial success, with the PlayStation version {{going on to}} sell over 3 million copies. A sequel to the game, titled Croc 2, was released in 1999.|$|E
5|$|During filming, {{the crew}} and several cast members objected to cinematographer Michael Seresin <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> {{operator}} John Stanier's European style of single-source lighting, which involved the use of incense burners. In response, representatives of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) halted the production, and forbade Parker from using smoke on the set due to the noxious atmosphere it created.|$|E
5|$|Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin {{falls in}} folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck {{folds of the}} Javan {{rhinoceros}} are smaller {{than those of the}} Indian rhinoceros, but still form a saddle shape over the shoulder. Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, the Javan rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> traps. They are rarely encountered, observed or measured directly.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} for Anachronox is turn-based; {{the player}} controls {{a party of}} up to three characters as they explore a 3D environment of futuristic cities, space vessels, and outdoor areas. Inspirations for the game include older role-playing video games such as Chrono Trigger and the Final Fantasy series, animator Chuck Jones and the novel Ender's Game. The game was built with a heavily {{modified version of the}} Quake II engine, rewritten chiefly to allow a wider color palette, emotive animations and facial expressions, better lighting, particle, <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> effects.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new linear method for reconstructing simultaneously 3 D features (points, lines <b>and</b> planes) <b>and</b> <b>cameras</b> from many perspective views by solving a single linear system. It assumes {{that a real}} or virtual reference plane is visible in all views. We call it the Direct Reference Plane (DRP) method. It {{is well known that}} the projection relationship between uncalibrated <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> 3 D features is non-linear {{in the absence of a}} reference plane. With a known reference plane, points <b>and</b> <b>cameras</b> have a linear relationship, as shown in [16]. The main contribution of this paper is that lines <b>and</b> <b>cameras,</b> as well as, planes <b>and</b> <b>cameras</b> also have a linear relationship. Consequently, all 3 D features <b>and</b> all <b>cameras</b> can be reconstructed simultaneously from a single linear system, which handles missing image measurements naturally. A further contribution is an extensive experimental comparison, using real data, of different reference plane and non-reference plane reconstruction methods. For difficult reference plane scenarios, with point or line features, the DRP method is superior to all compared methods. Finally, an extensive list of reference plane scenarios is presented, which shows the wide applicability of the DRP method. ...|$|R
5|$|To {{enhance the}} {{illusion}} of the puppets, David Lane ensured that camera shots frequently omitted {{the tops of the}} heads and the visible control wires, and also incorporated low-angle shots for dramatic effect. Location shooting in Portugal was arranged for Lane, Derek Meddings <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> operator Alan Perry to film overhead landscape shots for the climax in which Alan rescues the Zero-X astronauts during re-entry. However, when the footage was deemed unsatisfactory, it was replaced with a painted backdrop made by associate producer Reg Hill.|$|E
5|$|With {{a budget}} of $230,000, the {{surviving}} original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 was compiled by Nafzger and assigned to Lowry Digital for restoration. The video was processed to remove random noise <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> shake without destroying historical legitimacy. The images were from tapes in Australia, the CBS News archive, and kinescope recordings made at Johnson Space Center. The restored video, remaining in black and white, contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements.|$|E

Since 2006, WIN's weeknight bulletin has also included coverage of the Griffith area. In addition, Southern Cross Nine runs a small sales office and airs short local news updates from its Canberra studios throughout the day. Since 2017, Southern Cross Nine's new hour long weeknight bulletin from Wagga Wagga is Nine News Riverina.|$|E

5|$|At 3:54p.m. BST on 23 July 2011, two {{ambulances}} {{were called}} to Winehouse's home in Camden, London. Winehouse was pronounced dead at the scene. Shortly afterwards, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that she had died. After her death was announced, media <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> crews appeared, as crowds gathered near Winehouse's residence to pay their respects. Forensic investigators entered the flat as police cordoned off the street outside; they recovered one small and two large bottles of vodka from her room. After her death, the singer broke her second Guinness World Record: for the most songs by a woman to simultaneously appear on the UK singles chart, with eight.|$|E
5|$|Clayman (IGN) {{reported}} that the game had no major technical issues, which was a major concern in the protracted run-up to the game's release. He also found that most of its levels {{did not appear to}} leverage the Xbox 360's advances in areas apart from graphics. Bramwell (Eurogamer), on the other hand, fought the controls <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> throughout the game. He lamented a particular issue in which the camera would spin 180 degrees when Kameo was hit, which made the path of retreat harder to see. Theobald (GameSpy) also lamented the camera. Kasavin (GameSpot) found Kameo to be technically outstanding, and praised its automatic game save features, short loading times, steady frame rates, and detailed display on both standard- and high-definition televisions. Pfister (1UP.com) wrote that Kameo was technically impressive to the point of overwhelming the gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Unleashed was mixed, with Metacritic aggregate {{scores of}} 60 and 54 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions respectively, and 66 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions. The added element of motion controls for the Werehog sections, {{as well as}} text-based hub worlds and better Werehog level design <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> system, were reasons cited for the higher review scores for the Wii version of the game, though a few review websites, such as 1UP, gave the Wii version a lower score than its Xbox 360 and PS3 counterparts. Nevertheless, the game was a commercial success and sold 2.45 million units combined making it Sega's third best selling game during their last fiscal year period of 2008.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{scenarios}} follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and the story's divergence mainly depends on whether an idol passes or fails an audition, though {{this is not always}} the case. Some outcomes, such as failing to pass the first audition, can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternate ending to the plot. An audition marks the end of a chapter, after which the story will progress onto the next stage. In the game's stage mode, the player is able to freely customize a stand-alone performance, including options for the song, costume, accessories, choreography <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> positioning. Up to 16 players can participate via Wi-Fi in the stage mode by offering three types of cheers during one player's performance. If the game is played on a Nintendo DS with a camera, such as a Nintendo DSi or a later model, the camera may be used to scan QR codes found online or in magazines to obtain in-game items.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to religious allusions, the crew used color schemes <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> movements {{to create their}} own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic. When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle, with an earth tone, while the camera movement was gentle as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater camera movement. When there was danger, the lighting became colder with more grays and blues, and the camera shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{considered}} Viva Piñata {{a success}} and the sequel's development team sought to make a more definitive version of the original. The team re-used many of the development infrastructure set up for its predecessor and exhausted their gameplay ideas for the piñata gardening concept. The game released to generally favorable reviews in September 2008. Critics considered the game more accessible to newcomers and a worthwhile improvement on the original, but altogether closer to an expansion than a unique sequel. Reviewers praised its game design tweaks but were mixed on its multiplayer modes <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> integration. Critics were mixed on whether the sequel would attract new players to the franchise. Trouble in Paradise was later included in the developer's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
