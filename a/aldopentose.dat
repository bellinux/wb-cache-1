Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called trioses, those with four are called tetroses, five are called pentoses, six are hexoses, and so on.

No cytotoxicity was observed when incubation was performed at neutral pH and mild temperature. To conclude, the glycation reaction conducted under controlled conditions can be considered as a promising way to upgrade marine hydrolysates without generating deleterious compounds...|$|R

Moreover, we suggested that the observed differences in the biological activity and the rate of the autoxidation reactions of the four pentoses are due to their configurational difference, since the order [(3) > (2) > (4) > (1) ] is the same both in rhe activity and in the reaction rate, and the similar effect of configuration on the rate of the oxidation reaction and enolization of <b>aldopentoses</b> was reportedi n the literature. Aldohexoses are in general less reactive than <b>aldopentoses</b> in oxidations (e. g [...] halogen oxidation of free sugars) and have been reported to exhibit very weak nucleic acid-cleaving activity.

The growth rate on arabinose for recombinant S. cerevisiae is very slow, even at very high substrate concentrations, preventing functional complementation for transport.

We measured the permeabilities of model protocellular membranes to water, {{five of the six}} pentoses, and selected aldohexoses, ketohexoses, and three to six carbon alditols by following volume changes of vesicles after the addition of solute to the external medium. Solute hydrophobicities correlated poorly with permeability coefficients within one structural class of compounds. The permeability coefficients of diastereomeric sugars differed by as much as a factor of 10, with ribose being the most permeable <b>aldopentose.</b> Flexible alditols and sugars, sugars biased toward or restricted to furanose forms, and sugars having anomers with hydrophobic faces permeated more quickly than compounds lacking these features. Among the aldopentoses, only ribose possesses all of these properties. Ribose permeated both fatty acid and phospholipid membranes more rapidly than the other aldopentoses or hexoses. The enhanced permeability conferred by the unique conformational preferences of ribose would have allowed faster assimilation of ribose by primitive cells as they passively absorbed materials from the environment.

The enthalpic contributions to the pair cross-interaction coefficients are negative for solutions containing sugars and glycine or urea, while they are positive for solutions of sugars and N-acetylglycinamide or prevailingly hydrophobic alkylamides. This quite distinct behaviour is confirmed by the deviations of the cross-interaction coefficients with respect to the values of the half-sum of the enthalpic contributions to the self-interactions. The half-sum is assumed as a reference value for the condition of minimal mutual perturbation between the solute molecules. This approach allows us to emphasize the possible important implications of the unfavourable positive contribution of the enthalpy to the interactions between peptides and saccharides.

40|$|The {{existence}} of the RNA world, in which RNA acted as a catalyst {{as well as an}} informational macromolecule, assumes a large prebiotic source of ribose or the {{existence of}} pre-RNA molecules with backbones different from ribose-phosphate. The generally accepted prebiotic synthesis of ribose, the formose reaction, yields numerous sugars without any selectivity. Even if there were a selective synthesis of ribose, there is still the problem of stability. Sugars are known to be unstable in strong acid or base, but there are few data for neutral solutions. Therefore, we have measured the rate of decomposition of ribose between pH 4 and pH 8 from 40 C to 120 C. The ribose half-lives are very short (73 min at pH 7. 0 and 100 C and 44 years at pH 7. 0 and 0 C). The other <b>aldopentoses</b> and aldohexoses have half-lives within an order of magnitude of these values, as do 2 -deoxyribose, ribose 5 -phosphate, and ribose 2, 4 bisphosphate.

The specific activity of mycobacterial extracts was ten-fold higher for D-arabitol than for its L-isomer, and eight-fold higher than for xylitol (it was more than forty-fold lower in the case of glycerol-grown cells). The product of the pentitol dehydrogenase reaction was identified as D-xylulose by three different procedures.

The versatility of this strain of A. aerogenes is due to an ability to synthesize in the presence of appropriate carbohydrates (inducers) families of enzymes which catalyze the metabolism of the carbohydrates (i. e., families of pentitol dehydrogenases, <b>aldopentose</b> isomerases, and pentulokinases). The specificity of induction for members of the enzyme families was found to vary, and cross induction of enzyme activity was common, especially among the pentitol dehydrogenases.

No significant variations were found in the free energies of complexation of the amino acids {{as a result of an}} entropy-enthalpy compensation effect. The transfer enthalpy of the amino acid cations are negative implying that these cations are enthalpically more stable in methanol than water. However, no complexation in water was found between these guest species and 18 -crown- 6.

A combination of experimental and computational studies carried out by us and our collaborators is aimed at helping to close this gap. Properties of membranes might have contributed to the selection of RNA as an early biopolymer. A kinetic mechanism was proposed (Sacerdote & Szostak, 2005) in which ribose was supplied more quickly than other <b>aldopentoses</b> to primordial cells for preferential incorporation of ribonucleotides into nucleic acids. This proposal is based on a finding that ribose permeates membranes an order of magnitude faster than its diastereomers, arabinose and xylose. Our computer simulations, which yield permeation rates in excellent agreement with experiment, and kinetic modeling explain this phenomenon in terms of inter- and intramolecular interactions involving exocyclic hydroxyl groups attached to carbon atoms of the pyranose ring (Wei and Pohorille, 2009). They also constrain scenarios for the formation of the earliest nucleic acids (Wei and Pohorille, 2013). In one scenario, sugars permeate protocellular walls and subsequently are used to synthesize nucleic acids inside protocells. As long as this process proceeds at the rate faster than 6 x 10 (exp - 3) /s, ribose derivatives will be available for synthesis easier than their diastereomers. If nucleosides or their activated derivatives are synthesized outside protocells and subsequently transported across protocellular membranes the kinetic mechanism does not apply because all diastereomers, which have their sugars in the furanose rather than pyranose form, permeate the membrane at approximately the same rate. Properties of membranes might have been also coupled to metabolism involving peptides. Recently, Adamala and Szostak (2013) have shown that a dipeptide inside fatty-acid vesicles catalyzes the formation of another dipeptide that binds to vesicle walls and, by doing so, promotes their growth at the expense of other vesicles. This coupling of metabolism, permeability of vesicles and their growth is the first demonstration of evolutionary advantage imparted by small, membrane-bound peptides. Building on this work we have calculated the rate at which different blocked amino acids are delivered to a protocell for synthesis of dipeptides. We have further shown that the dipeptides are located at the water-membrane interface rather than in the center of the bilayer. On these basis it is anticipated that other dipeptides containing aromatic, but not necessarily hydrophobic amino acids (e. g. tyrosine) could have the same catalytic effects. Insight from these studies allows for estimating the rate of vesicle growth and the rates of dipeptide synthesis required to keep the system in balance. These results, in combination with our earlier studies, lead to a general scenario for evolution from membrane-bound dipeptides to ion channels in the origin of life...|$|R
