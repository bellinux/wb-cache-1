5|$|Castelli {{moved to}} a farm in modern the Buenos Aires {{neighborhood}} of Núñez. The farm had some agriculture fields and a small brick factory. He lived next to other influential people like Cornelio Saavedra, Juan Larrea, Miguel de Azcuénaga, and attorney José Darragueira. The meetings of the secret society continued, unaffected by the departure of Burke. On June 2, 1806, Castelli's mother died, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in mourning when the city learned of a British landing in Quilmes.|$|E
5|$|Australia's success {{came at a}} cost, with Lindwall {{injured and}} unable to bowl in the lead-up to the Second Test, missing the {{intervening}} matches against Northamptonshire and Yorkshire. The heavy workload on Miller caused by Lindwall's breaking down mid-Test generated severe back pain, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> not fully recovered {{by the start of}} the Second Test at Lord's. Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning of the Lord's Test. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to risk his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Miller also played, but still nursing his back, was unfit to bowl.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain also {{involved}} himself in civic activities in Birmingham. In 1906, Chamberlain was {{a founding member}} of the University House Committee at Birmingham University, the president of which was his aunt, Mrs Charles Beale, wife of the University's first Vice-Chancellor. He became an Official Visitor and then a director of the Birmingham General Hospital. He advocated a larger facility for the hospital, a cause in which he was eventually successful, though building did not commence until 1934 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> fundraising as Prime Minister. Stating that he was painfully aware of the defects of his own education, he played a part in the establishment of the University of Birmingham, of which Mason Science College became a part. Joseph Chamberlain became the University's first chancellor; Neville Chamberlain was appointed to its Council and later to its Board of Governors.|$|E
5|$|In 1457, Skanderbeg had {{achieved}} {{his most famous}} victory over the Ottoman Empire at Albulena (Ujëbardha), which was received with great enthusiasm throughout Italy. In order to repay Alfonso for the financial and military assistance given to him years before, Skanderbeg took up the pope's pleas to help out Alfonso's son by sending a military expedition to Italy. Before leaving, Skanderbeg tried to negotiate a ceasefire with Sultan Mehmed II, the conqueror of Constantinople, to ensure his domain's safety. Mehmed had not declared a truce <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> sending his armies against Bosnia and the Morea. It was not until 1459, after Mehmed's conquest of Serbia, that Mehmed not only declared a truce, but also a three-year ceasefire with Skanderbeg. This gave Skanderbeg his opportunity to send his men to Italy.|$|E
5|$|The king visited Hanover {{again from}} May to November 1719. Instead of {{appointing}} George to the guardianship, {{he established a}} regency council. In 1720, Walpole encouraged the king and his son to reconcile, {{for the sake of}} public unity, which they did half-heartedly. Walpole and Townshend returned to political office, and rejoined the ministry. George was soon disillusioned with the terms of the reconciliation; his three daughters who were in the care of the king were not returned <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> barred from becoming regent during the king's absences. He came to believe that Walpole had tricked him into the rapprochement as part of a scheme to regain power. Over the next few years, he and Caroline lived quietly, avoiding overt political activity. They had three more children: William, Mary and Louisa, who were brought up at Leicester House and Richmond Lodge, George's summer residence.|$|E

25|$|Harry Peckham (1740 – 10 January 1787) was a King's Counsel, {{judge and}} sportsman who toured Europe {{and wrote a}} series of letters which are still being {{published}} over 200 years later.

25|$|Pope John Paul II {{died in the}} Vatican at {{the time}} of the Change, instead of {{surviving}} until 2005, as in our timeline, but Cardinal Ratzinger fled to Umbria, where connections with the worldwide Roman Catholic church were reestablished <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> elected Pope, as in our timeline – and his pontificate lasts until 2022. Perhaps the greatest post-Change success of the Roman Catholic Church was reunification with the Church of England, which led to the crowning of the British monarch (William V) as Emperor of the West.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 1853, Keil {{published}} his new magazine under the inconspicuous title , {{named after the}} gazebo in his garden in Leipzig. Initially he could not serve as editor because his press credentials had been revoked <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> under police surveillance, so he borrowed the firm of Stolle & Diezmann for the first run of 5000 copies. His objective was to reach and enlighten the whole family, especially the German middle classes, through a carefully-crafted mixture of current events, essays on the natural sciences, biographies, short stories, poetry, and full-page illustrations. The magazine's masthead depicted a grandfatherly figure reading to a family around a table.|$|E

25|$|Following the Habsburg {{victory in}} Italy the Emperor could at last send Charles III {{assistance}} in early 1708. Joseph I's resources remained limited <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> unwilling to assign {{a high priority}} {{to the war in}} Iberia. Nevertheless, the Austrians agreed to send reinforcements, as well as Guido Starhemberg to assume supreme Allied command in the peninsula. James Stanhope – the English envoy to Charles III – became the new British commander in Spain, and in September he and Admiral Leake captured Menorca and the key harbour, Mahón. This success followed hard on Leake's capture of Sardinia in the name of Charles III in August. However, Philip V's generals on the Spanish mainland continued their advance on Charles III in Barcelona. Orléans took Tortosa in mid-July, while on the Valencian coast d'Asfeld re-captured Dénia in mid-November, and Alicante (though not its citadel) in early December.|$|E
25|$|The {{executive}} offices of General Motors headquarters continued to clash with DeLorean's nonconformity, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{not able to}} fit the traditional mold of conservatism that was usually expected of someone of his stature. When John was appointed, Chevrolet was having financial and organizational troubles, and GM president Ed Cole needed a first-class manager in that position to sort things out – company man or not. The new model Camaro was due out for the 1970 model year, and it was rapidly falling behind schedule. Redesigns for the Corvette and Nova were also delayed, and unit sales had still not recovered from {{the past four years}} of turmoil, much of that because of the bad publicity surrounding the Corvair and well-publicized quality-control issues affecting other Chevy models, including defective motor mounts that led to an unprecedented recall of 6.7 million Chevrolets built between 1965 and 1969. DeLorean responded to the production problems by delaying the release of the Camaro, and simplifying the modifications to the Corvette and Nova.|$|E
25|$|Cowan was {{an amateur}} {{right-handed}} middle-order or opening batsman whose appearances in regular cricket were restricted by {{his career in}} the Royal Navy. He was educated at the Britannia Royal Naval College at Dartmouth, Devon, passing out in 1899. As a naval cadet, he was posted to HMS Crescent and then in 1902 as an acting sub-lieutenant to HMS Revenge, a pre-Dreadnought battleship. The following year he was deployed as a full sub-lieutenant to the depot ship HMS Orion, based in Malta, for operation on the torpedo boat destroyer HMS Seal <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> there when promoted to full lieutenant in 1905. At the start of 1907, still lieutenant, he was sent to the newly commissioned HMS Hibernia, flagship of the North Atlantic Fleet, and then in 1911 he was posted to the refitted HMS Cumberland. By the end of the First World War, Cowan had reached the rank of Commander and was in charge of HMS Nairana, a converted ferry used to launch seaplanes which was deployed off the northern coast of Russia during the North Russia Campaign of UK involvement in the Russian Civil War. In retirement in 1928, he was promoted from the rank of Commander to Captain.|$|E

25|$|In a June 9, 1876 {{engagement}} {{called the}} Skirmish at Tongue River Heights, during the Great Sioux War of 1876-77 General George Crook was camped on the Tongue {{near the mouth}} of Prairie Dog Creek with about 950 soldiers, when Sioux fired into his camp from a bluff across the Tongue. A battalion under Captain Anson Mills responded, crossing the river and driving the Sioux force from the bluffs. As a consequence of this engagement, on June 11, General Crook moved his base camp to the junction of Big and Little Goose Creeks, some 7 miles south of the junction of Goose Creek and the Tongue River, where Sheridan, Wyoming is now located. On June 16, after being joined on the Tongue by some 260 Crow and Shoshone scouts, Crook moved his forces north, across the Tongue, and on June 17, 1876 engaged a large Sioux and Cheyenne force at the Battle of the Rosebud. After the battle Crook returned south of the Tongue River to the base camp on Goose Creek, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> there on June 25, 1876 when General George A. Custer was defeated at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, some 65 miles to the north.|$|E
25|$|I got my {{stopwatch}} {{going again}} {{to check the}} length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints {{of no more than}} 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check — <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport — something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front — and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times.|$|E
