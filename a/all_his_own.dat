5|$|Disraeli left {{much of the}} {{detailed}} work to Salisbury, concentrating his efforts on making it as difficult as possible for the broken-up big Bulgaria to reunite. Disraeli did not have things <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> way: he intended that Batum be demilitarised, but the Russians obtained their preferred language, and in 1886, fortified the town. Nevertheless, the Cyprus Convention ceding the island to Britain was announced during the congress, and again made Disraeli a sensation.|$|E

For the movie, DiBiase performed <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> stunts, which resulted in him separating the cartilage between two of his ribs during a fight scene.|$|E
5|$|Anderson had a final {{meeting with}} the Schanzkowski family in 1938. Gertrude Schanzkowska was insistent that Anderson was her sister, Franziska, but the Nazi {{government}} had arranged the meeting to determine Anderson's identity, and if accepted as Schanzkowska she would be imprisoned. The Schanzkowski family refused to sign affidavits against her, and no further action was taken. In 1939, World War II began with Germany's attack on the western half of Poland. In 1940, Edward Fallows died virtually destitute after wasting <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money on trying to obtain the Tsar's non-existent fortune for the Grandanor Corporation. Towards {{the end of the}} war, Anderson lived at Schloss Winterstein with Louise of Saxe-Meiningen, in what became the Soviet occupation zone. In 1946, Prince Frederick of Saxe-Altenburg helped her across the border to Bad Liebenzell in the French occupation zone.|$|E

5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
5|$|Citadel was {{the last}} German {{strategic}} offensive on the Eastern Front, {{and one of the}} largest battles in history, involving more than four million men. By the time the Wehrmacht launched their initial assault on 5 July 1943, the Soviet forces outnumbered them by nearly three to one. Walther Model was in command of the northern pincer, with the Ninth Army, while Manstein's Army Group South formed the southern pincer. Both armies were slowed as the tanks were blown up in minefields and caught up in combat on a series of prepared Soviet defensive lines. After five days of fighting Model's advance was stopped, with the Ninth Panzers suffering 25,000 casualties. By 13 July Model's forces were being drawn away towards Orel, where the Soviet army had launched Operation Kutuzov. Manstein's forces were able to penetrate the Soviet lines, causing heavy casualties. He reached, but did not enter or capture, Prokhorovka, his first major objective, on 11 July, inflicting serious Soviet losses in the resulting Battle of Prokhorovka. However, on 13 July Hitler called off the failed Kursk offensive; the Allies had landed in Sicily, so he issued the order for a withdrawal. Manstein protested; he felt that the Soviet forces had exhausted all their reserves in the area, and {{he did not want to}} stop until <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> reserves had been committed. Hitler, however, insisted on calling off the operation. Although Soviet casualties were indeed heavy, modern historians discount the possibility of a successful German continuation of the offensive.|$|E

25|$|Though the reputations of many {{of these}} writers had faded by the mid-20th century, the {{influence}} of the symbolist movement was nonetheless profound. This was especially true in the case of Innokenty Annensky, whose definitive collection of verse, Cypress Box, was published posthumously (1909). Sometimes cited as a Slavic counterpart to the accursed poets, Annensky managed to render into Russian the essential intonations of Baudelaire and Verlaine, while the subtle music, ominous allusions, arcane vocabulary, and the spell of minutely changing colours and odours in his poetry were <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> His influence on the acmeist school of Russian poetry (Akhmatova, Gumilyov, Mandelshtam) was paramount.|$|E
25|$|The Mears Newz was {{published}} by Swift Lathers, its founder and editor. Lathers was well-skilled in English and grammar, benefiting from training by his mother, an English teacher. Lathers worked as a stringer for a Detroit newspaper, where he grew to dislike the constant editing of his writing by others. He was then motivated {{to start his own}} newspaper where no one else could edit his writing. Moving from the Detroit area to Mears in 1909, Lathers started The Mears News (he initially spelled the word News in the name with an s) and believed it was his life's calling to report on items related to Mears, his adopted hometown. His simple meager lifestyle sacrificed personal financial gain to keep his newspaper going. Lathers wrote <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> stories and reports. He printed the newspapers on a foot operated printing press. Lathers would hand deliver the newspapers himself locally.|$|E

The episode opens with a quote from French existentialist philosopher and writer Jean-Paul Sartre—"I am responsible for everything... except my very responsibility", which {{was taken from the}} 1943 treatise Being and Nothingness. Sarte's writing echoes the motivations of the character of Raymond Dees, with author N. E.

500|$|X Japan's {{appearance}} {{was inspired by}} glam rock, Kiss, David Bowie, as well as traditional Japanese kabuki theatre, where it was customary for male actors to play female roles and dress like women. Visual kei artists still often employ feminine looks and garbs for their stage. According to Josephine Yun, [...] "like its music, X's look was individualistic. Square-shouldered Toshi donned leather and metal, looking like a character out of the anime Gundam. Taiji dolled up in perfect, pretty glam. Pata's sleepy, backseat demeanor and whiskey bottle became his trademark, as hide forever goaded the audience. And Yoshiki was a paradox <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> bewtichingly effeminate one moment — and a full-force, wrist-breaking (literally) hurricane in concert the next." [...] Will Hodgkinson of The Times described X Japan as having, [...] "the grandiosity of Queen, the heavy-metal hysteria of Iron Maiden and the symphonic sophistication of classical music, all tied up with {{a healthy dose of}} melodrama." ...|$|E
500|$|Eastwood's {{next film}} The Eiger Sanction (1975) {{was based on}} Trevanian's {{critically}} acclaimed spy novel of the same name. Eastwood plays Jonathan Hemlock in a role originally intended for Paul Newman, an assassin turned college art professor who decides {{to return to his}} former profession for one last [...] "sanction" [...] in return for a rare Pissarro painting. In the process he must climb the north face of the Eiger in Switzerland under perilous conditions. Mike Hoover taught Eastwood how to climb during several weeks of preparation at Yosemite in the summer of 1974 before filming commenced in Grindelwald, Switzerland on August 12, 1974. Despite prior warnings about the perils of the Eiger the film crew suffered a number of accidents, including one fatality. Despite the danger, Eastwood insisted on doing <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> climbing and stunts. Upon release in May 1975 The Eiger Sanction was a commercial failure, receiving only $23.8million at the box office, and was poorly received by most critics. Joy Gould Boyum of the Wall Street Journal dismissed the film as [...] "brutal fantasy". Eastwood blamed Universal Studios for the film's poor promotion and turned his back on them to make an agreement with Warner Brothers, through Frank Wells, that has lasted to the present day.|$|E
500|$|Hope's playing was {{strongly}} {{based in the}} blues-influenced jazz tradition. He employed dissonant harmonies and spiky, contrasting lines and phrases. Rosenthal observed that Hope's playing {{on one of his}} compositions for the 1953 Donaldson–Brown recording illustrated [...] "many elements of the pianist's emerging style: somber, internally shifting chords in the introduction; punchy, twisting phrases in the solo; and the smoldering intensity that always characterized his best work." [...] Hope's sense of time meant that his note placement was unpredictable, falling at various points either side of the beat but not exactly on it. His use of keyboard dynamics was similarly flexible, as the listener could not predict when in a performance the level would change. The Billboard reviewer of Hope's final recordings, as reissued in 1996, wrote that [...] "he's dynamically smoother than Monk, with a spidery, spacy touch. His harmonic and compositional approach is intricate in design and almost eerie in execution." [...] Coda critic Stuart Broomer also commented on Hope's touch, suggesting that it was unusual and light, and created a combination of delicacy and boldness that was <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> Leonard Feather and Ira Gitler summarized Hope's abilities: he had [...] "a style that parallels Powell, [...] was a pianist and composer of rare harmonic acuity and very personal interpretation." ...|$|E

A desperate Tom turns to Mark for help in finding dirt on Ron, and Mark suggests Tom visit an out-of-town bar and speak to Ron's old friend Duke Silver. Tom visits the bar and learns Duke Silver is actually the [...] alter ego of Ron himself, who secretly plays saxophone in a jazz club.

500|$|Regarding the book's achievement, Shone remarks [...] "He {{now stands}} at year zero – creatively, psychologically." [...] However, typical {{features}} of Ellis' earlier works remain intact; for example, in its depictions of violence. Commenting on its self-referential aspects, Janelle Brown of the San Francisco Chronicle recommends [...] "for his next endeavor, Ellis should stop worrying and start looking for the exit of his own personal rabbit hole." [...] The Buffalo News awarded the novel its Editor's Choice. Jeff Simon comments that it [...] "brings an excessive Reaganesque flavor to Obama America". With regards to the novel's writing style, he comments [...] "The first-person sentences run on and on, but the individual sections of the book are nothing if not minimal... ghastly narcissism or not, Bret Easton Ellis has a fictional territory <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> and, heaven forbid, a mastery there." [...] The Wall Street Journal on the other hand, described this prose style as [...] "flat and fizzless". Such is the book's violent aesthetic that, for Eileen Battersby of The Irish Times, [...] "the book is closer to his remarkable third novel, American Psycho". She further compliments Ellis as [...] "a bizarrely moral writer who specializes in evoking the amoral." [...] Concerning his writing, she notes its [...] "despair is blunt, factual and seldom approaches the laconic unease of JG Ballard." ...|$|E
