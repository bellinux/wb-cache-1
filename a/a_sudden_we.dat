500|$|For {{the next}} two years, the band played {{throughout}} the Boston area. Eventually Godsmack's CD landed {{in the hands of}} Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station WAAF (FM). The radio station put [...] "Keep Away" [...] into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of [...] "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled [...] "Whatever", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM). In an interview Sully Erna stated, [...] "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> started moving over a thousand records a week. (...) I was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off".|$|E
2500|$|One {{event that}} {{affected}} `Abdu'l-Bahá greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment {{of his father}} when `Abdu'l-Bahá was eight years old; the imprisonment led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children. `Abdu'l-Bahá accompanied his mother to visit Bahá'u'lláh who was then imprisoned in the infamous subterranean dungeon the Síyáh-Chál. He described how [...] "I saw a dark, steep place. We entered a small, narrow doorway, and went down two steps, but beyond those one could see nothing. In {{the middle of the}} stairway, all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> heard His …voice: 'Do not bring him in here', and so they took me back".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Mushroom {{was eager}} {{to connect with the}} 'new wave' in England and brought over Peter Solley, an English {{producer}} and latter-day Procol Harum member, to produce another Mushroom artist, The Sports. One night Solley saw Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons perform, and on the strength of their new song, [...] "Shape I'm In", asked to produce the group. The first single, [...] "Hit and Run", from the album, Screaming Targets, was pop reggae and reached No.12 on the charts in August 1979. Camilleri said he [...] "never thought 'Hit and Run' would do anything but maybe the lick was infectious enough – though as a song it was a bit stupid – but it got us a deal all over the world. It was a wacky thing and all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> were away in a different arena".|$|E

6000|$|The morning after, {{as if by}} miracle, things righted {{themselves}} of <b>a</b> <b>sudden.</b> While <b>we</b> were wondering what it meant, Charles received a telegram from Sir Adolphus Cordery:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Not {{until we}} hear shots from them," [...] Charlie replied. [...] "We have but four charges left, {{and if the}} wolves made <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> rush, <b>we</b> might want to use them." ...|$|R
2500|$|All of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> had two Australian {{teams on}} one tour... I {{certainly}} felt excluded... At one stage in England I {{was waiting in}} a bar for my teammates to come downstairs, but because everyone was up the street with Packer, they never came... I was certainly disappointed to be left out. At that stage I think I had played nine Tests and was averaging 40 and you had {{other people who were}} barely Shield cricketers being called up by Packer. I didn't know the reasons why those guys were in it and I wasn't. That is always a question I will wonder about. I certainly kept being mates with Hookesy... It was a strange feeling. There were times when we were there to play for Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting about something else. There were times when there were arguments in the bar that got a lot louder than what they should have been.|$|E
2500|$|On November 8, 1992, {{the band}} {{recorded}} [...] "Beautiful Son," [...] "20 Years in the Dakota" [...] and [...] "Old Age" [...] during a recording session at Word of Mouth Recording in Seattle with producer Jack Endino. The three-song session was later released in April 1993 as Hole's fourth single on the City Slang label. On January 21, 1993, Love and Schemel recorded five demo songs at BMG Ariola Ltda. in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Produced by Craig Montgomery, the session was originally a demo session for Nirvana, who were recording material for their upcoming studio album, In Utero (1993). During breaks in Nirvana's session, Love and Schemel recorded {{a number of}} songs later featured on Live Through This, including [...] "Miss World," [...] "She Walks on Me," [...] "I Think That I Would Die" [...] and [...] "Softer, Softest." [...] The band relocated back to Los Angeles where they recruited former Janitor Joe bassist Kristen Pfaff in early 1993; Pfaff was also an accomplished cellist and music student. Erlandson said of Pfaff's membership: [...] "That's when we took off, all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> became a real band." [...] After a brief tour of the United Kingdom {{in the summer of}} 1993, the band sent a series of demos to the record label. [...] "When we got the Live Through This demos, I realized very quickly that Hole had gotten a new rhythm section," [...] said producer Sean Slade. [...] "It was much more musical." ...|$|E
60|$|Breakfast over, he and I were {{reclining}} in the main-top--where, {{by permission}} of my noble master, Jack Chase, I had invited him--when, of <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>we</b> heard a cannonading. It was our own ship.|$|E
60|$|Our {{journey was}} soon at an end; for, scaling <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> height, <b>we</b> came {{abruptly}} upon {{the place of}} our destination. I wish that it were possible to sketch in words this spot as vividly as I recollect it.|$|R
6000|$|... +Stanza 6,+ 1. 1. And like <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> meteor. <b>We</b> {{here have}} a fragmentary simile which may--or equally well may not--follow on as {{connected}} with St. 5. See on p. 147, for {{whatever it may}} be worth in illustration, the line relating to Coleridge:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How comes it," [...] inquired Will, {{when this}} process was going on, [...] "that you managed to escape and to bring a gun away with you? We would not have left the ship without you, but our own escape was <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> affair; <b>we</b> {{scarcely}} expected to accomplish {{it at the time}} we did. I suppose you had a sharp run for it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’All of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> see wot a cruel, ’ard {{thing it}} was to go and try and deceive a poor widder woman,’ ses Sam, in a ’usky voice; ’we both see it at once.’ ...|$|E
60|$|Then all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> did {{begin to}} talk; {{and not of}} those matters of which the well-bred {{naturally}} converse--the habits of the rarer kinds of ducks, and the careers of our College friends, but of something never mentioned in polite society.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> heard Jehan at the {{stairway}} wake, but a boy pushed past him, and stood before us, the hall rushes in his hair, all slubbered with sleep. [...] "My father! My father! I dreamed of treachery," [...] he cried, and babbled thickly.|$|E
60|$|So {{through an}} ill-timed skirmish, two severed heads, and a dead body, {{the rule of}} Brandeis came to <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> end. <b>We</b> shall see him a while longer {{fighting}} for existence in a losing battle; but his government--take it for all in all, the most promising that has ever been in these unlucky islands--was from that hour a piece of history.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a linear {{stability}} analysis of the flow in a circular pipe with <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> expansion. <b>We</b> consider both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid models and a thorough comparison is presented. The stability analysis is completed by an adjoint-based investigation on the sensitivity characteristics of perturbations. The results are discussed and compared, when it is possible, to those already published in the pertinent literature...|$|R
60|$|Halts {{were now}} more frequent, but I {{did not wish}} to speak to Dian until I could see from the {{expression}} of her face how she was receiving my apologies. At last a faint glow ahead forewarned us {{of the end of the}} tunnel, for which I for one was devoutly thankful. Then at <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> turn <b>we</b> emerged into the full light of the noonday sun.|$|R
60|$|So {{we passed}} the curtain, and stood upon the portico, looking at the garden misty with moonlight, and talking of this and that--about the Israelites, I think, who, as we heard, were {{wandering}} in the deserts of Sinai. Then of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> grew silent, both of us.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} one {{o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}} when we seemed to be quite close to the green flanks of Umpondwana, that of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> cut a wide spoor trampled by thousands of naked feet. Jan and Gaasha got off the waggon to examine it, but Ralph did not move.|$|E
60|$|A hedge, {{swinging}} sharp right, flanked the garden, {{and above}} it on a slope of daisy-dotted meadows {{we could see}} Lord Lundie's tiled and half-timbered summer farmhouse. Of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> heard voices behind the tree--the fine full tones of the unembarrassed English, speaking to their equals--that tore through the hedge like sleet through rafters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Winston, [...] "while I am {{prepared}} to act upon it, I would recommend it to others with some diffidence. No money can be made at present by farming, but I {{see no reason why}} we should not endeavor to cut our losses by selling forward down. If caught by <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> rally, <b>we</b> could fall back on the grain we hold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{he said to}} the midshipmen, [...] "I will redeem my promise. The {{frontier}} is only {{fifty miles}} distant. I will send on a man at once to ascertain some point at which there are boats {{on this side of the}} river. I will march at daylight with 150 picked men, and no fear but with <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> attack <b>we</b> shall break through the patrols." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Father. We will {{be ready}} {{tomorrow}} evening. We shall wait quietly for you until you come, unless <b>we</b> hear <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> alarm. If <b>we</b> do, we will go round behind the governor's house, and wait there for your coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I 'm not blind, my dear, {{neither is}} Tom, {{and when a}} young gentleman cuts a call {{abruptly}} short, and races after a young lady, and is seen holding her hand at the quietest corner of the park, and then goes travelling all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>we</b> {{know what it means}} if you don't." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{sat there}} silent {{and full of}} strange emotions, and expecting every moment the end to come. All of <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>we</b> both of us gave a great cry, and my lover leaped up so that our boat rocked violently and nearly capsized. For my part, I sat still, gazing, with {{distended}} eyes and parted lips, upon the strangest sight which I had ever seen.|$|E
60|$|We set sail, I say, from hence {{in seven}} days, and, finding the coast lie fairly on our {{starboard}} side, kept the land on board all the way, distance about three leagues; and it held us thus, {{about a hundred}} and twenty leagues due east, when on <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> {{lost sight of the}} land; whether it broke off, or whether it only drew off farther south, we could not tell.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} half an hour I came to <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> standstill, for <b>we</b> {{were within}} a few paces {{of half a dozen}} white men, as could be told even in the {{darkness}} by the outlines of their clothing.|$|R
6000|$|Twice have I {{written this}} letter from end to end. Twice have I torn it up, fearing lest those {{across the water}} should say that I had gone mad on <b>a</b> <b>sudden.</b> Now <b>we</b> will begin {{for the third time}} quite solemnly and soberly. I have been through the Yellowstone National Park in a buggy, in the company of an adventurous old lady from Chicago and her husband, who disapproved of scenery as being [...] "ongodly." [...] I fancy it scared them.|$|R
6000|$|... "The door {{must come}} down," [...] he answered, and, {{springing}} against it, he put all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, {{but did not}} yield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, {{and this time it}} gave way with <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> snap, and <b>we</b> found ourselves within Bartholomew Sholto's chamber.|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither did we till lately. We've {{been reading}} Scott's novels, {{and all of}} <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> remembered that our {{grandfather}} was a Scotchman. So we hunted up the old stories, got a bagpipe, put on our plaids, and went in, heart and soul, for {{the glory of the}} Clan. We've been at it some time now, and it's great fun. Our people like it, and I think we are a pretty canny set." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{soldiers}} were moving {{on in the}} direction of the old Battery, and we were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>we</b> all stopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but it was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised together,--if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.|$|E
6000|$|My man Friday had {{delivered}} our guide, {{and when we}} {{came up to him}} he was helping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt and frightened, when on <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>we</b> espied the bear come out of the wood; and a monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We were all a little surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, {{it was easy to see}} joy and courage in the fellow’s countenance. “O! O! O!” says Friday, three times, pointing to him; “O master, you give me te leave, me shakee te hand with him; me makee you good laugh.” ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of sudden stops on output growth and export and import responses. First, we define and identify <b>sudden</b> stops. <b>We</b> show that <b>sudden</b> stops are fairly common since the late 70 s. Then, by looking at this large pool of country experiences we study how openness, liability dollarization and the choice of exchange rate regime shape the aftermath of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> stop. <b>We</b> find that openness and flexible rates contribute to a better output recovery, while liability dollarization worsens such recovery. We also find that open countries adjust the current account through higher export growth and less import contraction while the opposite holds for countries with large liability dollarization. These stylized facts allow {{to think about what}} may help an economy prepare for <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> stop, in contrast with the traditional policy recommendations that concentrated on preventing such events. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{observations of}} a novel hysteresis behavior {{in the growth of}} ice crystals under near-vacuum conditions. Above a threshold supersaturation, we find that the ice growth rate often exhibits <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> increase that <b>we</b> attribute to an impurity-driven growth instability. We examine possible mechanisms for this instability, which can be used to produce clean, faceted ice surfaces. ...|$|R
5000|$|All of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> at 8:46… <b>we</b> hear 'BOOM!' An {{explosion}} {{so powerful}} and {{so loud that}} push us upward in the air coming from below! It was so powerful that all the walls cracked, the false ceiling fell on top of us, the fire sprinkler system got activated and everybody started screaming in horror: 'HELP! HELP! HELP!' ...|$|R
