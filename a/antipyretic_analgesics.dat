40|$|Analgesic {{nephropathy}} is {{a unique}} drug-induced kidney disease. It is characterized by renal papillary necrosis and interstitial nephritis resulting from prolonged excessive consumption of combination <b>antipyretic</b> <b>analgesics.</b> <b>Antipyretic</b> <b>analgesics</b> {{have been used in}} clinical medicine since the late nineteenth century. Buss introduced sodium salicylate in 1895, Dresser introduced aspirin in 1897, phenacetin in 1887, and Von Merring introduced paracetamol (acetaminophen) in 1893 [1]. These drugs have found widespread use as everyday remedies in almost every country in the world.

40|$|<b>Antipyretic</b> <b>analgesics</b> {{are among}} the most often used {{medications}} worldwide. Their major mechanism of action is the blockade of synthesis of prostanoids. These are lipid mediators, which are produced from arachidonic acid in response to tissue damage and inflammation. Constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and inducible COX- 2 produce the prostaglandin precursors prostaglandin G 2 and prostaglandin H 2 from arachidonic acid. These precursors are subsequently converted into the different biologically active prostaglandins and thromboxane. Among these, prostaglandin E 2 is probably the most important one for pain sensitization. It facilitates nociception not only in the peripheral inflamed tissue but also at central sites, namely the spinal cord dorsal horn. Antipyretic analgesic should therefore no longer be considered as ‘(solely) peripherally acting analgesics’. They are classified according to their physiochemical properties, clinical actions, and pharmacodynamic selectivity. Acidic <b>antipyretic</b> <b>analgesics</b> (NSAIDs) are potent and efficient inhibitors of the two cyclooxygenases, and exert, in addition to their analgesic and antipyretic effect, a profound anti-inflammatory action. Most of their unwanted effects including their gastrointestinal toxicity are also due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Classical non-acidic antipyretic analgesics—for example, paracetamol (acetaminophen) — are relatively poor inhibitors of cyclooxygenases. They are analgesic and antipyretic, but lack significant anti-inflammatory properties. Because the inducible cyclooxygenase isoform COX- 2 produces most of the prostaglandins triggering inflammation and nociceptive sensitization, selective COX- 2 inhibitors have been developed as analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Like classical NSAIDs these ‘coxibs’ are antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory, but show significantly reduced gastrointestinal toxicity compared to classical NSAIDs. As we learn more about the molecular mechanisms of the pronociceptive action of prostaglandins new therapeutic strategies may arise at the horizon. Future developments may include inhibitors of specific prostaglandin synthases and of prostaglandin receptor antagonists...|$|E

40|$|Addiction {{and abuse}} of <b>antipyretic</b> <b>analgesics</b> has been {{recognized}} early {{after the turn of}} this century. The incidence markedly increased and the syndrome spread over many countries {{in the first half of}} the 20 th century. The syndrome and its pathology, consisting of renal papillary necrosis and tubulo-interstitial nephritis, was first described in the medical literature in the early 1950 's in Switzerland by Spühler and Zollinger, who rightly suspected chronic analgesic (Saridon) intoxication as being the cause in their cases. Clinically the disease is characterized by slowly progressive renal failure with renal colics from passage of necrotic papillae. Death from uremia is common unless dialyzed. The disease has been particularly prevalent in certain areas of Australia, Belgium, Western Germany, in Switzerland and some other countries. The nephrotoxic agents are mixtures of salicylates (aspirin) with phenacetin or acetaminophen. The principal nephrotoxic compound is probably aspirin [...] the aminophenol derivatives increasing its nephrotoxicity. However, all these components alone may cause [...] exceptionally [...] the syndrome. Rarely some newer, nonsteroid analgesics (NSAID's) can also be nephrotoxic. Phenacetin has [...] in particular in compound mixtures [...] mood-altering (euphoric) properties, giving rise to craving, addiction and chronic abuse. Addiction has been greatly facilitated by the over-the-counter availability of these cheap analgesic mixtures. Mass addiction [...] and abuse [...] may occur in all kinds of communities, in factories or families because of the euphoric effect, taking away fatigue and weariness and increasing productivity. There is a relation between the per capita consumption of <b>antipyretic</b> <b>analgesics</b> and analgesic nephropathy in several countries and in certain districts. The pattern of sales and mass consumption (and the incidence of nephropathy) is substantially promoted by the local presence of production facilities, usually accompanied by vigorous sales and advertising policies. Individual addiction usually occurs in psychoneurotic females often with social and marital problems and mental instability, often with long histories of headaches, backpains, and other, often psychogenic disorders. Analgesic nephropathy is often complicated by anemia, peptic ulcer, premature aging and atherosclerosis and in 8 - 10 % by uro-epithelial carcinoma (the so called analgesic syndrome). The diagnosis depends largely on the history of chronic abuse of analgesics, which is often doggedly denied, hampering the diagnosis.

We constructed a drug information database for prescriptions issued by 5 hospitals with over 300 beds in Okinawa (Okinawa Hokubu Hospital, Okinawa Chubu Hospital, Urasoe General Hospital, University of the Ryukyus Hospital and Okinawa Kyodo Hospital). A total of 16, 250 prescriptions was issued by the 5 hospitals from June 1 to 7, 1999 and among them 999 (6. 1 %) were for hypolipidemic drugs. Hypolipidemic drugs comprised the highest proportion of prescriptions in the 65 - 74 years age group and in the 45 - 84 years age group they accounted for 92. 9 % of the total. By chemical structure, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were prescribed the most among hypolipidemic drugs and nicotinic acid derivatives came second, followed by fibrates and probucol.

40|$|<b>Antipyretic</b> <b>analgesics,</b> {{taken in}} large doses over a {{prolonged}} period, cause a specific form of kidney disease, characterized by papillary necrosis and interstitial scarring. Epidemiological evidence incriminated mixtures of drugs including aspirin (ASA), phenacetin, and caffeine. The mechanism of toxicity is unclear. We tested {{the effects of}} ASA, acetaminophen (APAF, the active metabolite of phenacetin), caffeine, and other related drugs individually and in combination on mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells (mIMCD 3). The number of rapidly proliferating cells was reduced by ≈ 50 % by 0. 5 mM ASA, salicylic acid, or APAF. The drugs had less effect on confluent cells, which proliferate slowly. Thus, the slow in vivo turnover of IMCD cells could explain why clinical toxicity requires very high doses of these drugs over a very long period. Caffeine greatly potentiated the effect of acetaminophen, pointing to a potential danger of the mixture. Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, indomethacin and NS- 398, did not reduce cell number except at concentrations greatly in excess of those that inhibit COX. Therefore, COX inhibition alone is not toxic. APAF arrests most cells in late G 1 and S and produces a mixed form of cell death with both oncosis (swollen cells and nuclei) and apoptosis. APAF is known to inhibit the synthesis of DNA and cause chromosomal aberrations due to inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Such effects of APAF might account for renal medullary cell death in vivo and development of uroepithelial tumors from surviving cells that have chromosomal aberrations...|$|E

However, no cytokines associated with LMIA have been identified to date. Because CXCL 8 {{played an important role in}} neutrophil infiltration and activation, we performed the LMT and measured CXCL 8 levels in patients with hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics (beta-lactams) and <b>antipyretic</b> <b>analgesics</b> (APAs) and investigated the pathogenic mechanism of hypersensitivity to these drugs. MethodsThe LMT was performed according to an improved version of the agarose plate method and CXCL 8 levels in the reacted solution that had been stored as described were measured using a solid-phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ResultsMigration index (MI) values for the LMT were 77. 7 ± 11. 7 for patients with hypersensitivity to beta- lactams and 83. 6 ± 1. 9 for those with hypersensitivity to APAs. The CXCL 8 concentrations were significantly higher in patients after beta-lactams administration (175. 9 ± 71. 2 ng/mL) than those without beta-lactams administration (48. 3 ± 34. 9 ng/mL). The CXCL 8 concentrations were significantly lower in patients after APAs administration (41. 7 ± 24. 3 ng/mL) than those without APAs administration (63. 1 ± 30. 2 ng/mL). ConclusionsIncreased CXCL 8 levels produced by beta-lactams administration were accompanied by LMIA. CXCL 8 may be involved in LMIA and play a role in beta-lactam allergies. In contrast, the LMIA detected in patients with allergies to APAs may be a cytokine or chemokine other than CXCL 8...|$|E
40|$|Background. A recent {{large-scale}} {{case-control study}} on analgesic nephropathy (SAN) [1] found no {{increased risk of}} end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in users of combined or single formulations of phenacetin-free analgesics. In a subgroup of 22 high users, however, a dose-dependent increased risk was found, which raised the question if these patients presented or not with analgesic nephropathy (AN). Methods. The individual questionnaires of this subgroup of high users were reviewed, and the total lifetime intake {{of different types of}} analgesics was calculated. For evidence of AN, the following data were considered: (1) the amount and type of analgesics consumed, (2) the cause of ESRD, as diagnosed by the nephrologist in charge of the patient and (3) renal imaging and other relevant laboratory data. Results. This group of ESRD patients consumed on average 7. 8 kg of <b>antipyretic</b> <b>analgesics</b> (range 30. 8 - 2. 7 kg) over an average of 21. 5 years (range 35 - 6 years). Single analgesics were exclusively used by 12 patients (54. 5 %) and combined analgesics by 5 patients (22. 7 %), while 5 patients used both. None of the patients was diagnosed as having AN, and a review of the questionnaires did not disclose evidence suggestive of AN. The possibility that, irrespective of AN, the analgesic (ab) use contributed to the progression of existing renal diseases cannot be answered in the absence of well-defined criteria. The data supporting the existence of such an analgesic-associated nephropathy (AAN) are, however, not consistent and most likely due to confounding by indication. Conclusion. In a group of ESRD patients with high use of non-phenacetin analgesics, no evidence of AN was found. There is no evidence that (ab) use of analgesics or NSAIDs other than phenacetin leads to a pathologically or clinically defined renal disease that could be named AN or AA...|$|E

The current study was thus aimed at evaluating <b>antipyretic,</b> <b>analgesic</b> and anti-inflammatory activities of the methanolic extract of whole plant of V. betonicifolia (VBME). Methods VBME was employed to assess antipyretic activity in yeast induced hyperthermia. Analgesic profile was ascertained in acetic acid induced writhing, hot plat and tail immersion test. Nevertheless, the anti-inflammatory activity was tested in carrageenan induced paw edema and histamine induced inflammatory tests. BALB/c mice were used at test doses of 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight intra peritoneally (i. p). Results In yeast induced pyrexia, VBME demonstrated dose dependently (78. 23 %) protection at 300 mg/kg, similar to standard drug, paracetamol (90 %) at 150 mg/kg i. p. VBME showed a dose dependent analgesia in various pain models i. e. acetic acid, hot plat and tail immersion having 78. 90 %, 69. 96 % and 68. 58 % protection respectively at 300 mg/kg. However, the analgesic action of VBME was completely antagonized by the injection of naloxone like opiate antagonists. Similarly carrageenan and histamine induces inflammation was significantly antagonized by VBME, 66. 30 % and 60. 80 % respectively at 300 mg/kg.
