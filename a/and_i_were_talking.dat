5|$|Globocnik <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about Operation Reinhard, {{which was}} in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E

"As you know, Dan, you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about {{missile defense}} before {{you set up}} High Frontier in September of '81...You and {{a small group of}} dedicated, {{determined}} people helped us move the SDI concept over all the roadblocks put up by people of less vision and belief in American capacity. God bless you!"—President Ronald Reagan, March 1993 ...|$|E
2500|$|In another interview, Amos explained, [...] " [...] {{said to me}} in March when I {{was visiting}} him in New York, 'I’ve {{always wanted to know}} what you would do with a {{seasonal}} album. You’re a minister’s daughter so you grew up with this stuff, but you’re also a feminist.' A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be a}} place where goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity. And he said, 'I’d really like to see you have a perspective on the carols and write some of your own.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{jumped to}} her feet. [...] "Poff," [...] she said, [...] "I {{want to go}} and see the evening primroses pop. You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> nonsense. THEY don't have ideas anyhow. They just pop--as God meant them to do. What stupid things we human beings are!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear, {{you need}} not nod and wink at me!" [...] cries Hetty. [...] "Mamma asked Harry on purpose to enliven us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> until he begins, just like the fiddles at the playhouse, you know, Theo! First the fiddles. Then the play. Pray begin, Harry!" ...|$|R
60|$|An {{hour later}} the Princess Userti {{broke into the}} room of his palace where the Prince <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lord George <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> of {{you last}} night,' said Gashford, after a pause. 'He says {{you are a}} very earnest fellow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{night when}} Jem <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> things over in Rainbow Valley, I {{asked him if}} he had ever felt afraid at the front.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I learn. She's a holy of holies. But I {{promised to}} say nothing further about her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> haven't. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about your Speaker of the House of Commons." ...|$|R
2500|$|Soon after, Folds {{moved back}} to North Carolina. The trio, of Folds, bassist Robert Sledge and drummer Darren Jessee, formed Ben Folds Five in 1994 in Chapel Hill. As Folds put it, [...] "Jeff Buckley was being signed at that time by Columbia <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to Steve, his A guy, and somehow we knew the same people or something." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> of books, <b>I</b> {{must tell}} of Jack Blunt the sailor, and his Dream Book.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] said Mrs. Cadwallader, {{with a sharp}} note of surprise. [...] "It {{is hardly}} a {{fortnight}} since you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She said: [...] "Mr. Redfield <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> of 'the war' to-day--I mean our 'cattle-man's invasion'--and I {{learned that}} you were the {{sergeant}} who came for the prisoners." ...|$|E
60|$|While {{my mother}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> {{in a low}} tone about Nicholas, I could not avoid hearing parts of a {{conversation}} between my sister and Ivanka that surprised me much.|$|E
6000|$|... "When me and Strong {{was down}} at the grand stand after the race, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to Leggat minor, who was there with his {{governor}}, I saw Pa look as savage as a bear. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> say, Ma, Leggat minor {{told me that he}} heard his governor say that Pa had lost seven thousand backing the favourite. I'll never back the favourite when I'm of age. No, no--hang me if I do: leave me alone, Strong, will you?" ...|$|R
50|$|I {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that all of the discussion of standardisation of language was a discussion of the written forms of language. It had nothing to do with spoken language. We don't have the spoken language standardised yet. When we say that we're speaking Standard English, what we're doing is transferring into our spoken vocabulary and syntax the elements of the written language. What is standard in what you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> now <b>is</b> what we get from our writing.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to Montenegro's vote for independence, Drašković {{called for a}} restoration of Serbia's monarchy: [...] "This is an historic moment for Serbia itself, a beginning which {{would be based on}} the historically-proven and victorious pillars of the Serbian state <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> about the pillars of a kingdom." [...] After the breakup with Montenegro in June 2006, Drašković served (until May 2007) as the foreign minister of the Republic of Serbia, a successor to the state union of Serbia-Montenegro.|$|R
6000|$|... "Armley <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> {{about this}} after noon's decision," [...] he continued. [...] "There {{will be no}} secret about it to-morrow. It has been decided to carry out our autumn manoeuvred as usual in South em waters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Helen <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> this afternoon, Mr. Lessingham," [...] she said, [...] "of {{the days}} when you and Dick were both in the Magdalen Eleven and both had just a chance of being chosen for the Varsity. You never played, did you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Dixon {{shook his}} head. [...] "Greatest bunch I ever looked at. But I think they resented our presence. Pat <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about them. It's strange, Dorn, but I believe these Blue Devils that have saved France and England, and perhaps America, too, don't like our being here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't keep us in suspense, my dear fellow!" [...] Mr. Parker implored. [...] "What {{has gone}} wrong? Eve <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> just--just <b>talking</b> over your {{delightful}} party." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What dream? Why, {{the dream}} that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in Arthur's court--a person who never existed; <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> to you, who {{are nothing but}} a work of the imagination." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad that}} you came this afternoon," [...] Rachael continued. [...] "Bertrand <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>talking.</b> We think it well {{that you should be}} married very soon." ...|$|R
60|$|Basil Grant <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> {{one day in}} what {{is perhaps}} the most perfect place for talking on earth--the top of a tolerably deserted tramcar. To talk {{on the top of a}} hill is superb, but to talk on the top of a flying hill is a fairy tale.|$|E
6000|$|... "If we ever part, again, {{until one}} or both go into dock, it will be your fault, my old friend. If I have thought of you once, since we parted, I have dreamed of you fifty times! Talcott <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> {{of you in the}} late gale, and {{wondering}} what sail you would advise us to put the ship under." ...|$|E
6000|$|I retired {{early that}} night, and, being young, forgot my perplexities in heavy slumber. The next morning I noticed that Alice's eyes seemed heavy, and I {{wondered}} {{what could be}} the reason. In after years I mentioned it when Grace <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about old times together, but she only smiled gravely, and said, [...] "I sometimes think your cousin was too good for this world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it was madness!" [...] he exclaimed, angrily. [...] "There are spies everywhere. Your brother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> overheard <b>talking</b> {{together}} {{at this very}} place. <b>I</b> may <b>be</b> arrested at any moment." ...|$|R
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for La Bella Mafia {{began in the}} spring of 2002. In April 2002, Lil' Kim stated in an interview that she had begun working with Dr. Dre in the recording studio. She told MTV, [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Dre a lot. <b>And</b> Dre <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about possibly doing some collaborations. He's a cool cat. I love Dre. Our chemistry in the studio was just like, cool. We've been working, you know, trying to cook up some things". Kim also stated that she wanted to work with Eminem, Timbaland, and The Neptunes.|$|R
2500|$|Asked by Wolf Blitzer if {{he would}} ever support the efforts of Dennis Kucinich to cut funding for the war, Webb said, [...] "I – you know, I lived through Vietnam. I lived through it as a Marine <b>and</b> <b>I</b> know that those sorts of approaches, while they seem {{attractive}} on one level are really not that realistic. What {{we want to do}} – <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> with a number of senators today – is to try to get some of these so-called emergency legislation packages back into the committee process so that the committees can actually play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was at Mr. Creakle's, my son tells me, {{that you}} first became acquainted,' said Mrs. Steerforth, as she <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> at one table, while they played backgammon at another. 'Indeed, I {{recollect}} his speaking, at that time, of a pupil younger than himself {{who had taken}} his fancy there; but your name, as you may suppose, has not lived in my memory.' ...|$|E
60|$|While William <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking,</b> {{the poor}} Dutchmen were openly {{condemned}} to die, {{as it may}} be called, by the whole ship's company; and so warm were the men upon it, that they grew very clamorous; and when they heard that William was against it, some of them swore they should die, and if William opposed it, he should drown along with them.|$|E
6000|$|... “Just so,” {{said the}} other meaningly. “You know that all my people like you very much, though they hold various {{opinions}} as to your discretion. Only the other day Jane, you know my married sister, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about you. She was extremely distressed. I assured her that you must be very far away or very deeply buried somewhere not to have given a sign of life under this provocation.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the show's origin, Scott Yancey said: [...] "I'm {{from the}} Hollywood area originally, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> with some buddies {{who are in}} the industry. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> telling them how I had to pull my Glock out on some {{homeless}} guys who came at me with needles in one of the houses that was all boarded up. They're like, 'Man, you need your own reality show. We'll make it like a commercial for your website or something.' So I paid their expenses, and they gave it to another friend of ours, who gave it to a guy who worked at Lionsgate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{very glad}} that you have won if it makes any {{difference}} to you, Cuthbert. Now {{you know you have}} to lie very still, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>talking</b> <b>is</b> very bad for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That instant,' said Ralph. 'I {{was coming}} to call for you, making sure to catch you before you left; but your mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> over family affairs, and the time has slipped away so rapidly--' ...|$|R
