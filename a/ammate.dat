For third and sixth grade and college students, the subject nouns elected were more human and <b>ammate</b> than object nouns, linguistic selectlonal rules correctly predicted relative animacy, humanness, and informational uncertainty for each function, and subject-object interacted on all these properties with active-passive. Distributions obtained from adults contained more inam-mate nouns (where permissible), more informational uncertainty, and had smaller lnter-sections with each other than complementary distributions obtained from children. A general conclusion of recent reviews of work m developmental psycholinguistics (e. g., McCarthy, 1954; McNeill, 1970) is that the grammar of English is largely acqmred by children before age five. Vocabulary size, however, continues to grow at a substantial rate throughout the usual school years (Dolch, 1927), and some lexical growth is probably maintained throughout hfe (Raegel, 1965). As the child's lexicon expands, it also seems to become further differentiated and generalized (Riegel, Riegel, Quarterman & Smith, 1968; Anglin, 1970).
