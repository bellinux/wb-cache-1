25|$|From their {{earliest}} days both Fulmer and Yarsley Testing Laboratories had {{carried out a}} wide variety of tests for clients and had designed and constructed specialized test equipment. In 1982 both Fulmer Technical Services and Yarsley Technical Centre were awarded accreditation from the National Testing Laboratory <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Scheme</b> (NATLAS).|$|E
25|$|Started in 1997, Cask Marque is a {{voluntary}} <b>accreditation</b> <b>scheme</b> that allows publicans {{to display a}} special symbol indicating that their cask ale is of good quality, as judged {{by a series of}} surprise inspections. In 2016 there were 45 qualified assessors who make over 20,000 visits to pubs each year.|$|E

25|$|The use of ECT in the UK has {{continued}} to fall, from about 23,000 courses in 1986 to about 11,000 in 2002. There is still marked variation in use, both in prescribing and in standards of administration. The Royal College of Psychiatrists produced three more sets of guidelines, and carried out two more surveys. The National Health Service produced guidelines on ECT use in 2003 and the following year the Royal College of Psychiatrists set up a voluntary <b>accreditation</b> <b>scheme</b> for ECT clinics.|$|E
25|$|As {{the quality}} of health care has {{increasingly}} become an issue around the world, hospitals have increasingly had to pay serious attention to this matter. Independent external assessment of quality {{is one of the}} most powerful ways to assess this aspect of health care, and hospital accreditation is one means by which this is achieved. In many parts of the world such accreditation is sourced from other countries, a phenomenon known as international healthcare accreditation, by groups such as Accreditation Canada from Canada, the Joint Commission from the USA, the Trent <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Scheme</b> from Great Britain, and Haute Authorité de santé (HAS) from France.|$|E
25|$|Tyson {{worked as}} a cricket coach in Melbourne and was the captain-coach of University of Melbourne Cricket Club. He also played for Todmorden Cricket Club in the Lancashire League in 1961, the Prime Ministers XI in 1963–64, International Cavaliers in 1968, Old England vs Old Australia in 1980 and Footscray Cricket Club. He was {{recruited}} as the Director of Coaching for the Victorian Cricket Association, taking them to two Sheffield Shield victories, and helped establish the Australian National <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Scheme</b> in 1974. From 1990 to 2008 he travelled to India to teach the coaches at the National Cricket Academy and Mumbai Cricket Association and coached the Sri Lankan national cricket team for the World Cup.|$|E

50|$|In the USA in {{the early}} 20th century, there was concern over how to best create an {{appropriate}} environment in which clinicians could work. Standards to improve {{the control of the}} hospital environment were thus generated, and these subsequently grew into <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> with the remit to facilitate and improve organisational development. Part of the process is not only about assessing quality, but also about promoting and improving quality. Similar <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> were soon developed elsewhere in the world.|$|R
50|$|The {{scheme is}} {{different}} from most official <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> in being managed through peer review, rather than through a top-down agency. Direct community engagement is considered essential to the scheme’s success.|$|R
25|$|The {{guidance}} {{received a}} mixed reception. It was welcomed by {{an editorial in}} the British Medical Journal but the Royal College of Psychiatrists launched an unsuccessful appeal. The NICE guidance, as the British Medical Journal editorial points out, is only a policy statement and psychiatrists may deviate from it if they see fit. Adherence to standards has not been universal in the past. A survey of ECT use in 1980 found {{that more than half of}} ECT clinics failed to meet minimum standards set by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, with a later survey in 1998 finding that minimum standards were largely adhered to, but that two-thirds of clinics still fell short of current guidelines, particularly in the training and supervision of junior doctors involved in the procedure. A voluntary <b>accreditation</b> <b>scheme,</b> ECTAS, was set up in 2004 by the Royal College, but as of 2006 only a minority of ECT clinics in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have signed up.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> also {{undertake}} international healthcare accreditation {{work outside}} of their base country. One of {{the large number of}} <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> in the United States, the Joint Commission (TJC) currently being the best known, has created Joint Commission International, or JCI. In recent years, DNV have been challenging TJC in the USA. Accreditation Canada accredited its first organization internationally in 1967 in Bermuda http://www.internationalaccreditation.ca/aboutus/history.aspx. In 2010, Accreditation Canada International (ACI http://www.internationalaccreditation.ca) is created to provide accreditation to hospitals, clinics, primary care centers and health systems. Acreditas Global http://www.aaahc.org/international/ (formerly AAAHC International) is present in Peru since 2012 and Costa Rica.|$|R
25|$|The {{different}} international healthcare <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> vary in quality, size, cost, {{intent and}} {{the skill and}} intensity of their marketing. They also vary in terms of cost to hospitals and healthcare institutions making use of them.|$|R
2500|$|Further {{guidelines}} {{appeared in}} 1995, followed by yet another survey with similar results. There were still {{problems with the}} training and supervision of doctors administering ECT; only [...] a quarter of clinics were rated as good and two-thirds {{failed to meet the}} most recent standards. [...] In 2004 the Royal College of Psychiatrists set up a voluntary <b>accreditation</b> <b>scheme</b> for ECT clinics. Two years on, only a minority of clinics in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland had signed up.|$|E
2500|$|Minor cricket matches {{will often}} have trained umpires. The {{independent}} Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers (ACU), formed in 1955, used to conduct umpire training within the UK. It however merged {{to form the}} ECB Association of Cricket Officials (ECB ACO) on 1 January 2008. A new structure of cricket umpiring and scoring qualifications has now been put into place and the ACO provides training and examinations for these. Cricket Australia has introduced a two-tier <b>accreditation</b> <b>scheme</b> and eventually all umpires {{will be required to}} achieve the appropriate level of accreditation. [...] The ages of umpires can vary enormously as some are former players, while others enter the cricketing world as umpires.|$|E
2500|$|A {{candidate}} for {{training as a}} professional diving supervisor is generally selected from the divers employed by a contractor, as a competent diver of the class for {{which he or she}} will be trained to supervise, and a reliable person, suitable for taking the responsibility for {{the health and safety of}} the diving team and capable of managing the logistics of a diving operation. Training as a diving supervisor is generally carried out by commercial diver training schools, which are usually registered as training providers by a national or international quality assurance body or government department, such as the Australian Diver <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Scheme</b> (ADAS) in Australia, the Association of Diving Contractors - UK (UK ADC) in the UK and the Department of Labour in South Africa. The International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) also registers diving supervisors for offshore work.|$|E
50|$|In the USA, {{insurers}} {{will often}} only {{make use of}} health care providers that are independently surveyed by a recognized quality assurance program, such as being accredited by <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> such as the Joint Commission and the American Accreditation Healthcare Commission.|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> vary in approach, quality, size, intent, sourcing of surveyors and {{the skill}} of their marketing. They also vary {{in terms of how}} much they charge hospitals and healthcare institutions for their services. They all have web sites.|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{individuals}} seeking {{recognition of}} their professional standing within the Australian tourism industry had but one option, membership of the Australian Institute of Travel and Tourism. More recently, employer bodies in several tourism industry sectors, namely, retail travel, meetings and inbound, have acted to develop individual <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> designed to confer a level of professional standing upon individuals working in their respective sectors. This paper begins with {{an overview of the}} individual tourism-related <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> currently operating in Australia and then moves on to discuss the forces that have led to their development. Following on from this discussion, the operational difficulties that these programmes have encountered are examined along with their respective future outlooks. It is argued that {{there appears to be a}} certain consistency in the problems faced by existing programmes and that these difficulties place a question mark over the longer-term viability of at least some of these schemes. These difficulties, it is suggested, parallel many of the problems being faced by organisation-based <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> in the tourism industry. In the final part of this paper, some suggestions are made as to how these problems might be addressed...|$|R
2500|$|It {{is fairly}} common for a {{national}} standard for commercial diver training and registration to apply within a country. These standards may be set by national government departments and empowered by national legislation, for example, {{in the case of}} the United Kingdom, where the standards are set by the Health and Safety Executive, and South Africa where they are published by the Department of Labour. Many national training standards and the associated diver registrations are recognised internationally among the countries which are members of the International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum (IDRCF). A similar arrangement exists for State legislated standards, as in the case of Canada and Australia. Registration of professional divers trained to these standards may be directly administered by government, as in the case of South Africa, where diver registration is done by the Department of Labour, or by an approved external agent, as {{in the case of the}} Australian Diver <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Scheme</b> (ADAS) ...|$|E

50|$|Worldwide, the {{certificate}} authority business is fragmented, with national or regional providers dominating their home market. This is because many uses of digital certificates, such as for legally binding digital signatures, {{are linked to}} local law, regulations, and <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> for certificate authorities.|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> vary in quality, size, {{intent and}} {{the skill of}} their marketing.

50|$|Hospitals and {{healthcare}} services are vital components of any well-ordered and humane society, and will indisputably be {{the recipients of}} societal resources. That hospitals should be places of safety, not only for patients {{but also for the}} staff and for the general public, is of the greatest importance. Quality of hospitals {{and healthcare}} services is also of great interest to many other bodies, including governments, NGOs targeting healthcare and social welfare, professional organisations representing doctors, patient organisations, shareholders of companies providing healthcare services, etc. However, <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> are {{not the same thing as}} government-controlled initiatives set up to assess healthcare providers with only governmental objectives in mind - ideally, the functioning and finance of hospital <b>accreditation</b> <b>schemes</b> should be independent of governmental control.|$|R
