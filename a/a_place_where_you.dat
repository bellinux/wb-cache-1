5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It is <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E

500|$|In 1987, Daniel Amos vocalist Terry Scott Taylor {{recorded}} what Trouser Press admired as a [...] "first-rate cover" [...] of [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] for his album A Briefing for the Ascent. Conversely, Sean Carruthers of AllMusic considers singer Tom Hooper's 2002 {{cover to}} be a version that [...] "manages {{to drain the}} life" [...] out of the composition. Elliott Smith included [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] in his live performances. His biographer Benjamin Nugent writes that the song appealed to Smith amid his struggles with depression and drug addiction, as [...] "a ballad about {{trying to get rid}} of self-imposed suffering and returning to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> can relate to other people".|$|E

500|$|While at Makerere, Achebe {{was asked}} to read a novel written by a student (James Ngugi, later known as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o) called Weep Not, Child. Impressed, he sent it to Alan Hill at Heinemann, which {{published}} it two years later to coincide with its paperback line of books from African writers. Hill indicated this was to remedy a situation where British publishers [...] "regarded West Africa only as <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> sold books." [...] Achebe was chosen to be General Editor of the African Writers Series, which became a significant force in bringing postcolonial literature from Africa {{to the rest of}} the world, and he continued in that role until 1972.|$|E
500|$|Obsidian drew {{on older}} {{computer}} RPGs for inspiration on the storyline and gameplay, like Fallout and the Ultima series. Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said [...] "We've {{been thinking about}} a lot of older RPGs, and we have this feeling that something has been lost with recent RPGs." [...] He compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to Baldur's Gate II, stating that he wanted to expand upon the city of Neverwinter as Baldur's Gate II had done with its setting, Athkatla. [...] "We're looking at how to make Neverwinter a really intriguing place to be, and make it <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> go and come back to and go and come back to and have it really be a center for the game," [...] Urquhart said. The game's story, while still revolving around the city of Neverwinter, would be unrelated to Neverwinter Nights. Instead of starting the game as a powerful, important character, players would begin Neverwinter Nights 2 as nobodies. Obsidian wanted realism in the game and concrete consequences for the player's actions. The story would be centered on the player character, who would have to gradually earn the respect of Lord Nasher and the city of Neverwinter.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reference}} {{points for the}} lyrics of The Scream were J. G. Ballard and William Burroughs. In a track such as [...] "Suburban Relapse", the band wrote about suburbia, where they were born and raised. Steven Severin emphasized: [...] "That's why J.G. Ballard resonated so much with us, because all his near-future tales were set in this bizarre suburban wasteland. Suburbia is <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> can imagine any kind of possibility, because there's space, not urban clutter".|$|E

His maternal grandmother was a Pequot, and he was also of Basque and Irish descent. As he put it, [...] "A little of this and a little of that; a real street dog." [...] DeVille said about Stamford, [...] "It was post-industrial. Everybody worked in factories, you know. Not me. I wouldn't have that. People from Stamford don't get too far. That's <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> die." [...] DeVille said about his youthful musical tastes, [...] "I still remember listening to groups like the Drifters. It was like magic, there was drama, and it would hypnotise me." ...|$|E

The barn is very customisable through the Gopher Underground Shop, a shop mentioned {{in an early}} Chapter 1 mission that is located just outside the main area.
