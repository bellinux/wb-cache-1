25|$|In CT, an X-ray tube {{opposite}} an X-ray detector (or detectors) in a ring-shaped apparatus rotate {{around a}} patient, producing a computer-generated cross-sectional image (tomogram). CT is {{acquired in the}} <b>axial</b> <b>plane,</b> with coronal and sagittal images produced by computer reconstruction. Radiocontrast agents are often used with CT for enhanced delineation of anatomy. Although radiographs provide higher spatial resolution, CT can detect more subtle variations in attenuation of X-rays (higher contrast resolution). CT exposes the patient to significantly more ionizing radiation than a radiograph.|$|E

25|$|The {{hinge points}} along an entire folded surface form a hinge line, {{which can be}} either a crest line or a trough line. The trend and plunge of a linear hinge line gives you {{information}} about {{the orientation of the}} fold. To more completely describe the orientation of a fold, one must describe the axial surface. The axial surface is the surface defined by connecting all the hinge lines of stacked folding surfaces. If the axial surface is a planar surface then it is called the <b>axial</b> <b>plane</b> and can be described by the strike and dip of the plane. An axial trace is the line of intersection of the axial surface with any other surface (ground, side of mountain, geological cross-section).|$|E

Structural geologists measure a variety of planar features (bedding planes, foliation <b>planes,</b> fold <b>axial</b> <b>planes,</b> fault planes, and joints), and linear features (stretching lineations, in which minerals are ductily extended; fold axes; and intersection lineations, the trace of a planar feature on another planar surface).|$|R
40|$|Background: Novel {{microscopic}} techniques which bypass the resolution limit in light microscopy are becoming routinely established today. The higher spatial resolution of super-resolution microscopy techniques demands for precise correction of drift, spectral and spatial offset of images recorded at different <b>axial</b> <b>planes.</b> Methods: We employ a hydrophilic gel matrix for super-resolution microscopy of cellular structures. The matrix allows distributing fiducial markers in 3 D, and using these for drift correction and multi-channel registration. We demonstrate single-molecule super-resolution microscopy with photoswitchable fluorophores at different <b>axial</b> <b>planes.</b> We calculate a correction matrix for each spectral channel, correct for drift, spectral and spatial offset in 3 D. Results and discussion: We demonstrate single-molecule super-resolution microscopy with photoswitchable fluorophores in a hydrophilic gel matrix. We distribute multi-color fiducial markers in the gel matrix and correct for drift and register multiple imaging channels. We perform two-color super-resolution imaging of click-labeled DNA and histone H 2 B in different <b>axial</b> <b>planes,</b> and demonstrate {{the quality of}} drift correction and channel registration quantitatively. This approach delivers robust microscopic data which {{is a prerequisite for}} data interpretation...|$|R

50|$|Cleavages {{display a}} {{measurable}} geometric {{relationship with the}} <b>axial</b> <b>plane</b> of folds developed during deformation and {{is referred to as}} axial planar foliations. The foliations are symmetrically arranged with respect to the <b>axial</b> <b>plane</b> depending on the composition and competency of a rock. For example, when mixed sandstone and mudstone sequences are folded during very-low to low grade metamorphism, cleavage forms parallel to the fold <b>axial</b> <b>plane,</b> particularly in the clay-rich parts of the sequence. In folded alternations of sandstone and mudstone the cleavage has a fan-like arrangement, divergent in the mudstone layers and convergent in the sandstones. This is thought to be because the folding is controlled by buckling of the stronger sandstone beds with the weaker mudstones deforming to fill the intervening gaps. The result is a feature referred to as foliation fanning.|$|E

30|$|Here, we {{introduce}} a simple experimental protocol to distribute fiducial markers {{in three dimensions}} using a hydrophilic extracellular matrix (ECM). Such hydrogels were developed for cell culture to support cell growth in 3 D {{and serve as a}} scaffold (Lee et al. 2008), and comprise biocompatible compounds such as fibrin (Blomback 2004 # 212), collagen (Bell et al. 1979) or alginate (Augst et al. 2006). Adding fiducial markers to the ECM gel and embedding the cells in the gel matrix leads to a distribution of the fiducial markers in 3 D. We perform single-molecule localization microscopy of DNA and histone H 2 B in different <b>axial</b> <b>planes,</b> and use the fiducial markers to correct for both drift and spectral offset. A sufficiently dense distribution of fiducial markers further allows registering super-resolution images recorded in different <b>axial</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
