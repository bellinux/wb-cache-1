40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to profile altered {{patterns}} of gene expression that characterize degenerative ascending thoracic <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> and to compare these patterns with those observed for infrarenal abdominal <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms.</b> MethodsFull-thickness <b>aortic</b> wall tissues were obtained during surgical repair of degenerative thoracic <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> and infrarenal abdominal <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> (n = 4 each), with normal thoracic and abdominal aortas from organ transplant donors used as control preparations. Radiolabeled complementary DNA was prepared for each specimen and hybridized to complementary DNA microarrays, and differential levels of gene expression between aneurysmal and normal aortic tissues at each site were assessed by parametric statistics. ResultsOf 1185 genes examined, 112 (9. 5 %) were differentially expressed (P <. 05) between thoracic <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> and normal thoracic aorta, with 105 increased and 7 decreased. There were 104 genes (8. 8 %) differentially expressed between infrarenal abdominal <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> and normal abdominal aorta (65 increased and 39 decreased). Quantitative increases in expression for 97 genes were unique to thoracic <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms,</b> whereas increases for 61 genes were unique to infrarenal abdominal <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms.</b> Although 8 gene products were significantly altered in both thoracic and infrarenal abdominal <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms,</b> these changes were directionally concordant for only 4 (matrix metalloproteinase 9 /gelatinase B, v-yes- 1 oncogene, mitogen-activated protein kinase 9, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 /CD 54). Results for 9 genes were independently confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction. ConclusionsThoracic <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> and infrarenal abdominal <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression relative to normal aorta from the same sites, with most alterations being unique to each disease. Degenerative aneurysms arising in different locations are thus characterized by a high degree of molecular heterogeneity, reflecting different pathophysiologic mechanisms...|$|R
5|$|That same year, Gygax was {{diagnosed}} with a potentially deadly abdominal <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysm.</b> Doctors concurred that surgery was needed, but their estimates of success varied from 50% to 90%. With no firm medical consensus, Gygax came to believe that he would likely die on the operating table; he refused to consider surgery, although he realized that a rupture of the aneurysm – likely inevitable – would be fatal. In one concession to his condition, he switched from cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to cigars.|$|E

He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysm,</b> among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of low back pain result from systemic or psychological problems, such as fibromyalgia and somatoform disorders.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundBoth <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> and {{coronary}} artery ectasia (CAE) frequently coexist and {{are associated with}} more pronounced inflammation. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NL ratio) is widely used as a marker of inflammation. However, relation between CAE and NL ratio in patients with <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> is not fully understood. This study was undertaken to assess relation between CAE and NL ratio in patients with <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms.</b> MethodsThis study consisted of 93 consecutive patients with <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> (AA group) and 79 patients without <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> who had angiographically normal coronary arteries as the control group. Moreover, patients with <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> were classified into two groups based {{on the presence of}} CAE; CAE (+) group (n = 44) and CAE (−) group (n = 49). We compared blood chemical parameters in both groups. ResultsIn the AA group, 44 patients (47. 3 %) had CAE. The AA group had a significantly higher NL ratio than the control group (2. 93 ± 1. 43 vs. 2. 45 ± 1. 05, p = 0. 027). Furthermore, the CAE (+) group had a significantly higher NL ratio than the CAE (−) group (3. 39 ± 1. 67 vs. 2. 52 ± 1. 04, p < 0. 01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the high NL ratio was an independent predictor for CAE in patients with <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> (odds ratio 1. 76, 95 % confidence interval 1. 24 – 2. 69, p = 0. 001). ConclusionsPatients with <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> had a significantly higher NL ratio than those without <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms.</b> Furthermore, the NL ratio might predict the presence of CAE in patients with <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms...</b>|$|R

5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a name tag, so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysm,</b> for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up.

40|$|ABSTRACTBACKGROUNDEndovascular {{treatment}} has revolutionized the therapeutic approach to abdominal <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> {{due to its}} low morbidity and mortality rates. Despite the technological advances, there still are anatomical limitations {{on the use of}} stent grafts. This study aimed to evaluate the immediate clinical results in patients with complex abdominal <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> treated with a second generation stent graft. METHODSThis is an observational, prospective, non-randomized, single-center study in a series of patients undergoing endovascular repair of complex infra-renal abdominal <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms,</b> using a stent graft with a dual-ring stent design (Anaconda™ – Vascutek, Terumo, Inchinnan, Scotland). Clinical and angiographic characteristics, technical and therapeutic success rates, morbidity and mortality and perioperative reintervention rates were evaluated. RESULTSBetween February 2010 and December 2011, 108 consecutive patients with <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms</b> were treated, of whom 16 had complex abdominal <b>aortic</b> <b>aneurysms,</b> treated with the Anaconda™ AAA Stent Graft System. Mean age was 76 ± 7 years and 75 % were males. Technical success was observed in 94 % and therapeutic success in 75 % of cases. There was one postoperative death. The most prevalent perioperative complication was surgical wound bleeding (2 / 16) and peripheral embolism (2 / 16). Reinterventions were required in 12. 5 % of the patients during follow-up.
