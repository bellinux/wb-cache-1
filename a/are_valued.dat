In traditional Chinese medicine, alligator meat is said to cure the common cold and prevent cancer, while various internal organs are believed to have medicinal properties.|$|E
5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E

5|$|Pacific {{angelsharks}} are {{not dangerous}} to humans unless provoked, {{in which case}} their bite can cause a painful injury. They <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> for their meat and are captured by commercial and recreational fishers across their range. A targeted gillnet fishery for this species began off Santa Barbara, California in 1976 and ended in 1994, after overfishing and new regulations led to its near-collapse. This species is now mainly fished in Mexican waters. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as the Californian population is largely protected and recovering, while the impact of Mexican fisheries is unknown.|$|E

Some species, like Russula vesca, can even be eaten raw. The brittle texture of Russula fruitbodies makes them different from other mushrooms and is not appreciated by some.|$|E

Excluding fish exports, which amounted to $254 million, all the main export categories were either mining or hydrocarbon products.

5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|All {{dates of}} the dollar also exist in proof finish. The 1999 coins were sold as {{standalone}} proof strikes, rather than {{as part of a}} larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.|$|E
5|$|Asian {{elephants}} perform {{tasks such}} as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around national parks, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions. In northern Thailand, the animals are used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee. They <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks. Elephants can be trained to respond to over 30 commands. Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous {{to work with and}} are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes. In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960.|$|E

5|$|Spinner {{sharks are}} swift and gregarious predators that feed {{on a wide}} variety of small bony fishes and cephalopods. When feeding on schools of forage fish, they will speed {{vertically}} through the school while spinning on their axis, erupting from the water at the end. Like other members of its family, the spinner shark is viviparous, with females bearing litters of three to 20 young every other year. The newborns are born in shallow nursery areas near the coast, and are relatively fast-growing. This species is not usually dangerous to humans, but may become belligerent when excited by food. Spinner sharks <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> by commercial fisheries across their range for their meat, fins, liver oil, and skin. They are also esteemed as strong fighters by recreational fishers. The IUCN has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} and cutting {{teeth of the}} silky shark make it {{potentially}} dangerous, and it has behaved aggressively towards divers. However, attacks are rare, as few humans enter its oceanic habitat. Silky sharks <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> for their fins, {{and to a lesser}} extent their meat, hide, liver oil, and jaws. Because of their abundance, they form a major component of commercial and artisanal shark fisheries in many countries. Furthermore, their association with tuna results in many sharks being taken as bycatch in tuna fisheries. Although slow-reproducing like most other sharks, the wide distribution and large population size of the silky shark was once thought to buffer the species against these fishing pressures. However, data now suggest that silky shark numbers are declining around the world, which prompted the IUCN to reassess its conservation status from Least Concern to Near Threatened in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{price and}} value of a Zimbabwean {{banknote}} depend on various factors: the rarity, based on {{factors such as the}} name of capital city, how long it was printed, or the type of watermark; its condition, and the national situation at time of issue, such as shortages or hyperinflation. Common designs and variants such as the $100 note of 1995 (Pick no. 9) are usually valued at about $1 apiece, while rare varieties such as the $10 Salisbury error note (Pick no. 3b) and the Standard Chartered issues <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> at around $100 or more. Zimbabwean banknotes are usually sold by banknote dealers over the counter or on the internet, although the most valued types theoretically qualify for inclusion in auction.|$|E

5|$|Large {{numbers of}} silky sharks are caught by {{commercial}} and artisanal multispecies shark fisheries operating off Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the United States, Ecuador, Spain, Portugal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Yemen, and Côte d'Ivoire. Even greater numbers are caught incidentally by tuna longline and purse seine fisheries throughout its range, particularly those using fish aggregating devices. It {{is the most}} common shark caught as bycatch in the eastern Pacific and Gulf of Mexico tuna fisheries, and the second-most common shark caught as bycatch (next to the blue shark) overall. The fins <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> as an ingredient in shark fin soup, with captured sharks often finned at sea {{and the rest of the}} body discarded. Fins from an estimated one-half to one and a half million silky sharks are traded globally per year; it is the second- or third-most common species auctioned on the Hong Kong fin market, which represents over half the global trade. The meat (sold fresh or dried and salted), skin, and liver oil may also be used, as well as the jaws: this species is the predominant source of dried shark jaw curios sold to tourists in the tropics.
