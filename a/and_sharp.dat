5|$|Beauchamp's {{defense team}} {{attempted}} to discredit Patrick Darby by stressing {{his association with}} the Old Court and suggesting the murder was politically motivated. They also presented witnesses who testified that they knew of no hostility between Beauchamp <b>and</b> <b>Sharp,</b> and questioned whether Darby and Beauchamp's 1824 meeting ever occurred.|$|E
5|$|Volume II covers an {{assortment}} of topics: animals including sea creatures such as sea urchin, seahorse, whelk, mussel, crab, scorpion, electric ray, viper, cuttlefish and many others; dairy produce; cereals; vegetables such as sea kale, beetroot, asparagus; <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> herbs such as garlic, leek, onion, caper and mustard.|$|E
5|$|A single pair of {{long and}} slender {{antennae}} is present, the segments {{of which are}} relatively few and elongated. They were most probably used as sensory organs, with most segments possessing small setae (bristles). A pair of short lobed structures (possible antennules) are also present, their position corresponding {{to the location of}} the second pair of antennae in modern-day crustaceans. In between them is a small triangular rostral plate with a narrow <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> central ridge.|$|E

Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer <b>and</b> <b>sharper</b> than they had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer <b>and</b> <b>sharper</b> than the rest.|$|R
50|$|Although the Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company bore his name, Christian Sharps {{was not the}} company's owner. He {{left the}} firm, first to form C. <b>Sharps</b> <b>and</b> Company in 1853 <b>and</b> then <b>Sharps</b> & Hankins, in {{partnership}} with William Hankins, in 1862. Both firms were located in Philadelphia. The <b>Sharps</b> <b>and</b> Hankins partnership ended in 1866, <b>and</b> <b>Sharps</b> resumed the manufacturing of firearms under the C. <b>Sharps</b> <b>and</b> Company name. In all, he was awarded a total of fifteen firearms-related patents.|$|R
5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance {{on its hind}} legs, usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may jump {{in the air and}} strike out with its short nails <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
5|$|Filming for series 3 {{began in}} November 2012, with an airing date {{scheduled}} for May 2013. In November Jones <b>and</b> <b>Sharp</b> were photographed filming {{on location in}} Manchester for the series. As the fourth series had a different air date (its television broadcast began in September, unlike May for the three previous series) it became the first series not to be filmed in the winter months. A longer break in production between series 3 and 4 was {{the reason that the}} fourth series was instead filmed in summer.|$|E
5|$|Pernick and Wilder {{highlight}} eight major {{clean technology}} sectors: solar power, wind power, biofuels, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications, and water filtration. Six major forces, which {{they call the}} six C’s, are pushing clean technology into the mainstream: costs, capital, competition, China, consumers, and climate. Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota <b>and</b> <b>Sharp,</b> and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are making multibillion-dollar investments in clean technology.|$|E

5|$|Darby {{eventually}} brought {{suit for}} libel against Kendall <b>and</b> Eliza <b>Sharp,</b> {{as well as}} Senator Beauchamp <b>and</b> <b>Sharp's</b> brother Leander. Numerous delays and changes of venue prevented any of the suits from ever going to trial. Darby died in December 1829.|$|R
50|$|After {{retiring}} from Caltech, <b>Sharp</b> <b>and</b> his wife Jean moved their home from Altadena to Santa Barbara, {{where they lived}} for two decades in a custom-built house on Gibraltar Road overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

5|$|Riefenstahl tried {{many times}} to make more films during the 1950s and 1960s, but was met with resistance, public protests <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> criticism. Many of her filmmaking peers in Hollywood had fled Nazi Germany and were unsympathetic to her. Although both film {{professionals}} and investors were willing to support her work, most of the projects she attempted were stopped owing to ever-renewed and highly negative publicity about her past work for the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|The board noted that: {{the test}} {{planners}} {{had failed to}} identify the test as hazardous; the emergency equipment (such as gas masks) were inadequate to handle this type of fire; that fire, rescue, and medical teams were not in attendance; and that the spacecraft work and access areas contained many hindrances to emergency response such as steps, sliding doors, <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> turns.|$|E
5|$|The hindfeet {{are long}} and have the three central digits longer than the two outer ones. They are white to pale yellow above, where the foot is covered with hairs, which are longer than in T.bolivaris. The digits of the hindfeet are {{surrounded}} by ungual tufts of silvery hair that are longer than the claws themselves. The claws are short <b>and</b> <b>sharp.</b> Parts of the sole are covered by indistinct scales (squamae), which are usually entirely absent in T.bolivaris. The pads are moderately large.|$|E

5|$|The {{red panda}} is {{specialized}} as a bamboo feeder with strong, curved <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> semi-retractile claws standing inward for grasping narrow tree branches, leaves, and fruit. Like the giant panda, {{it has a}} “false thumb” which {{is an extension of}} the wrist bone. When descending a tree head-first, the red panda rotates its ankle to control its descent, one of the few climbing species to do so.|$|E
5|$|The serval {{is similar}} to the {{sympatric}} caracal, but has a narrower spoor, a rounder skull, and lacks its prominent ear tufts. The African golden cat is darker, with different cranial features. It resembles the cheetah in its build and coat pattern, though not in size. The serval shares its adaptations to its marshy habitat with the jungle cat; both cats have large <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> ears that help in locating the prey efficiently, and their long legs raise them above muddy ground and water.|$|E
5|$|After Governor Adair's term {{expired in}} 1825, he was succeeded by another Relief Party member, General Joseph Desha. Desha <b>and</b> <b>Sharp</b> had been colleagues in Congress, and Desha re-appointed Sharp as {{attorney}} general. The Relief faction {{in the legislature}} passed several measures favorable to debtors, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck them down as unconstitutional. Unable to muster the votes to remove the hostile justices on the Court of Appeals, Relief partisans in the General Assembly passed legislation to abolish the entire court and create a new one, which Governor Desha promptly stocked with sympathetic judges. For a time, two courts claimed authority as Kentucky's court of last resort; this period {{was referred to as}} the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E

5|$|Although {{found to}} be {{reliable}} and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards {{in the form of}} an exposed hot barrel <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> edges. There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program (PIP) intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the nurse}} shark, the tawny nurse shark has a more placid {{disposition}} and will often allow divers to touch and play with it. However, it should be accorded respect due to its powerful jaws <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> teeth. This species is caught by commercial fisheries across most of its range for meat, fins, liver oil, leather, and fishmeal. It is also esteemed as a game fish off Queensland, Australia, and {{is known for its}} habit of spitting water in the faces of its captors. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the tawny nurse shark as Vulnerable, with subpopulations in several areas already diminished or extirpated.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1961 event, FIDE {{abolished}} the automatic {{right of a}} deposed champion to a rematch, and the next champion, Armenian Tigran Petrosian, a player renowned for his defensive and positional skills, held the title for two cycles, 1963–1969. His successor, Boris Spassky from Russia (champion 1969–1972), won games in both positional <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> tactical style. The next championship, the so-called Match of the Century, saw the first non-Soviet challenger since World War II, American Bobby Fischer, who defeated his Candidates opponents by unheard-of margins and clearly won the world championship match. In 1975, however, Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet Anatoly Karpov when FIDE did not meet his demands, and Karpov obtained the title by default. Fischer modernized many aspects of chess, especially by extensively preparing openings.|$|E

5|$|Harris {{reportedly}} {{joined the}} cast of Prometheus in February 2011 with Idris Elba and Kate Dickie. Harris described Fifield as an audience surrogate who is very cautious and questions dangerous situations. Jon Spaihts, author of Alien: Engineers (the original prequel), wrote Fifield as changing directly into an Alien from the black mutagen, tying the film into the Alien canon. During its evolution into Prometheus, Ridley Scott decided to diverge from the previous films and establish a separate canon. In a deleted take of Fifield's mutated face he is more deformed and reminiscent of an Alien, with an elongated cranium under the melted, translucent helmet, long arms <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> teeth. The character's final depiction retained Fifield's human appearance.|$|E
5|$|Low-powered motorboats {{are allowed}} in the park; the {{majority}} of salt water areas are no-wake zones to protect manatees and other marine animals from harm. Jet skis, airboats, and other motorized personal watercraft are prohibited. Many trails allow kayaks and canoes. A state license is required for fishing. Fresh water licenses are not sold in the park, but a salt water license may be available. Swimming is not recommended within the park boundaries; water moccasins, snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), alligators and crocodiles thrive in fresh water. Sharks, barracuda, <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> dangerous coral are plentiful in salt water. Visibility is low in both kinds.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are omnivores {{and display}} {{varying degrees of}} carnivory and herbivory, {{generally}} leaning in favor of one more than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for one over the other, as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous. They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50-70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth <b>and</b> <b>sharp</b> carnassials meant for slashing, {{and in some cases}} strong jaws for bone-crushing, {{as in the case of}} hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had saber-shaped canines.|$|E
