40|$|Abstract At present, <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drugs</b> — {{foremost}} {{among them the}} proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) — represent a keystone inHelicobacter pylori eradication therapy. The present article shall first compare the role of PPIs as compared with histamine H 2 receptor antagonists, both {{of them in the}} role of antibiotic-associated antisecretory therapy, and shall then address the contribution of each of the various PPIs that have been developed until the present time to the H. pylori eradication therapies. In summary, it may be concluded that PPIs are more effective overall than H 2 receptor antagonists when the two groups of <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drugs</b> are given at the usual standard doses together with antibiotics with the intention of eradicating H. pylori infection. However, all PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, and esome-prazole) are equivalent when given together with two antibiotics to cure the infection. 1...|$|R
40|$|Omeprazole is an <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drug</b> {{used against}} gastric ulcers. It quickly {{decomposes}} in an acid medium, however, therefore {{making it a}} matter {{of great interest to}} protect it in these conditions and determine the ideal adsorption conditions for this drug on latex particles for formulation designs — oral suspensions — containing polymers with the aim of delivering different drugs in a sustained and controlled action. Time, pH, and concentration of the active ingredient for which maximum adsorption occurs, were determined. The findings suggest that adsorption is evidently greatest at an acid pH 4 – 5, that the adsorption of Omeprazole rises concomitantly with the increase in latex particles, and the time is the least influential factor. © 2000 Elsevier Science S.

40|$|Nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) is {{a common}} {{condition}} and the most frequent phenotype of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). NERD is extremely heterogeneous and includes patients with negative endoscopy but abnormal esophageal acid exposure and/or positive reflux-symptom association analysis (hypersensitive esophagus). This segregation is only possible owing {{to the use of}} impedance-pH monitoring. Indeed, weakly acidic reflux represents {{one of the most common}} causes of refractory symptoms in patients evaluated off antisecretory therapy and, more importantly, during <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drug</b> treatment. Patients with heartburn who do not have any type of reflux underlying their symptoms (functional heartburn) must be excluded from the category of GERD. The drawbacks of impedance-pH are mainly due to the day-to-day variability of the test and the fact that the accuracy of the symptom-reflux correlation scores is often far from perfect. Some histopathological characteristics, such as dilated intercellular spaces, can be helpful in distinguishing patients with NERD through esophageal biopsies. Patients with NERD in whom acid is the main pathogenetic factor respond successfully to proton pump inhibitor therapy, while those with hypersensitive esophagus to weakly acidic reflux could be treated with reflux inhibitors or surgery, although further controlled studies are require...|$|E
40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) are {{the most}} important tool to control pain in rheumatic diseases; however, their application is limited by the risk of serious complications in the cardiovascular system and gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The advent of a Russian new drug that is a naproxen and esomeprazole combination (Vimovo™) extends the possibilities of NSAIDS use. This review considers the benefits of both NEC components. The former is naproxen, a traditional NSAIDS that is in common use as an effective analgesic worldwide. Its chief merit is the least cardiovascular risk among all NSAIDs (aside from aspirin). Esomeprazole is a representative of the group of proton pump inhibitors, a potent <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drug</b> that has passed major tests as an agent for the prevention of NSAID-related GIT complications. This drug combination allows patient incompliance to gastroprotective therapy to be eliminated. Large-scale clinical trials have confirmed a considerable reduction in the frequency of GIT complications with NSAIDS use as compared to the standard enteric-coated naproxen, including in patients receiving low-dose aspirin.

40|$|Background/aims—To {{explore the}} reasons why {{patients}} with gastric cancer continue to present with advanced disease despite open access gastroscopy.  Patients—All patients diagnosed with gastric cancer between 1 August 1989 and 31 July 1994.  Methods—A retrospective study of the presentation of gastric cancer in South Tees; patients were diagnosed at open access gastroscopy or referred through conventional channels. Primary care records of 81 patients dying between 1991 and 1995 were analysed for previous symptoms, investigations, and <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drug</b> therapy. Findings were compared with 200 age and sex matched controls.  Results—The overall incidence of earlier stage gastric cancer remains low at 13 %. Diagnostic delay occurs in both primary and secondary care due to {{a high incidence of}} previous dyspepsia and investigation. One in six patients had been previously investigated in the three years prior to diagnosis, the majority of whom were on antisecretory drugs.  Conclusions—Early gastric cancer remains rare in South Tees health district. Advantages of open access gastroscopy appear to be compromised by delayed referral to hospital and failure of endoscopists to recognise the early disease; either they are unaware of its appearance or prior treatment with an H 2 receptor antagonist masks the disease by allowing mucosal healing. ...|$|E

In patients with ETEC diarrhea who received 400 mg of BS {{in a single}} oral dose, the mean stool volumes were significantly less {{than those of the}} controls during three consecutive 8 -hr periods after treatment (P <. 05). At 24 hr after treatment, significantly more patients who were treated with BS and had ETEC diarrhea stopped having diarrhea as compared with the controls (42070 vs 20 %, P<. 05). In patients with cholera who received 400 mg of BS, the mean 8 -hr stool volume during the second 8 -hr period after treatment declined to 2. 22 liters, which was significantly less than the 2. 79 liters found in the controls (P <. 05).

40|$|AIMS: To {{test whether}} a hypoacidic {{environment}} may potentially "stress" Helicobacter pylori DNA, encouraging {{the emergence of}} strain variation. METHODS: This hypothesis was tested by inducing prolonged hypoacidity with omeprazole, a potent <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drug.</b> The genomic DNA of H pylori was studied by electrophoretic separation of restriction endonuclease fragments followed by rRNA gene hybridisation in seven patients infected with H pylori before and after treatment with omeprazole 20 - 40 mg daily for six to eight weeks. DNA was isolated and purified using the guanidium thiocyanate reagent method. DNA samples were digested with Hae III, electrophoresed, vacublotted, and hybridised using a biotinylated cDNA probe prepared from 16 S and 23 S rRNA from H pylori NCTC 11638. Isolates were compared using their ribopatterns (DNA fingerprints). RESULTS: A total of 26 isolates were obtained; all DNA isolates were cut by Hae III, which was the enzyme that gave the best resolved hybridisation patterns for analysis. No two patients harboured the same strain. The isolates from two patients showed evidence of subtypic variation; one patient had two distinct strains and four patients had their own indistinguishable strains before and after treatment with omeprazole. For each patient, the paired ribopatterns of H pylori DNA were not affected by treatment with omeprazole for six to eight weeks. CONCLUSION: The H pylori genome is relatively stable when exposed to the conditions of prolonged hypoacidity that result from treatment with omeprazole...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dyspepsia {{is common}} in western society. Prompt {{endoscopy}} is imperative in all patients with sinister symptoms or if symptoms first appear {{after the age of}} 50 - 55 years, but the optimal management of younger patients with uncomplicated dyspepsia is still open to debate. Methods: The literature on the management of uncomplicated dyspepsia is reviewed and a personal view is presented. Results: Strategies based on non-invasive detection of Helicobacter pylori are probably the most cost-effective. Currently (H. pylori prevalence 30 %- 40 %), a 'test and treat' approach using a non-invasive test to detect H. pylori {{is likely to be the}} most efficient first step. If the patient is H. pylori-negative or if symptoms persist after successful H. pylori eradication, empirical treatment with an anti-secretory drug is justified. Endoscopy is reserved for those patients in whom this approach fails. If the prevalence of H. pylori decreases, the positive predictive value of any non-invasive H. pylori test will become too low. A 'test and scope' approach in which a positive test can be confirmed by two or more biopsy-based tests is then more appropriate. At a very low prevalence of H. Pylori in the dyspeptic population, non-invasive testing for H. pylori loses its significance and empirical treatment with an <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drug</b> becomes a rational first step. Conclusions: The optimal approach to management of uncomplicated dyspepsia is dependent on the prevalence of H. pylori among the dyspeptic population. At the current prevalence rate, 'test and treat', followed by acid suppressive treatment in the case of persisting symptoms, is the most appropriate strategy...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although {{empirical}} <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drug</b> {{therapy is}} recommended to young dyspeptic patients without alarming features, {{the effectiveness of}} this approach remains undetermined. We evaluated the long-term effects of an initial 12 -wk course of lansoprazole in young dyspeptic patients without Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. METHODS: Patients who were less than 45 yr and presented with at least 3 months of dyspepsia in the absence of alarming features were eligible. They were offered 13 C-urea breath test (UBT) to determine H. pylori status and all symptomatic patients with negative UBT were randomized to receive lansoprazole 30 mg daily or placebo for 12 wk. Those who had previous endoscopy or positive UBT were excluded. Primary end point was the proportion of patients with treatment failure, defined as worsening of global dyspeptic symptom, while on study medication. Patients were followed up for 26 wk for global dyspeptic symptom as determined by 7 -point Likert scale. Quality-of-life assessment (SF- 36), need of endoscopy, and utilization of other health-care services were monitored for 52 wk. RESULTS: A total of 157 dyspeptic patients were randomized. At the end of 12 -wk treatment, the proportion of patients with treatment failure was similar in the lansoprazole (33. 3 %) and placebo (30. 3 %) groups (P = 0. 74). Patients' global assessment of their dyspeptic symptom was comparable at all time points measured. There was also {{no significant difference in the}} SF- 36 mental and physical summary scales. At the end of 52 wk, there was no difference in the proportion of patients who underwent endoscopy, had additional medical consultations, or used other nonstudy medications between the two groups.

40|$|Background: Recent {{data has}} raised {{skepticism}} regarding the long-term effectiveness of radiotherapy (RxT) in acromegaly {{and its role}} as an ancillary tool to neurosurgery (Tx). Patients: We evaluated 72 acromegalic patients previously submitted to RxT. Data were discarded in 23 patients, who were lost to follow-up, operated on after RxT or irradiated with techniques different from external conventional fractionated RxT. Among the remaining 49 (five with mixed GH-prolactin ade-noma), 34 were irradiated after surgical failure and 15 as primary treatment. A second cycle of RxT was administered in two. Results: (i) GH/IGF-I. After a median follow-up of 14 years (range 3 – 41), normal age-matched IGF-I levels were reached in eight patients (16 %) after 10 years, and GH levels, 2. 5 mg/l in six (12 %) after 9 years. The rate of persistently pathological hormonal levels was still 90 % at 25 years. All patients with GH/IGF-I normalization had undergone irradiation without any <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drug.</b> Neither basal GH nor tumor size affected the outcome of RxT. In three patients (6 %) a relapse/worsening occurred. (ii) Tumor size. Tumor shrank after 8. 5 years in 24 patients (49 %), in nine of whom during GH-suppres-sive treatment. Tumor shrinkage was not predictive of hormonal normalization. (iii) Side-effects. Hypo-pituitarism was diagnosed in four patients (selective in three and global in one) and GH deficiency in one. Three patients had neurological side-effects and meningioma was shown in two patients. Conclusion: RxT is unable to cure acromegaly, because it seldom achieves hormonal normalization even after a very prolonged follow-up. Concomitant antisecretory treatment seems to counteract its effects. RxT can still {{play a role in}} those patients with large tumor remnants, because of its capacity to shrink tumor size.

Objective: To estimate the effectiveness of RC in the symptomatic treatment of acute diarrhoea in adults. Data Sources: A systematic review of MedLine, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, DARE, and Embase (up to November 2013). Additional studies were identified by contacting clinical experts and the manufacturer. Study Selection and Appraisal: Randomized Controlled Trials performed in adults suffering from acute diarrhoea using RC in one treatment arm. Independent extraction of articles using predefined data fields, and methodological quality measurement assessment. All randomised trials performed in adults suffering from acute diarrhoea with RC as the studied group. Statistics: The main efficacy endpoint was diarrhoea duration defined as time to recovery compared between groups by survival techniques and converted into hazard ratio (HR). We exclusively used a random-effect meta-analytic model. Constipation proportion was the main safety endpoint, evaluated between treatments by the Relative Risks (RR). Results: Twelve randomised trials (2619 patients) met inclusion criteria. Duration of diarrhoea was much shorter in the RC group, the proportion of patients having recovered {{at any time of}} the treatment period was 65 % higher in the RC group, compared with placebo (HR = 1. 65 [1. 38 - 1. 97], p < 0. 00001, n= 1001).

Rats were injected intraperitoneally at 8 : 00 a. m. on two consecutive days. In hepatectomized rats, the first dose was injected at 8 : 00 a. m. immediately after surgery, the second, 24 h later. The serum of sham-operated or 70 % hepatectomized rats that did not receive drugs served as control. No changes in DNA synthesis, percentage of labelled nuclei and transaminase were detected when the agents were added to the hepatocytes in culture at concentrations within the effective pharmacological dosage and 30 times higher. Similarly, no changes in these parameters were obtained when different concentrations of serum obtained from sham-operated rats treated with H 2 blocking agents or omeprazole were added to the basal culture medium.

40|$|After {{establishing}} the benign {{nature of a}} gastric ulcer, the treatment is primarily medical. This medical therapy is aimed to alleviate symptoms, to heal the ulcer and to prevent relapses. Based {{on the history of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the Helicobacter pylori-status, gastric ulcer patients can be divided into four categories (1) H. pylori positive plus NSAIDuse, (2) H. pylori positive without NSAID use, (3) NSAID use with negative H. pylori-status, (4) Negative H. pylori-status and no NSAID use. Patients taking NSAIDs should stop this therapy if possible. Patients with gastric H. pylori infection should be treated by a regimen of a proton pump inhibitor with at least two appropriate antibiotics. This treatment will result in early alleviation of symptoms, rapid healing of the ulcer and prophylaxis of ulcer relapse. In patients with gastric ulcer who cannot stop NSAIDs, maintenance therapy with prostaglandins or potent <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drugs</b> should be considered. The few patients with gastric ulcer who do not take NSAIDs and do not have gastric H. pylori infection should be treated by <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drugs,</b> and they should be carefully followed endoscopically to exclude malignant (carcinoma, lymphoma) or non-peptic (Crohn's disease) disease.

The relationship between degree of acid suppression and therapeutic efficacy has not been precisely defined for these drugs. We have examined the association between suppression of intragastric acidity and duodenal ulcer healing rates for a number of therapeutic regimens. For the H 2 receptor antagonists alone, the most significant correlation with healing rates was with suppression of intragastric acidity at night (r = 0. 926; p = 0. 0001). When other classes of drug: high dose antacid, omeprazole and a synthetic prostaglandin (enprostil) were included in the analysis, the closest correlation was with suppression of total 24 hour intragastric acidity (r = 0. 911; p less than F 0. 0001). Stepwise linear regression analysis was used to investigate the relative contributions to healing of suppression of acidity during the day and night. Suppression of nocturnal acidity was found to be the single most important factor in explaining healing rates. No further benefit was obtained with daytime suppression for H 2 receptor antagonists; suppression of acidity at night accounted for 86. 1 % of the observed variation in healing rates among different regimens of H 2 receptor antagonists. When all classes of drugs were analysed, inclusion of daytime suppression produced a significant improvement in correlation over nocturnal suppression alone. Drug regimens providing potent suppression of nocturnal acidity produce the highest healing rates in controlled clinical trials. The healing rate for any dose regimen of an <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drug</b> can be predicted from a knowledge of its effect on intragastric acidity. For the H 2 receptor antagonists, suppression of nocturnal acidity is the most relevant in this context. Moderate suppression of acidity achieves ulcer healing rates at four to eight weeks which are comparable with those seen with potent suppression at two to four weeks. Increasing degrees of suppression merely accelerate healing...|$|E

If there is pain or discomfort, 3 or 4 sips of room temperature water will usually relieve the pain. Symptomatic patients should elevate the head of their beds and avoid lying down directly after meals. [...] If the condition has been brought on by stress, stress reduction techniques may be prescribed, or if overweight, weight loss may be indicated. [...] <b>Antisecretory</b> <b>drugs</b> like proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor blockers can be used to reduce acid secretion.

40|$|General {{management}} of severe acute pancreatitis Severe acute pancreatitis remains a very challenging disease with multiple complications and high mortality. As early identification and aggressive treatment of associated organ dysfunction can exert {{a major impact}} on outcome, early assessment of prognosis and severity is important. Supportive therapy includes vigorous hydration, analgesia, and pharmacological or mechanical support targeted towards specific organ dysfunctions. The most recent guidelines do not recommend the use prophylactic antibiotics. Enteral nutrition via a nasojejunal tube has become the preferred feeding route. The available evidence indicates that patients with severe acute pancreatitis do not benefit from a therapy with available <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drugs</b> or protease inhibitors. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this article, we have {{reviewed}} the main therapeutic measures for the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES). Review of the literature was based on computer searches (Pub-Med, Index Medicus) and personal experiences. We have evaluated all the measures now available for treating patients with sporadic gastrinomas or gastrinomas associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1, (MEN 1) including medical therapy such as <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drugs</b> and somatostatin analogs (SST), chemotherapy and chemoembolization, and surgical procedures. In ZES patients, the best therapeutic procedure is surgery which, if radical, can be curative. Medical treatment can be the best palliative therapy and should be used, when possible, in association with surgery...|$|R
40|$|In a {{group of}} 94 {{duodenal}} ulcer patients consecutively studied and followed-up for 1 year, subjects with maximal acid output (M. A. O.) above 60 mmol/hour (mostly heavy-smoking men), were found to relapse more frequently than those with lower M. A. O. values (72. 2 % versus 27. 6 %; p less than 0. 0005). A significantly higher relapse rate was also detected in patients treated with maintenance dosages of effective <b>antisecretory</b> <b>drugs</b> (cimetidine, ranitidine, pirenzepine) and presenting M.

40|$|The enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells {{represent}} the predominating endocrine cell {{population in the}} oxyntic mucosa of the stomach. They are {{under the influence of}} gastrin.

There are many unknowns concerning the intervention of other trophic factors in addition to gastrin and concerning the receptors located on the cells.
