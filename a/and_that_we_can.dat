Lacking outside confirming texts, they hold that we cannot confirm the origin or date of most statements and laws, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> say little for certain about their authorship. In this view, the questions above are impossible to answer. See, for example, the works of Louis Jacobs and Shaye J.D. Cohen.|$|E

25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything {{is that we can}} be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E

She stated that [...] "for many years people have asked me why there have been no women following in my footsteps. I really hope the Commission can help answer that question <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> attract and support women in all areas of our sport." [...] Having already headed a working group on the future of rallying, Mouton was appointed FIA's manager in the World Rally Championship in 2011. Mouton also serves in the nomination committee of the Rally Hall of Fame. In March 2012, she recused herself after becoming a candidate for nomination. Mouton was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with two-time world champion Carlos Sainz.|$|E
500|$|Finally, Duerr {{once again}} criticises the {{approach}} of Western society and its anthropologists to studying [...] "archaic" [...] spiritual beliefs. He asserts that in these [...] "archaic" [...] cultures, people [...] "have a much clearer idea {{about the fact that}} we can not be only what we are if at the same time, we are also what we are not, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only know who we are if we experience our boundaries". He denounces Western scientists and anthropologists for their approaches to the study of such cultures, arguing that they have misrepresented them by attempting to fit them within the Western ideas of objectivity. He argues that in future, anthropologists must reach their own boundaries, and recognize the wilderness of their consciousness before they can truly understand the worldview of [...] "archaic" [...] humans.|$|E

2500|$|The {{journalist}} Peter Dizikes, {{writing in}} The Boston Globe in 2008, notes that popular culture {{likes the idea}} of the butterfly effect, but gets it wrong. Whereas Lorenz suggested correctly with his butterfly metaphor that predictability [...] "is inherently limited", popular culture supposes that each event can be explained by finding the small reasons that caused it. Dizikes explains: [...] "It speaks to our larger expectation that the world should be comprehensible – that everything happens for a reason, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> pinpoint all those reasons, however small they may be. But nature itself defies this expectation." ...|$|E

The diverse religious movements covered by the term [...] "gnosticism" [...] share the basic doctrines that the surrounding world is fundamentally evil or inhospitable, that we are trapped in the world through no fault of our own, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be saved from the world only through secret knowledge (gnosis).

2500|$|Georg Christoph Lichtenberg's {{knowledge}} of Le Sage's theory {{was based on}} [...] "Lucrece Newtonien" [...] and a summary by Prévost. Lichtenberg originally believed (like Descartes) that every explanation of natural phenomena {{must be based on}} rectilinear motion and impulsion, and Le Sage's theory fulfilled these conditions. In 1790 he expressed in one of his papers his enthusiasm for the theory, believing that Le Sage's theory embraces all of our knowledge and makes any further dreaming on that topic useless. He went on by saying: [...] "If it is a dream, it is the greatest and the most magnificent which was ever dreamed..." [...] <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> fill with it a gap in our books, which can only be filled by a dream.|$|E
2500|$|Tismăneanu {{has been}} accused by {{multiple}} Romanian and foreign scholars and researchers of employing dubious methods to squelch criticism {{of him and his}} works. [...] In May 2012, the well-respected scholar Alina Mungiu-Pippidi wrote, [...] "I hope that Volodea will once again become the spiritual creature, subtle and {{with a sense of humor}} who he used to be, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> forget this sinister alter-ego that he has become, telephoning newspapers and television stations to orchestrate--without being asked by anybody--pro-Băsescu propaganda and putting pressure on independent journalists." [...] According to Michael Shafir, Tismăneanu responded to criticisms by the American researcher Richard Hall as follows: [...] "On the one hand, the vicepresident of the Civic Alliance, Sorin Ilieşiu, a person close to Tismăneanu, reacted by putting the word [...] "analyst" [...] in quotes, so that the journalist Andrei Bădin could then [...] "demonstrate" [...] that Hall wasn't a CIA analyst, but had only served an insignificant [...] "probationary" [...] period of six months. [...] The person who was the object of his criticism knew better: [...] Hall had published in the very journal that he had previously led ("East European Politics and Societies"). [...] So he picked up the telephone and yelled at Richard Hall's supervisor, in a scene that could have been included in [...] "Stalinism for All Seasons." [...] Michael Shafir detailed Tismăneanu's tactics more broadly in an article entitled suggestively, [...] "About Questionable Clarifications, Plagiarism, Being an Imposter, and Careerism." [...] In November 2013, Vasile Ernu told an interviewer how Editura Curtea Veche cancelled a book contract because among a handful of references to Tismăneanu one suggested that [...] "Tismăneanu employs two different discourses, one inside Romania and one outside." ...|$|E
