40|$|Now-a-days {{usage of}} {{concrete}} {{in the field}} of civil engineering is increasing rapidly in which most of it is going as waste due to improper management and care while placing it. The waste produced cannot be recycled/reused, so as to eradicate this some alternatives can be chosen. Mainly in the construction of retaining walls, concrete panels are used to support the backfill soil, but at the time of installation most of the panels get rejected because at the time of transportation and installation of panels. If proper care is not taken the ends get damaged by which there cannot be a proper bonding between the adjacent panels. So as to overcome this geocells are used in case of concrete panels which is a HDPE (High Density PolyEthylene) material which is a reusable can be used under any climatic conditions, transportation and installation of this material is easy and consumes less time. Geocells are placed in layers one above the other as the depth of geocell is restricted, so all the layers are placed with some inclination as it is easy to support backfill soil and the displacements generated among them can be encountered. Analysis of geocell reinforced retaining wall is done in PLAXIS 3 D. PLAXIS 3 D is a finite element <b>analytical</b> geotechnical <b>software</b> gives accurate results compared to that finite difference and limit equilibrium <b>analytical</b> <b>software’s.</b> In the PLAXIS 3 D software, generation of geocell retaining wall models with inclinations are made and without load and with loading conditions.
