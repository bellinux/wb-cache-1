Rather than the wooden box used in 19th century cameras, modern models substitute bellows to reduce {{the bulk of the}} cameras and make them easier to use outside the studio.|$|R
40|$|For the ATLAS {{experiment}} at the LHC, CERN, it {{is planned}} {{to build a}} pixel detector containing around 1750 individual detector modules. The high power density of the electronics requires an extremely efficient thermal management system: an evaporative fluorocarbon cooling system has been chosen for this task. The harsh radiation environment presents another constraint {{on the design of}} the control system, since irradiated sensors can be irreparably damaged by heating up. Much emphasis has been placed on the safety of the connections between the cooling system and the power supplies. An <b>interlock</b> <b>box</b> has been developed for this purpose. We report on the status of the evaporative cooling system, on the plans for the detector control system and on the irradiation studies of the <b>interlock</b> <b>box.</b> I...|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanically}} <b>interlocked</b> signal <b>box</b> at {{the station}} opened in 1887, and was decommissioned in June 2008. Originally built with 120 levers, it had 191 when it closed, making it the world's largest.|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened to}} {{unofficial}} traffic on 18 March 1886, {{with the line}} extended to Bacchus Marsh on 16 February 1887. By 1890, Parwan had a platform, goods shed, a 20-lever <b>interlocked</b> signal <b>box</b> and a three road yard.|$|R
50|$|Subsequent {{investigations}} {{showed that}} the freight train had most likely passed a red signal (as well as the additional distant signal requiring it {{to slow down and}} prepare to stop). The track had been planned to be equipped with the PZB automatic train protection system for years; however {{at the time of the}} accident it still used only visual signals. When the freight train passed the switch (which was already set for the passenger train) the train director in the <b>interlocking</b> <b>box</b> at Hordorf was alerted - he testified that he had radioed an instruction to stop via Zugbahnfunk but got no response until after the collision (which occurred only seconds later).|$|R
50|$|A {{train describer}} is {{originally}} an additional apparatus at British railways that {{ensures that the}} identity of each train is displayed on the signalbox panel together with the indication of that train's presence, usually offering routing information. This routing information would then be passed through to the platform display for passenger information. Technically the train reporting number was pushed from one signal box to the next. A series of interconnected signal boxes form a train describer system (TDS) transferring train describer data to be shown on the respective signalbox panel in a train describer display. The electric relay <b>interlocking</b> <b>boxes</b> were later replaced by electronic control boards where the train indication is just a text element on the video display.|$|R
50|$|Being on {{a single}} track section of track, the station served as a {{crossing}} loop, with an <b>interlocked</b> signal <b>box</b> erected in 1890. In 1893 a turntable was added, and by 1908 the station had a four road yard, passenger platform, and a goods shed and platform.|$|R
5000|$|Severn Bridge Junction is {{the area}} of railway lines just south of Shrewsbury railway station, in Shropshire, England. It is {{controlled}} by a mechanical <b>interlocked</b> signal <b>box</b> of the same name, which is now the largest operational mechanical signal box in the world. The Network Rail signalling area code is 'SBJ.' ...|$|R
40|$|The {{palletization}} problem involves <b>interlocking</b> <b>boxes</b> on a pallet. There are {{two approaches}} {{dealing with the}} solution to this problem: mathematical and heuristic. Three models are proposed in the thesis. Model 1 is an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model dealing with boxes with different lengths and widths but same height. Model 2 provides systematic procedures for 3 D palletization problems by combining the ILP Model 1 and rules of thumb. Model 3 employs a heuristic, in which the main emphasis is on the random sequence of boxes. All three models are capable of performing multi-layer palletization. The pallet utilization, Work-In-Process (WIP), loading stability and palletization time are used as performance measures. Model 3 is implemented in a physical Robotic Palletization System (RPS) through a "C" program which integrates the subsystems consisting of a vision, a conveyor and a robot...|$|R
50|$|Melton station {{opened on}} 2 April 1884, when {{the line from}} Braybrook Junction opened. The line was {{extended}} westward to Parwan station in 1886, and being on a single track section of track, the station served as a crossing loop from this time. By 1889 the station had an <b>interlocked</b> signal <b>box,</b> single passenger platform, and a three road yard. A goods shed also existed across from the passenger platform.|$|R
50|$|The {{method of}} loading boxes on pallets {{strongly}} affects stacking. Vertical columns {{provide the best}} <b>box</b> performance while <b>interlocking</b> patterns of <b>boxes</b> significantly reduce performance. The interaction of the boxes and pallets is also important.|$|R
50|$|The single {{platform}} and the signal <b>box</b> <b>interlocking</b> prevent two trains carrying passengers from passing here; {{although it is}} possible to pass one passenger train and that of another type i.e. light engine(s), engineer's train etc.|$|R
50|$|The station opened as Kororoit on 2 April 1884, at {{the same}} time as the Serviceton line though it, and was renamed Deer Park in 1899, by which time the station had a three road yard, {{passenger}} platform on the southern track, a goods platform on the northern track, and an <b>interlocked</b> signal <b>box.</b> Being on a single track railway, it served as a crossing loop for trains though it, which remained until 1913, when the signal box was abolished.|$|R
40|$|Of all {{the labels}} given to {{movements}} in twentieth-century art, "Cubism" {{is perhaps the}} most misleading. At worst, it can encourage us to think of Cubism {{as little more than a}} mannerism - a style of painting in which the "touches" of Impressionism or the "dots" of Pointillism give way to hard-edged planes that allow the world to be represented in the more modern and mechanistic guise of <b>interlocking</b> <b>boxes</b> and cubes. Anyone who is tempted to interpret Cubism in this way is likely to be pulled up short by the assertion, to be found in just about every major study of the movement, that Cubism brought about the wholesale transformation of western art. For the art historian Robert Rosenblum, writing in 1959, it was as "revolutionary as the discoveries of Einstein or Freud", while for Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten, writing at the start of the twenty-first century, it "initiated a pictorial revolution" that "transformed not just subsequent painting, sculpture and photography, but also architecture and design of everything from furniture to clothing to objects of everyday use". Claims such as these surely cannot rest merely on the development of a new style of painting, even one that broke with accepted notions of what a painting should look like...|$|R

Trick <b>boxes,</b> beautifully veneered with a wood mosaic called “yoseki”, require sliding panels to be moved in sequence until the top or bottom lid can slide open. Some boxes require fifty or more moves to open. Japanes...|$|R
50|$|The station opened as Mount Atkinson on 2 April 1884, at {{the same}} time as the Serviceton line though it, and was renamed Rockbank in 1889. Being on a single track railway line, it {{provided}} a crossing loop for trains, and continues to do so today. By 1914, it had a three road yard, a passenger platform on the southern track, a goods platform on the northern track, and an <b>interlocked</b> signal <b>box.</b> The station served the local farming community. With a chaff mill established in the 1890s, and the recreation reserve and tennis club located nearby, the station became the focus of the Rockbank community.|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened in}} 1872, {{along with the}} line though it, and became a {{junction}} for the Mansfield branch line to Yea in 1883, with the line extended to Mansfield in 1891, and Alexandra in 1909. A turntable was added when the station became a junction, and the main line was duplicated from Broadford in the same year, with the double track being extended north in 1886. The first <b>interlocked</b> signal <b>box</b> was erected in 1885, controlling three platforms and a four road yard. The crossovers for the branch line initially faced Seymour, requiring Melbourne-bound trains to reverse; a Melbourne-facing crossover was added in 1911.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{virtually}} all drag race delay boxes are microprocessor based with intelligent, backlit LCD readouts. The most popular models feature internal crossover time computation (allowing a driver {{to pick a}} visual cue from his opponents side of the Christmas tree, the delay box internally does simple math computations for the driver), bump up and bump down compensation (allows a driver to easily make small plus or minus timing adjustments quickly and remotely), crossover compensation (an offset time the driver can set when crossing over), safety <b>interlock</b> (prevents delay <b>box</b> from reactivating once the race car is in motion, a valuable feature), bypass (a feature where the delay box is deactivated before it can finish counting down, thus launching the car immediately), and other features.|$|R
50|$|Before the Second World War, {{there were}} two {{mechanical}} signal boxes in Neu-Ulm of the Bruchsal class, which were called signal boxes II and III. Signal box II was destroyed in World War II in an air raid on 1 March 1945. After the war it was rebuilt and resumed operations in mid-1946. On 31 January 1965, the mechanical <b>interlocking</b> in signal <b>box</b> II {{was replaced by a}} track plan push button interlocking of Siemens class 59 (SP Dr S59), allowing 15 staff positions to be saved. In 2004, signal box III was decommissioned. As part of Neu-Ulm 21, the push button interlocking was decommissioned on 17 March 2007 and demolished shortly thereafter. As a substitute on 18 March 2007, an electronic interlocking in Ulm, built as Lorenz class L90, remotely controls the Neu-Ulm area.|$|R
5000|$|After German reunification, the {{withdrawal}} of the Soviet troops began and it was completed in 1994. Jüterbog was no longer a military base. Accordingly, the significance of the station decreased, especially as freight traffic fell sharply. The railway tracks of the station were reduced to a considerable extent. In 1999, the tracks were connected to an electronic <b>interlocking.</b> The signal <b>box</b> was thus rendered superfluous and it was closed in 2010. In 1996, passenger services ended between Jüterbog and Sperenberg (and ended two years later on the whole route to Zossen) and freight traffic stopped between Jüterbog and Zossen. The line was closed in the same year. The station building was sold in 2015 to a person who is considering uses for it. It stands (as of 2016) largely empty, although a ticket agency uses individual rooms of the building.|$|R
