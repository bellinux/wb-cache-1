5|$|Rajam died of typhoid in 1939. Her death {{affected}} Narayan {{deeply and}} he remained depressed {{for a long}} time; he was also concerned for their daughter Hema, who was only three years old. The bereavement brought about {{a significant change in}} his life and was the inspiration behind his next novel, The English Teacher. This book, like his first two books, is autobiographical, but more so, and completes an unintentional thematic trilogy following Swami and Friends and The Bachelor of Arts. In subsequent interviews, Narayan <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> English Teacher was almost entirely an autobiography, albeit with different names for the characters and the change of setting in Malgudi; he also explains that the emotions detailed in the book reflected his own at the time of Rajam's death.|$|E
5|$|Sociologist Reiner Grundmann's {{review in}} BioSocieties journal, <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> book is well {{researched}} and factually based, but criticizes {{the book as}} being written in {{a black and white}} manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding of the political process and the mechanisms of knowledge policy, because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides all the (formal) hallmarks of science, Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.|$|E
5|$|The Safety Board {{believes}} that the flight crew of Flight 405 should have taken more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. The Safety Board {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.|$|E

25|$|An {{archaeology}} of the senses, including archaeological optics, {{emphasizes that}} the past was inhabited by living people whose experiences were inherently partial and subjective. Indeed, this subjectivity might have lent both meaning and mystery to events occurring within ancient structures. This <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> senses were {{likely to have been}} used and understood in very different ways by people through time.|$|E
25|$|In its {{earliest}} days the intelligent design movement {{was called the}} 'wedge movement'. The wedge metaphor, attributed to Johnson, {{is that of a}} metal wedge splitting a log and represents using an aggressive public relations programme to create an opening for the supernatural in the public's understanding of science. Johnson <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> goal of the intelligent design movement is to promote a theistic agenda as a scientific concept.|$|E

The bulletin also state that officers may only use a password to gain access to data stored within the device itself, and not data stored on-line.|$|E
25|$|The Windsor Report was criticised by liberals (for example, in The Windsor Report: A Liberal Response) for {{seeming to}} take for granted that the actions of New Hampshire and New Westminster—and {{homosexuality}} in general—were wrong. For example, while it calls for both conservatives and liberals to apologise for disunity, it <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conservatives may have acted {{out of a sense of}} duty. However, it concedes no such acknowledgement to New Westminster and New Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Later, Hitler is {{informed}} by Krebs and Alfred Jodl that Steiner could not mount the attack, allowing the Red Army to further advance closer to Berlin. Dismissing everyone from the room except for Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf, Hitler flies into a furious rage against what he perceives are traitorous actions against him and finally <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war is lost. However, {{he is determined to}} stay in Berlin to the end, even if it means killing himself.|$|E

25|$|Feist <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tekumel setting from M. A. R. Barker's Empire of the Petal Throne was {{the source}} for much of Kelewan. The {{original}} D campaign which he based his books on had an invasion of the Midkemia world by Tekumel. As a result, much of the background of Kelewan – the Tsurani Empire, the lack of metals and horses, the Cho'ja, the pantheons of 20 major and 20 minor gods – comes from Tekumel. Feist claims to have been unaware of this origin when he wrote Magician.|$|E
25|$|In childhood, Vātsyāyana says, {{a person}} should {{learn how to}} make a living; youth is the time for pleasure, and as years pass one should {{concentrate}} on living virtuously and hope to escape the cycle of rebirth. The Kama Sutra <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> senses can be dangerous: 'Just as a horse in full gallop, blinded by the energy of his own speed, pays no attention to any post or hole or ditch on the path, so two lovers, blinded by passion, in the friction of sexual battle, are caught up in their fierce energy and pay no attention to danger' (2.7.33).|$|E
25|$|In its Recommendations for the Censuses of Population and Housing, the CES {{identifies}} {{homeless people}} under two broad groups: (a) Primary homelessness (or rooflessness). This category includes persons {{living in the}} streets without a shelter that would fall {{within the scope of}} living quarters; (b) Secondary homelessness. This category may include persons with no place of usual residence who move frequently between various types of accommodations (including dwellings, shelters, and institutions for the homeless or other living quarters). This category includes persons living in private dwellings but reporting 'no usual address' on their census form. The CES <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> above approach does not provide a full definition of the 'homeless'.|$|E

25|$|For Moltmann's {{second major}} work, The Crucified God, the {{philosophical}} inspiration {{comes from a}} different tendency within Marxist philosophy. In Explanation of the Theme, his introduction to the book, Moltmann <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> direction of his questioning has shifted to that of existentialist philosophy and the Marxism of the Frankfurt School, particularly Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer – close associates of Paul Tillich. An unacknowledged influence, and certainly an important parallel, is probably the Death of God theology that was winning notice in the mid-1960s, particularly the essay collection under that title, edited by William Hamilton and Thomas J. J. Altizer in memory of Paul Tillich.|$|E
25|$|David Campos, {{author of}} the book, Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook, {{illuminates}} the argument proposed by proponents of sexual education programs in public schools. Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of heterosexuality are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them. However, Campos also <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for LGBT youth. It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased, factual information about sexual orientation, along with supportive counseling programs for these homosexual youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|Chessick also {{acknowledged}} {{the dangers of}} relativism implicit in ontological hermeneutics. He <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> art and theory of interpretation is not bound by today's methods of science that aim to prevent nihilism and relativism. However, Bernstein {{has pointed out that}} there never could be any hard and fast rules or methods for interpretation because it does not aim to be a science. Gadamer states that the methods of the natural sciences are too impoverished to reveal many truths about human nature and likewise advocated for a hermeneutic approach. Others have made similar arguments for ontological hermeneutics. Chessick writes that the limitations preventing the natural sciences from uncovering certain truths about human nature is precisely why Dilthey initially advocated for a distinction between the natural and human sciences, paving the way for hermeneutics to become a method of inquiry.|$|E

500|$|The {{experiences}} and situations described are largely anecdotal, but Dalrymple {{explains that he}} interviewed over 10,000 people who attempted suicide and had them tell stories about [...] "the lives {{of four or five}} other people", resulting in a sample base of around 50,000 individuals. Since he is writing about the English underclass, Dalrymple <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of the people interviewed, remembered, and discussed about are white. According to social critic Thomas Sowell, this allows a look at the underclass [...] "without fear of being called 'racist'." ...|$|E
500|$|Yorke <b>acknowledges</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{purpose of}} the Tribal Hidage is unknown and that it may well not be, as has been {{commonly}} argued, an overlord's tribute list. She warns against assuming that the minor peoples (of 7000 hides or less) possessed any [...] "means of defining themselves as a distinct gentes". She notes that among these, the Isle of Wight and the South Gyrwe tribes, tiny {{in terms of their}} hidages and geographically isolated from other peoples, were among the few who possessed their own royal dynasties.|$|E
