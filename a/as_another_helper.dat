60|$|In the old days, {{before the}} {{discovery}} of the leprosy bacillus, a small number of men and women, suffering from various and wholly different diseases, were adjudged lepers and sent to Molokai. Years afterward they suffered great consternation when the bacteriologists declared that they were not afflicted with leprosy and never had been. They fought against being sent away from Molokai, and in one way or <b>another,</b> <b>as</b> <b>helpers</b> and nurses, they got jobs from the Board of Health and remained. The present jailer is one of these men. Declared to be a non-leper, he accepted, on salary, the charge of the jail, in order to escape being sent away.|$|R

Two open-ended questions regarding the role of the kindergarten teacher in children’s lives, were set as a separate mini-questionnaire. For the purposes of this particular study, practitioners (N= 69) and first-year university kindergarten teacher students (N= 65) had to complete two sentences: “Children are like…because …” and “Kindergarten teachers are like… because…”. Their responses were content analysed and then compared. Analysis shows that both students and kindergarten teachers perceive children in a very positive way and evaluate their job as highly valuable. They also highly value their role in children’s lives (<b>as</b> <b>another</b> parent, teacher, <b>helper,</b> model, safe haven, etc.). The most significant difference between practicing teachers and students is their perception of working conditions, where students show a more idealistic approach. (DIPF/Orig. ...|$|R

2500|$|Olson, Jason, Ferrari, and Hutcheson (2005) {{reviewed}} the existent literature on four mutual-help organizations (Alcoholics Anonymous, Oxford House, GROW, and Schizophrenics Anonymous). They {{suggest that the}} processes of change framework found within the transtheoretical model of intentional behavior change (Prochaska, Diclemente, and Norcross, 1992) is a useful model to conceptualize the activities of mutual-help organization members throughout their journey of mental health recovery. They explicitly link social liberation, {{the last of the}} ten processes of change articulated by the model (the others being: consciousness raising, self-reevaluation, helping relationships, self-liberation, environmental reevaluation, dramatic relief/emotional arousal, stimulus control, reinforcement management, and counterconditioning) to the helper-therapy principle, along with a related concept known as bidirectional support (Maton, 1988). Per Olson et al. (2005), social liberation [...] "involves the person in recovery focusing attention away from oneself and developing a broader recognition of social issues that contributed to the targeted problem" [...] which encourages [...] "recovering individuals to take more helping-related attitudes toward others who face similar problems" [...] (p.174). In reviewing the research conducted among members of these four self-help/mutual-help organizations, they identify three different mechanisms which might underlie the therapeutic effect of mutual-help: (1) when an individual helps <b>another,</b> the <b>helper's</b> social functioning improves because the act of providing help to <b>another</b> allows the <b>helper</b> to work through their own difficulties; (2) when an individual helps <b>another,</b> the <b>helper's</b> social functioning improves because the act of providing help to <b>another</b> allows the <b>helper</b> to reinforce their own personal learning about recovery; and/or (3) when an individual helps <b>another,</b> the <b>helper</b> experiences an increase in their own sense of competence and usefulness to others and enables the helper to adopt a [...] "strength-based roles that have not been fully exercised in other areas of life" [...] (p.175). In reviewing the research on GROW, specifically, 67% of members of this organization sampled by Young and Williams (1987) who were asked how they most benefited from participation reported that involvement in GROW [...] "taught [...] could help others" [...] (the most endorsed answer among all listed categories). As suggested by a study by Maton and Salem (1995), this idea is most succinctly expressed by way of an axiom of GROW which is often recited at meetings: [...] "If you need help, help others." ...|$|R
