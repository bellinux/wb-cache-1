5|$|The finetooth shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans. However, when caught, this shark thrashes <b>and</b> <b>snaps</b> at {{anything}} within range, and people have been bitten attempting to handle it. Finetooth sharks are used for human consumption fresh or dried and salted. Other than off the southeastern United States, this species is of little commercial importance: it is small and occurs in water too shallow for most commercial and recreational fisheries, and is generally too fast-swimming to be caught by shrimp trawlers. Small numbers are taken incidentally by floating longlines and on hook-and-line. This species is susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate, and to habitat degradation due to its inshore habits.|$|E

25|$|At the Walford In Bloom competition, {{there is}} a gas {{explosion}} and Martin is panicked when he cannot find Stacey and hits a police officer, resulting in two weeks imprisonment. When Kush suffers a cardiac arrest, he is diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome, which is hereditary. Stacey worries that Arthur could die and tells Bex {{about the possibility of}} Arthur having the syndrome. A doctor assures Stacey that the chance of Arthur displaying symptoms at a young age is small. After Stacey misses Lily's dance show, she tells Lily about Arthur's condition. Stacey is annoyed with Whitney when she takes Lily and Arthur for breakfast and Lily is fed up of being ignored by an exhausted Stacey. When Lily refuses to eat her tea, Stacey physically takes Lily to go upstairs in the presence of Carmel, who refuses to leave Stacey with Lily and Arthur. Arthur undergoes an ECG and Stacey, Kush and Martin are told by the specialist that Arthur is at high risk at having the condition, but cannot have an operation or tests like Kush due to his age. Stacey is anxious that Arthur having a cardiac arrest is a sign of the condition and his parents are told about equipment that is not available on the NHS. Stacey is angry with Martin that he asked Kush for money to buy the equipment. Stacey and Martin panic when Arthur will not wake up, and when they receive Arthur's medical records at the hospital, Stacey and Martin are told that Arthur has swallowed Stacey's bipolar medication. Carmel is horrified when she finds bruises on Arthur's arms, and expresses her concerns to Kush that Stacey is unwell, while Stacey tells her sister-in-law Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) that he gained the bruises in hospital. However, Lily tells Carmel that Stacey was responsible, so Carmel reports it to social services, but tries to retract what she said after realising it was a mistake. Social services visit Stacey and Martin and tell them they received a report about Arthur. Arthur and Lily are placed in Carmel's care until social services have investigated. Arthur is looked over by a doctor, who has no concerns and Stacey and Martin can have Arthur and Lily back. Social worker Fiona Payne (Sandra James-Young) tells Stacey and Martin she will be conducting further home visits. Lily tells Stacey and Martin that she injured Arthur. After speaking with Lily, Fiona tells Stacey and Martin that Lily feels pushed out with Arthur and is anxious about the new baby. Kush and Carmel admit Carmel called social services, enraging Stacey, who bans them both from seeing Arthur before suffering an eclamptic seizure. She is taken to hospital, where her and Martin are told her baby will have to be delivered prematurely {{due to a lack of}} oxygen. The baby is delivered, though Martin is told that there are complications. Stacey goes to see her daughter, but changes her mind <b>and</b> <b>snaps</b> at Martin for allowing Carmel to look after Lily. Stacey later sees her daughter. Stacey and Martin's daughter is put on a ventilator. Stacey grows annoyed at Martin suggesting baby names, but confides in Max about her feelings. Stacey apologises to Martin and they name their daughter Hope.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} estimate the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Autonomic Nervous System components (SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> respectively) by using an indicator obtained from surface ECGs. The long-term goal of the project is to quantitatively analyze the ratio between SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> {{in order to better}} characterize certain pathologies. An approach based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA), which exploits the di erent activation delays of SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> is proposed <b>and</b> applied to a database with normal subjects and diabetic patients. Preliminary results show a good separation, in the frequency domain, of SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> dynamics, including a di erentiation of SNAS <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> in the low-frequency band.

When Lisa sees how she upset him, she says that they are just too different and will eventually drift apart. To make things up to her, Homer takes her to a local New Age store which introduces Homer and Lisa to water-filled sensory deprivation tanks, where they experience their own spiritual journey. On her journey, Lisa sees herself from Homer's perspective, reprimanding him for snoring during a ballet recital. Lisa realizes that despite his boorish personality, Homer loves Lisa enough {{to take her to}} events and places that he does not personally like just so she can be happy. Meanwhile, a pair of repo men start to clean out the store despite the lease not being up for months, taking the tank that Homer is in.

40|$|The hormones {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP) {{and brain}} natriuretic peptide (BNP) are stored and {{secreted}} by cardiac myocytes. To date, there is little information reported regarding the cellular mechanisms regulating the release of these hormones. Recent studies have identified soluble N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive-fusion attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) in the trafficking, docking and fusion of ANP and BNP secretory vesicles. In this study, I characterized the expression profiles of the three SNARE proteins (syntaxin 5 A, syntaxin 18, <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 29), implicated in constitutive exocytosis, in atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes. My results suggest that syntaxin 5 A, syntaxin 18 <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 29 are not important in the constitutive secretion of ANP and {{may play a role}} in another protein trafficking pathway. Syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25, two SNARE proteins previously characterized in atrial cardiac myocytes, form a complex in adults that has been implicated in the exocytosis of ANP. I investigated the protein expression and promoter activity of these two SNARE proteins in neonatal and adult atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes. The functional role of syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25 was assessed using botulinum neurotoxin C (BoNT/C) and BoNT/A which cleave these SNARE proteins, respectively. Treatment of cardiac myocytes with BoNT/A and BoNT/C suggest that syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25 regulate ANP secretion in neonatal cardiac myocytes, albeit low levels. Lastly, I examined the influence of forskolin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) on the syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25 promoter. The lack of effect of these agents on gene reporter activity suggests that the CRE element in the syntaxin 1 A <b>and</b> <b>SNAP</b> 25 promoter do not significantly affect transcriptional activity. Overall, my studies demonstrate the developmental changes in SNARE protein expression in the heart, and their potential role in ANP secretion...|$|R
2500|$|One {{theory about}} the Highland Fling {{is that it}} was a dance of triumph {{at the end of a}} battle.

These comics differ from previous Buffy literature {{in that they}} are the official continuation of the television series and are considered canon. In Season Eight (2007–11), it establishes Buffy is not living with the Immortal in Rome which is simply a cover story to ensure her safety as she is now the leader of a global organization which recruits and trains Slayers to deal with demonic threats worldwide. However, a mysterious group led by the masked villain 'Twilight' believe the Slayers themselves are the danger, should they begin to consider themselves superior to mankind. In the story [...] "Wolves at the Gate", Buffy shares a sexual encounter with fellow Slayer Satsu; however Satsu leaves soon after because she realizes Buffy cannot return her feelings. Earlier in the series, the audience glimpsed Buffy's most personal sexual fantasy in her dreamspace: a threesome with Angel and Spike. The series' final two arcs are in some sense are about Buffy's relationships with Angel and Spike. In [...] "Twilight", Buffy mysteriously obtains super powers and discovers that Twilight is in fact Angel. Despite his actions, Buffy succumbs to her passions and engages in an act of passionate airborne sex with Angel, only having them return on waking up in a paradise dimension which will replace the existing universe. In spite of the lure of eternal happiness together in this new dimension, the two return to Earth to assist their friends against extra-dimensional demons, when Spike arrives. In [...] "Last Gleaming", Spike's information leads them to source both of magic and of Twilight's power, a mystical [...] "seed" [...] buried beneath Sunnydale. Giles plans to destroy it, but Twilight possesses Angel <b>and</b> <b>snaps</b> his neck. Distraught, Buffy smashes the seed herself. Twilight is stopped but magic is also removed from the universe. Though Slayers and vampires retain their powers, witches for example are left entirely powerless.
