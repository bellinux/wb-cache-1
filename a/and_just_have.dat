500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, [...] "Because each episode is so wildly different {{there was nothing}} really linking them {{other than the fact}} they were all inside a Number Nine, I just thought {{it would be nice to}} have an object that you could hide <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> there on every set." [...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] on a table in Squires's fireplace. However, there is also a [...] "second" [...] hare. While it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown at the end of the episode, the crossword published in The Guardian contains a nina spelling ONELEPUS, Lepus being the generic name for hares.|$|E
500|$|Inside No. 9, for Pemberton, {{offered the}} [...] "perfect vehicle" [...] for revisiting the {{possibility}} of dialogue-free television. Shearsmith said that, {{at the start of}} the writing process, the pair did not have the intention of scripting the entire episode without dialogue, and that it would be [...] "great" [...] to have ten minutes without it. However, Pemberton said it was easier to write once they had entered the correct [...] "mindset". Once half an episode had been written, Pemberton said, the pair thought [...] "we've just got to keep going". The only dialogue in the episode is right at the end; [...] "what a great thing to get to the end <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> one line of dialogue", Pemberton suggested, comparing the concept to that of the Mel Brooks film Silent Movie.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss {{feels that}} episodes such as [...] "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] are his {{favorite}} episodes to write {{because they have}} a [...] "solid theme or an issue" [...] (in this case, religion and theft), that one can [...] "discuss endlessly <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> it present itself in so many different ways." [...] Producer Jeff Martin said that the writers tried to use a [...] "very strict construction of the Eighth Commandment," [...] considering cable theft to be [...] "essentially a victimless crime." [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment" [...] was produced at a time when illegal cable hookups were becoming commonplace in many homes. This episode later inspired the season four episode [...] "Homer the Heretic", in which Homer stops going to church on Sundays. Based on the Fourth Commandment, [...] "remember the Sabbath and keep it holy", that episode originated when Jean commented to Reiss, [...] "We had a lot of luck with Homer stealing cable, so maybe we could look to other commandments?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Cut Man" [...] {{ends with}} a long action {{sequence}} filmed in a single take. DeKnight called it the [...] "most complicated action scene" [...] in the series, due to the technical difficulty in filming it, and credited Goddard, episodic director Phil Abraham, stunt coordinator Philip J Silvera, and series cinematographer Matt Lloyd with realizing it. He also named [...] films as inspiration for the sequence. There {{were only a few}} days to plan and set up the fight, as opposed to a film which would allow [...] "at least a couple of weeks", and it took 7 or 8 takes to get the shot right. Silvera explained that the scene was always scripted to be a one-shot, and that he had intended to work around it with wipes, but Abraham challenged the team to do it all for real, which allowed the fight to feel more grounded by having them [...] "slow down the fight, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> this raw, animalistic feeling happening." [...] The final shot does include some 'Texas Switches' between actors and stunt doubles, but was ultimately filmed with no cuts.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2006 interview, John Collins {{said that}} the group's {{formation}} and the recording of the EP was just [...] "for fun", with no intention of [...] "taking it too seriously". He {{also noted that the}} idea of the EP was first proposed when Powderfinger's hiatus began, and he asked Bishop the question [...] "Do you want to write some songs <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> a bit of fun?" [...] Originally, the band had not intended to release any work, stating [...] "It’s not very commercial, in a sense." [...] However, in a later interview with FasterLouder, Bishop noted that the band would [...] "maybe send it off to Europe and The States with some indie labels", as well as hoping to tour around the country.|$|E
2500|$|The studio {{brought in}} screenwriter W. D. Richter, a veteran script doctor (and {{director}} of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai) to extensively rewrite the script, {{as he felt}} that the Wild West and fantasy elements didn’t work together. The screenwriter modernized everything. Almost everything in the original script was discarded except for Lo Pan's story. Richter realized that [...] "what it needed wasn't a rewrite but a complete overhaul. It was a dreadful screenplay. This happens often when scripts are bought and there's no intention that the original writers will stay on". Richter used Rosemary's Baby as his template, presenting [...] "the foreground story in a familiar context [...] rather than San Francisco at the turn-of-the-century, which distances the audience immediately [...] <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> one simple remove, the world underground, you have a much better chance of making direct contact with the audience". He wrote his own draft in 10 weeks. Goldman contacted Richter and suggested that he should not work on the project. Richter told him, [...] "I'm sorry the studio doesn't want to go forward with you guys, but my turning it down {{is not going to get}} you the job. They'll just hire someone else".|$|E

2500|$|Scherzinger credits Whitney Houston {{as being}} her {{greatest}} musical influence and idol, saying {{she wanted to}} [...] "be Whitney" [...] when she grew up. She admired Houston {{so much that she}} auditioned with her version of [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] at her Popstars audition. When Scherzinger was growing up in her home town of Louisville, she received a Christmas gift (at the age of six) of a tiny purple boombox and a cassette of Whitney Houston's chart-topping 1985 self-titled debut album. [...] "My parents had no money, but they got me this player and Whitney's album, which had [...] "The Greatest Love of All" [...] on it," [...] Scherzinger recalls. [...] "That was it for me. From that moment on I wanted to sing. Her voice was so powerful; every note she sang just felt like the truth." [...] Scherzinger also named Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Roberta Flack, Sade Adu, Alanis Morissette, Toni Braxton and Tina Turner as her biggest influences while growing up. Scherzinger said that Beyoncé also inspired her, stating: [...] "I am inspired by women like Beyoncé who wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into what they do and that is how I pride myself." [...] Scherzinger said while she is on stage performing, she borrows personas of Tina Turner and Mick Jagger: [...] "The way he [...] prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love Tina Turner's attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> that attitude and that soul behind you." [...] Scherzinger also cites Gwen Stefani as an influence. Janet Jackson and MIA are also influences to her. When Scherzinger was older, Mariah Carey became a huge influence to her. She also wished to work with the Black Eyed Peas saying she admired their music. Scherzinger is also a fan of Adele. Critically acclaimed, [...] "Pop Prince", Prince also became a big influence when she was in her teens. Michael Jackson was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols. Paula Abdul, who Scherzinger sat alongside on the judging panel of The X Factor, was one of her influences. When she gained the role on Men in Black 3, Scherzinger said that music was a very big part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film. She said, [...] "I listened to my heavier music and I listened to Led Zeppelin and I kind of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot and she told me about lots of crazy things to think about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said." [...] Scherzinger said that the role has inspired her to record differently on her second studio album.|$|E

To-day, well, I'm half glad and I'm half sorry that they're not here. If they walked into this office now I'd swallow a bean as quickly as I could, but I tell you frankly, Mr. Waddington, that at the present moment it seems entirely {{reasonable}} to me. Money, after all, is worth having, isn't it?--a nice comfortable sum so that one could sit back <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> a good time. Don't stare at me like that. Of course, I'm half ashamed of what I'm saying. There's the other part pulling and tugging away all the time makes me feel inclined to kick myself, but I can't help it.

Did it with the working classes, the sort who used to go to a race-meeting for a jaunt, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> a bit on {{for the sake of the}} sport. Took their missus generally, and made a holiday of it, and if they lost they'd grin and come and chaff me, and if they won they'd spend the money like lords. I made money, of course, bought houses, and made a lot more. Then business fell off. I didn't seem to meet with that cheerful holiday-making crew at any of the meetings up in the North, and I got sick of it. You see, I'd made sort of friends with them. They all knew Dicky Fardell, and I knew hundreds of 'em by sight. They'd come and mob me to stand 'em a drink when the wrong horse won, and I can tell you I never refused. They were always good-tempered, real sports to the backbone, and I tell you I was fond of 'em. And then they left off coming. I couldn't understand it at first. The one or two who came talked of bad trade, and when I asked after their pals they shook their heads. They betted in shillings instead of half-crowns, and I didn't like the look of their faces when they lost. I tell you, it got so at last that I used to watch for the horse they'd put their bit on to win, and feel kind o' sick when it didn't. You can imagine I couldn't stand that sort of thing long. I chucked it, and I went to look for my pals. I wanted to find out what had become of them." ...|$|E
