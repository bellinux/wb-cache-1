50|$|The {{steelwork}} was {{encased in}} Gunite, a sprayed dry mix concrete, {{the process of}} {{which was based on}} an invention in the United States <b>at</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>century</b> to spray plaster of paris in the reconstruction of skeletons of prehistoric animals. Between 1904-1909 this method was modified to spray sand and cement using a machine known as a Cement- Gun. Gunite was copyrighted in 1912 and continued as a proprietary trademark until 1967, when it became a generic term. The process involves a mixture of sand and cement which is loaded into one chamber, a stream of the dry mixture is forced along a delivery pipe to the gun, and on discharge is mixed with an annular jet of water. It was only in the 1920s that the process spread internationally, {{and it is difficult to}} ascertain whether other examples of bridges using the Gunite process, beside the St Paul Minnesota bridge, exist. It would appear that the use of Gunite in the arches, beams, deck members and hangers of the main spans, is a major early use of the process in Australia. The Opening Booklet for the bridge states:"The encasing of broad flange beams with concrete applied under pressure introduces new methods to Brisbane."The southern approach of the bridge, to the south of Montague Road, was designed to have wider footpaths and roadway than the remainder of the bridge to conform with the decision of the Council to utilise this portion of the approach, so that access might be had to abutting buildings (directly) from the bridge roadway.|$|E
