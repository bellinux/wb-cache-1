5|$|The {{premise of}} a repentant murderer seeking {{to atone for}} their actions {{appears to have been}} based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his {{perineum}} and force rose stems along his urethra to be forcibly pulled out. However, the actual murders may have been inspired by the case of Susan Smith, <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake. Mention is also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose recidivism is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should warrant a death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while on parole.|$|E
5|$|Hilde is the {{daughter}} of the king of Wolfkrone, a fictional European kingdom under assault by series antagonist Nightmare's forces. After her father was driven insane by the Evil Seed event brought upon by the cursed sword Soul Edge (which took place seven years before the events of Soulcalibur IV), Hilde was forced to take the throne of Wolfkrone despite her young age. She took the responsibilities to protect her people and lead her armies in the front lines against Nightmare. As a desperate measure, Hilde seeks the Sword of Resurrection, Soul Calibur, to bring back an ancient king who once restored peace to the world. Eventually, both Nightmare and Soul Edge are destroyed for good by Soul Calibur, wielded by Hilde's friend, Siegfried, thus ending the long-term war. However, the Wolfkrone is still at turmoil, and Hilde must search for a new land for her people to settle. Throughout seventeen years, Hilde goes from nation to nation to search for territory, where she also became <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> children. Eventually, the Wolfkrone manages to find a land and live at peace, but Hilde is alarmed by Siegfried that an army of malfested have challenged wars upon the kingdom. Thus, Hilde allies herself with Siegfried's group of mercenaries, Schwarzwind, to defend her kingdom, regardless of the possibility that she might lose her life in the process.|$|E

Edward Guthman of the San Francisco Chronicle found Zeta-Jones to be a standout among the ensemble and labelled her [...] "sensational" [...] in a scene in which she confronts a Tijuana dealer, adding that [...] "through sheer conviction, she electrifies a moment that could have been absurd". The ensemble of Traffic won the SAG Award for Outstanding Cast and Zeta-Jones was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E
