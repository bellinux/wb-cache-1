Their significant disadvantage is a central screening of an entrance pupil that leads to lower image quality. The paper contains description of the investigations on <b>afocal</b> <b>systems</b> formed by eccentrically cut-out mirror paraboloids (off-axis mirrors) where aperture diaphragm is displaced in the meridian plane for a defined value and a central field point is located on the optical axis. The canonic Mersenne systems are accepted as base schemas (modules) for these compositions. The paper considers two types of such systems: visible increases – Г > 0 and Г < 0. Algorithms for calculation of centered <b>afocal</b> <b>systems</b> with two and four reflections have been written in the paper and the systems are free from spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism when an input pupil is located in superimposed focal planes of all parabolic mirrors. An aberration in curvature image has been additionally corrected in three-mirror quart-parabolic scheme which is a combination of two classical telescopic Mersenne systems. The paper presents schemes and calculation results. Two-mirror schemes with non-screened input pupil have been studied in the paper and in this case all the system remains centered and an aperture diaphragm is decentered for the distance Cm which is commensurable with the diaphragm size. The paper contains description of the investigated afocal schemes with four reflections from off-axis mirror paraboloids, a prepared algorithm for calculation, the obtained formulas for making combination of canonic <b>afocal</b> <b>systems</b> formed by two mirrors.

There is a substantial concentration of energy toward the optical axis, similar to apodization of the pupil. Calculations of the point spread function (PSF) show that in such systems, the Airy disk is slightly enlarged (at most 20 %) and the second maximum (the first bright ring) can be completely suppressed. The most effective suppression of the second and higher maxima in the diffraction pattern is obtained with an imposed central obscuration ratio of 0. 5 and a primary mirror focal ratio of 2.

The authors hereby present mathematical calculation proving that if the principal point of the correcting lens P 2 ̆ 72 is in the F 1 of the emmetropic eye, meaning that? is equal to the front focal length of the emmetropic eye, there is no change in the refractive eye system, i. e. it becomes emmetropic and there is no change in the size of the retinal image.

40|$|The General Optical Systems Evaluation Program, GENOPTICS, was {{developed}} {{as an aid}} for the analysis and evaluation of optical systems that employ lenses, mirrors, diffraction gratings, and other geometrical surfaces. The GENOPTICS evaluation is performed by means of geometrical ray tracing based upon Snell's law. The GENOPTICS program can provide for the exact ray tracing {{of as many as}} 800 rays through as many as 40 surfaces. These surfaces may be planar, conic, toric, or polynomial shaped lenses, mirrors, and diffraction gratings. Each surface may be tilted about as many as three axes and may be decentered. Surfaces having bilateral symmetry may also be analyzed. GENOPTICS provides for user-oriented input and {{for a wide range of}} output for the evaluation of the optical system being analyzed. GENOPTICS provides a wide range of features for the optical system analyst. GENOPTICS performs axial ray tracing and computation of the third order aberrations including aspheric contribution. The program includes a quasi-automatic ray-surface intersection selection option. Graphical output can be generated for spot diagrams, radial energy distributions, and modulation transfer functions, for each object point and each color. Sag tables may be generated for any rotationally symmetric surface, with options to obtain the sag differences from a reference sphere in units of lengths or wavelengths. Statistics and plots of ray intercepts with any surface in the system may be obtained for use in vignetting analysis and beam distribution analysis. <b>Afocal</b> <b>systems</b> can be examined with image statistics generated in terms of tangents of angles with respect to the optical axis. For exact ray tracing, a ray pattern at the entrance pupil can be specified as a rectangular or polar grid, where each ray samples an equal amount of area, or as a pattern where each ray samples an equal amount of solid angle for a finite object. This latter pattern is useful in radiometric work. Input to GENOPTICS includes program control statements, system definition data, surface data, and task data. Multiple cases may be examined in a single run. Output includes printed and graphical results. The user can specify which portions of an analysis are to be printed. Optional printout includes system data, surface-to-surface printout of each ray, modulation transfer function values, radial energy distribution values, and paraxial ray data including aberrations. GENOPTICS is coded to generate plotted output for a ZETA plotting system but should be readily adapted to other plotting systems. The GENOPTICS program is written in FORTRAN 77 and has been implemented on an IBM 370 series and DEC VAX series computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 220 K of 8 bit bytes.

40|$|Subject of Research. Traditionally, afocal compensators, {{located in}} {{parallel}} or in converging beams, {{are used to}} correct the aberrations of mirror systems. The additional property of afocality gives the possibility to ignore practically the selection of materials in the design, since, in this case, the achromatic correction is achieved automatically. A change in the ambient temperature leads {{to a change in}} the shape of the mirrors and their mutual arrangement, in addition, the optical characteristics of the compensator material change that leads to defocusing. Main Results. Based on the analysis of paraxial formulas valid for the correction of chromatic aberrations and thermal defocusing, we have obtained formulas that enable to evaluate the characteristics of the materials necessary for passive athermalization, that is, to keep image quality when the ambient temperature changes without using a mechanical offset of the sensor. It is shown that in a two-lens compensator used to correct aberrations of two-mirror lens in a converging beam of rays, it is necessary to use a combination of optical glasses and polymer materials for passive athermalization. Practical Relevance. Based on the theoretical correlations obtained, a two-mirror <b>system</b> with an <b>afocal</b> compensator is calculated with a high image quality maintained over a wide temperature range. The use of obtained formulas in practice made it possible to demonstrate the possibility of creation of athermalized catadioptric lens involving combinations of conventional glasses with modern polymeric materials.
