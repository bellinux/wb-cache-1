In 1999, when Betty was celebrating 30 years on-screen, Alison Boshoff of the Daily Mail praised the character's never changing style: [...] "for 30 years, one favourite fixture of Coronation Street has remained exactly the same [...] barmaid Betty Turpin. With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back.

He increased her role in storylines. This made Cooper delighted, of the changes she stated: [...] "he seemed to like what I did and he's worked on it and developed it.

At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Gaga gave her first televised performance of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] dressed as a satellite landing on the moon. Wearing a red bikini, and a large red disc around her, Gaga was perched atop a semi-circular replica of the moon which was covered in silver chains. Flames erupted around the stage as Gaga revealed another circular disc covering her face.

500|$|Christopher Eccleston's casting as the Ninth Doctor was {{announced}} on 22 March 2004. He was the production team's first {{choice for the}} character. Other actors linked to the role included Bill Nighy, Richard E Grant, Anthony Head, Eddie Izzard, Hugh Grant and Alan Davies. Jane Tranter, BBC Controller of Drama Commissioning, stated in the announcement of his casting that casting an actor of Eccleston's reputation signalled [...] "our intention to take Doctor Who into the 21st century, as well as retaining its core traditional values– to be surprising, edgy and eccentric". Executive Producer Russell T Davies remarked that casting Eccleston [...] "raises the bar for all of us". Eccleston cited {{the quality of the}} scripts as a reason for joining the cast, stating in an interview on BBC's Breakfast programme that he was [...] "excited" [...] about working with Davies. In the press-pack for the series he states that he had emailed the writer to declare his interest in the role. Eccleston enjoyed having the chance to work on a series aimed at a different demographic than his previous work, noting that [...] "it's aimed at families, so I'm kind of acting for children <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> lucky {{to be able to do}} that". He felt that being cast by Davies in the series was a [...] "risk" [...] because as an actor he is not known for [...] "charm or comedy" [...] and anticipated a potential backlash due to being built up as [...] "an actor of stature" [...] and the difference between his own interpretation of the character and past doctors.|$|E

500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E
