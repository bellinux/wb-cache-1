25|$|Dual-sports, {{sometimes}} called dual-purpose or on/off-road motorcycles, are street legal machines that <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> enter off-road situations. Typically {{based on a}} dirt bike chassis, they have added lights, mirrors, signals, and instruments {{that allow them to}} be licensed for public roads. They are higher than other street bikes, with a high center of gravity and tall seat height, allowing good suspension travel for rough ground.|$|E

Certain versions <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be amphibious and air droppable via Il-76.|$|E
25|$|Since CD-Rs {{in general}} cannot be logically erased to any degree, the {{disposal}} of CD-Rs presents a possible security issue if they contain sensitive / private data. Destroying the data requires physically destroying the disc or data layer. Heating the disc in a microwave oven for 10–15 seconds effectively destroys the data layer by causing arcing in the metal reflective layer, but this same arcing may cause damage or excessive wear to the microwave oven. Many office paper shredders <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> shred CDs.|$|E
2500|$|RFN's campaigning, {{advocacy}} and information activities <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> ensure that other major Norwegian actors (such as the [...] ) espouse {{policies that are}} consistent with rainforest protection, and to promote awareness among Norwegian businesses and the public of the impacts of their investments, activities, and consumption patterns on the rainforest and its peoples.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{resonator}} {{types are}} distinguished by the focal lengths {{of the two}} mirrors and the distance between them. [...] (Flat mirrors are not often used {{because of the difficulty}} of aligning them to the needed precision.) [...] The geometry (resonator type) must be chosen so that the beam remains stable (that the size of the beam does not continually grow with multiple reflections). [...] Resonator types <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> meet other criteria such as minimum beam waist or having no focal point (and therefore intense light at that point) inside the cavity.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{lining wear}} indicators, located {{either as a}} semi-metallic layer within the brake pad {{material}} or with an external [...] "sensor", <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> squeal when the lining is due for replacement. The typical external sensor is fundamentally different from the noises described above (when the brakes are applied) because the wear sensor noise typically occurs when the brakes are not used. The wear sensor may only create squeal under braking when it first begins to indicate wear but is still a fundamentally different sound and pitch.|$|E
2500|$|Inspiration for the {{characters}} {{was drawn from}} graphic novels and comic books, Gustav Klimt paintings, as well as Indian and Eastern European art. [...] As Koozå is dreamt of by the Innocent, many of the costumes are designed to impress the audience with ideas of children's toys, soldiers, and children's stories. [...] Many of the costumes <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> metamorphose. [...] For example, the Charivari performers have controls at their fingertips that will turn their costumes from gold to red {{in the blink of}} an eye. [...] These metamorphosis effects were inspired by quick-change artists and magicians.|$|E
