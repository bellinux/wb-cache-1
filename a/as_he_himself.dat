Murphy chose a Midwest setting <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> grew up in Indiana, and {{recalled}} childhood visits to Ohio to the Kings Island theme park. Although set in Lima, the show is filmed at Paramount Studios and Helen Bernstein High School in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|As State Secretary Reitz had a {{complicated}} and hefty job. After the State President {{he was the}} most important member of the Executive Council (Uitvoerende Raad). As the most senior civil servant he was responsible for the oversight over the implementation of the laws and regulations, as well as for all the correspondence of the President, official government reports, etc. He was also an intermediary between the Executive Council and parliament, the First and Second Volksraad, and a key figure in the foreign affairs of the State. Experienced and well organised <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> was Reitz managed to quickly modernise the structure of the state apparatus, by implementing regulations for the running of the government departments, appointing an archivist for his own, and by prescribing that all correspondence with the government should be in Dutch.|$|E
5|$|Dennie had health trouble {{throughout}} his life, {{as well as}} a predilection for wine. His father (who had battled mental illness) died on September 28, 1811; Dennie was not able to attend his father's funeral, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> was gravely ill at the time, and this caused him great grief. He briefly recovered, but succumbed to cholera morbus four months after his father's death. Dennie died on January 7, 1812, and was interred two days later at St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia. His epitaph was written by John Quincy Adams. The epitaph erroneously gives Lexington, Massachusetts as his birthplace; in fact, Dennie was born in Boston, but his family moved to Lexington shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Other {{alterations}} and additions {{were made}} during the 17th century, including a modest brick house added onto the west end in 1639, perhaps intended as a home for Sir Alexander's bailiff, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> no longer used the hall as his main residence by that time. The house was built at 90° to the timber-framed building, to which it was later joined. During the Civil War Sir Alexander, as a Royalist, was imprisoned and suffered financial hardship. Reduced means eventually forced his heir, John Radclyffe, into selling the hall to Colonel John Birch in 1662, thus ending more than 300 years of his family's occupation.|$|E
5|$|By 1824, the {{material}} available to Buckland consisted of specimen OUM J13505, {{a piece of}} a right lower jaw with a single erupted tooth; OUM J13577, a posterior dorsal vertebra; OUM J13579, an anterior caudal vertebra; OUM J13576, a sacrum of five sacral vertebrae; OUM J13585, a cervical rib; OUM J13580, a rib; OUM J29881, an ilium of the pelvis, OUM J13563, a piece of the pubic bone; OUM J13565, a part of the ischium; OUM J13561, a thighbone and OUM J13572, the lower part of a second metatarsal. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> was aware, these did not all belong to the same individual; only the sacrum was articulated. Because they represented several individuals, the described fossils formed a syntype series. By modern standards, from these a single specimen has to be selected to serve as the type specimen on which the name is based. In 1990, Ralph Molnar chose the famous dentary (front part of the lower jaw), OUM J13505, as such a lectotype. Because he was unaccustomed to the deep dinosaurian pelvis, much taller than with typical reptiles, Buckland misidentified several bones, interpreting the pubic bone as a fibula and mistaking the ischium for a clavicle. Buckland identified the organism as being a giant animal belonging to the Sauria – the Lizards, at the time seen as including the crocodiles – and he placed it in the new genus Megalosaurus, repeating an estimate by Cuvier that the largest pieces he described, indicated an animal twelve metres long in life.|$|E
25|$|By then, I. M. Melik had {{invested}} his {{money into a}} large-scale agricultural venture, on the Moldavian estate of Costeștii Botoșanilor. The purchase took place in March 1885. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> noted, 507 fálce of land (some 726 hectares) were exchanged for his 210,000 lei, cash. This was {{a third of the}} estate, as defined by tradition, and a half of the actual village.|$|E

25|$|After {{retiring}} from playing in 1964, Benaud turned to full-time cricket journalism and commentary, dividing {{his time between}} Britain (where {{he worked for the}} BBC for many years before joining Channel 4 in 1999), and Australia (for the Nine Network). Overall he played in or commentated on approximately 500 Test matches, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> noted in one of his final interviews in Britain when asked if he would miss Test cricket.|$|E
25|$|As a {{means of}} {{escaping}} the pulp mill, Bimba helped {{to establish a new}} cooperative bakery to make rye bread, an important staple food for the immigrant community, becoming a delivery truck driver in the process. He also for the first time came into contact with the Lithuanian socialist movement, and soon came to abandon the Catholicism of his youth for religious freethinking <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> became a socialist.|$|E
25|$|The Illusive Man is {{the leader}} of Cerberus, a pro-human group officially {{regarded}} as a terrorist organisation by the Citadel Council and the humans' Systems Alliance. The character was voiced by Martin Sheen in both Mass Effect 2 and 3. According to Casey Hudson, Sheen really got into the role. Sheen has said he would suck on a pen to simulate smoking when recording lines, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> did not smoke.|$|E

25|$|Following the Civil War Carpenter's {{transformation}} from a Jeffersonian Democrat into a Republican was complete. Despite {{reports that he}} backed President Andrew Johnson's policies, he made speeches supporting the Radical congress. He called for the enfranchisement of African American men and invited members of the Loyal Democracy to join the Republicans, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> did {{in the summer of}} 1867 with his support for Governor Lucius Fairchild's re-election.|$|E
25|$|Historians have {{condemned}} {{the trial of}} the Bonifacio brothers as unjust. The jury was entirely composed of Aguinaldo's men; Bonifacio's defense lawyer acted more like a prosecutor <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> declared Bonifacio's guilt and instead appealed for less punishment; and Bonifacio was not allowed to confront the state witness for the charge of conspiracy {{on the grounds that the}} latter had been killed in battle, but later the witness was seen with the prosecutors.|$|E
25|$|As {{chairman}} of the Division of the Modern Languages Division of Harvard, a position he inherited from Child, Kittredge {{was in a position}} to set graduate degree requirements and he insisted that graduate literature candidates master several foreign languages, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> had done. Neither he nor Child wished the modern languages to replace the study of Greek and Latin, and Kittredge would oppose Harvard president Charles W. Eliot's efforts to abolish Greek as a requirement for graduation.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, Nilsen {{purchased a}} Polaroid camera and photographed Ockenden's body in various suggestive positions. He then lay Ockenden's corpse spreadeagled above {{him on his}} bed as he watched television for several hours, before wrapping the body in plastic bags and stowing the corpse beneath the floorboards. On approximately four occasions over the following fortnight, Nilsen disinterred Ockenden's body from beneath his floorboards and seated the body upon his armchair alongside him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> watched television and drank alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Some of Sanielevici's later {{scholarly}} work evidenced a {{focus on}} ethnography, religious studies and folkloristics. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> noted, these themes preoccupied him during his work for Adevărul. The articles, collected in Literatură şi ştiinţă volume, discussed Romanian ethnography back to the ancient tribes of Dacia: Arta ţăranului romîn este curat mediteraniană ("The Art of the Romanian Peasant Is Plainly Mediterranean"), Rasa, limba şi cultura băştinaşilor Daciei ("The Race, Language and Culture of Dacia's Aboriginals"), Strămoşul nostru aurignacianul ("Our Ancestor, the Aurignacian Man").|$|E
25|$|Stanley Hauerwas {{was raised}} in Pleasant Grove, Texas, in a working-class family. He {{attended}} both Pleasant Grove High School (1954–56) and W. W. Samuell High School (1956–58). As {{the son of a}} bricklayer, Hauerwas was early on apprenticed to the craft of bricklaying under his father. The experience was extremely formative for his later life, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> has often compared the skill and hard work that bricklaying requires with both his own approach to theological work and the challenges of living a fully Christian life.|$|E

25|$|As a {{high school}} student before and after the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Ion Negoiţescu also became interested in politics, and rallied with the Iron Guard, a revolutionary fascist movement which would establish the National Legionary regime (in existence between 1940 and 1941). <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> later recalled, he contributed to the group's press and, wearing the green-colored paramilitary uniform of the Guardists, took part in National Legionary street parades. This choice intrigued his biographers and reviewers of his work, who generally agree that it clashed with the young man's tolerant nature and individualism.|$|E
25|$|As Ottoman {{administrators were}} being {{expelled}} from the Balkans, Batzaria and fellow Aromanian intellectuals tended to support the doomed project of an independent, multi-ethnic, Macedonia. In the short peaceful hiatus which followed his return from London, Batzaria represented the empire in secret talks with Romania's Titu Maiorescu government, negotiating a new alliance against the victorious Kingdom of Bulgaria. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> recalled, the request was refused by Romanian politicians, who stated that they wished to avoid attacking other Christian nations. The Ottoman approach however resonated with Romania's intentions, and both states eventually defeated Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War.|$|E
25|$|Grimm's text-editions {{were mostly}} {{prepared}} {{in conjunction with}} his brother. In 1812 they published the two ancient fragments of the Hildebrandslied and the Weißenbrunner Gebet, Jacob having discovered what till then had never been suspected — namely the alliteration in these poems. However, Jacob had little taste for text editing, and, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> confessed, working on a critical text gave him little pleasure. He therefore left this department to others, especially Lachmann, who soon turned his brilliant critical genius, trained in the severe school of classical philology, to Old and Middle High German poetry and metre.|$|E
