30|$|The {{construct}} ‘commercial competence’ was {{equivalent to}} only some extent in Germany and Switzerland. There are two possible strategies {{to cope with}} this situation that depend on the <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> implementation. First, if a country focuses on adapting an already existing test from another country to save resources, then an alternative—test development—should be considered. In the end, it might be less costly to build the test from scratch. Second, if the focus is on measuring competence in a cross-national setting, then the commonalities of constructs must be identified. Sometimes, commonalities come down to trivial tasks, and if that is the case, the utility of the original comparative study might be of concern.|$|E
40|$|The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> case {{prioritisation}} is {{to determine}} an ordering of test cases that maximises the likelihood of early fault revelation. Previous prioritisation techniques {{have tended to be}} single objective, for which the additional greedy algorithm is the current state-of-the-art. Unlike test suite minimisation, multi objective test case prioritisation has not been thoroughly evaluated. This paper presents an extensive empirical study of the effectiveness of multi objective test case prioritisation, evaluating it on multiple versions of five widely-used benchmark programs and a much larger real world system of over 1 million lines of code. The paper also presents a lossless coverage compaction algorithm that dramatically scales the performance of all algorithms studied by between 2 and 4 orders of magnitude, making prioritisation practical for even very demanding problems.

Every time {{it is not possible}} to perform each and every test case. Hence it is important to decide test cases prioritization. The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>Test</b> case prioritization is to prioritize the test case sequences and finding the faults as early as possible to improve proficiency of testing. Here we define a new prioritization method which prioritizes test cases in descending order for Component Based Software Development (CBSD) using the concept of Prim’s algorithm. Our main aim is to implement and observe the model based test case prioritization algorithm which make use of CIG (Component interaction Graph) as input for a medium / large size CBSD (Component Based Software Development Process) by taking any real-time system as an example and to generate prioritized test cases in descending order...|$|E

The background that makes useful {{the application of the}} flexibility notion to power systems is explained. Some general definitions concerning {{the concept of}} flexibility in more recent scientific literature are reported. A specific and unique definition of transmission system flexibility in respect of the generation changes is proposed. The mathematical model and the calculation methodology of some bulk system flexibility indices are presented. A dedicated tool in Matlab for their computation is briefly shown in its features. The tool is owned by the Italian Transmission System Operator (TERNA) and is in testing for the flexibility evaluation of parts of the Italian National Transmission Grid. An application of the procedure to a real case is presented and the main results are discussed with the <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> the validity of the proposed indices...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{aquaculture}} supplies {{fish products}} to market {{to meet the}} increasing need of fish and fish products in human diet and industry. Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), {{in which there is}} constant reuse of water, offer an extremely resource-efficient way to produce fish. Yet, RAS also need a constant water filtration in order to achieve adequate water parameters and finally quality products. Efforts to increase the effectiveness of the nitrification biofilters and denitrification reactors and to decrease the amount of solid waste in form of fish faeces and waste diet from a RAS are central research topics in this field. The present study aimed: 1) 	To analyze how efficiently fish use the inputs to the RAS system and the content of what is lost (e. g. in fish faeces, foam, waste diet etc) within waste products from a RAS, 2) 	To determine if filtered particulate organic matter, otherwise disposed of as waste, may be used as carbon source in a recycling procedure within RAS and, 3) 	To evaluate the effectiveness of ozone-activated particulate organic matter when used by denitrification bacteria as external carbon source. An experiment was conducted in which individuals of European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax, kept in a RAS, were fed ad libitum with commercial feeds and the amount of solid waste (according to the feeds inputs) from the drum filter and the protein skimmer were determined, sampled before and after feeding and analyzed to examine their carbon, nitrogen and organic matter content (e. g. aminoacids, fatty acids) tested against the commercial feed used. Organic matter content was determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The sampled particulate organic matter from the drum filter was subsequently treated with ozone over various time intervals and its content analyzed to quantify simple carbon substrates feasible for use as carbon source by bacteria in the denitrification reactor. Ozone is commonly used for disinfection purpose and to clear the water from organic compounds responsible of the high turbidity of the water in RAS. It is as well toxic for living organism when higher levels leak to the system. The ozonized samples were tested against commercial carbon sources commonly used for RAS-denitrification at a laboratory scale with the <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> it later on in a real system. The final objective is to evaluate the performance of denitrification reactors using ozone-activated particulate organic matter and to determine its influence on the growth performance of the studied species under these conditions {{as well as on the}} efficiency of the denitrification process. We expect to optimize RAS by recycling the particulate organic matter filtered out from the RAS and to find out the best ozone treatment time for obtaining an efficient denitrification and no collateral damage to the reared organisms or to the bacteria in denitrification reactors and nitrification biofilters. Preliminary results of this pilot study will be presented...|$|E
