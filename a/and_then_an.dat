Their fingers on the triggers, they did not deprive themselves of this pleasure. If one of us had stopped for a second, a sharp shot finished off another filthy son of a bitch.|$|E
5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. The {{first part of the}} ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of the}} head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E

5|$|As British offshoots, the Australian colonies {{participated in}} Britain's small {{wars of the}} 19th century, while later as a federated dominion, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> {{independent}} nation, Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War, {{as well as in}} the wars in Korea, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam during the Cold War. In the Post-Vietnam era Australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions, through the United Nations and other agencies, including in the Sinai, Persian Gulf, Rwanda, Somalia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands, as well as many overseas humanitarian relief operations, while more recently they have also fought as part of multi-lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In total, nearly 103,000 Australians died during the course of these conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Born in Oldham, Lancashire, {{the son of}} a musician, Walton was a chorister <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> {{undergraduate}} at Christ Church, Oxford. On {{leaving the}} university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score.|$|E
5|$|Hargest {{returned}} to New Zealand in May 1919 with his wife, Marie Henrietta Wilkie. The couple {{had been married}} since 1917, the ceremony taking place in England where Marie was serving as a nurse in the New Zealand military hospital at Brockenhurst. Hargest {{returned to}} farming, buying land near Invercargill. He retained {{an interest in the}} military and resumed his career with the Territorials in which he commanded firstly a regiment <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> infantry brigade.|$|E

5|$|He went to Primary School in St. Annes Primary School, Navan. Brosnan's father {{abandoned}} the family when Pierce was an infant. When {{he was four}} years old, his mother moved to London {{to work as a}} nurse. From that point on, he was largely brought up by his grandparents, Philip and Kathleen Smith. After their deaths, he lived with an aunt <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> uncle, but was subsequently sent to live in a boarding house run by a woman named Eileen.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to promoting physical exercise, Isamu Kurosawa {{was open to}} Western traditions and considered theater and motion pictures to have educational merit. He encouraged his children to watch films; young Akira viewed his first movies {{at the age of}} six. An important formative influence was his elementary school teacher Mr Tachikawa, whose progressive educational practices ignited in his young pupil first a love of drawing <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> interest in education in general. During this time, the boy also studied calligraphy and Kendo swordsmanship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century a mine was {{developed}} alongside the River Barle. The mine was originally called Wheal Maria, then changed to Wheal Eliza. It was a copper mine from 1845–54 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> iron mine until 1857, although the first mining activity on the site may be from 1552. At Simonsbath, a restored Victorian water-powered sawmill, which was damaged in the floods of 1992, has now been purchased by the National Park and returned to working order; it is now {{used to make the}} footpath signs, gates, stiles and bridges for various sites in the park.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{processes}} are noncommutative: A person asked <b>a</b> question (<b>A)</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> question (B) may give different answers to each question than {{a person asked}} first (B) <b>and</b> <b>then</b> (<b>A),</b> because asking a question may change the person's state of mind.|$|R

50|$|Trust region {{methods are}} in some sense dual to line search methods: trust region methods first choose a step size (the size of the trust region) <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> step {{direction}} while line search methods first choose <b>a</b> step direction <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> step size.|$|R
5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E
5|$|Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always underground. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa {{the song}} {{is based on an}} almost pure tone at 3.5 kiloHertz, loud enough to make the ground vibrate 20cm all round the burrow; in fact {{the song is}} unique in each species. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the burrow is {{somewhat}} roughly sculpted; in Gryllotalpa vineae, the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. In both species the burrow {{takes the form of a}} double exponential horn with twin openings at the soil surface; at the other end there is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> escape tunnel. A burrow is used for at least a week. The male positions himself head down with his head in the bulb, his tail near the fork in the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Planet Terror makes {{heavy use}} of digital effects {{throughout}} the film. Perhaps {{the most notable}} effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots {{and replaced it with}} computer-generated props—first a table leg <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> M16 rifle. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post-production.|$|E
60|$|Riding {{across the}} gap between the cottages was a string of horsemen, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> grey cart, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> team drawing a heavy object--a gun, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> more horsemen, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> second gun. It was all a dim brown {{procession}} in the moonlight. A mounted officer came up beside him and looked at him <b>and</b> <b>then</b> went back to the cross-roads, but as yet England was not troubling about spies. Four more guns passed, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> string of carts and more mounted men, sitting stiffly. Nobody was singing or shouting; scarcely a word was audible, and through all the column there was an effect of quiet efficient haste. And so they passed, and rumbled and jingled and clattered out of the scene, leaving Mr. Britling in his car in the dreaming village. He restarted his engine once more, and went his way thoughtfully.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was first a furniture <b>and</b> music store, <b>then</b> <b>a</b> billiard parlor during approximately 1920 to 1928 or 1929, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> hotel into the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{instead of}} the crow from Krylov's story, <b>a</b> dog appears, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> cow, <b>and</b> even a Hippopotamus. The {{original}} fox is also replaced by <b>an</b> ostrich <b>and</b> <b>then</b> by <b>a</b> street cleaner.|$|R
5|$|The Hawaiian–Emperor {{seamount}} chain {{is a series}} of volcanoes and seamounts extending across the Pacific Ocean. The chain has been produced by the movement of the ocean crust over the Hawaii hotspot, an upwelling of hot rock from the Earth's mantle. As the oceanic crust moves the volcanoes farther away from their source of magma, their eruptions become less frequent and less powerful until they eventually cease to erupt altogether. At that point erosion of the volcano and subsidence of the seafloor cause the volcano to gradually diminish. As the volcano sinks and erodes, it first becomes an atoll island <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> atoll. Further subsidence causes the volcano to sink below the sea surface, becoming a seamount and/or a guyot. This list documents the most significant volcanoes in the chain, ordered by distance from the hotspot; however, there are many others that have yet to be properly studied.|$|E
5|$|The Mitchell Freeway {{is planned}} to {{continue}} {{north to the}} Metropolitan Region Scheme's boundary, beyond Yanchep and Two Rocks. The state government announced in March 2012 {{the formation of the}} Mitchell Freeway Extension Community Working Group. The group worked with Main Roads Western Australia to investigate options for relieving congestion, with a focus on the next freeway extension. Several options were considered, before the group released a strategic business case in November 2012. The report recommends a staged approach, starting with intersection improvements between 2013 and 2015. This would be followed by a freeway extension to Hester Avenue, by 2017 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> expressway standard extension to Romeo Road, Alkimos by 2021. Half-diamond interchanges are suggested for Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The captain {{asked for}} the descent {{checklist}} at 20:24:24. The fasten seat belt sign was switched on and the flight attendant started the process of preparing the cabin for landing. At 20:24:46 the captain, {{as part of the}} checklist, informed the first officer that they would go down to 1,500 ft at Torghatten and then down to 550ft. This was followed first by a partially unreadable conversation between the captain and the first officers, which included if they were to fill fuel, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> unreadable conversation between the captain and the jump seat passenger. The direction of the VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (DME) at Brønnøysund was checked at 20:26:37.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolution}} of an activity into a sport <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> entertainment is also {{affected by the}} local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of surfing is associated with Hawaii and that of snow skiing probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport {{such as in the}} case of ice hockey—an important entertainment in Canada.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. The iPhone 5 has the shortest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced with only twelve months in production, breaking with Apple's standard practice of selling an existing iPhone model at a reduced price upon {{the release of a}} new model, being replaced as a midrange <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> entry-level device by the iPhone 5C; the 5C internal hardware specifications are almost identical to the 5 albeit having a less expensive polycarbonate exterior. The iPhone 5 supports 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, but not iOS 11 which was released on September 19, 2017. The iPhone 5 is the second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4S.|$|E
5|$|Wild men or savages—usually {{depicted}} carrying staves or clubs, living {{beyond the}} bounds of civilization without shelter or fire, lacking feelings and souls—were then a metaphor for man without God. Common superstition held that long-haired wild men, known as lutins, who danced to firelight either to conjure demons or as part of fertility rituals, lived in mountainous areas such as the Pyrenees. In some village charivaris at harvest or planting time dancers dressed as wild men, to represent demons, were ceremonially captured <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease evil spirits. The church, however, considered these rituals pagan and demonic.|$|E
