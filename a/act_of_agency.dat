5000|$|Jonas {{explores the}} notion of the frame {{extensively}} in Vertical Roll as an expression of “standing one’s ground against external forces.” [...] By recording a CRT playing back video, Jonas creates a frame within a frame, and then creating the image that the frame is collapsing in on itself every half second or so by adjusting the vertical roll on the monitor. While visually excluding the outside world nearly the entire piece, sounds accompanying the crashing frame dictate some kind of external operator attempting to beat along with the CRT’s image, expanding the scope of the piece beyond the video. In the concluding moments of her video Jonas breaks the frame entirely when she inserts her head in between the camera and the monitor, entering from {{the outer edge of the}} frame, destroying the symbolic wall the camera creates and adding another level of spatial fragmentation and self-reflection. The introduction of Jonas' head is an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> independent of the vertical roll. It renders the vertical roll visible and reveals the space of the video to the viewer, shattering its perceptual illusion. The disjunction caused by the concluding moments of this video highlights the implications of video presented, or displayed, in the space of the monitor.|$|E
5000|$|Black {{suffering}} is also {{examined by the}} Martinican philosopher and psychiatrist Frantz Fanon (1925-1961). In his book Black Skin, White Masks (Grove Press, 1967; original French 1952), {{he argued that the}} modern world afforded no model of a normal black adult. Instead, there are the pathologies of the black soul, which he calls a white construction. This problem placed black people in an alienated relationship with language, love, and even their inner dream life. Although he was careful to claim that there are exceptions to these claims, the general situation is as follows. Blacks who master the dominant language are treated either as not really black or receive much suspicion. Worse, they find themselves seeking white recognition, which affirms the role of whites as the standard by which they are judged. The matter repeats itself with love. Black women and black men seeking white recognition do so, he argued, through asking for recognition from white male symbols of authority. That effort is self-deceiving. It makes such black women ask to be loved as white instead of as women, and it makes such black males fail to be men. Fanon also brings out the philosophical problem of reason and its relation to emotions by considering whether a flight into Négritude, the intellectual movement coined by Aimé Césaire, could enable blacks to love themselves by rejecting white reason. But Jean-Paul Sartre's criticism in his essay [...] "Orphée Noir" [...] ("Black Orpheus") led Fanon into [...] "changing his tune" [...] by realizing that such a path was still relative to a white one and faced being overcome in expectations of a [...] "universal" [...] humanity, which for Sartre was a revolutionary working class. Fanon's response was that he needed not to know that, and later on in A Dying Colonialism (Grove Press, 1967; original French 1959), he pointed out that although whites created the Negro, it was the Negro who created Négritude. His point was that it was still an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency,</b> and that theme of being what he called [...] "actional" [...] continued in his writings. At the end of Black Skin, White Masks, he asked his body to make of him a man who questions. Fanon's point was that racism and colonialism attempted to over-determine black existence, but as a question, black existence faced possibility and could thus reach beyond what is imposed upon it. In The Wretched of the Earth (Grove Press, 1963; original French 1961), he returned to this question at the historical level by demanding the transformation of material circumstances and the development of new symbols with which to set afoot a new humanity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In Islamic worldview, Family, as {{the unit}} {{responsible}} for man’s happiness or misery, has {{been regarded as}} the most important pillar of the society. The family unit is formed when a man and woman are called husband and wife through marriage contract. Although very sacred and important, the family unit, when necessary, can be broken through the ways Islam has proposed. The breaking of marriage contract is called ‘divorce’. There are several kinds of divorces. In Islam, divorce is “Ijadee”, i. e. it is men’s prerogative. Like every other vicarious act, divorce can be performed through a deputy. This is possible in two ways: The man can choose a third person as his deputy in divorce. The man can assign the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> to the wife herself. The present study is going to discuss different Islamic sect’s legal and religious commandments of vicarious divorce, its conditions to be mentioned in the marriage contract and its details to be thought to the young couples...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} school non-completion {{continues}} {{to be a matter of}} concern for policy makers and practitioners in Australia today. Despite the efforts of governments and school systems to improve participation and retention rates, often one in three students drop out of school before completing Year 12. Major factors influence non-completion and militate against young people remaining at school. Findings from recent research indicate that some non-completers choose to re-enter education through second chance programs outside the school environment. The argument for second chance education presented in this paper is developed within the context of the ‘risk ’ society and in relation to recent theories of youth transitions. The need for a ‘second chance ’ is justified in relation to recent theories of youth transitions, which suggest that re-entry into second chance education is a personal <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> through which young people struggle to reclaim successful personal and educational identities amidst the constraints and hazards in their daily lives.

40|$|Using Argentine former {{political}} prisoners {{as a case}} study to contribute to the larger field of transitional justice studies, this research addresses three key debates: What is the end goal of transitional justice? Should post-conflict societies recall memories of past violence? Does human rights leave behind those previously involved in popular (and armed) struggles? To answer these questions, I explain the marginalized status of former {{political prisoners}}, investigate the impacts of social and economic discrimination caused by stigmas attached to imprisonment, and analyze the unique role political prisoners play in memorialization efforts. This study is based on 21 months of fieldwork in 2006, 2008, and 2009, conducted in Buenos Aires and in Córdoba with members of the Asociación de Ex Presos Políticos de Córdoba (AEPPC), who were once disappeared and illegally imprisoned for belonging to labor unions, leftist movements, and guerrilla organizations during the last military dictatorship (1976 - 1983). My methods included: participant observation, 39 interviews with political prisoners, five expert interviews, and archival research. I argue {{that in the case of}} Argentina former political prisoners, the goal of transitional justice is to receive financial compensation for being victimized by the state and to have a major role in the construction of collective memories of the past. Remembering the past is seen as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency,</b> rather than of reviving trauma. Finally, when families of the disappeared adopted a human rights framework, they also portrayed disappeared victims as apolitical [...] which effectively excluded political prisoners.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to an understanding}} of why children in urban Ethiopia and elsewhere go to school by accounting for children in one Ethiopian city’s own explanations of! their educational participation, and examining the factors shaping these understandings. The findings demonstrate that, for children in this context, education was both an indicator of a ‘good’ childhood, and the route to social adulthood. Children in Hawassa wanted to go to school in order to become good workers, good people and good national! citizens. Their motivations for going to school often overlapped with dominant arguments for the expansion of education, but went beyond the narrow economic instrumentalism of the human capital approach and challenged the neoliberal individualism that has underpinned much work on human capabilities. The thesis therefore asserts the important contribution that children can make to debates about the purposes of education.

However, it does not instead present attendance as resulting from compulsion or normativity. Rather, it argues that going to school was an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> that arose from children’s ultimate human concerns, and was constrained and enabled by external ‘generative mechanisms’(Bhaskar 1978). These mechanisms included discourses about the morality and power of education, economic structures rendering school attendance necessary for the achievement of desired indicators of adulthood, and government strategies seeking to minimise civil conflict and dissent. ...|$|E
40|$|Architecture is an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency,</b> and a {{technology}} that can be learned by anyone for their own purpose. It evolved as a system of organization and a protective shell for our fragile bodies, a vast, complex technology that enables human survival. Yet despite its universal nature, we have artificially limited our control over it, and who has access to it; we limit its potentials, its adaptive capacities, its diversity, and our continued survival. Walled-up in universities, behind certifications and dissertations, we have removed architecture from the public’s mind so that few understand it and use it. The city, in its surging complexity, is ever more opaque; the systems, infrastructure, and regulations that govern its formation are hidden from view, behind doors, walls, and fences. Hack seeks to make the city legible and architecture accessible, by leveraging a growing tide of hacker culture, and its subcultures – makers and DIY drone enthusiasts – and their respective technologies. Since {{the birth of the}} computer, Hackers have sought to democratize information technology held by military, government, and corporate interests. In doing so they’ve provided a number of methods, that enable free sharing and collaboration between individuals, distributing problem-solving practices, open-source systems, hands-on education, and free access to tools, all applicable to the challenges and opportunities facing architecture and city building today. Hack bootstraps itself to these ideals with hands-on experiments and reflections on those experiments, reframing architecture as a basic skill, {{a technology}} to be used by anyone, democratizing architecture through online communities, and the Hacker culture, in order to define a new active role for the architect.

40|$|Institutional and {{political}} economy approaches have long dominated {{the study of}} post-Communist public broadcasting, {{as well as the}} entire body of post-Communist media transformations research, and the enquiry into publics of public broadcasting has traditionally been neglected. Though media scholars like to talk about a deep crisis in the relationship between public broadcasters and their publics in former Communist bloc countries across Central and Eastern Europe, little has been done to understand the relationship between public broadcasters and their publics in these societies drawing on qualitative audience research tradition. Building on Hirschman’s influential theory of ‘exit, voice and loyalty’, which made it possible to see viewing choices audiences make as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency,</b> in combination with theoretical tools developed within the framework of social constructionist approaches to national imagination and broadcasting, my study focuses on the investigation of responses publics of the Latvian public television LTV have developed vis-à-vis its role as contributing to the nation-building project in this ex-Soviet Baltic country. With the help of focus groups methodology and family ethnography, the thesis aims to explore the relationship between the way members of the ethno-linguistic majority of Latvian-speakers and the sizeable ethno-linguistic minority of Russian-speakers conceptualize the public broadcaster LTV, as well as understand the concept of public broadcasting more generally, and the way they define the national ‘we’. The study concludes that what I call publics of LTV employ Hirschman’s described exit mechanism as a voice-type response. Through their rejection of public television which, for a number of complex reasons they consider to be a state broadcaster serving the interests of those in power they voice their protest against the country’s political establishment {{and in the case of}} its Russian-speaking publics also against the government’s ethno-nationalistic conception of the national ‘we’. I also find that though having exited from the public broadcaster LTV, its publics have not abandoned the idea of public broadcasting as such. At least at a normative level the public broadcasting ideals are recognized, accepted and valued, though they are not necessarily associated with the country’s de jure institutional embodiment of public broadcasting LTV. Rejection of the public television has also not made its non-loyal publics ‘less citizens’. The commercial rivals of LTV, be they national or, in the case of Russian-speaking audiences, localized transnational Russian television, have allowed their viewers to exercise citizenship and be loyal nationals day in day out in a way that is more liberal and flexible than the hegemonic form of citizenship and national imagination of the public television LTV can offer...|$|E
40|$|Cultural {{production}} and labour {{have been the}} subject of considerable research in recent years. But relatively little research has paid attention to workers in the internet industries, especially the Chinese internet industries. This thesis uses ethnographic research to examine the quality of the working life of Chinese internet workers and asks: What is working life like in the Chinese internet industries? And how do workers themselves understand and evaluate their experiences of working life? This thesis examines three main inter-related issues in order to answer these questions. First, the work quality of these workers is evaluated via a framework consisting of work effort or intensity, autonomy and security. Empirical data, collected from three months’ covert observation in a Chinese internet company and two periods of interviews in the industries, shows inequalities and injustices in working life. Second, the social class of internet workers provides a crucial context for understanding their working conditions. Chinese internet workers are understood as part of the lower middle class in contemporary Chinese society. They face ‘proletarianisation’: they suffer a worsening of their working conditions and their collaborative <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> show close relationships with those of the working class. Thirdly, the <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> these workers is analysed, including their negotiation with, and resistance to, the state and businesses. A key argument is that proletarianisation is the result of exploitation, which is understood from a neo-Marxist perspective here: the bureaucratic capitalist class appropriates the labour efforts of the working class and skills of the middle class through ownership of means of {{production and}} exercise of the political authority to allocate these resources. The notion of exploitation is a fundamental mechanism to understand the quality of working life in the industries, as it explains why workers suffer poor working conditions. Workers’ <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> explain why workers still work in the industries, despite such poor conditions, and how they strive to improve them. This research also argues that such acts indicate a ‘bottom up’ force in contemporary China, which suggests the potential to create better working conditions and a better China...|$|R

40|$|This project {{investigates the}} ways in which home is {{conceptualized}} and represented in sixty years of the literature of the Caribbean diaspora in Britain by balancing texts from the post-World War II period with contemporary texts and considering how the diaspora has been imagined and reimagined. Making a home of a diaspora—typically considered as a collection of scattered and ostracized migrants— requires a conceptual leap, <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency,</b> and, sometimes, a flight of imagination. Through the imagery of domesticity and the rhetoric of nationalism, literary analyses of representations of diaspora allow us to explore the imagined constructs of diasporic homes. This project explores how each presents a way of claiming a place as home and illustrates the literary tradition’s meaningful focus on migrants’ ability to create homes or to claim oppression-resistant spaces and lay claim to the nation. In doing so, these texts illustrate that instead of necessarily being a marker of displacement, the diaspora has the potential to provide a sense of home to people removed from their countries of origin. After the Second World War, migration from the British West Indies (the contemporaneous term) to Britain, the “mother country,” increased unprecedentedly as Britain held out the promise of belonging through its colonial hegemony and legal British nationality for colonial subjects, yet migrating black British subjects were overwhelmingly socially excluded. The governmental, political, and popular rhetoric of this exclusion contributed to the level of racism migrants encountered in all areas of life and by 1962 they had been reframed and redefined as invasive foreign immigrants through the debates, bills, acts, memoranda, government reports, editorials, and biased reporting. The literature of the Caribbean diaspora in Britain takes this up as a central thematic concern and, in representing the diaspora, depicts it as shaping Caribbean and black British identity while providing insight into a remarkable confrontation between colonial subjects and colonial power. Literary criticism concerning diaspora texts often focuses on psychological exile, authenticity, or the immigrant writer as a privileged intellectual abroad. Diaspora studies inclusive of the British Caribbean diaspora tend to fall into two groups: those with sociology-based foci on the dispersal of peoples longing for their nations of origin; or cultural studies-based examinations of the significance and experience of nation and multiculturalism. The cumulative result of these approaches has been an emphasis on fragmentation or rupture. This is important, yet the literature of the Caribbean diaspora also represents displacement as potentially unifying as the diaspora itself becomes a home to its members. “At Home in the Diaspora” rethinks experiences of diaspora and contends that migration is not plainly a matter of displacement because diasporic connections complicate {{the ways in}} which we can understand displacement...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundDementia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} mental health problems among older people. Dementia, even in the early stage, may challenge ones quality of life. The diagnosis of dementia entails a diagnosis of the disease as well as a diagnosis of the care needed. This care should be pro-active, aimed at reducing excessive disability, dependency, and suffering, and with a focus on well-being, pleasure and empowerment. Nurses are often confronted with older people with early-stage dementia and may take up an important role in providing pro-active care. The present evidence based guidelines on management of dementia acknowledge the importance of pro-active care, yet the care guidelines mainly focus on pro-active support for the family caregiver and little if not for the person with dementia. Having accurate knowledge of what one experiences when living with dementia is important in order to focus pro-active care towards enhancing quality of life. Qualitative research is fundamentally well suited to obtain an insiders view of living with early-stage dementia. Although there are several studies into the subjective experience of people with dementia, longitudinal research in this area is scarce. Longitudinal research is important as in dementia due to progressive decline the person with early-stage dementia continuously faces new challenges in living with this disease. AimThis study aims at providing a better understanding of what it means for older people to live with early-stage dementia. The study has the purpose to explore how these people come to understand and cope with their changing life due to dementia. The longitudinal aspect of the study aims at exploring which changes may occur in the lived experience over time and what may trigger these changes. This study aims to contribute to the enhancement of pro-active nursing care which allows the person with dementia to receive the care that is beneficial to his or her wellbeing in such a way that it supports her/his dignity and autonomy. MethodsWe performed a longitudinal constructivist grounded theory study. Our initial sample consisted of 20 persons aged 65 years or older recently diagnosed with early-stage dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating 0. 5 or 1) and one or more of their family members. The participants were recruited from five memory clinics in Flanders, Belgium. We included family members in our study sample only for context information. Seventeen elderly persons could be included in the longitudinal study, in which we had for most persons 3 to 4 interviews over a period of 10 to 12 months. Data were collected through open in-depth interviews. In total 74 interviews were conducted: 30 with only the person with dementia, 21 with only family member(s), and 23 with the person and family member(s) together. Interviews were analysed using the constant comparative method and narrative analysis. Data-, analysis-, and researcher triangulation were used to increase the trustworthiness of thefindings. Results The study comprised three major phases. In a first phase the analysis of the first interviews led to a strikingly positive story. In this story the respondents emphasized competences and positive characteristics and minimized problems. This story was in contradiction with the suffering discerned in literature and with the stories of the families. The quest to understand the meaning of these initial findings, resulted in a deeper level of analysis. Interpretative concepts of being valued and not being valued were formulated, and a balance between the two concepts was identified. Careful analysis of our interaction with the participants in the interviews, theoretical constructs of identity and findings from literature review led to the second phase of the analysis in which a model of a struggle to being valued was developed. The generated model proposes that being valued is more central in the lived experience of older people with early-stage dementia, than is their memory loss. However, the model suggests also that these people are constantly balancing their feelings of value and worthlessness, struggling to remain someone of value. This struggle is prompted by threats posed by dementia and by the persons interactions with others. In a third phase we analysed changes over time, in particular with regard to the model that had been developed in the second phase. We identified an on-going struggle to being valued and an important shift in being valued for what you do to being valued for who you are. This progression represents a shift in core values of identity that are performance related toward ones that are existence related, being foremost the ability and power to accept loss. Dependency emerged as an important trigger for this shift. In a final phase the positive story of being valued and the identified shift in being valued were discussed with regard to and integrated within the literature, to illuminate further the meaning of the theoretical model of (a struggle of) being valued. The positive story is considered as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency,</b> expressing that the person still has a mind of his own and is in control of his self and even in control of his world, or at least it may express the desire to do so. The positive story may communicate the need to protect ones self-image from the negative perception of dementia or the request to others to adjust their overly negative perception of dementia (i. e. counterstory). The positive story may also communicate true positivism in the experience of living with early-stage dementia. It may represent the power to remain of value despite loss and the hope one may still flourish as a human being. Discussion These findings suggest that being valued is central in the experience of living with early-stage dementia, and that it can be maintained by accepting loss. However, this is not an acceptance out of surrender, yet it may require a constant struggle. This acceptance may allow the person with dementiato remain autonomous in view of dependency. The positive story as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> may provide a guide for the development of a caring environment. It requires competent nurses who are able and willing to listen carefully and move beyond the exact wording to hear and understand the true story. It requires nurses as competent co-creators of positive stories, especially as dementia may affect the capacity to (re) construct a story or the negative imagery of dementia may lead people with dementia to believe one is no longer able to do so. It requires nurses with an open and authentic attitude that may make the person with dementia feel safe to tell his or her story. The positive story is a story about being valued and supporting value and agency should be central in caregiving, as is the provision of hope. Nurses need to provide care aimed at valuing people with dementia in their uniqueness. Support for the continuity of the (historical value of the) person needs to be carefully balanced with space for adaptation (and growth). Advanced care planning should focus on this potential for positive adaptation, including advice on how to overcome obstacles. Nurses will need to balance along with the person with dementia, gauging when support of value is more appropriate and when understanding for the feeling of not being valued is more appropriate. Counterbalancing may be especially warranted if the person with dementia is not able to shift his or her value and is not able to accept loss without losing hope. Respect for the agency of the person with dementia also means that there should be openness to discuss the value of living when acceptance has reached its limits. Supporting the value and the agency of the person with dementia also means supporting those who are close to the person with dementia. These recommendations for practice pose major challenges to our thinking about care for older people with early-stage dementia, to our thinking about autonomy and dependency of these people, and to the acknowledgment of listening to and co-creation of stories as nursing interventions. This will require adaptations in education and staffing issues. The present model of (a struggle to) being valued needs further elaboration to bring more nuance to the concept of being valued and the process of maintenance of being valued in living with early-stage dementia. Possible influences of socio-cultural diversity, of aging, of disease elements (disease specific diagnosis, non-cognitive psychological and behavioural symptoms, level of awareness), of failures to make the shift in being valued should be further explored. The partnership with family members should be more acknowledged and studied for its importance in maintenance of being valued, as is the lack of social support. Caregiving situations or interventions may be observed to see how they may impede or support being valued. And finally, efforts should be made to maximize openness and the co-constructing between the researcher and the participants with dementia in future research, and this may require innovative research approaches. Findings from this research have important societal value. In our society where productivity prevails, it is important to make people aware that, no matter what, all persons possess important value in their being. Having dementia and losing the ability to be productive does not mean one ceases to exist as a valuable person.

40|$|Abstract During the {{biennium}} 2013 – 2014 Syrian refugees {{started to}} reach Italy through Mediterranean seaborne migration routes, from Libya and Egypt. Their presence contributed to partially modifying {{the configuration of}} the incoming migration flows to Italy, both in terms of socio-demographic composition and access to the European asylum system. Data shows that most of the Syrian refugees who landed in Italy between 2013 and 2014 decided to pursue their journeys to Northern Europe, by overcoming the restrictions imposed by the Dublin Regulation. The article focuses on the phenomenon of transit, as an interesting standpoint from which to observe certain <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> and resistance, put in place by refugees in order to “choose the country where to live” (Denaro, 2016) : the refusal to provide fingerprints during identification, the organization of hunger strikes, the secondary mobility per se. Moreover, the article attempts to shed light on the relational and socio-political context in which these practices have taken shape, by focusing on the construction of relationships with activists and volunteers, and the (explicit and tacit) processes of negotiation which refugees conducted with police authorities and other stakeholders...|$|R

The women in this study gain a sense of achievement from their ability to 'manage' and place great emphasis on being a good mother, thereby fighting against the negative discourse often associated with lone motherhood. It is suggested that coping strategies can be interpreted as <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> consumer <b>agency</b> that can result in consumer empowerment. In contrast with the bleak portrayal of the poor in prior research, we suggest that coping strategies can be instrumental in creating a positive identity...|$|R
40|$|Sine the 1970 s {{when the}} {{battered}} women’s movement brought increased public {{attention to the}} issue of woman battering, a set of domestic violence discourses have emerged. These discourses have been influenced by a variety of social institutions. Through such discourses, the “battered woman” has been represented in specific ways. In this dissertation, I draw from discourse analysis, symbolic interactionism, poststructuralism, and feminist theory in order to explore the relationship between discourse, subjectivity, and the criminalization of domestic violence. Through an examination of current criminal justice domestic violence policy, interviews with prosecutors who work with domestic violence cases and interviews with women who have experienced violence {{in the context of an}} intimate relationship, I examine how domestic violence discourses: (1) re(present) victims of woman battering; (2) influence the interpretive processes of both criminal justice system professionals and battered women in their interactions with one another; and (3) situate and mediate the experiences of both criminal justice system professionals and battered women. I demonstrate that mainstream representations of abused women both enable and limit the self-constructions and presentations of battered women and ultimately impact the women’s experiences, particularly in the context of the criminal justice system. However, as I illustrate, despite being constrained by the institutional power of the criminal justice system, battered women are never completely powerless and are able to engage in <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> and resistance...|$|R

30|$|Many {{theoretical}} {{concepts of}} the refugee camp as a socio-spatial entity were developed based on camps in African countries and the Middle East, most prominently by Agier (2014), Ramadan (2013), Sanyal (2014), and Malkki (1995). In this literature, the refugee camp is usually positioned between “formality and informality, mobility and immobility, permanence and impermanence” (Grbac, 2013, p. 3) as well as exception and norm (Malkki, 2002). Scholars conceptualize these extremes by applying two major theoretical angles. First, camp studies apply an Agambenian and a Foucauldian view to study the camp as a space of exception, biopolitics, and its means of discipline and security. Diken and Laustsen (2005) and Edkins (2000), for example, see camps as spaces that are put into place to control and contain people who “disturb the national order of things” (Turner 2016, p. 139). Hyndman (2000) and Pasquetti (2015) study camps as spaces of discipline, control, order, and governmentality. Second, there are scholars such as Ramadan (2013), Salih (2017), and Redclift (2013), who go beyond {{the notion of the}} camp as a representation of a state of exception and exclusion. They follow the approach of studying camps (also) as sites in which new identities, <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency,</b> political life, and resistance are formed and practiced. Other works focus on various forms of violence and exploitation (Ferris, 2007; Loescher & Milner, 2004) or conceptualize camps as, or in contrast to, cities (Agier, Nice, & Wacquant, 2002; Grbac, 2013).|$|R
50|$|The {{capacity}} of a human {{to act as an}} agent is personal to that human, though considerations of the outcomes flowing from particular <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> human <b>agency</b> for us and others can then be thought to invest a moral component into a given situation wherein an agent has acted, and thus to involve moral agency. If a situation is the consequence of human decision making, persons may be under a duty to apply value judgments to the consequences of their decisions, and held to be responsible for those decisions. Human agency entitles the observer to ask should this have occurred? {{in a way that would}} be nonsensical in circumstances lacking human decisions-makers, for example, the impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy on Jupiter.|$|R
