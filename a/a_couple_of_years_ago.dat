25|$|A genetic {{discrimination}} is possible but difficult, {{since there are}} only a few genetic characteristics that differentiate dingoes from other domestic dogs. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> some scientists from the University of New South Wales developed a relatively reliable method with 20 genetic “fingerprints” using DNA from skin and blood samples to determine the “purity” of a dingo. If one of these “fingerprints” would be found, this would indicate that the examined dog is possibly a hybrid and not a “pure” dingo. The reference group for this test was a group of captive dingoes, thought to cover the whole range of the dingo population. Samples that lay outside of this range would be regarded as hybrids. With increasing development this method might be possible to use on hair and scat samples and provide more exact results.|$|E

She explained, [...] "It was {{all too easy to}} compare our real actors with our puppet characters and descriptions such as 'wooden', 'expressionless', 'no strings attached' and 'puppet-like' were cheap shots some of the UK critics could not resist... Typecasting is the lazy man's friend, and boy, were we typecast in Britain." [...] On Doppelgänger, she said in 1992, [...] "I saw it on TV <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and I was very pleased with it. I thought it came over quite well." ...|$|E

'Yeah, I laughed, but not as hard as <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> So it sucks.' That's nonsense.

500|$|Arjona {{wrote the}} song for his mother, Noemí Morales. She {{told him she}} didn't like it because it make her cry. He said that he [...] "wrote the song {{as a gift for}} my mom in a Mother's Day and two sisters (<b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago)</b> [...] and i thought the idea of {{including}} it on the album was very good". Lyrically, [...] "Mi Novia Se Me Esta Poniendo Vieja" [...] revolves around how a son looks at their mother from a sentimental perspective, with Arjona singing [...] "She loves me either if i gor as a guerrilla, or I won the Nobel Prize for Peace / She does't care if i'm last or first, if i'm going as a conformist or as tenacious." [...] He also said that he never thought to include the song in an album, just as happened with his single [...] "Señora De Las Cuatro Decadas" [...] from Historias back in 1994.|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall also lauded Torv's performance, {{noting that}} the actress [...] "captures Nimoy's staccato delivery, her growling voice, even his trick eyebrow. Not since Zachary Quinto played a young Spock in Star Trek <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> have I seen anyone so perfectly sound and move like Nimoy." [...] Stegall did express a wish that the characters not try to explain every case (such {{as the one in}} the episode) out of a belief that their explanations were often absurd; this observation led Stegall to praise the new character of Lincoln however, as she believed, like Hanson, that the series has [...] "been needing an Everyman in this mix for awhile, someone for whom immortality is not a commonplace." [...] Charlie Jane Anders of io9 was critical of the episode, remarking that [...] "the whole 'soul magnets' thing, which had seemed to be a throwaway comment a few episodes ago, {{is turning out to be}} sort of a weak plot device. And the whole bodily-possession storyline is just perhaps one level of wackiness too far for me. I also had the feeling that this might finally be the acting challenge that was beyond Anna Torv's considerable abilities, as her Leonard Nimoy impression quickly started to grate on my nerves." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 1994, {{the label}} {{arranged}} her {{to fly to}} London and meet with producer Tom Bailey. They recorded the songs [...] "I Want You", [...] "Fly" [...] and [...] "Just Like Honey", which was later re-recorded by Keith Fernley of Bailey's group Babble with {{a different set of}} lyrics and became the song [...] "Father's Field". Lords used lyrics she had previously written in New Zealand based on her personal journals she kept since she was a child. After finishing her recording with Bailey, Lords wanted something with a harder edge to add another dimension to her album. She was introduced to producer Ben Watkins of the electronic group Juno Reactor and decided to incorporate more rave sound. Mainly inspired by the music she would hear at warehouse parties during her stay in London, Lords teamed up with American singer Wonder with whom she created the lyrics to the song [...] "Control". Lords later commented on the inspiration behind the album's sound: [...] "It was in England that I fell in love with techno music. I was working in the UK doing some modelling <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and I was sharing a flat with some other girls in South London. We were really broke, and the cheapest place to go and have a good night out were raves - you could get in for about three bucks. So I went to a lot of raves and clubs, and I {{fell in love with the}} music - it was something that wasn't happening in the States at the time." [...] Lords recorded three more songs with Watkins; [...] "Good-N-Evil", [...] "Outlaw Lover" [...] and [...] "Fallen Angel".|$|E

[...] The character Professor Milton Greene, Jack Donaghy's biological father, was played by guest actor Alan Alda, {{best known for his}} role as Hawkeye Pierce from the television series M*A*S*H. Alda and Alec Baldwin have worked together, having appeared in the 2004 biographical drama film The Aviator. This was Alda's third appearance on the show. After the airing of the season three finale episode [...] "Kidney Now!', in which Jack organizes a benefit concert to get Milton a kidney, it was unknown whether or not the benefit concert for Milton was a success, however, in the season four episode [...] "Into the Crevasse", Milton is shown to have written his book From Peanut to President, a biography of United States President Jimmy Carter. In this episode it is revealed that Jack sent Milton a kidney from British singer-songwriter Elvis Costello who participated in the benefit concert in [...] "Kidney Now!". In October 2010, it was confirmed that Alda would return as his 30 Rock character on the fifth season. In an interview with TV Guide, Alda said that he first met Elaine Stritch twenty years ago [...] "but never worked with her before. I always knew the reunion would be interesting. We kid with each other a lot, and our characters have a common enemy in their son." [...] This was Elaine Stritch's seventh appearance as Colleen Donaghy, Jack's mother, on the series.
