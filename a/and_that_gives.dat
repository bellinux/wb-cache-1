Breach of fiduciary duty may occur in insider trading, when an insider or a related party makes trades in a corporation's securities based on material non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider's duties at the corporation. Breach of fiduciary duty by a lawyer with regard to a client, if negligent, may be a form of legal malpractice; if intentional, it may be remedied in equity.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman, who praised {{both the}} {{previous}} Jurassic Park films, awarded the third film only a C grade, writing [...] "Jurassic Park III has no pretensions {{to be anything}} more than a goose-bumpy fantasy theme-park ride for kids, but it's such a routine ride. Spielberg's wizardry is gone, and his balletic light touch as well, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> too much of this 90-minute movie over to the duller-than-dull characters." [...] Derek Elley of Variety Reviews felt likewise, calling the film [...] "an all-action, helter-skelter, don't-forget-to-buy-the-computer-game ride that makes the two previous installments look like models of classic filmmaking". Ben Varkontine of PopMatters called it [...] "not as good a ride as the first", but [...] "better than the second." [...] Much of the criticism was leveled at the plot as simply a chase movie with no character development; Apollo Movie Guide panned the film as being [...] "almost the same as the first movie" [...] with [...] "no need for new ideas or even a script". Empire magazine gave the film 3 stars out of 5, commenting that it was [...] "Short, scrappy and intermittently scary" [...] and that the film ultimately [...] "skews young".|$|E

[...] Fazekas also said that seeds for a third season had been planted all throughout the second, and {{that the end of the}} second season, with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M. Carter file, was [...] "very much tied to a third season arc", with the shooter and their reason for taking the file already determined. Atwell added that the third season would have gone [...] "further back into [...] past” while having [...] "a possible kind of twist... into something to do with [...] family." [...] She also added that more insight would have been provided on Carter's brother, Michael.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} at Stevenage, Boyd earned the {{nickname}} [...] "The White Pelé" [...] – this was down to his use of tricks, {{as well as the}} amount of flair Boyd brought to the team at such a young age. Stevenage manager Graham Westley, who gave Boyd his first run of matches in the first-team, described Boyd as a [...] "special talent" [...] following his two goals away at Woking in August 2005. Westley proceeded to call Boyd [...] "gifted", and a player with [...] "fantastic technical ability". He has been labelled a creative and flamboyant midfielder, and described as [...] "a player who will create goalscoring opportunities all game long". Boyd has stated that he considers assisting goals a [...] "big part of his game", and says [...] "I try to create chances for other players <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> me just as much pleasure as scoring". Boyd's creative nature is emphasised {{by the fact that he}} has assisted over 50 goals for Peterborough during {{his time at}} London Road. Peterborough United manager Darren Ferguson has said that Boyd [...] "has the tendency, and ability, to score goals from long distance", talking after Boyd's 35-yard volley against Boston United. This was further highlighted when Boyd scored from just inside the opposition's half in a win against Huddersfield Town in October 2012. Boyd collected a Saido Berahino knock-down, before hitting a dipping volley from the edge of the centre circle. Manager Darren Ferguson stated — [...] "If Lionel Messi had done it you'd be seeing it over again. For vision and execution it was one of the best I have seen". Boyd also scored several long range goals during his time at Stevenage, scoring from outside the area on seven different occasions; most notably on the half-volley from 30 yards in a match against Cambridge United in January 2006.|$|E
