5|$|Data for the abelisaurid forelimbs {{are known}} from Eoabelisaurus and the carnotaurines Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus. All had small forelimbs {{which seem to}} have been vestigial. The bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) were {{extremely}} short, only 25% of the length of the upper arm (humerus) in Carnotaurus and 33% in Aucasaurus. The entire <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> held straight, and the elbow joint was immobile.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1940, the {{principal}} {{concern of the}} Royal Air Force, together with elements of the Fleet Air <b>Arm,</b> <b>was</b> to contest the control of British airspace with the German Luftwaffe. For the Germans, achieving at least local air superiority was an essential prerequisite to any invasion.|$|E
50|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>arm</b> <b>is</b> {{a machine}} that mimics the action of a human <b>arm.</b> Mechanical <b>arms</b> <b>are</b> composed of multiple beams connected by hinges powered by actuators. One end of the <b>arm</b> <b>is</b> attached to a firm base while the other has a tool. They can be controlled by humans either directly or over a distance. A computer-controlled mechanical <b>arm</b> <b>is</b> called a robotic arm. However, a robotic <b>arm</b> <b>is</b> {{just one of many}} types of different mechanical arms.|$|R

5|$|On 19October 1936, the air <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> reorganised, and {{renamed the}} Schweizerische Flugwaffe (Department of Aviation and Anti-Aircraft Defense), {{becoming}} an autonomous service under the Swiss Federal Military Department, {{analogous to the}} organizational autonomy of the United States Army Air Forces within the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|The giant ground sloth Megatherium is {{from the}} Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in South America, where Charles Darwin had {{excavated}} some fossils in 1835. The model was built hugging a live tree which subsequently grew and broke the model's arm. The <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> replaced and later the tree died. This model {{used to be in}} the children's zoo which has now been demolished.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air <b>Arm</b> <b>was</b> {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E
50|$|Heraldic {{courtesy}} or courtoisie is a {{term used}} in heraldry when two <b>arms</b> <b>are</b> combined next to each other. The dexter <b>arms</b> <b>is</b> mirror-imaged so its charge is turned towards the sinister arms, out of courtesy. This is usually done, when the <b>arms</b> <b>are</b> showing an alliance.|$|R

25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Holy Roman Empire, <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> no longer granted to burghers except in the Kingdom of Saxony, where such grants {{continued}} from 1911 until 1918.

5|$|Eagle {{spent the}} first nine months of World War II in the Indian Ocean searching for German {{commerce}} raiders. During the early part of the war, the Fleet Air <b>Arm</b> <b>was</b> desperately short of fighters and Eagle was equipped solely with Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers until late 1940. She was transferred to the Mediterranean in May 1940, where she escorted convoys to Malta and Greece and attacked Italian shipping, naval units and bases in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ship also participated in the Battle of Calabria in July but her aircraft failed to score any hits when they attempted to torpedo Italian cruisers during the battle. Whenever Eagle was not at sea, her aircraft were disembarked and used ashore.|$|E
5|$|Nine days later, {{he checked}} into Methodist Hospital in Houston {{for a series}} of {{physical}} and psychological tests to determine the cause of his mysterious arm problems. An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and axillary arteries of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.|$|E
5|$|Stormy weather {{can cause}} the sea level by the coast to rise by up to two metres. In the past, this has caused {{disastrous}} flooding in the town, {{the worst in the}} town's history being in 1953. Coastal defences were subsequently constructed including groynes, sea walls and shingle beach. In the 1990s, these defences were deemed to be inadequate and an offshore breakwater, now known as Neptune's <b>Arm,</b> <b>was</b> built to protect the most vulnerable areas of the town.|$|E

He achieved a probable victory during the battle. In late 1940 {{he transferred to}} Malta in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations and joined No. 261 Squadron RAF. By February 1941 he had achieved eight victories (two at night) and was awarded a Bar to his DFC. MacLachlan was wounded in action on 16 February 1941. His <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> so severely damaged it was amputated, but he returned to operations in November 1941 with an artificial limb.|$|E
5|$|The February 1953 {{merger of}} ABC and United Paramount Theatres {{lead to the}} {{divestiture}} of WBKB (now WBBM-TV), which was sold to CBS. Paramount retained KTLA and applied to the FCC for a new station in Boston, but the construction permit was never granted. By this time, Paramount's television <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> called Paramount TV Productions, Incorporated; Paramount ceased using the PTN name. The company continued to distribute programs nationally, however, and continued to sign network affiliation agreements with local television stations.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Junction Canal {{came through}} the area between 1793 and 1800, with canal-side wharfs in Fenny Stratford, Great Linford, Bradwell and Wolverton. The route {{bypassed}} Newport Pagnell but, in 1817, an <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> dug to it from Great Linford. Trade along the canal stimulated the local economy. A large brickworks was established near the canal in Great Linford: two bottle kilns and the clay pits can still {{be seen on the}} site. Pottery from the Midlands begins to appear in excavations of dwellings from that period.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} {{arm of the}} Polish Underground State consisted {{primarily of}} various branches of the Armia Krajowa (AK) and, until 1942, the Union of Armed Struggle. This arm of the state was designed to prepare the Polish society for a future fight for the country's liberation. Apart from armed resistance, sabotage, intelligence, training, and propaganda, the state's military <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> responsible for maintaining communication with the London-based government in exile, and for protecting the civilian arm of the state.|$|E
5|$|The torch-bearing <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> {{displayed}} at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar. The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.|$|E

On the left <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> a Croatian armshield (red-white {{chessboard}}) {{and on the}} right an Edelweiss flower patch. The chessboard armshield was controversial, especially with the imams, who, after crossing the Sava river, removed them. Former SS personnel serving in the division were entitled to wear a Sig Rune badge that {{was attached to the}} left breast pocket of the tunic.|$|E

5|$|Two new {{characters}} {{were introduced in}} this episode. The first, Nelson Muntz, remains a frequently used recurring character, while the second, Herman, has been used far less. The design of Herman, {{with the exception of}} his missing <b>arm,</b> <b>was</b> inspired by writer John Swartzwelder. His voice, as performed by Harry Shearer, was partly inspired by George H. W. Bush. The original idea for Herman was for him to have a differing story for the loss of his arm with every appearance.|$|E
5|$|Yugoslav naval {{policy in}} the interwar period lacked {{direction}} until the mid-1920s, although it was generally accepted that the Adriatic coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of submarines, coastal torpedo boats, torpedo bombers and conventional bomber aircraft to perform this role. The Hrabri-class submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge.|$|E
5|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern {{technology}} {{to attempt to}} re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> raised {{in the manner of}} one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.|$|E
