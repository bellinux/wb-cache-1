25|$|The common {{elements}} of the lattice and ring bases are the constants 0 and 1, and an associative commutative binary operation, called meet x∧y in the lattice basis, and multiplication xy in the ring basis. The distinction is only terminological. The lattice basis has the further operations of join, x∨y, and complement, ¬x. The ring basis has instead the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operation</b> x⊕y of addition (the symbol ⊕ is used in preference to + because the latter is sometimes given the Boolean reading of join).|$|E
25|$|The IEEE floating-point standard, {{supported}} by almost all modern floating-point units, specifies that every floating point <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operation,</b> including division by zero, has a well-defined result. The standard supports signed zero, {{as well as}} infinity and NaN (not a number). There are two zeroes: +0 (positive zero) and −0 (negative zero) and this removes any ambiguity when dividing. In IEEE 754 arithmetic, a÷+0 is positive infinity when a is positive, negative infinity when a is negative, and NaN when a=±0. The infinity signs change when dividing by −0 instead.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations</b> such as addition, {{subtraction}} and multiplication {{are also}} T-functions (triangular T-functions), software-efficient word-based T-functions {{can be constructed}} by combining bitwise logic with <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations.</b> Another important property of T-functions based on <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations</b> is predictability of their period, which is highly attractive to cryptographers. Although triangular T-functions are naturally vulnerable to guess-and-determine attacks, well chosen bitwise transpositions between rounds can neutralize that imbalance. In software-efficient ciphers, {{it can be done}} by interleaving <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations</b> with byte-swapping operations and to a small degree with bitwise rotation operations. However, triangular T-functions remain highly inefficient in hardware.|$|R
40|$|AbstractStandby {{redundant}} {{system is a}} powerful tool to enhance the reliability, availability, quality, and safety of operational plants. This study proposed an approximate Tω (the weakest t-norm) fuzzy Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT) simulation technology to simulate two-unit standby {{redundant system}} reliability. The approximate fuzzy <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations</b> employ principle of interval arithmetic under the Tω <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations.</b> Therefore, the novel fuzzy <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations</b> may obtain fitter decision values, which have smaller fuzziness accumulating, under vague environment. In numerical examples the approximate fuzzy <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations</b> has evidenced that it can successfully calculate results of fuzzy <b>operations</b> as interval <b>arithmetic,</b> and can more effectively reduce fuzzy spreads. In the real fuzzy repairable reliability model the performance also shows that the approximate fuzzy <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations</b> successfully simulate/analyze the two-unit standby redundant system reliability and obtain more confident fuzzy results under vague environment...|$|R
5000|$|The level-index (LI) {{representation}} of numbers, and its algorithms for <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations,</b> were introduced by Clenshaw and Olver in 1984. [...] The symmetric {{form of the}} LI system and its <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations</b> were presented by Clenshaw and Turner. Anuta, Lozier, Schabanel and Turner developed the algorithm for symmetric level-index (SLI) arithmetic, and a parallel implementation of it. There has been extensive work on developing the SLI arithmetic algorithms and extending them to complex and vector <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|R
25|$|The first aids to {{computation}} were purely mechanical devices {{which required}} the operator {{to set up}} the initial values of an elementary <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operation,</b> then manipulate the device to obtain the result. Later, computers represented numbers in a continuous form, for instance distance along a scale, rotation of a shaft, or a voltage. Numbers could also be represented in the form of digits, automatically manipulated by a mechanical mechanism. Although this approach generally required more complex mechanisms, it greatly increased the precision of results. A series of breakthroughs, such as miniaturized transistor computers, and the integrated circuit, caused digital computers to largely replace analog computers. The cost of computers gradually became so low that by the 1990s, personal computers, and then, in the 2000s, mobile computers, (smartphones and tablets) became ubiquitous in industrialized countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{arithmetic}} operations {{required to perform}} row reduction {{is one way of}} measuring the algorithm's computational efficiency. For example, to solve a system of n equations for n unknowns by performing row operations on the matrix until it is in echelon form, and then solving for each unknown in reverse order, requires n(n+1) / 2 divisions, (2n3 + 3n2 − 5n)/6 multiplications, and (2n3 + 3n2 − 5n)/6 subtractions, for a total of approximately 2n3 / 3 operations. Thus it has arithmetic complexity of O(n3); see Big O notation. This arithmetic complexity is a good measure of the time needed for the whole computation when the time for each <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operation</b> is approximately constant. This is the case when the coefficients are represented by floating point numbers or when they belong to a finite field. If the coefficients are integers or rational numbers exactly represented, the intermediate entries can grow exponentially large, so the bit complexity is exponential.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{conception}} is Benthamite philosophy, which equated usefulness {{with the}} production of pleasure and avoidance of pain, assumed subject to <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operation.</b> British economists, {{under the influence of}} this philosophy (especially by way of John Stuart Mill), viewed utility as [...] "the feelings of pleasure and pain" [...] and further as a [...] "quantity of feeling" [...] (emphasis added).|$|E
2500|$|In {{elementary}} school teaching, integers are often intuitively {{defined as the}} (positive) natural numbers, [...] zero, and the negations of the natural numbers. However, this style of definition leads to many different cases (each <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operation</b> needs to be defined on each combination of types of integer) and makes it tedious to prove that these operations obey the laws of arithmetic. Therefore, in modern set-theoretic mathematics a more abstract construction, which allows one to define the arithmetical operations without any case distinction, is often used instead. The integers can thus be formally constructed as the equivalence classes of ordered pairs of natural numbers [...]|$|E

2500|$|IEEE 754 {{specifies}} {{a special}} value called [...] "Not a Number" [...] (NaN) {{to be returned}} {{as the result of}} certain [...] "invalid" [...] operations, such as 0/0, ∞×0, or sqrt(−1). [...] In general, NaNs will be propagated i.e. most operations involving a NaN will result in a NaN, although functions that would give some defined result for any given floating-point value will do so for NaNs as well, e.g. NaN ^ 0 = 1. There are two kinds of NaNs: the default quiet NaNs and, optionally, signaling NaNs. A signaling NaN in any <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operation</b> (including numerical comparisons) will cause an [...] "invalid" [...] exception to be signaled.|$|E
2500|$|Tally {{counters}} or marks: discrete, indistinguishable {{objects or}} marks {{of only one}} sort suitable for the model. In the most-reduced counter machine model, per each <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operation</b> only one object/mark is either added to or removed from its location/tape. In some counter machine models (e.g. Melzak (1961), Minsky (1961)) and most RAM and RASP models more than one object/mark can be added or removed in one operation with [...] "addition" [...] and usually [...] "subtraction"; sometimes with [...] "multiplication" [...] and/or [...] "division". Some models have control operations such as [...] "copy" [...] (variously: [...] "move", [...] "load", [...] "store") that move [...] "clumps" [...] of objects/marks from register to register in one action.|$|E
2500|$|Here, the {{required}} default method of handling exceptions according to IEEE 754 is discussed (the IEEE-754 optional trapping and other [...] "alternate exception handling" [...] modes are not discussed). Arithmetic exceptions are (by default) {{required to be}} recorded in [...] "sticky" [...] status flag bits. That they are [...] "sticky" [...] means {{that they are not}} reset by the next (<b>arithmetic)</b> <b>operation,</b> but stay set until explicitly reset. The use of [...] "sticky" [...] flags thus allows for testing of exceptional conditions to be delayed until after a full floating-point expression or subroutine: without them exceptional conditions that could not be otherwise ignored would require explicit testing immediately after every floating-point operation. By default, an operation always returns a result according to specification without interrupting computation. For instance, 1/0 returns +∞, while also setting the divide-by-zero flag bit (this default of ∞ is designed so as to often return a finite result when used in subsequent operations and so be safely ignored).|$|E

40|$|The {{software}} implementations of cryptographic algorithms {{are considered}} to be very slow, when there are requirements of multi-precision <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations</b> on very long integers. These <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations</b> may include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation. Several research papers have been published providing different solutions to make these operations faster. Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a cryptographic application that requires multi-precision <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations.</b> These <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations</b> are mostly based upon modular multiplication and exponentiation on integers of the size of 1024 bits. The use of such numbers {{is an essential part of}} providing high security against the cryptanalytic attacks on the authenticated messages. When these operations are implemented in software, performance in terms of speed becomes very low. The major focus of the thesis is the study of various <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operations</b> for public key cryptography and selecting the fast multi-precision arithmetic algorithms for hardware implementation. These selected algorithms are implemented in hardware and software for performance comparison and they are used to implement Digital Signature Algorithm for performance analysis...|$|R

2500|$|Rounding is {{used when}} the exact {{result of a}} floating-point {{operation}} (or a conversion to floating-point format) would need more digits than there are digits in the significand. IEEE 754 requires correct rounding: that is, the rounded result is as if infinitely precise arithmetic was used to compute the value and then rounded (although in implementation only three extra bits are needed to ensure this). There are several different rounding schemes (or rounding modes). Historically, truncation was the typical approach. Since the introduction of IEEE 754, the default method (round to nearest, ties to even, sometimes called Banker's Rounding) is more commonly used. This method rounds the ideal (infinitely precise) result of an <b>arithmetic</b> <b>operation</b> to the nearest representable value, and gives that representation as the result. In {{the case of a}} tie, the value that would make the significand end in an even digit is chosen. The IEEE 754 standard requires the same rounding to be applied to all fundamental algebraic operations, including square root and conversions, when there is a numeric (non-NaN) result. It means that the results of IEEE 754 operations are completely determined in all bits of the result, except for the representation of NaNs.
