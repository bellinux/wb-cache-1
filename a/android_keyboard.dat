2500|$|GO Keyboard [...] virtual <b>Android</b> <b>{{keyboard}}</b> apps (GO Keyboard - Emoji {{keyboard and}} GO Keyboard - Emoticon keyboard) transmit personal information to its remote servers without explicit users' consent. This information includes user's Google account email, language, IMSI, location, network type, Android version and build, and device's model and screen size. The apps also download and execute a code from a remote server, breaching the Malicious Behavior {{section of the}} Google Play privacy policies. Some of these plugins are detected as Adware or PUP by many Anti-Virus engines, while the developer, a Chinese company GOMO Dev Team, claims in the apps' description that they will never collect personal data including credit card information. The apps with about 2 million users in total were caught on spying on September 2017 by security researches from AdGuard who then reported their findings to Google.|$|E

40|$|With {{the rise}} of current smartphones, virtual {{keyboards}} for touchscreens became the dominant mobile text entry technique. We developed a typing game that records how users touch on the standard <b>Android</b> <b>keyboard</b> to investigate users' typing behaviour. 47, 770, 625 keystrokes from 72, 945 installations have been collected by publishing the game. By visualizing the touch distribution we identified a systematic skew and derived a function that compensates this skew by shifting touch events. By updating the game we conduct an experiment that investigates the effect of shifting touch events, changing the keys' labels, and visualizing the touched position. Results based on 6, 603, 659 keystrokes and 13, 013 installations show that visualizing the touched positions using a simple dot decreases the error rate of the <b>Android</b> <b>keyboard</b> by 18. 3 % but also decreases the speed by 5. 2 % with no positive effect on learnability. The <b>Android</b> <b>keyboard</b> outperforms the control condition but the constructed shift function further improves the performance by 2. 2 % and decreases the error rate by 9. 1 %. We argue that the shift function can improve existing keyboards at no costs...|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} mobile phones today are built with either full QWERTY {{keyboards}} or software implementations {{of them on}} a touch screen. Sometimes the keyboard pattern can be changed {{by means of a}} freeware third-party utility, such as Hacker's <b>Keyboard</b> for <b>Android,</b> AE <b>Keyboard</b> Mapper for Windows Mobile, or KeybLayout for Symbian OS.|$|R

30|$|Our results motivate {{a number}} of {{possible}} directions for future work. Existing touch models have assumed a single usage context, or considered coarse differences between stationary and walking users but ignored finer details. Commercial models can be quite basic — for example, early versions of the <b>Android</b> <b>keyboard</b> simply moved all touches up by ten pixels. Our results motivate a more nuanced approach. Gait phase angle, or other local movement predictions could be extracted at an operating system level and used to improve the input accuracy for all touches, not just those related to typing. Based on our results, this could have a related impact on use of small form factor devices like smartwatches. In general, our analysis reinforces the need for developers to consider the behaviour of users in multiple contexts, and tune their input techniques accordingly. This also points to another potential research area: accurate detection of these usage contexts and smooth adjustment of corrective behaviour.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, Kogan {{released}} {{a series of}} new products into its line, starting in January with its <b>Android</b> wireless <b>keyboard</b> and track pad. The device, which claims a distance of 20 meters unobstructed wireless range, works with almost anything which has a USB including Android, Linux, Windows, and OSX as well as Smart TV's, Xbox, PlayStation, and Home Theatre Systems. Soon after, Kogan.com added brand name tech products such as the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5, iPad 2 and the Apple MacBook air, selling them at discount prices.|$|R

50|$|The RIM BlackBerry lines {{offer only}} QWERTY and its {{localized}} variants AZERTY and QWERTZ. Apple's iOS 8.0 and later has {{the option to}} install onscreen keyboards from the App Store, which includes several free and paid Dvorak layouts. iOS 4.0 and later supports external Dvorak <b>keyboards.</b> Google's <b>Android</b> OS touchscreen <b>keyboard</b> can use Dvorak and other nonstandard layouts natively as of version 4.1.|$|R
5000|$|On <b>Android</b> devices, user-created <b>keyboards</b> can be used. [...] iOS {{devices have}} fully {{supported}} the Welsh language since {{the release of}} iOS 8 in September 2014. Users can switch their device to Welsh to access apps that are available in Welsh. Date and time on iOS is also localised, {{as shown by the}} built-in Calendar application, as well as certain third party apps that have been localized.|$|R
25|$|Gboard {{features}} Google Search, including web {{results and}} predictive answers, easy searching and sharing of GIF and emoji content, a predictive typing engine suggesting the next word depending on context, and multilingual language support. Updates to the keyboard have enabled additional functionality, including GIF suggestions, options for a dark color theme or adding a personal image as the keyboard background, support for voice dictation, next-phrase prediction, and hand-drawn emoji recognition. At {{the time of}} its launch on iOS, the keyboard only offered support for the English language, with more languages being gradually added in the following months, whereas on <b>Android,</b> the <b>keyboard</b> supported more than 100 languages at the time of release.|$|R
40|$|Advances {{in mobile}} device have enabled a {{various types of}} mobile {{applications}} to be developed for users beyond mobile communication services. In recent years, {{there has been an}} increasing interest in text entry with less popular and minority languages on mobile devices since the arrival of on-screen input method, which known as virtual keyboard. This work presents the first attempt to design and implement an <b>Android</b> SMS virtual <b>keyboard</b> called Tifinagh SMSK, which supports the Berber text entry for Android devices, enables the Berber native speakers to create, send and read its Tifinagh SMS messages. This tiny application has been implemented and tested on Android based smartphones and the outcome shows that it works correctly as intended...|$|R
3000|$|In {{face-to-face}} communication, a {{wide variety}} of functional verbal (e.g., stress, intonation, tone, etc.) and nonverbal (e.g., body language, dress, facial expression, etc.) tools can facilitate the achievement of the communicative goal for both parties. However, such virtual communication circumstances as forum, blog, instant messaging, which are mainly based on written texts, make verbal communication incomplete due to absence of suprasegmental features, and make it even impossible for the participants to use conventional nonverbal tools for smooth and successful communication. Lupyan & Dale (2016) reported that four groups of Instagram posts increased in emoji use by 30 %– 40 % in 2015 compared with that in the last 2 – 3  years, and there was a gradual decrease in the use of text-based slang, suggesting that emojis are replacing the functions served by text-based slang in recent years. In fact, not only slangs but other forms of written texts are now rapidly giving way to emojis. Extremely fast development of technology also accelerates the process. Almost 40 % Instagram posts in 2015 contained at least one emoji, which was a dramatic increase of 40 % compared with those in 2012, because of Apple and <b>Android</b> releasing emoji <b>keyboard</b> and Instagram launching on Android platform (Lupyan & Dale, 2016). Emoji has gone so viral that Oxford Dictionaries even named [...]...|$|R
