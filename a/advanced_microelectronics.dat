50|$|A {{series of}} {{targeting}} pods {{have been developed}} for LT LGB/PGB. The earliest samples are widely publicized in China, in photographs showing it's been carried by Nanchang Q-5. This early example of targeting pod has a diameter of 0.36 meter and weighs 250 kg, and for alternative targeting, the ground laser designator is used, weighing at 32 kg. Later models would use <b>advanced</b> <b>microelectronics</b> to reduce the size and weight of all of these targeting systems. The targeting pod for more advanced LT-3 can also be used for less sophisticated LT-2, but not vice versa. Alternatively, LT PGB can also be guided by any general purpose targeting pods, such as FILAT. In comparison to the more complex FILAT, the dedicated laser targeting pods are less costly. Chinese media have shown photographs of FT PGB being dropped from helicopters such as Chinese Naval Ka-28, in addition to the fixed winged platforms. However, neither nose-mounted nor mast-mounted targeting turrets have been specially developed for rotary platforms, but instead, the targeting pods for fixed winged platforms are carried directly by Chinese helicopters for targeting. The range of LT-2 is between 10 and 15 km, and the maximum time during which the bomb is guided is around 20 seconds, and the sensor mounted on LT-2 has a maximum range of 4 km. Similar information for LT-3 has not been released yet, but it is quoted to be greater than that of LT-2 by the developer at the defense exhibitions.|$|E
