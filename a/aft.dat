5|$|The guns on {{the forward}} turret roof were {{transferred}} to the superstructure in 1914 and the guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the <b>aft</b> superstructure in 1914–1915; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the <b>aft</b> turrets. Shortly afterwards, the {{guns on the}} <b>aft</b> turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} <b>aft</b> turret roof.|$|E
5|$|The pole {{foremast}} {{was modified}} to a tripod after 1916. This {{was due to}} the increased weight of masthead fire-control equipment associated with director firing. In 1917 Lion and Princess Royal received searchlight towers on the <b>aft</b> funnel and mainmast while losing one four-inch gun each from the <b>aft</b> battery. In early 1918, both ships received flying-off platforms on 'Q' and 'X' turrets for Sopwith Pup and Sopwith 1½ Strutter aircraft, and Lion was fitted with a torpedo control station at the <b>aft</b> end of her <b>aft</b> superstructure.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. The guns on the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 and the roof guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the <b>aft</b> superstructure about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the <b>aft</b> turrets. Shortly afterwards, the guns on the <b>aft</b> turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} <b>aft</b> turret roof.|$|E
5|$|Australia carried eight BL 12-inch Mark X guns in four BVIII* twin turrets; {{the largest}} guns fitted to any Australian warship. Two turrets were mounted fore and <b>aft</b> on the centreline, {{identified}} as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard and <b>aft.</b> Each wing turret had some limited ability to {{fire to the}} opposite side. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 4-inch Mark VII guns positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two submerged tubes for 18-inch torpedoes, {{one on each side}} <b>aft</b> of 'X' barbette, and 12 torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|Canada was {{transferred}} to the 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916. In 1917–18, she was fitted with better rangefinders and range dials, and two of the <b>aft</b> 6-inch secondary guns were removed after they suffered blast damage from the middle 14-inch turret. In the latter year, flying-off platforms for aircraft were added atop the superfiring turrets fore and <b>aft.</b> Canada was put into the reserve fleet in March 1919.|$|E
5|$|The {{forward section}} lies on its port side, with the {{amidships}} section keel up. The stern section {{rises from the}} seabed at an angle. This position shows the rudder locked into a 20° port turn, confirming that orders had been given (just prior to the <b>aft</b> magazines detonating) to change the ship's heading and bring the <b>aft</b> turrets 'X' and 'Y' {{to bear on the}} German ships.|$|E
5|$|A Type 271 surface {{search radar}} {{replaced}} the fire-control director and rangefinder above the bridge. A Type 290 surface warning radar was added {{at the top}} of the foremast. A High frequency direction finding system was added on a pole mast <b>aft.</b> The ship also received a Type 242 IFF system. Two 4.7-inch guns were removed, one each forward and <b>aft,</b> and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The 3-inch anti-aircraft gun amidships was also removed, but the number of 20mm AA guns was increased to six.|$|E
5|$|After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to {{join the}} rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow {{observed}} Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the <b>aft</b> airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the <b>aft</b> door was open.|$|E
5|$|Although no flight-deck cruisers {{were ever}} {{built by the}} U.S. Navy, the Soviet Union's , {{developed}} in the 1970s, is remarkably {{similar to that of}} the original flight-deck cruiser design, featuring an angled flight deck <b>aft</b> with anti-ship missile launchers forwards. In addition, during the early 1980s, plans were proposed for the reactivation of the U.S. Navy's Iowa-class battleships that entailed the removal of each ship's <b>aft</b> turret and the installation of a flight deck for operating V/STOL aircraft; in the end a much more modest conversion, lacking the flight deck, was carried out.|$|E
5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the <b>aft</b> magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss <b>aft.</b> The ship's main water pump also {{appears to have been}} damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss <b>aft</b> made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Defence {{received}} a QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 12 cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun and a QF 3-pounder (47mm) AA gun in 1915–16. The 12-pounder gun was {{mounted on the}} <b>aft</b> superstructure and the 3-pounder on the quarterdeck at the extreme rear.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the <b>aft</b> funnel to do that, which rendered the <b>aft</b> spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Mir was {{primarily}} {{supported by the}} Russian Soyuz and Progress spacecraft and had two ports available for docking them. Initially, the fore and <b>aft</b> ports of the core module {{could be used for}} dockings, but following the permanent berthing of Kvant-1 to the <b>aft</b> port in 1987, the rear port of the new module took on this role from the core module's <b>aft</b> port. Each port was equipped with the plumbing required for Progress cargo ferries to replace the station's fluids and also the guidance systems needed to guide the spacecraft for docking. Two such systems were used on Mir; the rear ports of both the core module and Kvant-1 were equipped with both the Igla and Kurs systems, whilst the core module's forward port featured only the newer Kurs.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September 2010, an {{incident}} occurred in Queen Mary 2s <b>aft</b> harmonic filter room. This {{resulted in the}} shutdown of all four propulsion motors {{and a loss of}} electrical power throughout the ship. Within an hour, the ship's main generators were restarted and it was able to resume passage. The later investigations finding revealed that an explosion was caused by electrical arcing within the <b>aft</b> harmonic filter igniting leaked dielectric fluid vapour.|$|E
5|$|The canopy glazing was {{extended}} <b>aft</b> {{to improve the}} view to the rear which allowed for the installation of a shelf behind the pilot for an RSI-1 radio (later upgraded to an RSI-4).|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{was divided into}} three decks, the upper two for passengers and the lower for cargo. The two passenger decks were divided into forward and <b>aft</b> compartments, separated by the engines and boiler amidships.|$|E
5|$|The second shell struck {{above the}} waterline, in the <b>aft</b> engine room, killing all the sailors inside and damaged the {{internal}} communication {{system of the}} ship.|$|E
5|$|The ship carried eight BL 12-inch Mk X guns in four {{twin gun}} turrets. Two turrets were mounted fore and <b>aft</b> on the centreline, {{identified}} as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard and <b>aft.</b> Each wing turret had a limited ability to {{fire to the}} opposite side, but if the ship was full broadside to her target she could bring all eight main guns to bear. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 4-inch BL Mk VII guns positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two 18-inch submerged torpedo tubes, {{one on each side}} <b>aft</b> of 'X' barbette, and twelve torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{initially}} {{carried a}} pole mast above the conning tower, though shortly after commissioning, both ships had lattice masts added <b>aft,</b> and in 1910, the forward masts were also replaced with lattice masts.|$|E
5|$|The two {{flight attendants}} were Debra Andrews Taylor and Janice King. Janice King, who {{was seated in}} the <b>aft</b> jumpseat, died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|They mounted two 17.7-inch (450-mm) {{submerged}} torpedo tubes, one on {{each side}} <b>aft</b> of 'X' barbette, for which twelve torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|Von der Tanns armor {{consisted}} of Krupp cemented and nickel steel. The main belt armor was 80–120mm (3.1–4.7in) thick forward, 250mm(9.8in) thick over the ship's citadel, and was 100mm(3.9in) thick <b>aft.</b> The forward conning tower {{was protected by}} 250mm(9.8in), while the <b>aft</b> conning tower by 200mm(7.9in). The four turrets had 230mm(9.1in) faces, 180mm(7.1in) sides, and 90mm(3.5in) on the roofs. The horizontal armor measured 25mm(0.98in) thick, and the sloping deck armor was 50mm(2.0in) thick. Like the armored cruiser Blücher before her, she was protected by a torpedo bulkhead, 25mm(0.98in) thick. It was set back a distance of 4meters(13ft) from the outer hull skin, the space in between being used to store coal.|$|E
5|$|A single High Angle Control System {{director}} was fitted {{on the island}} and another on an elevated mount on the former flying-off deck. Two pom-pom directors were also mounted on the island for the weapons mounted fore and <b>aft</b> of the island.|$|E
5|$|After 1940 {{the lower}} <b>aft</b> six-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over. The ship's {{anti-aircraft}} armament was augmented by two quadruple 1.1-inch gun mounts by early 1942, although these {{were replaced by}} twin Bofors 40 mm gun mounts later in the war. At about the same time, Milwaukee received eight Oerlikon 20 mm cannon.|$|E
5|$|Armidale {{undertook}} evasive action, manoeuvring frantically {{to avoid}} the aerial attack. However, at 15:15, the vessel was struck by two air-launched torpedoes, one hitting her port side and the other colliding with the engineering spaces, before a bomb exploded <b>aft.</b> Armidale listed sharply to port at this stage, and the order was given to abandon ship. As the crew leapt into the sea, they were strafed by the attacking aircraft. Sheean—after assisting to free a life-raft—was hit by two bullets {{from one of the}} aircraft, wounding him in the chest and back. Scrambling across the deck, he strapped himself into the <b>aft</b> Oerlikon 20mm cannon and began shooting at the fighters in an effort to protect some of the sailors already in the sea. Subject to the fire from Sheean's Oerlikon, the Japanese aircraft were kept at bay and were unable to effectively strafe those in the water.|$|E
5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the boundary layer transition <b>aft</b> by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more <b>aft</b> and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E
5|$|Belfasts {{aviation}} capability {{was provided}} by two catapult-launched Supermarine Walrus amphibious biplanes. These could be launched from a D1H catapult mounted <b>aft</b> of the forward superstructure, and recovered from the water by two cranes mounted {{on either side of}} the forward funnel. The aircraft, operated by the Fleet Air Arm's HMS Belfast Flight of 700 Naval Air Squadron, were stowed in two hangars in the forward superstructure.|$|E
5|$|Both ships carried one {{aircraft}} catapult {{for a pair}} of Heinkel He 60 biplane reconnaissance float planes. They were {{equipped with}} a crane to retrieve the aircraft after landing. The He 60s were later replaced by the monoplane Arado Ar 196 by 1939. Leipzigs catapult was located between the funnel and the forward superstructure, while Nürnbergs was placed <b>aft</b> of the funnel.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{underwent}} extensive refits {{near the}} end or after the war. North Carolina received a secondary air search set (SR) and a SCR-720 zenith search radar on the forward funnel. At {{the end of the}} war, it had an SP surface-search, a SK-2 air-search, a Mark 38 main battery fire control system with Mark 13 and 27 radars, a Mark 37 secondary battery fire control system with Mark 12, 22 and 32 radars, and a Mark 57 smaller weaponry fire control system, with a Mark 34 radar. In March 1946, Washington had a SK fore and a SR <b>aft,</b> a SG both fore and <b>aft,</b> and a TDY jammer (which could scramble radar on other ships).|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} rearmed {{in the late}} 1860s with 14 seven-inch and 2 eight-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns. The new guns were heavier so fewer could be carried. On both ships the eight-inch guns were mounted {{amidships}} on the main deck on the broadside {{and a pair of}} seven-inch guns were mounted on the upper deck as fore and <b>aft</b> chase guns. Eight of the remaining seven-inch guns were also placed on the main deck on the broadside where they were protected by the ship's armour, but one pair was on the main deck further <b>aft</b> where they were not protected by armour. The two ships differed where the last pair of seven-inch guns was positioned: Defence mounted them on the main deck, forward of the armour, while Resistance mounted hers on the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|Experience with {{previous}} battlecruiser designs {{led to the}} adoption of a continuous upper deck, which raised the level of the deck <b>aft.</b> This was necessary because the <b>aft</b> decks of earlier designs were usually awash when steaming at high speed, even in calm seas. The ships were also equipped with a bulbous bow to reduce drag on the hull, the first time the feature was used in the German Navy. The ships as designed required a crew of 46 officers and 1,140 enlisted sailors. Service as a squadron flagship would increase that number by an additional 14 officers and 62 sailors. The vessels carried a number of small boats, including two picket boats, one barge, two launches, two cutters, and three yawls.|$|E
5|$|Four Type 94 high-angle fire-control {{directors}} were fitted {{to control the}} Type 89 guns. The two controlling the port-side guns were adjacent to their guns while the starboard {{directors were}} mounted fore and <b>aft</b> on the island. They could control all of the forward and rear guns respectively as necessary. Type 22 and Type 13 air search radars may have been fitted.|$|E
5|$|Hōshō {{was fitted}} with a net used as a crash barrier <b>aft</b> of the forward {{elevator}} between 10 March and 2 July 1925. The barrier was intended to prevent landing aircraft from colliding with aircraft preparing to take off, and stop them from falling into the open elevator well. The barrier was hydraulically operated and could be erected in three seconds.|$|E
5|$|In 1917–18 the 12-pounder AA gun {{mounted on}} the <b>aft</b> {{superstructure}} {{was moved to the}} roof of the forward 9.2-inch gun turret and a fire-control system was installed with a director mounted on a platform fitted to the foremast. Minotaur was paid off on 5 February 1919, placed on the disposal list in May, put up for sale in March 1920 and sold the following month.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Wrangler {{became the}} first ship of her class to be {{converted}} into a Type 15 anti-submarine frigate. This was a major reconstruction that involved {{the removal of the}} superstructure, masts and armament as well most of the internal equipment. To increase the usable volume of the hull and to improve crew comfort, the forecastle deck was extended almost {{all the way to the}} stern and a new superstructure was built above it, made of aluminium to reduce topweight. Two lattice masts were added to carry the Type 277Q surface-search, Type 274 navigation, and Type 293Q gunnery radars. The ship's main gun armament now consisted of a twin-gun turret fitted with 4-inch (102mm) Mk XVI guns mounted <b>aft</b> and a water-cooled, twin-gun Mk V mount for 40mm Bofors guns above the bridge. The pair of triple-barrelled Squid anti-submarine mortars were shifted to the quarterdeck <b>aft</b> and were controlled by Type 170 and 174 ASDIC systems.|$|E
