5|$|Apart {{from some}} early season games for MCC and A. J. Webbe's XI, all of Bosanquet's cricket in 1901 was for Middlesex. He {{maintained}} his faster style of bowling but {{also began to}} bowl slow leg breaks, with the as-yet unrecognised googly mixed in as variation. Later, he found he could not effectively maintain both styles and decided to concentrate on spin, gradually dropping his quick bowling. His bowling brought him 36 wickets <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 37.52 in 1901 but did not take more than three wickets in a single innings. With the bat, it took until July for him to pass fifty runs in an innings but his form improved in August with four fifties. He ended the season with consecutive centuries against Surrey and Essex. In total, Bosanquet scored 1,240 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 32.63, and Warner regarded {{him as one of}} the three most reliable batsmen in the Middlesex side. After the season, Bosanquet went on his third tour of America, captaining a team himself. From January to April 1902, he toured the West Indies with Richard Bennett's team. He scored 623 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 34.61 with five fifties and 55 wickets <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 15.47, including figures of eight for 30 in one innings. Bosanquet's cricket followed a similar pattern in 1902. He scored 749 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 24.96, with a century against Cambridge. However, he did not pass fifty after the end of May until his last game of the season. With the ball, he took 40 wickets <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 21.17. These included 10 wickets against Oxford and 10 against Nottinghamshire; the latter performance, when he took seven for 57 in the second innings was described as remarkable by Wisden. It {{was the first time that}} his new bowling style attracted attention, although Bosanquet himself tried to play down the success for fear of alerting batsmen to his googly.|$|E

5|$|That {{relationship}} also ended badly, {{and he left}} Otago {{before being}} conscripted into the New Zealand armed forces {{near the end of}} the First World War. When he was demobilised, he returned to England and made his peace with Surrey. He played a handful of games between 1919 and 1921 but faded out of first-class cricket to pursue a career in industry. In all first-class cricket, Crawford scored 9,488 runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 32.60 and took 815 wickets <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 20.66.

5|$|Verity's final {{first-class}} cricket {{came in the}} 1939 season {{which was}} overshadowed by the forthcoming war. Yorkshire won their third successive County Championship and the seventh of Verity's career. Verity took 191wickets <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 13.13, to top the bowling averages {{for the second time}} in his career. Verity's only representative cricket came in the first Test match against West Indies, when he took two wickets in the match. He was subsequently left out of the team for the second Test in favour of Tom Goddard, and did not play any more Test matches. However, Wisden's report on the third Test commented that his absence and that of several other bowlers left the English attack weaker. In a career total of 40Tests, Verity took 144wickets <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 24.37 and scored 669runs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 20.90. With much of the end of the cricket season abandoned prior to the expected outbreak of war, Verity played his last match against Sussex. In the second innings, Verity took seven wickets for nine runs on a rain-affected pitch to bowl Sussex out for 33 and take Yorkshire to a win, although the match was played in a strained, tense atmosphere. This was Verity's last performance in first-class cricket. In total, he had taken 1,956wickets <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 14.90 and scored 5,603runs at 18.07.|$|E
