Special interest {{was given to the}} analysis of the two sound field constituents (tones and broadband noise). Three <b>axial</b> <b>sensor</b> arrays were mounted wall-flush downstream of the turbine stage in the annular duct section of the turbine exit. The arrays were positioned at three different azimuthal angles displaced by 120 ° and traversed azimuthally over 120 degrees in steps of 2 degrees to give a total of 4500 measurement points. Measurements were made at operating conditions from 68 % to 93 % rotor design speed. Special attention was given to the blade passing frequencies (BPF) of the three turbine rotors. The chosen experimental setup permitted their decomposition into azimuthal and radial modes. With this information, the tonal sound power transmitted upstream as well as downstream could be calculated. The mode analysis results provide a detailed view on the sound interaction processes between the turbine blade and vane rows.

40|$|A {{dual sensor}} {{conductance}} probe {{was used to}} measure the distributions of the local gas volume fraction and the local gas axial velocity in vertical upward, bubby air–water flows in which the mean gas volume fraction was less than 0. 1. Very limited data are available in the literature for such low volume fraction flows. The measured local gas volume fraction and velocity distributions were approximated by power law functions. The power law exponents associated with the measured local gas volume fraction profiles were found to be up to 30 % higher than values predicted in the literature. The power law exponents associated with the measured local gas velocity profiles were also found to be somewhat higher than values predicted in the literature. The power law exponents for the measured local gas volume fraction and local axial gas velocity distributions at a given flow condition were combined to obtain an estimate of the ‘Zuber–Findlay’ distribution parameter C 0 at that flow condition. The mean value of C 0 for all of the flow conditions investigated was 1. 09. This value of C 0 was found to give good agreement with the gradient of a plot of the mean gas velocity versus the homogeneous velocity uh, where and uh were obtained from reference measurements. This agreement is evidence for the good accuracy of the measured volume fraction and velocity profiles.

A silicate-based medium is forced through the internal geometries of a work piece by a hydraulic cylinder. The medium contains {{a certain amount of}} abrasive particles like carbide or diamond which influence the removal rate and surface quality.

Suitable experimental techniques to model these installation effects include field, laboratory and experimental models. In the current thesis a small-scale laboratory model {{is used to}} investigate the installation effect of displacement piles in sand, to complement a numerical study of the same subject. The current knowledge of installation effects is initially discussed. The distribution of shaft friction, resulting from cyclic loading, {{and the effect of}} initial relative density on the installation effects are of particular interest. Aims and scope for the current thesis are subsequently discussed, and consist of investigating the effect of installation mode (continuous or incremental installation), and the effect of the initial relative density of the soil before installation. The experiments are carried out in the geotechnical centrifuge, and considerable effort is taken to ensure that the similarity between the scale model and the prototype is assured. This concerns the model itself, the size of the soil grains, as well as the boundaries of the soil container. This process is guided both by theoretical and empirical consideration. The experimental model is then elaborated. This includes the geotechnical centrifuge, as well as the electrical and communications system installed to drive electric control motors and transmit measurement and control data. The model control system is described, including the computer programs that control the model tests. Deformation measurements are carried out by an in-flight camera. The deformation measurements are subsequently analysed with a series of computer programs to adjust for lens distortion and to retain displacement increments with a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) program. The soil sample preparation procedure is described, including preparation at different initial relative densities. The small scale model pile is described. This model pile included horizontal contact stress and <b>axial</b> stress measurement <b>sensors</b> that were included in the small membranes inside the model pile. The model pile was analysed with a FE-program to estimate the effect of the loading conditions. Calibration was carried out in custom-made calibration equipment for the horizontal stress <b>sensors</b> and the <b>axial</b> stress <b>sensor.</b> The experimental measurement results consisted of stress measurements and deformation measurements. The stress measurements consisted of the horizontal contact stress and the axial stress, as well as the ratios between these. The deformation measurements were presented as displacement paths in which the soil displacements were analysed, as well as incremental strains. The interpretation of the measurements focused on the effect of initial relative density, and the effect of load cycles. The initial relative density was shown to have a large influence on the horizontal contact stress during installation, and during extraction of the pile. The deformation measurements showed a similar influence in which the denser soil samples exhibited more horizontal displacement. The effect of incremental installation was analysed in the stress and deformation measurements, and indicates that the compaction of the soil during cyclic loading results in lower horizontal contact stress. The measurements were compared to numerical models that display a similar result, giving more confidence in the current theory of installation effects that is included in empirical design methods.

Moreover, internal data handling and algorithms used to derive speed from these pods are proprietary and thereby unclear. The present study investigates the use of foot contact time (CT) for running speed estimations, which potentially can be used in addition to the global positioning system (GPS) in situations where GPS performance is limited. CT was measured with tri <b>axial</b> inertial <b>sensors</b> attached to the feet of 14 runners, during natural over ground outdoor running, under optimized conditions for GPS. The individual relationships between running speed and CT were established during short runs at different speeds on two days. These relations were subsequently used to predict instantaneous speed during a straight line 4 km run with a single turning point halfway. Stopwatch derived speed, measured for each of 32 consecutive 125 m intervals during the 4 km runs, was used as reference. Individual speed-CT relations were strong (r 2 > 0. 96 for all trials) and consistent between days. During the 4 km runs, median error (ranges) in predicted speed from CT 2. 5 % (5. 2) was higher (P< 0. 05) than for GPS 1. 6 % (0. 8). However, around the turning point and during the first and last 125 m interval, error for GPS-speed increased to 5. 0 % (4. 5) and became greater (P< 0. 05) than the error predicted from CT: 2. 7 % (4. 4). Small speed fluctuations during 4 km runs were adequately monitored with both methods: CT and GPS respectively explained 85 % and 73 % of the total speed variance during 4 km runs. In conclusion, running speed estimates bases on speed-CT relations, have acceptable accuracy and could serve to backup or substitute for GPS during tarmac running on flat terrain whenever GPS performance is limited...|$|R

40|$|Mirotznik, MarkA novel {{fiber optic}} sensor was {{designed}} and developed for the measurement of fluid flow. The sensor was specifically designed to measure flow within small channels such as those found in many biomedical applications without any metal parts (i. e. MRI compatible). At {{the heart of the}} device was a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG). The FBG is an optical device that is very sensitive to axial strain. Specific mounts were designed to fit over the FBG and convert the pressure field, produced by the flow, into an axial stain that is then sensed optically by the FBG. Several different sets of mounts were designed, fabricated via 3 D printing and tested experimentally. The mounts were developed to test two types of flow measurement. One set was a flexure mount designed to convert the radial compressive forces of a pressure wave into axial strain. The other set was a flow restriction disc paired with a fixed point on the fiber. The interaction of the flow with the disc would create a tensile force on the fiber and generate a proportional signal. The sensor was tested against theoretical values by measuring reflected wavelength values against known <b>axial</b> strains. The <b>sensor</b> was also tested in a closed loop system that generated forces similar to those found within the human body. Conclusions based on experimental results were; (1) the FBG with the flexure mount was found to be sensitive and reliable in biological settings, (2) the FBG with the flow restriction disc was not able to generate consistent results to be considered useable.

40|$|The {{flotation}} {{process is}} designed to collect hydrophobic particles by attachment on to bubbles dispersed in slurry. The effectiveness of the flotation process depends on {{the properties of the}} bubble dispersion. For example, the ability of a machine to form small bubbles at a given flow rate of air will control the quantity of surface area available for bubble-particle collision. The gas dispersion, defined {{for the purposes of this}} thesis as bubbles suspended in slurry, is quantified by a group of "so-called" gas dispersion parameters including: superficial gas velocity (gas rate, Jg), gas holdup (epsilong), bubble size (Db) and bubble surface area flux (Sb). Cell characterization is a commonly used term in the study of gas dispersion parameters referring to any test designed specifically to increase understanding of the gas dispersion inside a particular machine, including how the dispersion can be manipulated by adjusting the operating variables and how the dispersion parameters vary with location inside a machine. Industrial tests were done to study mechanisms of manipulating the gas dispersion in forced air and self-aerated mechanical flotation machines, demonstrating that gas rate can be used to manipulate the gas dispersion in forced air machines, while froth depth, impeller speed and impeller submergence can be used to manipulate the dispersion in self-aerated machines. Facilitated by the development of the multi-Jg sensor, a technique based on gas rate mapping was developed for down-the-bank sample point selection. Experience using the sensor is described. Based on industrial tests, recommendations regarding sample point selection for down-the-bank optimization are offered. The development of an <b>axial</b> pressure profile <b>sensor</b> is described, facilitating axial investigation of variation in gas dispersion parameters. The proposed technique can be used to evaluate machine operating conditions and to resolve previously unexplained results...|$|R
