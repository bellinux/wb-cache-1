There was usually one unit per district of East Germany but the key districts of Halle, Leipzig and Magdeburg, with their large working class populations, and Potsdam all had two units.

50|$|The {{creation}} of the Ministry of Defense and the NVA seemingly {{should have been a}} blow to the authority and prestige of the Ministry of the Interior. The bureaucratic impact of this action was mitigated by permitting Stoph to carry both portfolios for four years. In addition, police activities, both civil and secret, remained under the Ministry of the Interior, as did the Border Police. The Ministry of the Interior established its own <b>Alert</b> <b>Units</b> for the specific function of internal security. The <b>Alert</b> <b>Units</b> were militarily structured, fully motorized units with modern weapons and equipment. Garrisoned and trained in battalion-size units, they were capable of carrying out police tasks and other security functions.

In October 1995, the 125 FW became the first unit ever to complete a transition from one fourth generation fighter to another fourth generation fighter as it transitioned from the F-16ADF to the F-15A/B. In April 1997, the 125 FW became the first Air Defense Unit to employ as Blue Air in an Offensive Counter Air (OCA) role, integrated with an active duty unit during a Red Flag exercise at Nellis AFB, Nevada.|$|E

The first pilot training occurred at an aviation club at Lausitz, and shortly thereafter Special Section 2 of the KVP was created as the nucleus of the East German air force. In 1952 Special Section 2 was redesignated Main Administration for Air Police.|$|R
50|$|In {{the initial}} stages of reorganization, the nonmilitary units of the People's Police, the Border Police, and the Transport Police were subordinated to the Main Administration of the People's Police, within the Ministry of the Interior.

40|$|In recent years, road {{accidents}} {{have increased}} significantly. One {{of the major}} reasons for these accidents, as reported is driver fatigue. Due to continuous and longtime driving, the driver gets exhausted and drowsy which may lead to an accident. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for a system to measure the fatigue level of driver and alert him when he/she feels drowsy to avoid accidents. Thus, we propose a system which comprises of a camera installed on the car dashboard. The camera detect the driver's face and observe the alteration in its facial features and uses these features to observe the fatigue level. Facial features include eyes and mouth. Principle Component Analysis is thus implemented to reduce the features while minimizing the amount of information lost. The parameters thus obtained are processed through Support Vector Classifier for classifying the fatigue level. After that classifier output is sent to the <b>alert</b> <b>unit.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, edited version of published paper in IEEE ICITE 201...|$|E

The Confederates' quiet approach was aided by the presence of heavy fog. Kershaw's Division attacked the trenches of Col.

Crook's division-sized [...] "army" [...] was overwhelmed and many fled, half-dressed, in panic. A brigade under Col.

However, around 1600 SS-Standartenfuhrer Paul Otto Geibel, chief of police and SS in the Warsaw District, received a warning about the uprising from an anonymous 'lieutenant of Luftwaffe', who had in turn been warned about it by a Polish woman. He <b>alerted</b> the <b>units</b> under his command, which thus were prepared for the assault at 1700. This drastically reduced the element of surprise of the resistance. On the other hand, while the Germans had been considering the possibility of an uprising, they had no operational plans prepared for such an occasion.|$|R
50|$|By December 1945—within {{six months}} {{of the end of the}} war—each of the five states in the Soviet {{occupation}} zone had a central police force, in clear violation of the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. In early January 1946, the term Volkspolizei (People's Police) was applied publicly to the new police forces in East Germany, and in August of the same year these forces were placed under the central control of the newly created German Administration of the Interior, headed by Erich Reschke. In November 1946, the Sowjetische Militäradministration in Deutschland (SMAD) directed the organization of the Deutsche Grenzpolizei (German Border Police), actually formed on 1 December 1946. The initial 3,000 recruits were organized and trained from People's Police resources, and by April 1948 the branch numbered 10,000, the total reaching 18,000 in 1950. The Grenzpolizei were armed and organised like a police force; and were subordinate to the Main Administration of the Border Police and <b>Alert</b> <b>Units</b> of the German Administration of the Interior. Eventually, the East German regime demanded a reorganization of the force along military lines, similar to their Soviet counterparts, the USSR Border Troops. In 1961, the Grenzpolizei were reorganized as the Grenztruppen der DDR. As part of the reorganization, the Grenztruppen der DDR were moved from the GDR Ministry of the Interior to the GDR Ministry of National Defense (MfNV). Although the border troops were originally part of the National People's Army (NVA), in 1973 they were separated from the NVA and reported thereafter directly to the MfNV.|$|R
50|$|The Police Department was {{established}} in 1955 soon after the town was incorporated. John Nelson was hired as its first Police Chief. The police car was a Ford Fairlane 500. Shortly thereafter, a few volunteer part-time policemen joined the force. When the town was formed, water hoses had to stay connected at each residence and ready to use {{in case of a}} fire. In 1958, a group of men joined together and a couple of volunteers attended the Firefighters School at Texas A&M University, and the Hollywood Park Volunteer Fire Department was founded. That year all the firemen had was a small pump unit. Robert Oakes, as general chairman, and many volunteers organized the first Hollywood Park Volunteer Fire Department Benefit Barbeque held June 22, 1968 at Raymond Russell Park. Volunteers prepared all the food. 746 people went through the serving line. The event was held for many years at Raymond Russell Park with games for the entire family and a live band. Funds were raised for equipment and to purchase 20 new two-way portable <b>alerting</b> <b>units.</b> Fred T. Keepers, Jr. was Fire Chief from 1967 — 1978. By 1969, eighteen dedicated volunteers provided protection for the 612 residents of Hollywood Park, Hill Country Village, as well as over a large area of ranchlands in the northernmost sections of Bexar County. The City provided the firemen with bright yellow uniforms, but they got no other compensation for their duty. The largest fire occurred in August 1968 when a grass fire erupted near Hwy 281 and burned off 3,000 acres. By 1973, there were 29 volunteers. A new Rescue Unit was purchased through fund raising projects and donations.|$|R
