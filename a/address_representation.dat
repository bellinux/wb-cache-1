30|$|Taken together, our {{findings}} suggest that a fruitful way to <b>address</b> <b>representation</b> issues is to address classroom environments. Recent surveys indicate that while there is a growing trend toward more active teaching approaches, the majority of faculty report extensive lecturing. For example, the 2010 – 2011 HERI survey of faculty (Hurtado et al. 2012) found that, in STEM, the majority of faculty (70 % of male faculty and 50 % of female faculty) report using extensive lecture most or all the time. Surveys in individual disciplines have found similar results. A 2010 survey of calculus faculty found 80 % of instructors lecturing “very often” or “often” (Apkarian and Kirin 2017). The majority of STEM faculty use extensive lectures the majority of the time. Our results indicate that shifting toward more active approaches may increase the persistence of women and students of color.|$|E

40|$|Cellular {{structures}} are present from the atomic level {{all the way}} up to patterns found in human skeleton. They are prevailing structures in the nature and known for their excellent mechanical, thermal, and acoustic properties. Two typical types of cellular structures, lightweight structures and compliant mechanisms, are investigated. Lightweight {{structures are}} rigid and designed to reduce weight, while increasing strength and stiffness. Compliant mechanisms are designed to transform motions and forces. Most available artificial lightweight structures are patterns of primitives. However, the performance of lightweight structures can be enhanced by using adaptive cellular structures with conformal strut orientations and sizes, like the trabeculae in femoral bone. Bending, torsion, and nonlinear behaviors of compliant mechanisms have not been sufficiently studied. In order to design adaptive cellular structures, a new unit cell, the unit truss is proposed. The unit truss approach facilitates the design of adaptive cellular structures for enhanced mechanical properties via geometric modeling, finite element analysis, shape optimization, and additive fabrication. Four research questions, which <b>address</b> <b>representation,</b> structural analysis, design synthesis, and manufacturing respectively, are raised and answered. Unit truss enables representation and mechanics analysis for adaptive cellular structures. A synthesis method using engineering optimization algorithms is developed to systematically design adaptive cellular structure. Two examples, graded cellular structure for prosthesis and compliant mechanism for morphing wings, are studied to test the unit truss approach. Ph. D.
