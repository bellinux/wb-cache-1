5|$|Cancer is {{a change}} in the {{cellular}} processes that cause a tumour to grow out of control. Cancerous cells sometimes have mutations in oncogenes, such as KRAS and CTNNB1 (β-catenin). Analysing the molecular signature of cancerous cellsthe DNA and its levels of expression via messenger RNAenables physicians to characterise the cancer and to choose the best therapy for their patients. As of 2010, <b>assays</b> that incorporate an array of antibodies against specific protein marker molecules are an emerging technology; there are hopes for these multiplex <b>assays</b> that could measure many markers at once. Other potential future biomarkers include micro RNA molecules, which cancerous cells express more of than healthy ones.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release <b>assays</b> and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release <b>assays</b> (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of CSF leak can be {{done through}} various imaging techniques, {{chemical}} tests of bodily fluid discharged from a head orifice, or by a clinical examination. The use of CT, MRI, and <b>assays</b> {{are the most common}} types of CSF leak instrumental tests. Many CSF leaks do not show up on imaging and chemical <b>assays,</b> thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache when the patient takes a prone position are positive indicators.|$|E
40|$|Two {{new methods}} for the {{detection}} of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent <b>assay</b> and a quantitative immunofluorescence <b>assay,</b> were evaluated and compared with the conventional indirect fluorescent-antibody slide test. Each of 100 human sera was <b>assayed</b> twice by the three procedures. Both the enzyme-linked immunosorbent <b>assay</b> and the quantitative immunofluorescence <b>assay</b> correlated well with serologically positive (indirect fluorescent-antibody titer {{greater than or equal to}} 1 : 32) and negative sera.

40|$|Antibody- and complement-mediated {{phagocytosis}} is {{the main}} defense mechanism against Streptococcus pneumoniae. A standardized, easy to perform phagocytosis <b>assay</b> for pneumococci {{would be a great}} asset for the evaluation of the potential efficacy of (experimental) pneumococcal vaccines. Such an <b>assay</b> could replace the laborious phagocytosis <b>assay</b> of viable pneumococci (classical killing <b>assay).</b> Therefore, a newly developed phagocytosis <b>assay</b> based on flow cytometry (flow <b>assay)</b> was compared with the conventional killing <b>assay</b> and enzyme-linked immunosorbent <b>assay</b> (ELISA), using sera obtained from adults pre- and postvaccination with either a bivalent conjugate, a tetravalent conjugate, or the 23 -valent polysaccharide vaccine. Highly significant correlations were observed between flow <b>assay</b> phagocytosis titers, killing <b>assay</b> phagocytosis titers, and ELISA antibody titers for serotype 6 B and 23 F as well. For serotype 19 F, strong correlations were only observed between killing <b>assay</b> and ELISA titers. A potential drawback of the flow <b>assay</b> might be the low sensitivity compared with that of the killing <b>assay.</b> The choice of what <b>assay</b> to use, however, will depend on the objectives of the <b>assay.</b> When speed, easy performance, sample throughput, improved worker safety, absence of influence of antibiotics, and absence of false positives are the major criteria, the flow <b>assay</b> is the method of choice. When higher sensitivity is the major requirement, the classical killing <b>assay</b> should be used...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPlant genome {{possesses}} over 100 protein phosphatase (PPase) {{genes that}} are key regulators of signal transduction via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation event. Here we report a comprehensive functional analysis of protein serine/threonine, dual-specificity and tyrosine phosphatases using recombinant PPases produced by wheat cell-free protein synthesis system. Eighty-two recombinant PPases were successfully produced using Arabidopsis full-length cDNA as templates. In vitro PPase <b>assay</b> was performed using phosphorylated myelin basic protein as substrate. Among the AtPPases examined, 26 serine/threonine, three dual-specificity and one tyrosine PPases exhibited catalytic activity, including 20 serine/threonine and one dual-specificity PPases that showed in vitro {{activities for the}} first time. Our study demonstrates genome-wide biochemical analysis of AtPPases using wheat cell-free system, and provides new information and insights on enzyme activities.

5|$|The exosome {{complex is}} the target of autoantibodies in {{patients}} suffering from various autoimmune diseases. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which patients have symptoms from both scleroderma and either polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Autoantibodies can be detected in the serum of patients {{by a variety of}} <b>assays.</b> In the past, the most commonly used methods were double immunodiffusion using calf thymus extracts, immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells or immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts. In immunoprecipitation <b>assays</b> with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the PM/Scl complex. Immunofluorescence using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the nucleolus of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis. More recently, recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and enzyme linked immunosorbent <b>assays</b> (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.|$|E

40|$|The <b>assay</b> on {{anhydrous}} {{basis is}} a mathematically derived value from an experimental results of <b>assay</b> and water content tests.

The industry-accepted formula for <b>assay</b> on anhydrous basis = (<b>assay</b> on as-is basis&# 215; 100) /(100 -&#x 0025;water). Statistically, the two variables involved in accepted formula are <b>assay</b> on as-is basis {{and water to}} obtain <b>assay</b> on anhydrous basis. The experimental errors associated with these two variables propagate in <b>assay</b> on anhydrous basis. The error propagates either in constructive or destructive mode. The constructive mode of error propagation is combination of positive error of <b>assay</b> on as-is basis and positive error of water or negative error of <b>assay</b> on as-is basis and negative error of water. The constructive mode of error propagation has more impact on <b>assay</b> on anhydrous basis values and its confidence interval. The destructive mode of error propagation is combination of a positive error of <b>assay</b> on as-is basis and a negative error of water or vice versa. The destructive mode of error propagation has lesser impact on <b>assay</b> on anhydrous basis values and its confidence interval {{in comparison to the}} constructive mode of error propagation.
