40|$|This study {{assessed}} the removal efficiency {{of organic matter}} and how {{it relates to the}} decrease of toxic and mutagenic effects when an anaerobic reactor is used to treat the bleaching effluent from two kraft pulp mills. Parameters such as COD (chemical oxygen demand), DOC (dissolved organic carbon), <b>AOX</b> (<b>adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogen),</b> ASL (acid soluble lignin), color, chlorides, total phenols and absorbance values in the UV-VIS spectral region were measured. The acute and chronic toxicity and genetic toxicity assessments were performed with Daphnia similis, Ceriodaphnia sp. and Allium cepa L, respectively. The removal efficiency of organic matter measured as COD, ranged from 45 % to 55 %, while AOX removal ranged from 40 % to 45 %. The acute toxic and chronic effects, as well as the cytotoxic, genotoxic and mutagenic effects, decrease as the biodegradable fraction of the organics is removed. These results, together with the organic load measurement of the effluents of the anaerobic treatment, indicate that these effluents are recalcitrant but not toxic. As expected, color increased when the anaerobic treatment was applied. However, the colored compounds are of microbial origin and do not cause an increase in genotoxic effects. To discharge the wastewater, it is necessary to apply a physico-chemical or aerobic biological post-treatment to the effluents of the anaerobic reactor...|$|E

The WAO reactions were performed in a batch reactor at various temperatures in the range of T = 430 - 500 K employing a concentration of c = 0. 88 mol L– 1 of H 2 O 2. The same H 2 O 2 concentration was used in the Fenton-type-pH ≈ 7 experimental session considering H 2 O 2 /Fe(II) mole ratios of 5, 10 and 15. Similar results were obtained in COD abatement but appreciably different performance in AOX removal and biodegradability enhancement was observed. A comparison between the treatment trials brought to the evidence that Fenton-Type-pH ≈ 7 process has poor performance in biodegradability enhancement, diversely the H 2 O 2 promoted WAO get to better performances even at mild temperature. This process could be considered as advantageous solution in landfill leachate pre-treatment when the main objectives are COD and AOX degradation together with the biodegradability enhancement for final treatment in common biological aerobic wastewater treatment plants...|$|E

40|$|Since March 1995 Amsterdam Water Supply {{has applied}} {{biological}} activated carbon filtration (BACF) {{in the treatment}} process of the Leiduin plant. In this plant (capacity 70 × 106 m 3 /y) pretreated River Rhine water is infiltrated in the dune area, west of Amsterdam, for artificial recharge. Post treatment comprises rapid sand filtration, ozonation, hardness removal, biological activated carbon filtration and slow sand filtration. At the start the carbon reactivation frequency was set at 18 months, based on removal efficiencies for <b>AOX</b> (<b>adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogens),</b> DOC, pesticides and micropollutants. After four years of operation of a pilot plant (10 m 3 /hour) in parallel with the full-scale plant, the remaining removal capacity and the break-through profile of the carbon filters was investigated. In contrast to the full-scale plant, no carbon reactivation was applied in the pilot plant during the operation of 4 years. Spiking experiments were carried out after ozonation, in the influent of the biological activated carbon filtration with a cocktail of different pesticides after 1. 5, 3 and 4 years. Influent concentrations varied between 2 to 10 μg/l. Without carbon reactivation the filter effluent still complies with the Dutch drinking water standards and guide lines, {{as well as with}} the Amsterdam Water Supply standards: DOC is less than 2 mg/l (actually 1. 2 mg/l) and AOX remains below 5 μg/l. After four years, with spiking concentrations of 2 μg/l still no pesticide break-through was observed in the two-stage biological activated carbon filtration process. It can be concluded that a running time of 3 years between two reactivations in the two stage biological active carbon filtration is achievable, without negatively affecting the finished water quality. Average DOC concentrations will increase up to 1. 2 mg/l, from 1 mg/l with running times of 2 years. After four years or 100, 000 bedvolumes the AOC content is equal to or lower than 10 μg/l after biological activated carbon filtration. With slow sand filtration at the end and as polishing step AOC will be less than 10 - 5 μg/l. With every extension of six months duration time a saving of ε 305, 000 on reactivation costs is possible. With every 6 month extension of the running time of the carbon filters a saving of ε 610, 000 is realised on the reactivation costs of the Leiduin treatment plant...|$|R

For nonvolatile DBPs, solid-phase extraction (SPE) with TELOS ENV as solid phase performed superior compared to ten other sorbents.

40|$|Electrochemical {{advanced}} oxidation processes (EAOPs) {{have been}} widely investigated as promising technologies to remove trace organic contaminants from water, but have rarely been used {{for the treatment of}} real waste streams. Anodic oxidation with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode was applied for the treatment of secondary effluent from a municipal sewage treatment plant containing 29 target pharmaceuticals and pesticides. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed from the contaminants decay, dissolved organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand removal. The effect of applied current and pH was evaluated. Almost complete mineralization of effluent organic matter and trace contaminants can be obtained by this EAOP primarily due to the action of hydroxyl radicals formed at the BDD surface. The oxidation of Cl- ions present in the wastewater at the BDD anode gave rise to active chlorine species (Cl 2 /HClO/ClO-), which are competitive oxidizing agents yielding chloramines and organohalogen byproducts, quantified as <b>adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogen.</b> However, further anodic oxidation of HClO/ClO- species led to the production of ClO 3 - and ClO 4 - ions.

40|$|In this study, {{the impact}} of bromide and iodide on {{disinfected}} waters was examined and potential treatment technologies for their removal or mitigation were investigated. Distributed waters from two Western Australian drinking water sources were evaluated {{in terms of their}} bromide and iodide concentrations, disinfection by-product (DBP) formation, halogen-specific <b>adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> (<b>AOX)</b> formation and chlorinous odours after disinfection. In both systems, the brominated DBPs dominated the measured DBPs and, in both cases, the known DSPs accounted for only 30 % of total organohalogens. Chloramination with a sufficient free chlorine contact time followed by ammonia addition, rather than preformed monochloramine, may be a viable mitigation strategy for the minimisation of I-OBPs, since exposure to free chlorine should promote the conversion of iodide to iodate, a safe form of iodine. This study has shown that bromide {{plays an important role in}} this process, mainly by enhancing the preferred conversion' of iodide to iodate. Ozone pre-treatment selectively oxidised iodide to iodate and minimised the formation of I-OB Ps.

The degradation of textile azo dyestuffs, Reactive Yellow 176 (Y 3 RS), Reactive Red 239 (R 3 BS) and Reactive Black 5 (B 5), by anodic CGDE was investigated in the presence of chloride (Cl−) ions. The degradation kinetics of the dyes was dependent on the concentration of Cl− ions and on the respective dye being treated. R 3 BS degradation was inhibited by Cl− ions in the range of 0 – 0. 01 M.

As {{the effects of this}} process on the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) remain a controversial issue, a bench-scale study has been undertaken to examine the impact of UV dechloramination on the formation of various DBPs. Four pool water samples were exposed to UV radiation at 254 nm in the presence of free chlorine ([Cl 2] 0 = 3 mg L- 1) and then chlorinated in the dark for 24 h ([Cl 2] 0 = 3 mg L- 1). High UV doses (up to 47 kJ m- 2) were used to simulate cumulative UV doses received by real pool waters.

The ecotoxicological evaluation comprised acute toxicity assays using as test organisms Daphnia Similis, seeds of Eruca sativa (arugula), and Allium cepa roots (onion). Analyses of color, pH, turbidity, conductivity, hardness, nitrogen, total <b>organic</b> carbon (TOC), <b>adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> (<b>AOX),</b> and metals were also carried out.

40|$|Disinfection with chloramines {{is often}} used to reduce the {{production}} of regulated disinfection by-products (DBPs) such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). However, chloramination can lead to the formation of N-nitrosamines, including N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a probable human carcinogen. Previous research used dimethylamine (DMA) as a model precursor of NDMA, but certain widely used tertiary dimethylamines (e. g. the pharmaceutical ranitidine) show much higher conversion rates to NDMA than DMA. This study investigates the NDMA formation potential of several tertiary amines including pharmaceuticals and herbicides. The reactivity of these molecules with monochloramine (NH 2 Cl) is studied through the formation of NDMA, and other halogenated DBPs such as haloacetonitriles (HANs) and <b>AOX</b> (<b>Adsorbable</b> <b>Organic</b> Halides). Several compounds investigated formed NDMA in greater amounts than DMA, revealing the importance of structural characteristics of tertiary amines for NDMA formation. Among these compounds, the pharmaceutical ranitidine showed the highest molar conversion to NDMA. The pH and dissolved oxygen content of the solution were found {{to play a major role}} for the formation of NDMA from ranitidine. NDMA was formed in higher amounts at pH around pH 8 and a lower concentration of dissolved oxygen dramatically decreased NDMA yields. These findings seem to indicate that dichloramine (NHCl 2) is not the major oxidant involved in the formation of NDMA from ranitidine, results in contradiction with the reaction mechanisms proposed in the literature. Dissolved oxygen was also found to influence the formation of other oxygen-containing DBPs (i. e. trichloronitromethane and haloketones). The results of this study identify several anthropogenic precursors of NDMA, indicating that chloramination of waters impacted by these tertiary amines could lead to the formation of significant amounts of NDMA and other non-regulated DBPs of potential health concern (e. g. dichloroacetonitrile or trichloronitromethane). This could be of particular importance for the chloramination of wastewater effluents, especially during water reuse processes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Approximately 50 % of the strains tested and 55 % of the genera tested produced AOX. Organohalogen production seemed to be a ubiquitous capacity among basidiomycetes. Many highly ecologically significant fungal species were identified among the moderate and high producers.

Decrease in leachate pollution index of current landfills is mainly related to reduction in concentrations of certain heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cd, Hg) and organics (biological oxygen demand (BOD 5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and <b>adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> (<b>AOX)).</b> However, contaminants of concern remain COD, ammonium-nitrogen (NH 4 -N) and BOD 5 with average concentrations in leachate of about 1850, 640, and 120 mg/L respectively.

Electrical conductivity (EC) of leachate may be used as a time and cost saving alternative to monitor sudden changes in concentration of these two parameters, due to high correlations of around 0. 8 with both COD and NH 4 -N values which are possibly due to low heavy metal concentrations in leachate. The decreased concentrations of heavy metals and BOD 5 favor the retrofitting of an existing biological reactor (nitrification/denitrification) with the deammonification process and post denitrification, as this lowers average annual operational cost (in terms of energy and external carbon source) and CO 2 emission by € 25, 850 and 15, 855 kg CO 2,eq respectively...|$|R

The strain had wild plasmids that were hard to eliminate using acridine orange and elevated temperature curing techniques. While still bearing 5 wild plasmids, attempts to transform B. cereus # 259 were unsuccessful using conventional methods and electroporation. Another strain, B. cereus # 518, found {{to be free of}} wild plasmids, was then used. A bidirectional vector shuttle plasmid (pMK 3) was employed to carry the cloned gene into this B. cereus strain.

40|$|Materials {{of steam}} water cycles can suffer from {{corrosion}} induced by halide anions in feedwater. <b>Organic</b> <b>halogen</b> compounds in feedwater can be degraded and release halide anions under high temperature and pressure. Therefore {{it is necessary}} to be able to measure the <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> concentration. Existing measurements including <b>Adsorbable</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Halogens</b> and Gas Chromatography are either not convenient, affordable, accurate or reproducible enough at these very low concentrations, meaning a new method should be developed. In this research the option of destroying the organic compounds to release the halide anions and measure them with ion chromatography was studied. The question is, which {{is the best way to}} destroy the organic compounds and release the halides anions. Six <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> model compounds were tested: aliphatic and aromatic fluorine, chlorine and bromine containing compounds. Two main methods were studied: UV/vacuumUV (VUV) photolysis and wet chemical oxidation with K 2 S 2 O 8. There are three phases in the research: 1. Study different UV lamps and oxidants on the target compounds and find the optimal combinations. 2. Try different dosages of K 2 S 2 O 8 and find an optimum. 3. Test halide release of target compounds in power plant conditions. In the experiments, three kinds of lamps were applied: VUV, low pressure (LP) lamp and medium pressure (MP) lamp. H 2 O 2 and TiO 2 were used as a catalyst. Last but not least, wet chemical oxidation was tested, with varying dosages of K 2 S 2 O 8. The experiments were executed with both single compounds and mixed compounds. The results show that the organic fluorine is the hardest to degrade while organic bromine is the easiest. Aromatic compounds are easier to degrade than aliphatic compounds. This happens not only in AOP process, but also in power plant conditions. The recovery of bromide and chloride in most methods could reach 95 % while aliphatic fluorine could only reach at most 70 %. It can be concluded that MP/H 2 O 2 is the most effective method for degradation of <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> compounds since it requires less time for the reaction to be completed, but wet chemical oxidation also showed high recoveries for all halide anions. The advantage of wet chemical oxidation is simple equipment and universality. The method with the lowest degradation rate and recovery is UV/TiO 2.

Although the presence of AOX in waters is of anthropogenic origin, they may also be of natural origin. In water environments they have long half-life, they resist breaking down and can accumulate in the food chain. Some of the compounds that are ranked among the AOX, are carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic at high concentrations. Threshold values of AOX's in drinking water are not detemined by Slovenian legislation. First measurements of AOX concentrations in drinking water were made in 2014, in areas where water supply system is managed by Hydrovod d. o. o., Komunala Brežice d. o. o., Komunala Črnomelj d. o. o., Komunala Metlika d. o. o., Komunala Novo mesto d. o. o. in Kostak d. d. The Master thesis gives an overview of the concentrations of AOX in surface, groundwater, potable water and in industrial wastewater in the Dolenjska and Bela Krajina regions between 2000 and 2014. Based on the data obtained, {{it was found that the}} concentrations of AOX in drinking water in the area of Ribnica, Kočevje and Sodražica water supply systems (karst surface of mesozoic limestone and dolomite), were higher than at other measuring sites. Moreover, concentrations of AOX in drinking waters treated with chlorine compounds were higher than in raw water. Concentrations of AOX in surface waters were mostly suitable and status of surface water bodies was identified as good. It was also found that in most plants the annual quantity of AOX in technological wastewaters exceeds the threshold for waste waters. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on {{determination}} of <b>adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogens</b> (<b>AOX)</b> concentration in the digested sludge from the sewage treatment plant and the losses of this component during dewatering and drying of sludge. Drying of the sludge from wastewater treatment plant is not extended too much in Czech Republic. In this work, the AOX are monitored, because AOX {{is one of the}} limits restraining use of the sludge on an agricultural land. Another reason is technological demand for using the sludge in cement processing, because chlorine in AOX can cause decrease in a heat transfer effect in a cement kiln. It is clear from the results that both centrifuged and dried sludge from the sewage treatment plant Brno fulfilled limits for using sludge on agriculture land. They can also be composted, in case they meet other requirements. If not, it is a possibility of co-incineration in cement kiln. In such case, limit for total chlorine including the AOX is required too. This limit was not exceeded. Another aim was to calculate a mass balance of AOX during the centrifugation and drying processes. It was found out, that after centrifugation the main part of AOX remained in the centrifuged sludge (96. 4 [*]%). The rest was drawn-off with reject water. 60 [*]% of AOX in the reject water were dissolved compounds. A similar situation occurred during the drying process. More than 99 [*]% of AOX was bound in the dried sludge.

In this work, anaerobic treatment was followed by ozonation, UV radiation and ozonation in the presence of UV radiation, to treat bleaching effluents from a cellulose kraft Pulp plant. The anaerobic reactor (horizontal anaerobic immobilized Sludge bed, HAISB) was Used as a pretreatment to reduce the efficient organic load before applying ACIP. The ozone treatments were applied in three different pH environments (3, 8 and 10) with retention times of 10, 30, 45 and 60 min. COD and <b>adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogens</b> (<b>AOX)</b> removal efficiencies at the HAISB were approximately 50 %, while the BOD removal efficiency reached 80 %. Ozonation promoted further removal of AOX and COD so that the combined efficiency reached 96 % for AOX and 70 % for COD. In the oxidation process, BOD was either removed in small quantities or actually increased, as intended, so that a second biological treatment would be able to complete the treatment. The maximum increase in the BOD(5) /COD ratio (biodegradability indicator) Occurred at pH 8, reaching 104 % for ozonation at a dosage of 1540 mg(O 3). L(- 1). Applying UV radiation alone resulted in lower values: a 34 % increase ill the BOD(5) /COD ratio and a 76 % AOX removal efficiency. These results indicate that the combination of anaerobic treatment with ozonation or ozonation/UV radiation improves the treatability of cellulose pulp bleaching efficients and that the resulting wastewater is suitable for further biological treatment under aerobic conditions with a low level of toxic compounds from the halogenated family...|$|R

The {{definitive}} peer-reviewed {{and edited}} {{version of this}} article is published in Water Research 45 (10), Pages 3164 – 3174, 2011, DOI: 10. 1016 /j. watres. 2011. 03. 035 and is available at www. iwapublishing. com. International audienceDisinfection with chloramines is often used to reduce the production of regulated disinfection by-products (DBPs) such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). However, chloramination can lead to the formation of N-nitrosamines, including N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a probable human carcinogen. Previous research used dimethylamine (DMA) as a model precursor of NDMA, but certain widely used tertiary dimethylamines (e. g. the pharmaceutical ranitidine) show much higher conversion rates to NDMA than DMA. This study investigates the NDMA formation potential of several tertiary amines including pharmaceuticals and herbicides. The reactivity of these molecules with monochloramine (NH 2 Cl) is studied through the formation of NDMA, and other halogenated DBPs such as haloacetonitriles (HANs) and <b>AOX</b> (<b>Adsorbable</b> <b>Organic</b> Halides). Several compounds investigated formed NDMA in greater amounts than DMA, revealing the importance of structural characteristics of tertiary amines for NDMA formation. Among these compounds, the pharmaceutical ranitidine showed the highest molar conversion to NDMA. The pH and dissolved oxygen content of the solution were found {{to play a major role}} for the formation of NDMA from ranitidine. NDMA was formed in higher amounts at pH around pH 8 and a lower concentration of dissolved oxygen dramatically decreased NDMA yields. These findings seem to indicate that dichloramine (NHCl 2) is not involved into the formation of NDMA from ranitidine. Dissolved oxygen was also found to influence the formation of other oxygen-containing DBPs (i. e. trichloronitromethane and haloketones), which shows that dissolved oxygen could be incorporated into those DBPs. The results of this study identify several anthropic precursors of NDMA, indicating that chloramination of waters impacted by these tertiary amines could lead to the formation of important amounts of NDMA and other non-regulated DBPs of potential health concern (e. g. dichloroacetonitrile or trichloronitromethane). This could be of particular importance for the chloramination of wastewater effluents, especially during water reuse processes...|$|R
40|$|Disinfection of {{drinking}} water is the most successful measure to reduce water-borne diseases and protect health. However, disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formed from the reaction of disinfectants such as chlorine and monochloramine with organic matter may cause bladder cancer and other adverse health effects. In this study the formation of DBPs through a full-scale water treatment plant serving a metropolitan area in Australia was assessed using in vitro bioanalytical tools, {{as well as through}} quantification of halogen-specific <b>adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogens</b> (<b>AOXs),</b> characterization of organic matter, and analytical quantification of selected regulated and emerging DBPs. The water treatment train consisted of coagulation, sand filtration, chlorination, addition of lime and fluoride, storage, and chloramination. Nonspecific toxicity peaked midway through the treatment train after the chlorination and storage steps. The dissolved organic matter concentration decreased after the coagulation step and then essentially remained constant during the treatment train. Concentrations of AOXs increased upon initial chlorination and continued to increase through the plant, probably due to increased chlorine contact time. Most of the quantified DBPs followed a trend similar to that of AOXs, with maximum concentrations observed in the final treated water after chloramination. The mostly chlorinated and brominated DBPs formed during treatment also caused reactive toxicity to increase after chlorination. Both genotoxicity with and without metabolic activation and the induction of the oxidative stress response pathway showed the same pattern as the nonspecific toxicity, with a maximum activity midway through the treatment train. Although measured effects cannot be directly translated to adverse health outcomes, this study demonstrates the applicability of bioanalytical tools to investigate DBP formation in a drinking water treatment plant, despite bioassays and sample preparation not yet being optimized for volatile DBPs. As such, the bioassays are useful as monitoring tools as they provide sensitive responses even at low DBP levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is to study the {{advanced}} oxidation processes (AOPs) of water pollutants via UV/hypochlorite (homogeneous AOPs), and UV solar light/TiO 2 (heterogeneous AOPs) in which the highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals (OH) are produced. These radicals are capable of destructing the emerging organic pollutants in water. The combined action of both OH and Cl that are produced during the NaOCl/UV processes increased the chlorination potential of humic acids (HA). In addition, at a high free-radical dose, such as in swimming pool water recirculation systems, the equal levels of <b>adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogens</b> (<b>AOX)</b> and CHCl 3 are formed with both low pressure (LP) and medium pressure (MP), respectively. CHCl 3, once formed, is not degraded with either LP or MP. Moreover, the photo-degradation of HA in LPUV/NaOCl process is higher than that for the MPUV/NaOCl process, which results in a higher initial rate of AOX and CHCl 3 formation. This raised the attention {{to the risk of}} using the LPUV/NaOCl process especially at the short reaction times that are relevant for water treatment. Based on the obtained results, a fixed-bed photocatalytic reactor can be applied for a small scale drinking water purification plants. This is mainly due to that TiO 2 coated by the electrophoretic deposition technique on stainless steel woven meshes fitted in layers has major advantages over the commonly used flat-plate reactor and the dispersed-phase reactor. This presents a novel reactor in the oxidation of water contaminants such as humic acids and atrazine. Up-scaling of such reactors is feasible. It is worth to highlight that the results obtained has led to an improved understanding and applications of AOPs for water treatment. The findings can be used to improve the performance of both small and large scale water purification plants...|$|R

40|$|Ozonation {{is known}} to {{generate}} biodegradable organic matter, which is typically reduced by biological filtration to avoid bacterial regrowth in distribution systems. Post-chlorination generates halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) but {{little is known about}} the biodegradability of their precursors. This study determined the effect of ozonation and biofiltration conditions, specifically ozone exposure and empty bed contact time (EBCT), on the control of DBP formation potentials in drinking water. Ozone exposure was varied through addition of H 2 O 2 during ozonation at 1 mgO 3 /mgDOC followed by biological filtration using either activated carbon (BAC) or anthracite. Ozonation led to a 10 % decrease in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), without further improvement from H 2 O 2 addition. Raising H 2 O 2 concentrations from 0 to 2 mmol/mmolO 3 resulted in increased DBP formation potentials during post-chlorination of the ozonated water (target Cl 2 residual after 24  h =  1 - 2  mg/L) as follows: 4 trihalomethanes (THM 4, 37 %), 8 haloacetic acids (HAA 8, 44 %), chloral hydrate (CH, 107 %), 2 haloketones (HK 2, 97 %), 4 haloacetonitriles (HAN 4, 33 %), trichloroacetamide (TCAM, 43 %), and <b>adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> (<b>AOX,</b> 27 %), but a decrease in the concentrations of 2 trihalonitromethanes (THNM 2, 43 %). Coupling ozonation with biofiltration prior to chlorination effectively lowered the formation potentials of all DBPs including CH, HK 2, and THNM 2, all of which increased after ozonation. The dynamics of DBP formation potentials during BAC filtration at different EBCTs followed first-order reaction kinetics. Minimum steady-state concentrations were attained at an EBCT of about 10 - 20  min, depending on the DBP species. The rate of reduction in DBP formation potentials varied among individual species before reaching their minimum concentrations. CH, HK 2, and THNM 2 had the highest rate constants of between 0. 5 and 0. 6 min(- 1) followed by HAN 4 (0. 4 min(- 1)), THM 4 (0. 3 min(- 1)), HAA 8 (0. 2 min(- 1)), and AOX (0. 1 min(- 1)). At an EBCT of 15  min, the reduction in formation potential for most DBPs was less than 50 % but was higher than 70 % for CH, HK 2, and THNM 2. The formation of bromine-containing DBPs increased with increasing EBCT, most likely due to an increase in Br(-) /DOC ratio. Overall, this study demonstrated that the combination of ozonation and biofiltration is an effective approach to mitigate DBP formation during drinking water treatment...|$|R
