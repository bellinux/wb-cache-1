This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning <b>and</b> <b>decision</b> making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Lionhead Studios used Michael Bratman's belief–desire–intention {{model to}} {{simulate}} creatures' learning <b>and</b> <b>decision</b> making processes. A creature forms an intention by combining desires, opinions, and beliefs. Beliefs {{are attributed to}} lists that store data about various world objects. Desires are goals the creature wants to fulfill, expressed as simplified perceptrons. Opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision trees. For each desire, the creature selects the belief with the best opinion, thus forming an intention or goal.|$|E

5|$|Peter Martyr Vermigli (8 September 149912 November 1562) was an Italian-born Reformed theologian. His {{early work}} as a {{reformer}} in Catholic medieval Italy <b>and</b> <b>decision</b> to flee for Protestant northern Europe influenced many other Italians to convert and flee as well. In England, he influenced the Edwardian Reformation, including the Eucharistic service of the 1552 Book of Common Prayer. He was considered an authority on the Eucharist among the Reformed churches, and engaged in controversies on the subject by writing treatises. Vermigli's Loci Communes, a compilation of excerpts from his biblical commentaries organized by the topics of systematic theology, became a standard Reformed theological textbook.|$|E

In order to do product approximation of the probability distribution, the upper bound of Bayes error rate, bounded by the conditional entropy of a class <b>and</b> <b>decisions,</b> should be minimized.
