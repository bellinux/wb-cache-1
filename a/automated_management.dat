40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} the possible ways of remote management of devices running Mikrotik RouterOS and choosing appropriate variant for implementation of <b>automated</b> remote <b>management</b> of the device, {{which is part}} of a mobile robot.

A substantial part of this work therefore deals with analysis and detailed documentation of proprietary protocols implemented in the MikroTik RouterOS operating system, which are suitable for implementation in an embedded system, from which it is necessary to perform <b>automated</b> remote <b>management.</b> The conclusion describes the principle of the proposed and realized implementation of proprietary protocols in C language.

50|$|Historically, {{one set of}} {{resources}} was dedicated to one particular computing technology, business application or line of business, and managed in a silo-like fashion. These resources supported a single set of requirements and processes, and couldn’t easily be optimized or reconfigured to support actual demand. This led technology providers to build out and complement their product-centric infrastructure and management offerings with Converged Infrastructure environments that converge servers, storage, networking, security, management and facilities. The efficiencies of having this type of integrated and <b>automated</b> <b>management</b> environment allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with simpler manageability and maintenance, and enables IT to adjust IT resources (such as servers, storage and networking) quicker to meet unpredictable business demand.|$|E
