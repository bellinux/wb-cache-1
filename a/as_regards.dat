The systemic manifestations of COPD include a number of endocrine disorders, such as those involving the pituitary, the thyroid, the gonads, the adrenals and the pancreas. Aim of the work: The aim of this work was to assess thyroid gland functions and hypogonadism among male patients with COPD and its relation to diseases severity. Patients and methods: The study included 60 male patients diagnosed as COPD were selected and classified according to the Egyptian society for chest diseases and tuberculosis (ESCT) into three groups (mild, moderate and sever COPD) where cases and their age matched controls were evaluated <b>as</b> <b>regard</b> thyroid, gonadotrophins and androgen levels (TSH, FT 3, FT 4, FSH, LH, DHEAS-S, testosterone total and free were measured). Results: When we made comparison between patients with different grades of COPD <b>as</b> <b>regard</b> thyroid, gonadotrophins and androgen levels we found statistical difference between mild versus moderate and mild versus severe COPD <b>as</b> <b>regard</b> FT 3 and mild versus moderate and severe COPD <b>as</b> <b>regard</b> DAHEAS-S and testosterone. And, the study showed that’s there were statistical difference <b>as</b> <b>regard</b> free testosterone among patients with COPD, but there was high statistical significant difference <b>as</b> <b>regard</b> DHEAS-S and testosterone. Conclusion: After assessment of thyroid gland functions and hypogonadism among male patients with COPD, we found hypogonadism increases with age and the degree of severity of COPD...|$|R

5|$|As English courts do {{not form}} part of Singapore's {{hierarchy}} of courts, decisions of such courts are not binding on Singapore courts. However, {{as a result of}} Singapore's colonial heritage, English judicial precedents continue to exercise a strong influence on the legal system and are regarded as highly persuasive, particularly <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> the development of the common law, and the interpretation of English statutes applicable in Singapore and Singapore statutes modelled on English enactments. Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of Singapore law. For instance, Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of criminal law and procedure because Singapore borrowed heavily from India in these areas.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>regards</b> numbers, the mid-2nd-century army {{contained}} c. 80,000 cavalry out of c. 385,000 total effectives i.e. cavalry constituted c. 21% of {{the total}} forces. For the late army, about {{one third of the}} army units in the Notitia are cavalry, but in numbers cavalry were a smaller proportion {{of the total}} because cavalry units were on average smaller than infantry units. For example, in the comitatus, cavalry vexillationes were probably half the size of infantry legiones. Overall, the available evidence suggests that the proportion of cavalry was much the same as in the 2nd century. Examples: in 478, a comitatus of 38,000 men contained 8,000 cavalry (21%). In 357, the comitatus of Gaul, 13–15,000 strong, contained an estimated 3,000 cavalry (20–23%).|$|E

Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E

Together with rapid rise of criminality involving illegal firearms following the Velvet Revolution, this led to fast rise in legal firearms ownership in the country in the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed firearms licenses. The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> C licenses, while E licenses remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders began to rise again (mostly E licenses).
