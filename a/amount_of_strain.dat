Ice will not flow until it has reached a thickness of 30 meters (98ft), but after 50 meters (164ft), small amounts of stress can result in a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain,</b> causing the deformation to become a plastic flow rather than elastic. At this point the glacier will begin to deform under its own weight and flow across the landscape.

50|$|In {{materials}} science, {{stress relaxation}} is the observed decrease in stress {{in response to}} the same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> generated in the structure. This is primarily due to keeping the structure in a strained condition for some finite interval of time and hence causing some amount of plastic strain. This {{should not be confused with}} creep, which is a constant state of stress with an increasing <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain.</b>|$|E
30|$|There {{are little}} {{differences}} on soybean curd yield between using two stains in fermentation, and {{no significant differences}} in the product’s color, flavor, morphology, and taste. Therefore, we can consider mixing two stains in fermentation, or adding the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> to study the impact on soybean curd quality.|$|R
30|$|Besides, it {{was also}} might be that the {{adsorption}} capacity between different mineral and different microorganisms was different and the adsorption capacity of mineral for microorganisms also shifted under different temperature. Previous study found that compared to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> At. ferrooxidans R 1 and SP 3 attached to chalcopyrite or sphalerite, attachment to pyrite was higher, and compared to chalcopyrite, less <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> R 1 and more <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> SP 3 attach to sphalerite (Harneit et al. 2006). Therefore, it might explain why additional chalcopyrite increased zinc leaching efficiency at low temperature while decreased it at high temperature. This is also a common phenomenon in natural ecosystem, such that for species turnover rates (one ecosystem function), temperature effects are strongest at intermediate nutrient gradients in subtropical regions, while at two extreme ends of nutrient gradients in subarctic regions (Wang et al. 2016). That is, temperature effect on ecosystem function is versatile in ecosystem with different nutrient/energy resource condition.|$|R

40|$|Many dyke {{intrusion}} {{events have}} repeatedly occurred at Izu-Tobu Volcanoes since 1978 ．In order to evaluate volcanic activity of Izu-Tobu Volcanoes and to forecast the volcanic eruption，we investigate {{relationship between the}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> intrusive magma estimated from dyke parameters obtained by previous studies and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> volumetric <b>strain</b> change observed at Higashi-Izu．As a result，we find {{that there is an}} obvious correlation between the volume of dyke intrusions and the maximum <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> volumetric <b>strain</b> changes in 24 hours． In addition，we notice that large magma intrusion causes a remarkable seismic activity more than expected from the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> volumetric <b>strain</b> changes． We propose a new technique for estimating the volume of dyke intrusion by using volumetric strain data observed at Higashi-Izu and introduce a new alert criteria based on the potential of volcanic eruption at Izu-Tobu Volcanoes．If our alert criteria is introduced，it is possible that volcanic warning is issued in an earlier stage of dyke intrusion event compared with the past...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> {{energy in}} bicyclic systems is {{commonly}} {{the sum of}} the strain energy in each individual ring. [...] This isn't always the case, as sometimes the fusion of rings induces some extra strain.|$|E

50|$|Simulations of jammed {{systems study}} {{particle}} conﬁgurations leading to jamming in both static systems and systems under shear.

40|$|Various <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> and lattice {{deformation}} were introduced into Si substrates by the deposition of amorphous Si films <b>of</b> different thicknesses. <b>Strain</b> and deformation are concentrated along the film edges and were recorded as contrast in double-crystal X-ray topograph (DXRT) images.

40|$|Continuous {{geodetic}} measurements from convergent margins {{have shown}} that deep transient creep events can release large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> energy without detectable seismic shaking, and they are thus known as slow or silent earthquakes.

5000|$|Necking, in {{engineering}} or materials science, is {{a mode of}} tensile deformation where relatively large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> localize disproportionately in a small region of the material. The resulting prominent decrease in local cross-sectional area provides {{the basis for the}} name [...] "neck". Because the local strains in the neck are large, necking is often closely associated with yielding, a form of plastic deformation associated with ductile materials, often metals or polymers. The neck eventually becomes a fracture when enough strain is applied.|$|R
50|$|Dynamic {{recrystallization}} {{occurs when}} a rock undergoes metamorphic conditions and reequilibrium of a minerals chemical composition. This happens {{when there is a}} decrease in free energy stored in deformed grains. Deformed micas can store a sufficient <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> energy that can allow recrystallization to occur. This process allows oriented regrowth of both old and new minerals into the damaged crystal lattice during cleavage development.|$|E
5000|$|Harnessing {{the strain}} rate {{determinants}} - In this mode, the relationship governing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> incurred per unit effort is altered so that less strain is incurred. This {{is done for}} instance through endurance programs and providing productive work environments in organizational management, or by reduced interest rates in macroeconomic management to reduce the economic strain incurred as economic agents pursue economic activities.|$|E
50|$|Hence bulk atoms (i.e. {{sufficiently}} large clusters) generally {{revert to}} one of the crystalline close-packing configurations instead. In other words, when icosahedral clusters get sufficiently large, the bulk-atom vote wins out over the surface-atom vote, and the atoms beneath each of the 20 facets adopt a face-centered-cubic pyramidal arrangement with tetrahedral (111) facets. Thus icosahedral twins are born, with a certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> along the interfacial (111) planes.|$|E

40|$|Strained and sheared {{turbulence}} is computed {{by direct}} simulation and it is shown that the results are in good qualitative agreement with experiments. It is found that after large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> have been applied to turbulence, the energy flow to the small scales is reduced and, in some cases, reversed. Eddy viscosity models are shown to be very poor in strained turbulence and, when they are used, the mean strain should not be included in them.

The relation between the yield stress and the microstructure of these samples was investigated. The Hall-Petch behaviour is maintained when a dependence of the Hall-Petch slope on the boundary misorientation is taken into account.

50|$|ICLs are {{fabricated}} from semiconductor heterostructures grown using {{molecular beam}} epitaxy (MBE). The materials used in the structure are InAs, GaSb, AlSb, and related alloys. These three binary materials are very closely lattice matched with lattice parameters close to 6.1 Å. Thus, these materials can be incorporated {{together in the same}} heterostructure without introducing a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain.</b> The MBE growth is typically done on either a GaSb or InAs substrate.|$|E
50|$|Observation of {{recrystallization}} {{in a rock}} sample {{can reveal}} a general temperature, but nothing very precise. This is because the process of recrystallization is strongly affected {{by the presence of}} water and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> present. As such, this information can be applied to determine relative temperatures of different rock much more reliably than it can determine absolute temperatures. Furthermore, this is an analysis that can be done, if only preliminarily, in the field by observing rocks in hand sample.|$|E
5000|$|The intent, in {{addition}} to building strength and conditioning, is to toughen the knuckles, wrist, and forearm in the punching position. This variation also reduces the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> in the wrist, compared to the typical [...] "palms on floor" [...] approach, {{and so it is}} sometimes used by those with wrist injuries. Such practitioners will usually perform their knuckle push-ups on a padded floor or a rolled-up towel, unlike martial artists, who may do bare-knuckle push-ups on hard floors.|$|E
50|$|SK {{growth can}} be {{described}} by both of these inequalities. While initial film growth follows a FM mechanism, i.e. positive differential μ, nontrivial <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> energy accumulate in the deposited layers. At a critical thickness, this strain induces a sign reversal in the chemical potential, i.e. negative differential μ, leading to a switch in the growth mode. At this point it is energetically favorable to nucleate islands and further growth occurs by a VW type mechanism. A thermodynamic criterion for layer growth {{similar to the one}} presented above can be obtained using a force balance of surface tensions and contact angle.|$|R

50|$|Concrete is a brittle {{material}} {{and can only}} withstand small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> tensile <b>strain</b> due to stress before cracking. When a reinforced concrete member is put in tension, after cracking, the member elongates by widening of cracks and by formation of new cracks.|$|R
50|$|During lithium intercalation, {{the volume}} of the {{electrode}} expands, causing mechanical strain. The mechanical strain compromises the structural integrity of the electrode, causing it to crack. Nanoparticles can decrease the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> placed on a material when the battery undergoes cycling, as the volume expansion associated with nanoparticles is less than the volume expansion associated with microparticles. The little volume expansion associated with nanoparticles also improves the reversibility capability of the battery: the ability of the battery to undergo many cycles without losing charge.|$|E
5000|$|Satisficing in EST is {{thus the}} result of an interplay of {{internal}} effort (the total effort being exerted by the volitional entity), strain and the satisficing threshold given the prior condition that the axioms defining the theory's universe (namely volition and self-preservation) are satisfied. In EST, factors called the [...] influence the relationship governing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> incurred per unit effort. Other factors called the [...] influence the value of the satisficing threshold, the level of strain at which satisficing tendency becomes very strong.|$|E
50|$|As {{deformation}} proceeds {{the geometric}} instability causes strain to continue concentrating {{in the neck}} until the material either ruptures or the necked material hardens enough, {{as indicated by the}} second tangent point in the top diagram, to cause other regions of the material to deform instead. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> in the stable neck is called the natural draw ratio because it is determined by the material's hardening characteristics, not the amount of drawing imposed on the material. Ductile polymers often exhibit stable necks because molecular orientation provides a mechanism for hardening that predominates at large strains.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, in {{children}} with ARDS the lung stress cannot be predicted from the airway pressure and the tidal volume normalized for the body weight can produce different <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> lung <b>strain.</b> Thus, an ideal respiratory monitoring system {{in children}} with mild-to-moderate ARDS should provide the measurement <b>of</b> stress and <b>strain.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{fundamental}} proposition of {{the effort}} satisficing theory is that [...] "Volitional entities tend to satisfice on efforts". EST postulates that: people generally exhibit volition (choice) and are as such volitional entities (i.e. people exhibit freedom of choice), volitional entities tend to exhibit a self-preservation imperative (i.e. they try to ensure their well-being is not significantly degraded), the exertion of effort results in the incurrence of [...] (which is the outcome of effort exertion for instance, tiredness or financial strain) and volitional entities believe that large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> signal {{a threat to their}} self-preservation imperative. Consequently, when the level <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> incurred by the volitional entity exceeds a threshold called the , volitional entities tend to exhibit satisficing behaviour by satisficing on their effort exertion.|$|R
