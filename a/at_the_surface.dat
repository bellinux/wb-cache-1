30|$|Combining Figs.  3 and 4 with Fig.  2, we can {{conclude}} {{that there is an}} alternating convex-concave curling deformation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> four corners and the track center.

When <b>the</b> temperature <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> is higher than that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>surface,</b> tensile stress occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>surface</b> and induces downward curling of the four corners; when <b>the</b> temperature <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> is lower than that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>surface,</b> there will be tensile stress <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top <b>surface</b> and four corners will curl upward.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of adsorption of charged polymers onto like-charged surfaces {{has been a}} matter of debates in recent years. We propose a mean-field theory for the interactions of like-charged polyelectrolyte and a plane <b>surface</b> in <b>the</b> presence of 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 electrolyte, which takes into account long-range van der Waals and double-layer forces. The theory is able to predict the optimum conditions, such as solvent composition, pH and temperature, for polyelectrolyte adsorption on like-charged surfaces as well as to account for the conformational properties of a polymer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces.</b> An excellent agreement of the predictions of the theory with the available experimental data suggests that it {{can be used as a}} simple tool for predicting the optimum conditions for studying various polyelectrolyte properties, including their biological activity, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Particularly simple expressions for the polymer/surface interaction energy have been obtained in the Debye!Huckel limit.

30|$|Osteopontin is {{a highly}} charged {{glycoprotein}} present in the extra cellular matrix {{of a wide range}} of tissues. It is, in particular, relevant for biomaterials through its role in mineralized tissue remodeling. The adsorption and enzymatic cleavage of osteopontin at four different surface chemistries (methyl-, carboxylic-, and amine-terminated alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers and bare gold) have been studied utilizing a combination of the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation and surface plasmon resonance. Full length bovine milk osteopontin was used which is well characterized with respect to post-translational modifications. Osteopontin adsorbed <b>at</b> all <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> formed thin (∼ 2 – 5 nm) hydrated layers with the highest amount of protein and the highest density layers observed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hydrophobic <b>surface.</b> Less protein and a higher level of hydration was observed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> polar <b>surfaces</b> with <b>the</b> highest level of hydration being observed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gold <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> energy dissipation of these thin films (as measured by the ΔD/ΔF value) was altered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> different <b>surface</b> chemistries and interestingly a higher dissipation correlated with a higher density. Thrombin was able to bind and cleave <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> bound osteopontin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hydrophobic <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> altered levels of osteopontin binding, hydration of the layer, and susceptibility to thrombin cleavage suggest that osteopontin adopts different conformations and/or orientations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> different material <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R
