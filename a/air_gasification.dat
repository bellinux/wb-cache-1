40|$|The {{increasing}} yield of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) {{is one of the}} main by-products of modern society. Among various MSW treatment methods, plasma gasification in a fixed-bed melting reactor (PGM) is a new technology, which may provide an efficient and environmental friendly solution for problems related to MSW disposals. General objectives of this work are to develop mathematical models for the PGM process, and using these models to analyze the characteristics of this new technology. In this thesis, both experimental measurement and numerical analysis are carried out to evaluate the performance of both <b>air</b> <b>gasification</b> and air&steam gasification in a PGM reactor. Furthermore, parameter studies were launched to investigate the effect of three main operation parameters: equivalence ratio (ER), steam feedstock mass ratio(S/F) and plasma energy ratio (PER). Based on the above analysis, the optimal suggestions aiming at providing highest syngas calorific value, as well as system energy efficiency, are given. Six experimental tests were conducted in a demonstration reactor. These tests are classified into two groups: <b>air</b> <b>gasification</b> (case 1 and 2) and air&steam gasification (case 3 to 6). In all these cases, the plasma gasification and melting of MSW produced a   syngas with a lower heating value of 6. 0 - 7. 0 MJ/Nm 3. By comparing the syngas yield and calorific value, the study found out that the steam and air mixture is a better gasification agent than pure air. It is also discovered that the operation parameters seriously influence the operation of the PGM process. A zero-dimensional kinetic free model was built up to investigate the influence of operation parameters. The model was developed using the popular process simulation software Aspen Plus. In this model, the whole plasma gasification and melting process was divided into four layers: drying, pyrolysis, char combustion&gasificaiton, and plasma melting. Mass and energy balances were considered in all layers. It was proved that the model is able to give good agreement of the syngas yield and composition. This model was used to study the influence of ER, S/F and PER on average gasification temperature, syngas composition and syngas yield. It is pointed out that a common problem for the PGM <b>air</b> <b>gasification</b> is the incomplete char conversion due to low ER value. Both increasing plasma power and feeding steam is helpful for solving this problem. The syngas quality can also be improved by reasonably feeding high temperature steam into the reactor.   In order to provide detailed information inside the reactor, a two-dimensional steady model was developed for the PGM process. The model used the Euler-Euler multiphase approach. The mass, momentum and energy balances of both gas and solid phases are considered in this model. The model described the complex chemical and physical processes such as drying, pyrolysis, homogeneous reactions, heterogeneous char reactions and melting of the inorganic components of MSW. The rates of chemical reactions are controlled by kinetic rates and physical transport theories. The model is capable of simulating the pressure fields, temperature fields, and velocity fields of both phase, as well as variations of gas and solid composition insider the reactor. This model was used to simulate both <b>air</b> <b>gasification</b> and air&steam gasification of MSW in the PGM reactor. For PGM <b>air</b> <b>gasification,</b> simulated results showed that when ER varies from 0. 043 to 0. 077, both the syngas yield and cold gas efficiency demonstrated a trend of increasing. This is explained mainly by the increase of char conversion rate with ER. However, the increase of ER was restricted by peak temperature inside the fixed-bed reactor. Therefore, it is not suggested to use only air as gasification in the PGM process. The influence of plasma power is not obvious when PER varies from 0. 098 to 0. 138.  The positive influences of steam addition on cold gas efficiency and syngas lower-heating-value are confirmed by the simulation results of PGM air&steam gasification. The main effect of steam addition is the rouse of water shift reaction, which largely accelerates the char conversion and final yields of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The effect of steam injection is affected by steam feeding rate, air feeding rate and plasma power. Based on the above modeling work, Interactions between operation parameters were discussed. Possible operation extents of operation parameters are delimitated. The optimal points aiming at obtaining maximum syngas LHV and system CGE are suggested...|$|E

30|$|Biomass {{gasification}} can {{be investigated}} using mathematical models when large-scale experimental studies are expensive {{and difficult to}} conduct. Extensive reviews on biomass gasification models were presented by Baruah and Baruah [3] and Puig-Arnavat et al. [4]. Among the available gasification models, thermodynamic equilibrium model (TEM) serves as an effective preliminary tool to analyse the effect of different feed stocks and operating parameters on biomass gasification. In general, equilibrium modelling can be achieved through two distinct approaches namely, stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric [5]. Even though both the approaches are conceptually similar, they differ in procedure, as the latter one is comparatively complicated in procedure. Thus, stoichiometric thermodynamic equilibrium models were formulated by many researchers to investigate biomass gasification [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Zainal et al. [14] successfully demonstrated <b>air</b> <b>gasification</b> of biomass using equilibrium constant expressions of water gas shift reaction and methanation reaction in terms of gasification temperature. TEMs can be modified to improve its prediction accuracy by considering char conversion, tar formation and incorporating suitable coefficients to equilibrium constants. Modification of TEM to augment its prediction accuracy was demonstrated by Jarungthammachote and Dutta [15] and Huang and Ramaswamy [16] for <b>air</b> <b>gasification,</b> Loha et al. [17] for steam gasification and Lim and Lee [18] for air–steam gasification. Barman et al. [19] considered tar as a compound containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in <b>air</b> <b>gasification.</b> Azzone et al. [20] considered char conversion {{as a function of}} equivalence ratio (ER) in air–steam gasification, whereas Lim and Lee [18] expressed it as a function of equivalence ratio and temperature. Abuadula et al. [13] included tar as benzene and unreacted char as 5  % of biomass carbon content in steam gasification model. Ng et al. [9] considered char as solid carbon and tar as a compound containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen along with correction factors for equilibrium constants as temperature dependent. Nguyen et al. [21] developed a three-stage quasi-equilibrium model for steam gasification of biomass where the deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium was reduced using empirical relations. Application of engineering equation solver (EES) in the modelling of biomass gasification was demonstrated by Puig-Arnavat et al. [22]. Deviation of this model from pure equilibrium is minimised by considering char and tar, pyrolysis, heat loss in pyrolysis, particles leaving the gasifier and setting the amount of CH 4 produced. Present work deals with the stoichiometric modelling of air–steam gasification considering tar and char and its application to compare the effect of different feed stocks in biomass gasification. The present work deals with the comparison of gasification process with different feed stocks in terms of syngas composition, gas yield and first law efficiency.|$|E
30|$|Pyrolysis {{results in}} removal of {{volatile}} matters and yields a solid residue called char (Kiihl et al. 1992). It {{is important to}} study the internal structure of solid residue after heat treatment because it affects the char reactivity. There are number of randomly oriented and different shapes pores with radii ranging from one length of nanometers to tens of nanometer (Liu et al. 2000). To explain the formation of pores during gasification, there are three mechanisms (Rodrigues-Reinoso 1991): (1) the width of existing pores, (2) the formation of new pores by selective gasification of certain structural components and (3) the opening of formerly unreachable pores. The total pore volume measured is further {{divided into two groups}} i.e., micropore region and the combined mesopore and macropore region (Siauw et al. 1984 and Rodrigues-Reinoso 1991). The micropores play important role in the reactivity of char particles because micro-pores take up approximately 95 % of total surface area, while the meso-pores and macro-pores provide the passage to reactant gases to reach the active carbon sites in the micro-pores where actual gasification reaction take place (Siauw et al. 1984; Liu et al. 2000). At low carbon conversion, pore swelling is dominant which result in an increased surface area, as reaction proceeds pores starts collapsing which leads to decrease in surface (Liu et al. 2000). Kiihl et al. (1992) reported that steam gasification produces a less microporous structure than CO 2 gasification. Feng and Bhatia (2003) reported that in <b>air</b> <b>gasification</b> pore structure development is different from CO 2 gasification. During CO 2 gasification, volume and surface area of small micropores increases very dramatically as gasification reaction progresses whereas in <b>air</b> <b>gasification</b> volume and surface area of small micropores does not change appreciably with carbon conversion after a particular extent of carbon conversion (Feng and Bhatia 2003).|$|E

It will {{also be used to}} determine whether the cold gas, exergy, and energy efficiencies of gases may be maximized by using secondary <b>air</b> injected to <b>gasification</b> zone under various ratios (0, 0. 5, 1, and 1. 5) at optimum ER of 0. 195.

They confirmed that the feasibility of co-gasification process for pine woodchips blends with poor quality coals. When black coal was considered, a minimum of 25 % of pine woodchips was needed to significantly enrich the overall efficiency; the product gas lower heating value (LHV) and the carbon conversion also increased. (McLendon et al. 2004) reported on a series of air-blown fluidized bed and entrained bed co-gasification tests with coal and straw. Pressures in the larger unit (based on U-Gas design) were up to 14.2 bar, and feed rates of the feedstock were a maximum of 720 kg/h. Feeding presented problems, but some synergies were noted.(Madhukar et al. 2007) observed in their study that combined steam and <b>air</b> <b>gasification</b> gave much higher H 2 yield than <b>air</b> <b>gasification</b> alone.(Doherty et al. 2009) studied the effects of varying equivalence ratio, temperature, level of air preheating, biomass moisture and input steam on syngas composition, and gas heating value.(Li et al. 2010) discussed the effect of temperature on the amount of hydrogen production. They found that a higher temperature caused higher hydrogen production and syngas yield.(Loha et al. 2011) investigated the alternation of hydrogen production, the LHV of syngas, energy and exergy efficiencies by varying the steam-to-fuel ratio, and temperature of gasifier. Industrial scale experience with coal and biomass or waste co-gasification is reported for several plants, e.g., the Buggenum plant in the Netherlands, where efforts of co-gasification of up to 50 % w/w of biomass were undertaken to generate a high proportion of green energy (Howaniec et al. 2011).|$|E

An air:wood mass ratio of 0. 7 was measured and in our operating conditions, and was not sensitive to air mass flux and bed density. With oxidative pyrolysis, yields of organic condensates were lower than with allothermal pyrolysis, whereas the production of pyrolysis water and permanent gases increased. Finally, the oxidation zone was shown to be flat and horizontal in a wood pellet bed but inclined in a wood chip bed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The Engineering Development Group within the CO 2 CRC is involved with assessing and optimization the process designs associated with the capture of CO 2. The Engineering Development Group recently assessed a number of capture methods for <b>air</b> blown <b>gasification</b> of brown coal. Objectives The aim of the project is to assess three different solvent absorption methods for the capture of CO 2 from a shifted synthesis gas stream prior to combustion in a gas turbine. The project will build on the framework already developed by Urech for an IGCC powerstation based on black coal. The mass and energy balances will be developed in greater detail with emphasis on the water gas shift reactor and the solvent capture processes. The three solvent capture processes will be...|$|R
40|$|Gasification is a thermo-chemical {{process which}} {{transforms}} biomass into valuable synthesis gas. Integrated with a biorefinery it can address the facility?s residue handling challenges and input demands. A number of feedstock, technology, oxidizer and product options {{are available for}} gasification along with combinations thereof. The objective of this work {{is to create a}} systematic method for optimizing the design of a residual biomass gasification unit. In detail, this work involves development of an optimization superstructure, creation of a biorefining scenario, process simulation, equipment sizing & costing, economic evaluation and optimization. The superstructure accommodates different feedstocks, reactor technologies, syngas cleaning options and final processing options. The criterion for optimization is annual worth. A biorefining scenario for the production of renewable diesel fuel from seed oil is developed; gasification receives the residues from this biorefinery. Availability of Soybeans, Jatropha, Chinese Tallow and woody biomass material is set by land use within a 50 -mile radius. Four reactor technologies are considered, based on oxidizer type and operating pressure, along with three syngas cleaning methods and five processing options. Results show that residual gasification is profitable for large-scale biorefineries with the proper configuration. Low-pressure <b>air</b> <b>gasification</b> with filters, water-gas shift and hydrogen separation is the most advantageous combination of technology and product with an annual worth of $ 9. 1 MM and a return on investment of 10. 7 percent. Low-pressure <b>air</b> <b>gasification</b> with filters and methanol synthesis is the second most advantageous combination with an annual worth of $ 9. 0 MM. Gasification is more economic for residue processing than combustion or disposal, and it competes well with natural gas-based methanol synthesis. However, it is less economic than steam-methane reforming of natural gas to hydrogen. Carbon dioxide credits contribute to profitability, affecting some configurations more than others. A carbon dioxide credit of $ 33 /t makes the process competitive with conventional oil and gas development. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates a 10 percent change in hydrogen or electricity price results in a change to the optimal configuration of the unit. Accurate assessment of future commodity prices is critical to maximizing profitability...|$|E
40|$|Gasification and {{pyrolysis}} {{are very}} promising technologies for clean energy production especially from low rank fuels. Biomass and wastes with high chlorine, alkali and even heavy metals content are fuels preferential for thermal utilization. However, several problems during combustion in conventional steam boilers occurs e. g. slagging, fouling, chlorine corrosion, boiler efficiency deterioration. New efficient and cost effective technologies are needed, even in small-scale applications. The main {{objective of this}} work was to compare the thermochemical behaviour and process parameters effects of different biomass under <b>air</b> <b>gasification</b> and pyrolysis conditions. Three important fuels for European power industry were selected: woody biomass and two residual biomass, such as oat straw and dried citrus wastes. In order to evaluate the possibility to use different feedstocks or to combine and/or integrate them in thermochemical processes, a comparison among typical and untypical feedstocks is needed. Tests performed on small scale fixed bed reactor show the gas yield, its composition and LHV parameter. The results were performed in Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden during BRISK program (Biofuels Research Infrastructure for Sharing Knowledge) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, a revised {{equilibrium}} model (gas-solid) was built. The temperature approach to equilibrium for the methane cracking reaction was specified {{to improve the}} prediction accuracy. The model was applied and validated in pilot scale experiments using a 150 kgh(- 1) two-stage downdraft gasifier and a gasifier from the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN). The type of gasification agent is a dominant factor that determines product gas composition, quality, and end-use. A theoretical analysis {{of the effect of}} gasifying agent on product gas quality and process efficiency was executed based on the model calculation. The optimal operation conditions were established for the three (air, steam, oxygen-steam) gasification processes. For <b>air</b> <b>gasification,</b> an optimal value of equivalence ratio (ER) of 0. 31 corresponds to the maximum gasification efficiency. The optimal range of steam/carbon ratio (SR) is between 0. 7 and 0. 8 for the equilibrium of the water-gas shift and steam reforming reactions. For autothermal oxygen-steam gasification, the H- 2 concentration reaches the highest value for SR= 1. 0...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} address the effects of mixing low-calorific fuel in to a natural gas fuelled large size {{combined}} cycle plant. Three different biofuels are tested namely; <b>air</b> blown <b>gasification</b> gas, indirect gasification gas and digestion gas. Simulations have been performed from 0 - 100 % biofuel natural gas mixtures. The biofuel impacts on the full cycle performance are discussed. Some more in-depth discussion about turbo-machinery components will be introduced when needed for the discussion. The compressors pressure ratio will increase in order to push the inert ballast of the low calorific fuels trough the turbine. Despite the increased expansion ratio in the gas turbine, the exhaust temperature raises slightly which derives from changed gas properties. The work {{is based on an}} in-house advanced off-design model within the software package IPSEPro. Sweden's newest plant "Oresundsverket", which is a combined heat and power (CHP) plant, is used as a basis for the Investigation.
