50|$|The {{amount of}} {{material}} in the forest floor depends on the balance between inputs from litter production and outputs from decomposition, and amounts also reflect the site's disturbance history. Both litter production and decomposition are functions of the site (e.g., wet versus dry; cold versus warm; nutrient rich versus nutrient poor) and the vegetation that occupies the site (e.g., conifer versus broadleaf). A site's forest floor is determined by its <b>areal</b> <b>weight,</b> depth, and nutrient content. Typically, forest floors are heaviest and deepest in boreal forests and mountain forests where decomposition rates are slow. In contrast, the lightest and thinnest forest floors usually occur in tropical rain forests where decomposition rates are rapid, except on white sands where nutrients could not be supplied from mineral weathering.|$|E

The key problem in using this valuable dataset is the need to reassign the data to other geographical areas when the geographical zonal systems are incompatible. Areal interpolation is used to dis-aggregate census data into areas or zones that are compatible and can be analyzed. In this project, two population distribution models are compared using areal interpolation. The two distribution models evaluated consist of simple <b>areal</b> <b>weighting</b> and a dasymetric-based approach. Simple <b>areal</b> <b>weighting</b> is used with 2000 census data in various zip code areas. The dasymetric approach uses the Hennepin County, MN parcels to redistribute the same 2000 census data.

Therefore, it is important to establish the fundamental understanding {{of the relationship between the}} microstructure and the macroscopic behavior. Motivated by this, mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of aramid nonwovens as a function of <b>areal</b> <b>weight</b> were reported using several analytical tools. The initial fiber orientation alignment was found significantly different within the nonwoven types according to XRD patterns.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A linear {{analytical}} model is proposed {{to evaluate the}} magnitude of the impact force {{as a function of the}} velocity of the impactor. This model provides a simple tool for estimating {{the magnitude of the}} impact load from the impact energy. For hybrid composites subjected to low- and medium-velocity impacts where elastic deformation is assumed, the effect of cross section material distribution on impact response was investigated. For a hybrid metal/polymer laminate and a hybrid titanium composite laminate, the relative position of the laminate plies has a significant effect on the plate deflection under impact loads. For equal <b>areal</b> <b>weight</b> plates, the number of layers in a hybrid composite laminate does not appear to affect the impact resistance. However, the relative material ratio of metal to polymer (or metal to polymeric composite) in hybrid composites significantly affects the impact response. Furthermore, the relative ply thickness in a laminate does not have significant effect on its impact resistance for plates with equal <b>areal</b> <b>weight,</b> but the research shows that the total relative material distribution does significantly affect the impact response. The analysis also shows that the effect of cross section material distribution can be qualitatively evaluated by checking the bending stiffness of the plate...|$|E

A stochastic model is employed to measure the estimation error caused in data transfer between incompatible zonal systems. The relationship between estimation error and the geometrical properties of zones is approximately represented in analytical forms.

40|$|In {{this paper}} several {{bidirectional}} flax fibers, usually used to made curtains, were employed as reinforcement of an epoxy matrix. Four different laminates {{were made by}} a vacuum bagging process, with varying both the <b>areal</b> <b>weight</b> and {{the treatment of the}} fabric. These structures were mechanically investigated carrying out both tensile and three point flexural tests. In order to evaluate the effect of the identified variables on the mechanical parameters (i. e. Young modulus and maximum stress) a statistical analysis was performed. Finally, by comparing the flax composite with a glass one, the convenience of the replacement of glass fiber was investigated in term of cost, weight and mechanical performances, by evaluating the structural efficiency coefficient {{of the cost of the}} material. The presence of layers with different <b>areal</b> <b>weight</b> within the structure induced a significant worsening of the flexural properties, with the start of cracks that produced a delamination failure. Also the tensile modulus got worse. Whereas the treatment on the fibers always improved the mechanical properties because the treated layer showed a behaviour of a pre-impregnated structure. For flexural stresses, the cost analysis was favourable to the substitution of the glass fibers with the flax ones. From this study, the composites reinforced with flax fibers could be used in several fields, as marine or automotive...|$|E

In the study we used a number of ballistic composites (20 cm x 20 cm) with different <b>areal</b> <b>weight</b> (thickness) and fiber/resin ratio. The composites were made with an open mold high pressure, high-temperature compression of prepreg layers made of plain woven ballistic nylon fabric and polyvinyl butyral modified phenolic resin of the resole type. The preparation of the composite experimental samples was conducted in accordance with the 22 full factorial experimental design. The <b>areal</b> <b>weight</b> of the composites was taken to be the first factor and the second was the fiber/resin ratio.

To approximate the response i. e. the ballistic strength of the composites within the study domain (2 – 9) kg/m 2 x (80 / 20 – 50 / 50) fiber/resin ratio, the first-order linear model with the interaction was used.

40|$|BackgroundTransforming {{spatial data}} from one scale to another is a {{challenge}} in geographic analysis. As part of a larger, primary study to determine a possible association between travel barriers to pediatric cancer facilities and adolescent cancer mortality across the United States, we examined methods to estimate mortality within zones at varying distances from these facilities: (1) geographic centroid assignment, (2) population-weighted centroid assignment, (3) simple <b>areal</b> <b>weighting,</b> (4) combined population and <b>areal</b> <b>weighting,</b> and (5) geostatistical areal interpolation. For the primary study, we used county mortality counts from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and population data by census tract for the United States to estimate zone mortality. In this paper, to evaluate the five mortality estimation methods, we employed address-level mortality data {{from the state of}} Georgia in conjunction with census data. Our objective here is to identify the simplest method that returns accurate mortality estimates. ResultsThe distribution of Georgia county adolescent cancer mortality counts mirrors the Poisson distribution of the NCHS counts for the U. S. Likewise, zone value patterns, along with the error measures of hierarchy and fit, are similar for the state and the nation. Therefore, Georgia data are suitable for methods testing. The mean absolute value arithmetic differences between the observed counts for Georgia and the five methods were 5. 50, 5. 00, 4. 17, 2. 74, and 3. 43, respectively. Comparing the methods through paired t-tests of absolute value arithmetic differences showed no statistical difference among the methods. However, we found a strong positive correlation (r 20 = 200. 63) between estimated Georgia mortality rates and combined weighting rates at zone level. Most importantly, Bland 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cAltman plots indicated acceptable agreement between paired arithmetic differences of Georgia rates and combined population and <b>areal</b> <b>weighting</b> rates.

A parametric study on composite sandwich mirrors {{was conducted by}} using finite element analysis as well as optical analysis. The factors covered the cell sizes, core materials, core thicknesses, face layups, and support configurations. Based on theoretical calculations, many high quality spherical composite sandwich mirrors were generated by using a non-heat curing process. The CFRP faces and Nomex core were chosen as the baseline materials for mirror fabrication due to their high strength and low weight. The proposed replication method applied an interface layer between face and surface coat to eliminate print-through problems.

40|$|A problem often {{encountered}} in spatial analysis is the unavailability of aggregated data for areal units {{that are not}} the desired units. To overcome this problem, areal interpolation methods are used to estimate unknown data values {{for a set of}} areal units based on the known data values for another set of areal units. A number of areal interpolation methods exist and there is no single method that is considered superior. Choosing the appropriate method to use often depends on the type of problem to be solved and the desired level of accuracy. ^ This study proposes an areal interpolation method by means of artificial neural networks. Artificial neural networks are computation models inspired by the biological neural network of the human brain. These computational models have been widely used in spatial analysis including applications within the sub-fields of remote sensing, spatial interaction modeling, and spatial interpolation. One advantage of using neural networks for spatial analysis problems is that there are no underlying assumptions that need to be made about the data being interpolated. ^ In this study, neural networks are applied to two areal interpolation scenarios; the “missing data” problem and the “alternative geography” problem. In both instances, the data to be estimated by neural networks are total population values for census block groups in Hartford County, Connecticut. A number of neural network models are generated containing various combinations of input data, which are considered to be spatial and demographic in nature. The accuracy of the population estimations derived from neural networks is measured by comparing them to the estimations from two existing areal interpolation methods; <b>areal</b> <b>weighting</b> and urban weighting. The results from this study indicate that neural networks achieve optimal estimations when applied to the “missing data” problem. When applied to the “alternative geography” problem, neural networks also produce better results when compared to <b>areal</b> <b>weighting</b> and urban weighting. ...|$|R

The research investigated the use of information by conservation organisations through case studies in the Statutory Nature Conservation Agencies and the North York Moors National Park. The results highlighted {{a number of key}} problems in the organisational use of information and in the content and utility of the data available. These included the lack of an organisational culture of information use, imperfect knowledge and utilisation of available data, the need to meet changing information demands and the requirement to produce comparable local, regional and national habitat stock estimates. Many of the data deficiencies highlighted would appear to be met by the Countryside Survey (CS) initiative. Despite offering potentially suitable data, with a combination of an environmental stratification (the ITE land class system), field survey and remotely sensed data, this source was little used. Thus, the study sought to assess the scope for comparing CS data with other habitat estimates and for improving the accuracy of these data through the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Three main techniques were employed, modified <b>areal</b> <b>weighting,</b> modified <b>areal</b> <b>weighting</b> with control zones and 'intelligent weighting' a hybrid approach in which Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) data were employed to redistribute Countryside Survey 1990 (CS 90) totals within ITE land classes. The research found that sub-land class estimates from CS 90 data could be improved in some circumstances. In most cases, LCMGB provided better estimates of habitat location and quantity than CS 90. In a few cases, the intelligent weighting method improved the interpolation of CS 90 estimates. It is suggested that regional habitat estimates may be improved further through greater within-land class differentiation, an increase in within-land class sampling intensity or stratification and the further development of the LCMGB.

Although the EDL project is ending in FY 11, NASA in-house development of advanced ablators will continue with a focus on varying resin systems and fiber/resin interactions...|$|E
40|$|Areal {{interpolation}} {{involves the}} transfer of data (often socioeconomic statistics and especially population data) from one zonation of a region to another, where the two zonations are geographically incompatible. This process is inevitably imprecise and is subject {{to a number of}} possible errors depending on the assumptions inherent in the methods used. Previous analysts have had only limited information with which to compare the results of interpolation and so assess the errors. In this paper a Monte Carlo simulation method based on modifiable areal units is employed. This allows multiple interpolations of population to be conducted from a single set of source zones to numerous sets of target zones. The properties of the full error distribution associated with a particular interpolation model can then be examined. The method based on dasymetric mapping consistently gave the highest accuracy of those tested, whereas the <b>areal</b> <b>weighting</b> method gave the lowest. More important than the results presented is the potential for future testing of other methods in increasingly complex situations. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research results}} on the dasymetric mapping method, the methodology adopted and a Dasymetric Population Density Map of the Northeastern Part of Poland. After studying certain published dasymetric mapping methods, {{a decision was made}} to start from the binary dasymetric procedure as described by Langdorf and Unwin (1994) in order to eliminate unpopulated regions. The CORINE Land Cover (CLC) database was utilized as ancillary data because the land cover pattern best reflects population density and provides useful georeferenced information for disaggregating census data. The first issued addressed was how is population distributed among CLC classes in Poland? Special attention was made to estimate the coefficients for the population ratio in land cover classes. Several different approaches were tested and eventually modified <b>areal</b> <b>weighting</b> was adopted. The dasymetric mapping method {{is based on the assumption}} that the ratio between the population density of two land cover categories is the same for any given commune...|$|R
40|$|Integrated annual methane fluxes {{measured}} from 1994 to 1996 at sites representing specific tundra vegetation and land cover types were weighted areally using a vegetation map [Auerbach et al., 1997] for the Kuparuk River basin and subareas. Wetland and open water CH 4 emissions dominate the Kuparuk River basin emission estimate. <b>Areal</b> <b>weighting</b> of site fluxes {{resulted in a}} regional CH 4 emission estimate of 2. 09 x 10 10 g CH 4 yr - 1 for the Kuparuk River basin. The global CH 4 emission obtained by extending areally weighted annual fluxes from this study to global tundra area (7. 34 x 10 12 m 2) is 5. 83 Tg CH 4 yr - 1. This is about 15 % of the Fung et al. [1991] atmospheric tracer model estimate and indicates that the vegetation distribution of the Kuparuk River Basin is not typical of the entire Arctic. Reconciling results from atmospheric tracer model estimates and areally weighted field flux measurements will require accurate high-resolution circumpolar estimates of wetland and open water areas and fluxes.
