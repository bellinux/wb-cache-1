2500|$|This drill {{team was}} the first to reach the trapped miners with an escape shaft. Plan B {{involved}} a Schramm Inc. T130XD <b>air</b> <b>core</b> drill owned by Geotec S.A.

Normally, the drills are used to drill top holes for {{the oil and gas industry}} and for mineral exploration and water wells. This system employed Chilean Drillers Supply SA (DSI) personnel, Mijali Proestakis G.M. and Partner, Igor Proestakis Tech Mgr, Greg Hall C.E.O. (who joined his team on site for the last eight days of drilling) and their 7" [...] drill pipe <b>air</b> <b>core</b> drill, a team of American drillers from Layne Christensen Company and specialized Down-The-Hole drilling hammers from Center Rock, Inc., of Berlin, Pennsylvania. Center Rock's president and personnel from DSI Chile were present on-site for the 33 days of drilling. While the Schramm rig, built by privately held Schramm, Inc. of West Chester, Pennsylvania, was already on the ground in Chile at the time of the mine collapse, additional drilling equipment was flown from the United States to Chile by United Parcel Service. The percussion-technology hammer drill can drill at more than [...] a day by using four hammers instead of one.|$|E

Ferrite core coils are more efficient regarding space and powerconsumption, but the optimization, calculation and production is much more complicated. So wedecided to keep it as simple and cost efficient as possible and use <b>air</b> <b>core</b> coil magnetorquers as ourprime active attitude control actuators.

50|$|The term <b>air</b> <b>core</b> coil {{describes}} an inductor {{that does not}} use a magnetic core made of a ferromagnetic material. The term refers to coils wound on plastic, ceramic, or other nonmagnetic forms, {{as well as those}} that have only air inside the windings. <b>Air</b> <b>core</b> coils have lower inductance than ferromagnetic core coils, but are often used at high frequencies because they are free from energy losses called core losses that occur in ferromagnetic cores, which increase with frequency. A side effect that can occur in <b>air</b> <b>core</b> coils in which the winding is not rigidly supported on a form is 'microphony': mechanical vibration of the windings can cause variations in the inductance.|$|E

50|$|A coil not {{containing}} a magnetic core is called an <b>air</b> <b>core.</b> This includes coils wound on a plastic or ceramic form {{in addition to}} those made of stiff wire that are self-supporting and have air inside them. <b>Air</b> <b>core</b> coils generally have a much lower inductance than similarly sized ferromagnetic core coils, but are used in radio frequency circuits to prevent energy losses called core losses that occur in magnetic cores. The absence of normal core losses permits a higher Q factor, so <b>air</b> <b>core</b> coils are used in high frequency resonant circuits, such as up to a few megahertz. However, losses such as proximity effect and dielectric losses are still present. Air cores are also used when field strengths above around 2 Tesla are required as they are not subject to saturation.|$|E

40|$|The Yucca Mountain Project was {{established}} to evaluate the potential for storing high-level radioactive wastes in geologic formations. Hydrologists recommended that drilling or coring in support of characterization tests be performed dry. Dry drilling, or <b>air</b> <b>coring,</b> presents a concern about health protection for the drilling personnel. The rock generally has a high silica content, and natural zeolites are abundant. Some zeolites are fibrous, leading to concerns that inhalation may result in asbestos-like lung diseases. An industrial hygiene study (IH) was conducted {{as part of an}} <b>air</b> <b>coring</b> technical feasibility test. The IH study found the potential for exposures to airborne silica and nuisance dusts to be within regulatory requirements and determined the commercial dust control equipment monitored to be effective when used in conjunction with a good area ventilation system and sound IH practices.

Recommendations for the Yucca Mountain studies are (1) dust collection and control equipment equivalent or superior to that monitored must be used for any dry drilling activity and must be used with good general dilution ventilation and local exhaust ventilation provided on major emission sources; (2) good industrial hygiene work practices must be implemented, including monitoring any area where zeolitic fibers are suspect; and (3) a study should be conducted to determine the biological effects of the fibrous zeolite, mordenite. 25 refs., 17 figs., 14 tabs...|$|R
