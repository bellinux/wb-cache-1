2500|$|These controversies {{came to a}} head in {{an event}} known as the Barnard Conference on Sexuality, a 1982 {{academic}} conference on feminist perspectives on sexuality. The conference was organized by [...] "pro-sex" [...] and other feminists who felt that their perspectives were excluded by the dominance of the anti-pornography radical feminist position in feminist circles. The latter were in turn excluded from participation in the Barnard Conference. WAP responded by picketing the conference. It is also alleged that WAP engaged in a campaign of harassment against several of the conference organizers (among them author Dorothy Allison), publishing their home addresses <b>and</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> on leaflets that were distributed publicly, engaging in telephone harassment, and calling the employers of these individuals in an attempt to get them fired from their jobs. In 1984, feminists opposed to Women Against Pornography and feminist anti-pornography politics coalesced in the group, Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce (FACT).|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{and during}} the war, Beria {{directed}} Sarkisov to keep a running list of the names <b>and</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> of his sexual encounters. Eventually he ordered Sarkisov to destroy the list {{because it was a}} security risk, but the colonel retained a secret handwritten copy. When Beria's fall from power began, Sarkisov passed the list to Viktor Abakumov, the former wartime head of SMERSH. He was now chief of the MGB – the successor to the NKVD – who was already aggressively building a case against Beria. Stalin, who was also seeking to undermine Beria, was thrilled by the detailed records kept by Sarkisov, demanding: [...] "Send me everything this asshole writes down!" [...] Sarkisov reported that Beria's sexual appetite had led to him contracting syphilis during the war, for which he was secretly treated without the knowledge of Stalin or the Politburo (a fact Beria later admitted during his interrogation). Although the Russian government acknowledged Sarkisov's handwritten list of Beria's victims on 17 January 2003, the victims' names will not be released until 2028.|$|E

2500|$|Some early iOS {{installs}} of Pokémon Go required {{users to}} provide the app with full access to their Google accounts, thereby allowing the app to [...] "access players' Gmail-based email, Google Drive-based files, photos and videos stored in Google Photos, and any other content within their Google accounts". The Pokémon Company and Niantic responded to the concerns, recognizing that the iOS app, at the time, [...] "... erroneously requests full access permission for the user's Google account ..." [...] However, Adam Reeve—the person who initially made claims of the security issues in a Tumblr post—later backtracked on his claim and was not [...] "100 percent sure" [...] it was valid. Dan Guido, CEO of the security company Trail of Bits, analyzed the app's programming and discovered that although the game did request full account access, this did not enable third-party usage as initially conveyed. Guido found that this did enable Niantic to access people's email addresses <b>and</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> unintentionally. A subsequent iOS app update reduced the scope of access. Niantic also issued a statement assuring users that no information was collected nor was any information beyond what was necessary to use the app accessed.|$|E
2500|$|Pause and probe is {{the skill}} of the {{moderator}} to give each participant a chance to jump in. As a general rule, a moderator should pause {{for at least five}} seconds after a participant talks or before beginning to talk. Probes, such as [...] "would you explain that further?" [...] or [...] "Would you give me an example?" [...] help to give additional information. Being prepared for the unexpected is one of the abilities of the focus group leaders in order for the efficient functioning of the groups. Some examples of unexpected events are no one showing up (make sure you bring list <b>and</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers),</b> only a few showing up (hold group anyway), meeting place is inadequate for the members to reach, the group members get too involved and don't want to leave (have formal ending), bad or hazardous weather (call everyone and cancel). Organization Skills helps focus group leaders to plan the theme for group discussions and also develop a printed outline for the meetings. There may be more productive discussions when every member of the focus group has a copy of the printed agenda before starting the discussion. This allows the member to have some time to review the topics and focus on key relevant issues. The leader should use the counseling skills in order for the discussion to take place effectively.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{claiming}} to have retired, on 18 July LulzSec hacked into the website of British newspaper The Sun. The group redirected the newspaper's website to an also-hacked redesign website of another newspaper The Times, altering the site to resemble The Sun and posting a fake story claiming that Rupert Murdoch had died after ingesting a fatal dose of palladium. They objected to the involvement of News Corporation, the Murdoch-owned company that publishes The Sun and The Times, in a large phone hacking scandal. The hacked website also contained a webcomic depicting LulzSec deciding on and carrying out the attack. The group later redirected The Sun website to their Twitter feed. News International released a statement regarding the attacks before having the page the statement appeared on also redirected to the LulzSec Twitter page and eventually taken offline. The group also released the names <b>and</b> <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> of a reporter for The Sun and two others associated with the newspaper and encouraged their supporters to call them. In recent times NovaCygni of AntiSec has openly touted that the [...] news channel Russian Television (RT) has openly stated support for the Anonymous movement and {{that at least one}} reporter for them is an active member of Anonymous. They further included an old email address and password of former News International executive Rebekah Brooks. News Corporation took the websites offline as a precaution later in the day.|$|E
