500|$|Norwood {{said the}} character's {{introduction}} was [...] "trying {{to bring the}} street to Albert Square" [...] and that the street slang the character uses is what {{he grew up with}} himself. He described the character in an interview with entertainment website Digital Spy as [...] " [...] to be a gangsta at times, a caring person, a player, a womaniser, the businessman... There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> that he wants to be and that shifts depending on the situation," [...] adding that he is quick to solve problems and always has a plan. Additionally, a profile for the character on the official EastEnders website calls him brash, a , confident and a loveable soft-touch.|$|E
500|$|Charlene's new romantic style {{wedding dress}} was {{designed}} and made by Isis of Melbourne, a local bridal salon. The dress was made from ivory silk, organza and chantilly lace. A writer for the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery's website observed that it was [...] "in keeping with Charlene's character as the suburban girl-next-door." [...] While the show's costume designer, Nicholas Wakerley, called it [...] "perfect for the time". Wakerley described the dress as being [...] "young and cool" [...] for the time, just like Charlene. He also revealed that the dress fitted Watson's desire for a fairy-tale wedding. When asked what made the dress memorable, fashion designer Alex Perry, stated [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> going on that it's hard not to remember it! The see-through sleeves {{with a hint of}} lace, the romantic era-style shoulders, the high neckline and hem." [...] Knowing how popular Minogue and Charlene were at the time, Perry was sure that the dress would have been copied by viewers. Charlene's bridesmaids wore peach taffeta dresses, while the groom and his ushers wore charcoal grey tails.|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Douglass C. Perry {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "the {{inclusion}} of chapters {{from the book}} skipped over in the movie, and the general variety of missions, spread out over the large landscapes work to its favor." [...] However, he was critical {{of the lack of}} an autosave feature, the implementation of the Ring, which he felt was completely optional, and the combat system, which he called [...] "basic and repetitive." [...] He concluded [...] "what this game has that the EA game doesn't have - chapters, characters and events from the book - is important to a Tolkien fan, and it warrants playtime [...] but without this license, this game is very, very average." [...] GameZone's Michael Knudson scored it 7.4 out of 10 arguing [...] "the game has a lot of potential, but a few gameplay quirks ruin it." [...] He concluded [...] "this game will only suit hardcore fans of the J.R.R. Tolkien series." [...] GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker scored it 5.5 out of 10 calling it [...] "an average adventure game with a high-profile license attached." [...] GameSpy's Bryan Stratton scored it 1.5 out of 5, comparing it unfavorably with the film; [...] "the reason that the movie worked was that Peter Jackson knew what to keep from the book, what to fast-forward through, and what to cut altogether. Fellowship doesn't have the benefit of so capable an editor." [...] Game Informers Andy McNamara scored it 3 out of 10, writing [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> wrong with this one, it's hard to decide. For one, the story is delivered with all the emotion of a grade school play. This wouldn't be such a bad thing, if the gameplay weren't absolutely abysmal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You Americans {{have such}} odd ways!" [...] the Baroness declared. [...] "You never ask {{anything}} outright; {{there seem to}} <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> you can't talk about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{might have}} waited a minute," [...] she mutters to herself, as {{she picks up}} the hats, [...] "there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> I wanted him to do." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "There <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> that could've gone wrong, {{and nothing}} went wrong," [...] said Michael Harris, {{one of a}} {{multitude}} of orca advocates and scientists witnessing the event.|$|R
60|$|LADY MARY (sighing). I do; {{but there}} <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to remember.|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to {{complain}} of in this household {{that it would}} never have occurred to me {{to complain}} of rheumatism," [...] murmured Clovis.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Ayala, there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to {{be thought}} of. Here {{is a young man}} who is able to give you not only every comfort but great opulence." ...|$|E
60|$|She laughed again. I {{wanted her}} to go on talking, because her laugh <b>was</b> <b>so</b> delightful. But we had reached the road, {{and she said she}} must go back: there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> she had to do.|$|R
60|$|He {{shrugged his}} shoulders. Even {{now he was}} not at all sure that she was not playing with him. There <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> about her which he could not understand. She began to draw on her gloves thoughtfully.|$|R
60|$|The Larramies {{would not}} listen to my leaving that day. There were a good {{many people in the}} house, but there was room enough for me, and, when we had left the bear without solving the problem of his final disposition, there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to <b>be</b> done and <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to <b>be</b> said that {{it was late in the}} {{afternoon}} before Miss Edith found the opportunity of speaking to me for which she had <b>been</b> waiting <b>so</b> long.|$|R
6000|$|... “Darling child, {{one does}} what one can; there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to consider,” urged Mrs. Moreen. “It’s his place—his only place. You see {{you think it}} is now.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> {{that go to}} make up such a judgment," [...] Peter Gee answered. [...] "It's {{very hard}} to explain. It would require almost a text book." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{can see her}} now as {{she stood}} there with her brows nearly frowning, her blue eyes looking before her, her mouth almost petulant. [...] "One feels that there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> going on--out of one's reach," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|Then he {{went over}} to his two suitcases. He was tired, very tired from his trip. A great weariness was {{beginning}} to descend over him. There <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to do, <b>so</b> terribly <b>many.</b> How could he hope to do them all? Back to the asteroid. And then what? ...|$|R
60|$|Well, {{my book is}} written--let it go. But if it {{were only}} to write over again there wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> left out. They burn in me; and they keep {{multiplying}} and multiplying; but now they can't ever be said. And besides, they would require a library--and a pen warmed up in hell.|$|R
6000|$|Carmina rose unwillingly. [...] "There <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> I {{wanted to}} say to you," [...] she began--and was {{interrupted}} by a rapid little series of knocks at the door. Was the person in a hurry? The person proved to be the discreet and accomplished Maria. She made her excuses to Carmina with sweetness, and turned to Miss Minerva with sorrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} ready," [...] the girl said; [...] "but I {{wish you would}} have stopped, there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> I {{want to ask you}} about, and these Yankee papers, which are all we see now, are full of lies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I {{used to have}} an {{idea that}} a parish clergyman should be a married man. There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> which he can do better when he has a woman to assist him who thinks exactly as he thinks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Benicia, [...] "would {{it matter}} greatly {{if it was}} not done, after all? There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> one would have altered in Africa--and they still go on. It is {{possible}} that nobody will ever succeed in changing them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] he replied; {{but there}} <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to <b>be</b> said, {{and now that}} they were alone it seemed {{necessary}} to bring themselves still more near, and to surmount a barrier which had grown up since they had last spoken. It was difficult, frightening even, oddly embarrassing. At one moment he was clear-sighted, and, at the next, confused.|$|R
60|$|He paused. He {{felt the}} rhythm of the verse about him in the room. How melancholy it was! Could he, too, write like that, express the melancholy of his soul in verse? There <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> he wanted to describe: his {{sensation}} of a few hours before on Grattan Bridge, for example. If he could get back again into that mood....|$|R
50|$|There <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> that he hadn't noticed {{about the}} place Café de la Gare. The scum who threw up and urinated, regularly, all over the toilet floor. The early starts, late finishes, the guys who had never had enough. Seven nights a week. Fifty-two weeks of the year. But there was no turning back. He would make it work. It was sink or swim.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know. There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> I want to do. Those {{flowers in}} the garden are calling me--and I {{want to go down}} to that hollow and pick buttercups--and I want to stay right here and look at things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Plantagenet says you'll {{have to take}} it;--but {{it seems}} to me he's always wrong. There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> that one must do that one doesn't do. He never {{perceives}} that everything gets changed every five years. So Mr. Finn is the favourite again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{cream of}} University {{life is the}} first summer term. Debts, as yet, are not; the Schools are too far off to cast their shadow over the {{unlimited}} enjoyment, which begins when lecture is over, at one o'clock. There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to do, - ...|$|E
60|$|Tom {{considered}} this point also. Rarely, if ever, had he <b>been</b> given <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> {{to think about}} in one morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "That I can understand," [...] said Dorothea, cordially. [...] "And in Rome {{it seems}} as if there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> which <b>are</b> more wanted in the world than {{pictures}}. But if you have a genius for painting, would it not be right to take that as a guide? Perhaps you might do better things than these--or different, so that there might not <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> pictures almost all alike in the same place." ...|$|R
60|$|In the {{excitement}} of the chase either Jacob or I would have passed it by as being of no particular value when there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to <b>be</b> picked up; but the old man was too good and experienced a soldier not to realize the possibilities of the find, and, heedless of all the wild scenes around him, he seized upon it, breaking the lock with a rock.|$|R
6000|$|... "Capitaine Rotherby," [...] she said, [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> {{which it}} seems hard to understand. I myself am very unhappy and perplexed, but I {{do know what}} my uncle would wish me to do. He would wish me to remain quite quiet, and to wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Trying to, {{but there}} <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to {{remember}} {{all at once}} keep time, steer straight, dodge the petticoats, and manage my confounded legs that it isn't easy to get on at first," [...] answered Mac {{with a sigh of}} exhaustion, wiping his hot forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... "People {{never do}} care for one another. Life is so full nowadays, there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to care about, that any {{concentration}} of the affections is impossible. Love is the derision of the modern world. It has not even the respect one pays to the antique." ...|$|E
60|$|But it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{easy to do}} wrong. There <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> wrong <b>things</b> to do, and {{the doing}} of them <b>was</b> <b>so</b> natural.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{must say}} good-bye now," [...] said Mary, [...] "because there <b>are</b> ever <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> {{in the house}} which I have got to do." ...|$|R
5000|$|In The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour (1971-74) [...] Network censors feared Cher's navel {{exposure}} {{would become}} a cause célèbre at CBS. Cher once commented, [...] "There <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> that <b>were</b> censored—ideas and words. All I know is I got in trouble for showing my belly button, and every time I turned around after I went off the air, all you saw were Cheryl Ladd's boobs." [...] People Magazine dubbed Cher [...] "Pioneer of the Belly Beautiful".|$|R
