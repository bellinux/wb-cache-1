25|$|Starch is 25% <b>amylose</b> and 75% amylopectin.|$|E
25|$|Starch or amylum is a {{polysaccharide}} {{produced by}} all green plants as an energy store. Pure starch is a white, tasteless and odourless powder. It {{consists of two}} types of molecules: the linear and helical <b>amylose</b> and the branched amylopectin. Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% <b>amylose</b> and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight.|$|E
25|$|Amylodextrin is {{a linear}} dextrin or short chained <b>amylose</b> (DP 20-30) {{that can be}} {{produced}} by enzymatic hydrolysis of the alpha-1,6 glycosidic bonds or debranching amylopectin. Amylodextrin colors blue with iodine.|$|E
25|$|Glutinous rice is {{distinguished}} from {{other types of}} rice by having no (or negligible amounts of) <b>amylose,</b> and high amounts of amylopectin (the two components of starch). Amylopectin {{is responsible for the}} sticky quality of glutinous rice. The difference has been traced to a single mutation that was selected for by farmers.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} close to 4,000 {{varieties}} of potato, it has been bred into many standard or well-known varieties, {{each of which has}} particular agricultural or culinary attributes. In general, varieties are categorized into a few main groups, such as russets, reds, whites, yellows (also called Yukons) and purples—based on common characteristics. Around 80 varieties are commercially available in the UK. For culinary purposes, varieties are often differentiated by their waxiness. Floury, or mealy (baking) potatoes have more starch (20–22%) than waxy (boiling) potatoes (16–18%). The distinction may also arise from variation in the comparative ratio of two potato starch compounds: <b>amylose</b> and amylopectin. <b>Amylose,</b> a long-chain molecule, diffuses from the starch granule when cooked in water, and lends itself to dishes where the potato is mashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin content, a highly branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape when boiled.|$|E
25|$|Glutinous rice (Oryza sativa var. glutinosa; {{also called}} sticky rice, sweet rice or waxy rice) {{is a type}} of rice grown mainly in Southeast and East Asia and the eastern parts of South Asia, which has opaque grains, very low <b>amylose</b> content, and is {{especially}} sticky when cooked. While it is widely consumed across Asia, it is only a staple food in northeastern Thailand and Laos.|$|E
25|$|The {{varieties}} of rice are typically classified as long-, medium-, and short-grained. The grains of long-grain rice (high in <b>amylose)</b> tend {{to remain intact}} after cooking; medium-grain rice (high in amylopectin) becomes more sticky. Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for risotto in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as arròs negre, in Spain. Some {{varieties of}} long-grain rice that are high in amylopectin, known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed. A stickier medium-grain rice is used for sushi; the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when molded. Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for rice pudding.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the chyme has reached this tube, most {{nutrients}} and 90% of the water have been absorbed by the body. At this point some electrolytes like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of ingested food (e.g., {{a large part of}} ingested <b>amylose,</b> starch which has been shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). As the chyme moves through the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. The ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid. The muscles of the colon then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess water, causing the stools to gradually solidify as they move along into the descending colon.|$|E
2500|$|... γ-Amylase (...) (alternative names: Glucan 1,4-α-glucosidase; amyloglucosidase; Exo-1,4-α-glucosidase; glucoamylase; {{lysosomal}} α-glucosidase; 1,4-α-D-glucan glucohydrolase) will cleave α(1–6) glycosidic linkages, {{as well as}} {{the last}} α(1–4)glycosidic linkages at the nonreducing end of <b>amylose</b> and amylopectin, yielding glucose. The γ-amylase has most acidic optimum pH of all amylases because it is most active around pH 3.|$|E
2500|$|In humans, dietary {{starches}} {{are composed}} of glucose units arranged in long chains called <b>amylose,</b> a polysaccharide. During digestion, bonds between glucose molecules are broken by salivary and pancreatic amylase, resulting in progressively smaller chains of glucose. [...] This results in simple sugars glucose and maltose (2 glucose molecules) that can be absorbed by the small intestine.|$|E
2500|$|The α-amylases (...) (CAS# 9014-71-5) (alternative names: 1,4-α-D-glucan glucanohydrolase; glycogenase) are calcium metalloenzymes. [...] By acting {{at random}} {{locations}} along the starch chain, α-amylase breaks down long-chain carbohydrates, ultimately yielding maltotriose and maltose from <b>amylose,</b> or maltose, glucose and [...] "limit dextrin" [...] from amylopectin. [...] Because it can act {{anywhere on the}} substrate, α-amylase tends to be faster-acting than β-amylase. [...] In animals, {{it is a major}} digestive enzyme, and its optimum pH is 6.7–7.0.|$|E
2500|$|Waxy potato {{varieties}} produce {{two main}} kinds of potato starch, <b>amylose</b> and amylopectin, {{the latter of}} which is most industrially useful. The German chemical company BASF created the Amflora potato, which has been modified to contain antisense against the enzyme that drives synthesis of <b>amylose,</b> namely granule bound starch synthase. [...] This resulting potato almost exclusively produces amylopectin, and thus is more useful for the starch industry. In 2010, the European Commission {{cleared the way for}} 'Amflora' to be grown in the European Union for industrial purposes only—not for food. Nevertheless, under EU rules, individual countries have the right to decide whether they will allow this potato to be grown on their territory. Commercial planting of 'Amflora' was expected in the Czech Republic and Germany in the spring of 2010, and Sweden and the Netherlands in subsequent years. Another GM potato variety developed by BASF is 'Fortuna' which was made resistant to late blight by adding two resistance genes, blb1 and blb2, which originate from the Mexican wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum. [...] In October 2011 BASF requested cultivation and marketing approval as a feed and food from the EFSA. In 2012, GMO development in Europe was stopped by BASF.|$|E
2500|$|According to the IPCC's TAR, [...] "The {{importance}} {{of climate change}} impacts on grain and forage quality emerges from new research. For rice, the <b>amylose</b> content of the grain—a major determinant of cooking quality—is increased under elevated CO2" [...] (Conroy et al., 1994). Cooked rice grain from plants grown in high- environments would be firmer than that from today's plants. However, concentrations of iron and zinc, which are important for human nutrition, would be lower (Seneweera and Conroy, 1997). Moreover, the protein content of the grain decreases under combined increases of temperature and CO2 (Ziska et al., 1997). Studies using FACE have shown that increases in CO2 lead to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants. This may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain {{the same amount of}} protein.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Waxy corn', a Chinese maize {{with almost}} all {{amylopectin}} and trace amounts of <b>amylose,</b> different from normal corn which endosperm contains 25% <b>amylose</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Starch {{consists}} of <b>amylose</b> and amylopectin which affect the textural properties of manufactured foods. Starches with high <b>amylose</b> content generally have increased resistant starch.|$|E
50|$|Values {{used on the}} iodine binding, however, {{are only}} {{estimates}} of <b>amylose</b> content because of differences in the binding abilities (and structure) of <b>amylose</b> and amylopectin among starch types. For example, amylopectin molecules with long external branches bind more iodine than those with short branches do, resulting in a small measure of apparent <b>amylose.</b>|$|E
50|$|While <b>amylose</b> {{was thought}} to be {{completely}} unbranched, it is now known that some of its molecules contain a few branch points.Amylose is a much smaller molecule than amylopectin. About one quarter of the mass of starch granules in plants consist of <b>amylose,</b> although there are about 150 times more <b>amylose</b> than amylopectin molecules.|$|E
50|$|It {{is another}} {{important}} factors in rice quality, like other cereal rice is good sources of starch especially <b>amylose.</b> It is composed more than 80% starch and at molecular level starch contains <b>amylose</b> (linear chains glucose of α (1-4) linkages) and amylopectin (branched chain glucose with α(1-6) linkage. In terms of <b>amylose</b> rice can be classified as waxy 0-2%, very low 2-10%, low 10-20%, intermediate20-25% and high 25-32% (rice dry basis). Starch content (<b>amylose)</b> of rice is very important factors in grain yield, processing and palatability.|$|E
50|$|Researchers have {{identified}} the Granule Bound Starch Synthase (GBSS) as the enzyme that specifically elongates <b>amylose</b> during starch biosynthesis in plants. The waxy locus in maize encodes for the GBSS protein. Mutants lacking the GBSS protein produce starch containing only amylopectin, such as in waxy corn. In Arabidopsis leaves, another gene, encoding the Protein Targeting to STarch (PTST) protein, is required in addition to GBSS for <b>amylose</b> synthesis. Mutants lacking either protein produce starch without <b>amylose.</b> GM potato cultivar Amflora by BASF Plant Science was developed to not produce <b>amylose.</b>|$|E
50|$|Historically, floridean starch {{has been}} {{described}} as lacking <b>amylose.</b> However, <b>amylose</b> has been identified as a component of floridean starch granules in some cases, particularly in unicellular red algae.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} {{apparent}} <b>amylose</b> {{can be determined}} either by measuring the absorbency of the starch-iodine complex (blue-value) and relating this value to that of pure <b>amylose</b> and amylopectin standards or by measuring the amount of iodine (mg) bound per 100 mg of starch in a potentiometric titration and relating the value to the amount bound by an <b>amylose</b> standard.|$|E
50|$|Combining the {{recessive}} mutant (wx) maize variant {{with other}} mutant as for example <b>amylose</b> extender (ae)maize and dull (du) maize {{has an effect}} on the <b>amylose</b> and amylopectine structure of the starch.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amylose</b> and {{amylopectin}} {{are both}} components of starch and polysaccharides made from D-glucose units. The {{big difference between}} the two is that <b>amylose</b> is linear because it only has αlpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Amylopectin on the other hand, is a branched polysaccharide because it has αlpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds with occasional αlpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds approximately every 22 D-glucose units. Glutinous rice is nearly 100% composed of amylopectin (one of the two components that makes up starch) and almost completely lacks its counterpart, <b>amylose,</b> in its starch granules. A non-glutinous rice grain contains <b>amylose</b> at about 10-30% weight by weight and amylopectin at about 70-90% weight by weight.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amylose</b> {{is also an}} {{important}} thickener, water binder, emulsion stabilizer, and gelling agent in both industrial and food-based contexts. Loose helical <b>amylose</b> chains have a hydrophobic interior that can bind to hydrophobic molecules such as lipids and aromatic compounds. The one problem with this is that, when it crystallizes or associates, it can lose some stability, often releasing water in the process (syneresis). When <b>amylose</b> concentration is increased, gel stickiness decreases but gel firmness increases. When other things including amylopectin bind to <b>amylose,</b> the viscosity can be affected, but incorporating κ-carrageenan, alginate, xanthan gum, or low-molecular-weight sugars can reduce the loss in stability. The ability to bind water can add substance to food, possibly serving as a fat replacement. For example, <b>amylose</b> is responsible for causing white sauce to thicken, but, upon cooling, some separation between the solid and the water will occur.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amylose</b> {{is made up}} of α(1→4) bound glucose molecules. The carbon atoms on glucose are numbered, {{starting}} at the aldehyde (C=O) carbon, so, in <b>amylose,</b> the 1-carbon on one glucose molecule is linked to the 4-carbon on the next glucose molecule (α(1→4) bonds). The structural formula of <b>amylose</b> is pictured at right. The number of repeated glucose subunits (n) is usually in the range of 300 to 3000, but can be many thousands.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the long}} linear chains of <b>amylose</b> more readily {{crystallize}} than amylopectin (which has short, highly branched chains), high-amylose starch is {{more resistant to}} digestion. Unlike amylopectin, <b>amylose</b> is not soluble in cold water. It also reduces the crystallinity of amylopectin and how easily water can infiltrate the starch. The higher the <b>amylose</b> content, the less expansion potential and the lower the gel strength for the same starch concentration. This can be countered partially by increasing the granule size.|$|E
5000|$|After {{two decades}} of {{research}} efforts, BASF's biotechnologists using genetic engineering succeeded in creating a potato, named [...] "Amflora", where the gene responsible for the synthesis of <b>amylose</b> had been turned off, thus the potato is unable to synthesize the less desirable <b>amylose.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Mochi is a {{multicomponent}} food {{consisting of}} polysaccharides, lipids, protein and water. Mochi has a heterogeneous structure of amylopectin gel, starch grains, and air bubbles. [...] This rice {{is characterized by}} its lack of <b>amylose</b> in the starch and is derived from short or medium japonica rices. The protein concentration of the rice is {{higher than that of}} normal short-grain rice, and the two also differ in <b>amylose</b> content. In mochi rice, the <b>amylose</b> content is negligible, which results in its gel-like consistency.|$|E
50|$|Starch is 25% <b>amylose</b> and 75% amylopectin.|$|E
