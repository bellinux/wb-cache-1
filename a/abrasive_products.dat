40|$|Nickel-based super alloys {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{applications}} in which high-temperature strength and resistance to creep, corrosion, and oxidation are required, such as in aircraft gas turbines, combustion chambers, and automotive engine valves. The properties that make these materials suitable for these applications also make them difficult to grind. Grinding systems for such materials are often built around vitrified cBN (cubic boron nitride) wheels to realize maximum productivity and minimum cost per part. Conditions that yield the most economical combination of stock removal rate and wheel wear are key to the successful implementation of the grinding system. Identifying the transition point for excessive wheel wear is important. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the performance of different cBN wheels when grinding difficult-to-grind (DTG) materials by determining the 'wheel wear characteristic curve', which correlates the G-ratio to the calculated tangential force per abrasive grain. With the proposed methodology, a threshold force per grit above which the wheel wear rate increases rapidly can be quickly identified. A comparison of performance for two <b>abrasive</b> <b>product</b> formulations in the grinding of three materials is presented.

40|$|Background: The tooth {{whitening}} substances for extrinsic use {{that are available}} in Brazil contain hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. Several studies have attributed the appearance of lesions in the enamel morphology, including hypersensitivity, to these substances. Such lesions justify fluoride therapy and application of infrared lasers, among other procedures. However, {{there is no consensus}} among researchers regarding the relevance of the severity of lesions detected on the tooth surface. Objectives: The present study was carried out with an aim of evaluating in vitro the effects of the hydrogen peroxide, carbamide peroxide and sodium bicarbonate contained in dentifrice formulations, on human tooth enamel. Materials and Methods: After darkening process in laboratory, human premolars were brushed using dentifrice containing the two whitening substances (Rembrandt - carbamide peroxide and Mentadent - hydrogen peroxide) and the <b>abrasive</b> <b>product</b> (Colgate - sodium bicarbonate). The degree of specimen staining before and after this procedure was determined using spectrophotometry. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to obtain images, which were analyzed to show the nature of the lesions that appeared on the enamel surface. Results: The effectiveness of the whitening caused by hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide and the abrasion caused by bicarbonate were confirmed, given that the treated test pieces returned to their original coloration. Based on SEM, evaluation of the enamel surfaces subjected to the test products showed that different types of morphologic lesions of varying severity appeared. Conclusions: Whitening dentifrice containing hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide produced lesions on the enamel surface such that the greatest sequelae were associated with exposure to hydrogen peroxide...|$|R

40|$|Toothpastes usually contain detergents, humectants, water colorant, {{fluoride}} and thickeners (e. g. silica). Tooth wear has a multi-factorial etilology {{and the use}} of abrasive dentifrices {{is related}} to abrasion of dental tissues during toothbrushing. This study evaluated in vitro the abrasiveness of a commercial silica gel low-abrasive dentrifice compared to an experimental dentifrice containing vegetable (almond) oil. Distilled water served as a control group. Acrylic specimens (8 per group) were submitted to simulated toothbrushing with slurries of the commercial dentifrice experimental dentifrice, almond oil and water in an automatic brushing machine programmed to 30, 000 brush strokes for each specimen which is equivalent to 2 years of manual toothbrushing. Thereafter, surface roughness (Ra) of the specimens was analyzed with a Surfcorder SE 1700 profilometer. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test at 5 % significance level. There was no statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) in the surface roughness after brushing with water almond oil experimental dentifrice.

40|$|During {{and after}} an erosive challenge, {{behavioral}} factors {{play a role}} in modifying the extent of erosive tooth wear. The manner that dietary acids are introduced into the mouth (gulping, sipping, use of a straw) will affect how long the teeth are in contact with the erosive challenge. The frequency and duration of exposure to an erosive agent is of paramount importance. Night-time exposure (e. g. baby bottle-feeding) to erosive agents may be particularly destructive because of the absence of salivary flow. Health-conscious individuals tend to ingest acidic drinks and juices more frequently and tend to have higher than average oral hygiene. While good oral hygiene is of proven value in the prevention of periodontal disease and dental caries, frequent toothbrushing with <b>abrasive</b> oral hygiene <b>products</b> may enhance erosive tooth wear.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of developing a}} method for making monodisperse, unagglomerated spherical particles greater than 50 nm in diameter was demonstrated. Carbonaceous particles were made by pyrolyzing ethylene with a pulsed CO 2 laser, thereby creating a non-equilibrium mixture of carbon, hydrogen, hydrocarbon vapors, and unpyrolyzed ethylene. Via a complex series of reactions, the carbon and hydrocarbon vapors quickly condensed into the spherical particles. By cooling and dispersing them in a supersonic expansion immediately after their creation, the hot newly-formed spheres were prevented from colliding and coalescing, thus preventing the problem of agglomeration which as plagued other investigators studying laser-simulated particle formation. The cold particles could be left suspended in the residual gases indefinitely without agglomerating. Their uniform sizes and unagglomerated nature were visualized by collecting the particles on filters that were subsequently examined using electron microscopy. It was found the mean particle size can be coarsely controlled by varying the initial ethylene pressure, and can be finely controlled by varying the fluence (energy/unit area) with which the laser irradiates the gas. The motivating application for this research was to manufacture particles that could be used as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) seeds in high-temperature high-speed flows. Though the particles made in this program will not evaporate until heated to about 3000 K, and thus could serve as LDV seeds in some applications, they are not ideal when the hot atmosphere is also oxidizing. In that situation, ceramic materials would be preferable. Research performed elsewhere has demonstrated that selected ceramic materials can be manufactured by laser pyrolysis of appropriate supply gases. It is anticipated that, when the same gases are used in conjunction with the rapid cooling technique, unagglomerated spherical ceramic particles can be made with little difficulty. Such particles would also be valuable to manufacturers of ceramic or <b>abrasive</b> <b>products,</b> and this technique may find its greatest commercial potential in those areas...|$|E

Most water jet cutters are based on a prismatic-prismatic design (gantry type). In an effort {{to reduce the number of}} precision parts in the machine, a rotary-rotary parallel drive design is proposed. The proposed mechanism will be actuated by electric DC windshield wiper motors directly coupled to the links, this eliminates the need for gearing mechanisms that add up to the total cost and complexity of the design. Kinematics of the design is simulated for a working area of 310 mm x 310 mm. Dynamic analysis is performed and the concepts of decoupled and configuration invariant inertia are derived, simplified to a set of conditions on the kinematic structure/mass properties of the arm linkages and applied to significantly simplify the mechanism's control system. The XY stage was designed to be inexpensive and small enough to be placed in hardware stores, garages and small machine shops. A vision of water jet cutters sold in boxes stacked on shelves in Wal-Mart, available for all machinists, artists, schools, and industries might one day thus become a reality if the pumps could also be made cheaply. by Fadi Abu Ibrahim.

40|$|Purpose: Silicon carbide {{grinding}} wheels are tools used in manufacturing industry to form precision componentsand {{continue to be}} used to increase production rates due to their ability to remove high volumes of material athigh speeds. There is a demand to increase the speed of rotation of the grinding wheel in order to achieve highremoval rates. The increase in speed creates a situation where the grinding machine and the operator are subjectedto a possible catastrophic failure of the wheel due to the stresses generated in the coarse brittle structure of thevitrified grinding wheel. The study focused on building and analyzing computer models of {{grinding wheels}} withrecessed features spinning at different rotational speeds. By employing a computational approach, it was possibleto determine the maximum principal stresses in the wheel together with the location of the stresses. The geometryof vitrified wheels considered included a plain-sided rotating wheel and a recessed rotating wheel. Design/methodology/approach: The paper shows how stresses and factors of safety are calculated in order topredict the bursting speeds of small recessed SiC grinding wheels. The main methods used include finite elementanalysis and mechanical testing of abrasive materials. The approach of the paper is to integrate the use of numericalanalysis techniques and experimental techniques to predict the safe operating conditions of SiC <b>abrasive</b> <b>products.</b> Findings: Calculations were conducted to determine maximum stress in parallel-sided and recessed cup wheels. Relevant factors of safety and bursting speed were also calculated and compared with experimental data. Thepaper proves the usefulness and applicability of a method developed for taking account of stress concentrationsat the recess of small cup-shaped silicon carbide grinding wheels. Research limitations/implications: The paper is limited to analyzing small recessed SiC grinding wheels. Further work should focus on large recessed wheels and wheels made with different abrasive grains and bondingmaterials. The type of porosity distribution should also be investigated. Practical implications: The paper shows how numerical methods are used to design safe operating conditionsfor brittle grinding wheels. The methods used show that numerical techniques are suitable for calculating themeasures of safety that are an important consideration when designing high speed rotating grinding wheels thatcan be devastating if allowed to fail in service. Originality/value: The originality in the paper is revealed owing to the fact that fracture mechanics principlesare applied to the prediction of failure of rotating grinding wheels. The paper is of practical importance tomechanical designers who are responsible for the safe design of grinding wheels...|$|E
