5000|$|... "Hi everybody, {{thanks for}} joining us on TCM. I'm Ben Mankiewicz. Tonight we are looking at movies {{featuring}} character actor Warren Oates. <b>And</b> <b>up</b> <b>next,</b> a movie long thought to be lost before it was rediscovered and presented at last year's TCM Classic Film Festival. From Citation Films in nineteen sixty — Private Property. Oates and Corey Allen play a couple of sketchy drifters named Duke and Boots. They're hitchhiking their way across Southern California — for a threatening version of George and Lenny in Of Mice and Men. They spy an attractive woman driving a Corvette. Duke and Boots follow her home, take up residence in the vacant house next door, with the intention of spying on her and then seducing her.|$|E
5000|$|... "Hi, {{welcome to}} TCM, I'm Ben Mankiewicz, filling in tonight for Robert Osborne. We are {{showcasing}} films featuring our {{star of the}} month Anthony Quinn <b>and,</b> <b>up</b> <b>next,</b> a double feature of Quinn comedies. Quinn was especially adept at playing ethnic characters — Italians, Russians, Arabs, Frenchmen, Greeks and, {{in the case of}} our next film, Native Americans. From Warner Brothers in nineteen seventy, it's Flap, a movie making its TCM premiere. It's a film adaptation of a novel, Nobody Likes a Drunken Indian by Clair Huffaker, who also wrote the screenplay. Set in present day, nineteen seventy, Quinn plays the title character, an American Indian named Flapping Eagle who lives on a reservation. Many of his problems are his own doing, mostly due to his fondness for the bottle, but he wants a better life for himself and his fellow reservationists so he sets out to start a modern day Indian uprising. His methods are unconventional to say the least. While Flap showcases the plight of Native Americans living on reservations, it's handled in a lighthearted manner, carefully directed by British filmmaker Carol Reed whose credits include nineteen forty-nine's The Third Man. Reed was still fresh off the success of his nineteen sixty-eight smash hit musical Oliver! This movie, Flap, is Reed's follow-up to that Oscar winner, coming two years later and also featuring a music score by Marvin Hamlisch and boasting a top-flight supporting cast, including Claude Akins, Tony Bill, Shelley Winters and Victor Jory. There's only one real-life Native American in the cast, John War Eagle, who plays Luke Wolf. From 1970, here's the TCM premiere of Anthony Quinn as Flap." ...|$|E
