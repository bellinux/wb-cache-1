5|$|He {{forced me}} to put {{the body in the}} boot of the car. He {{forced me to}} follow him as I {{thought we were going to}} a hospital. Then he <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away.|$|E
25|$|When he {{was really}} down, {{depressed}} about things. A relationship had failed. He rang me in a terrible state and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down to his house in Frankston. Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do {{for such a long}} time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E
2500|$|On that {{occasion}} {{the prospect of}} inviting Baba Hari Dass to the US was raised. [...] "They stayed with me and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the United States. I said I could go anywhere. I was ready {{to move to the}} higher mountains".|$|E
6000|$|... "The Duchess," [...] he repeated. [...] "I did {{not know}} that she was coming here. She was kind enough <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Scotland later on." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Aunt," [...] she said, [...] "Twoinette {{has twice}} <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Montreal, and I think I will. The prairie is very dreary in the winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} am I to do? The {{governor}} has <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down to Tretton, and I can't go without a five-pound note in my pocket." ...|$|E
6000|$|Seaforth {{understood}} him, and {{the implication}} pleased him {{though it was}} not openly expressed. [...] "Had you any especial reason when you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> Harry?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "If he <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> somewhere, {{will you}} tease mamma? She always lets you, Imogene, {{and it seems}} {{sometimes}} as if she just took a pleasure in denying me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He is in London now. It {{seems that}} he has run up on {{business}} {{for a day or}} two, and taken Lady Luxellian with him. He has written <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> his house, and search for a paper among his private memoranda, which he forgot to take with him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The other cowboy, called Andy, {{manifested}} uneasiness, and he said: [...] "Aw, now, Jake, you ain't a-goin' <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in there?... An' me hatin' Germans the way I do!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went in to}} call Robert to breakfast. I {{have been}} {{with him in the}} garden. He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> A heavy dew has {{refreshed}} the flowers. The peaches are ripening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} I wasn't {{at home when}} you arrived, Jamie," [...] she said; [...] "but the Polsons <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and play golf at Tunbridge Wells. I went round in bogy, Colonel Parsons." ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. He was an American in {{business}} at Singapore. I {{met him in}} Shanghai. I hated Lee. Rathbone <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Singapore with him and I went. I lived with him for four years.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on lending {{money to}} a third party, and he over head and ears in debt, by way of obliging you, why, it's a little too much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sorry, boys, but I must be off," [...] he announced. [...] "Wrayson {{has just}} telephoned <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{down and see}} him. I'm afraid he's queer! I've sent for a hansom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Phyllis," [...] he protested, [...] "I {{am one of}} your oldest friends! You <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{away and}} leave you here with strangers, without a word of explanation. Why, I have been weeks searching for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{going to}} Tulse Hill. You {{remember}} the manageress at the shop, well, she's married now, and she's <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{and spend the}} day with her. Of course she thinks I'm married too." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{soon after}} a constable {{came up and}} <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down to the river. He said there'd been an accident.... She was dead. A man had seen her walk along the {{tow-path}} and throw herself in.|$|E
6000|$|This {{the culprit}} admitted. [...] "But I {{was working for}} Sam Gregg, and when Joe <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> show him the trail, I didn't expect to get cinched for killing game. I didn't fire a shot--now that's the God's truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, ma'am, no, not in that; but I {{think she}} understands {{how to look}} at it; and if she <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with her, she knows that she is asking for {{something}} she doesn't expect to get." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you come}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{for a drive}} in that {{wonderful}} vehicle?" [...] she said lightly, pointing {{out of the window}} to where his dogcart was waiting. [...] "I should want a step-ladder to mount it!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Stroke of luck, Dick," [...] {{the former}} announced. [...] "I shall {{be able to}} do better than Marlingden--drop out of it altogether, in fact. Felixstowe's people have <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> up and stay with them in Scotland for a fortnight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, pretty much," [...] {{said her}} son, with a guiltless laugh. [...] "I {{went to see}} him {{yesterday}} afternoon, after I had gone over the whole ground with Uncle Jim, and Mr. Lapham <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down with him and finish up." ...|$|E
60|$|Matteo came <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Palace {{with him}} and Checco, at the {{particular}} desire of Girolamo, who wished to show them {{the progress of the}} decorations. I would not <b>go.</b> I wanted <b>to</b> be alone and think.|$|R

6000|$|... "Rexton isn't the world, dearest. Last week I had {{a letter}} from home <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a church there.

6000|$|Mr. Wilks acquiesced. [...] "And he <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{over to his}} 'ouse {{to smoke}} a pipe with 'im on Tuesday," [...] he added, in the casual manner in which men allude to their aristocratic connections. [...] "He's a bit lonely, all by himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very well, ma'am,' said Mrs Griffith, getting up. 'You're {{at liberty}} to think what you please, but I shall not come to church again. Mr Friend, the Baptist minister, has <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to his chapel, and I'm sure he won't treat me like that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about it," [...] said Silverbridge, [...] "but as he has <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> I think I ought to do it." [...] The Duke, who {{was by no means}} the man to make light of the political obligations of friendship, raised no objection.|$|E
6000|$|I was {{so sorry}} to leave London without seeing you; I shall be back [...] {{by the end}} of April, and am keeping on the same rooms.

He at last [...] bade Hermy <b>to</b> write and <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Clavering for the Easter [...] week. Such a note! I'll show it you when we meet. Of course I [...] declined.|$|R
6000|$|LIEUTENANT (remonstrating). Oh, I say, General! No, look here, you know: {{nobody can}} say I'm a coward after Lodi. But <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{into the dark}} by myself without a candle after such an awful {{conversation}} {{is a little too}} much. How {{would you like to do}} it yourself? ...|$|R
60|$|Algernon. You can't {{possibly}} <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{without having}} some dinner. It's absurd. I never go without my dinner. No one ever does, except vegetarians {{and people like}} that. Besides I have just made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six {{under the name of}} Ernest.|$|R
