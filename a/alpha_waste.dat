The main reactor in the unit is a cylinder 7 ft long, lined with refractory in the lower 5 $sup 1 $/$sub 2 $ ft to give an effective inside diameter of about 11 in. Four experimental runs, using simulated <b>alpha</b> <b>wastes,</b> were completed. Average processing rates of 27 lb/ hr were achieved. The waste components were shredded to an average size of 4 in. The ash content of the simulated waste was 3. 6 wt percent. The composition of the off-gas from the process was determined using a gas chromatograph. Condensates (or tars) were collected during a 12 -hr run and totaled 18 percent {{of the weight of}} the simulated feed that was processed. These tars had a calorific heating value of 9380 cal/g and a viscosity of 750 cp at 50 $sup 0 $C. Ash content of these tars was 0. 3 wt percent. Ash collected during a 12 -hr run appeared dark gray in color and had a bulk tap density of 0. 76 g/cm$sup 3 $. The ash was found to contain 13 wt percent unburned carbon.

40|$|The alpha-contaminated {{solid waste}} {{generated}} in Belgium results from past {{activities in the}} fuel cycle (R & D +Reprocessing and MOX fabrication pilot plants) and present operation of BELGONUCLEAIRE's MOX fuel fabrication plant. After the main steps {{in the management of}} alpha-contaminated solid waste were established, BELGONUCLEAIRE, with the backing of BELGOPROCESS and ONDRAF/NIRAS, started the design and construction of the T & C and interim-storage facilities for this <b>alpha</b> <b>waste.</b> The accumulated solid alpha radwaste containing a mixture of combustible and non-combustible material will be sorted. After sorting, both the accumulated and recently-generated non-combustible <b>alpha</b> <b>waste</b> will be embedded in a cement matrix. The erection of the sorting and cementing units which include glove-boxes and the interim storage building for conditioned packages was completed at BELGOPROCESS, at the beginning of year 2002. Start-up operations for both facilities have been performed. Operating tests of the sorting and cementing units were completed in July 2002 and inactive operation campaigns were started in August 2002. The results of the tests and inactive campaigns are given. Overall testing of the storage building supervised by the Safety Authorities was successfully performed at the end of 202 after completion of the operating tests on the equipment.

In all cases considered radionuclides coming out of the geosphere enter a river. For the biosphere calculations the BIOS-model, developed by the NRPB in England, is used. A short description of the model, {{as well as of the}} adjustments made at the RIVM to calculate the total individual and collective doses and the subdoses of different exposure pathways is given.

40|$|The actinides, {{especially}} the long lived alpha emitters, generated in a fuel cycle, demand a safe storage {{of the nuclear}} waste due to their high contribution to the total radioactivity. In this work it has been investigated whether a possible limitation of actinide production can be achieved in the inner fuel cycle by means of proper arrangements and strategies. Concerning this problem a mathematical comparison of different HTR fuel cycles indicates that the Th-U cycle is the most suitable since it has relatively good conversion rate. A special feature of the thorium cycle is that an almost negligible small fraction of 100 ppm of Th- 230 in Th- 232 produces {{a considerable amount of}} U- 232. This being itself a strong alpha emitter, it serves as the mother substance of further alpha emitters like Th- 228 and Ra- 224 leading to a high level of y-radiation. A combined HTR system of a conventional reactor and a near breeder has been investigated mathematically regarding its radioactive waste. The elements protactinium, neptunium, americium and curium as well as a 1 % loss of thorium, uranium and plutonium pass into the waste during fuel reprocessing. However, due to the simultaneous operation of both reactors such an <b>alpha</b> <b>waste</b> presents only a moderately higher level of radioactivity than that of the natural uranium used for this purpose. Furthermore, calculations have shown that in case nuclear energy is exclusively applied to meet the demand of the world population, by the help of described strategy the permanently growing nuclear waste would never reach the present level of radioactivity caused by all the natural uranium reserves...|$|E

40|$|Containers of {{transuranic}} and low-level <b>alpha</b> contaminated <b>waste</b> generated as {{a byproduct}} of Department of Energy defense-related programs must be characterized before their proper disposition can be determined. Although nondestructive assay methods are the primary method for assessing the mass and activity of the entrained transuranic radionuclides, there are additional sources of useful information relevant to the characterization of the entrained waste. These include known {{strengths and weaknesses of}} assay systems, expected correlations between assay measurements, container manifests, information about the generation process, and destructive assay techniques performed on representative samples. Each of these sources of information provides evidence that may confirm or refute the characterization of the materials as determined by the assay system(s).

40|$|In the {{operation}} of its facilities, the Valduc Research Center produces <b>alpha</b> contaminated solid <b>waste.</b> The Valduc Center has built an incineration facility to treat the most contaminated combustible waste. The process selected for waste incineration is the IRIS process. It was developped by the CEA at the Marcoule Nuclear Research Center. The Valduc Center asked SGN to build the incineration facility. The facility was commissioned in late 1996, and inactive waste incineration campaigns were run during more than 2, 500 hours in 1997 - 1998. In this period, chlorinated waste incineration test runs have been performed using the phophatizing process developped by the Marcoule Research Center. Active commissioning of the facility was performed in March 1999. From then till now on, three campaigns with active waste have been carried out, the results of which are given in the paper. The Valduc incinerator is now the first industrial active application of the IRIS process...|$|R
40|$|One {{important}} {{application of}} mobile robots is searching a geographical region {{to locate the}} origin of a specific sensible phenomenon. Mapping mine fields, extraterrestrial and undersea exploration, the location of chemical and biological weapons, {{and the location of}} explosive devices are just a few potential applications. Teams of robotic bloodhounds have a simple common goal; to converge on the location of the source phenomenon, confirm its intensity, and to remain aggregated around it until directed to take some other action. In cases where human intervention through teleoperation is not possible, the robot team must be deployed in a territory without supervision, requiring an autonomous decentralized coordination strategy. This paper presents the alpha beta coordination strategy, a family of collective search algorithms that are based on dynamic partitioning of the robotic team into two complementary social roles according to a sensor based status measure. Robots in the alpha role are risk takers, motivated to improve their status by exploring new regions of the search space. Robots in the beta role are motivated to improve but are conservative, and tend to remain aggregated and stationary until the alpha robots have identified better regions of the search space. Roles are determined dynamically by each member of the team based on the status of the individual robot relative to {{the current state of the}} collective. Partitioning the robot team into alpha and beta roles results in a balance between exploration and exploitation, and can yield collective energy savings and improved resistance to sensor noise and defectors. <b>Alpha</b> robots <b>waste</b> energy exploring new territory, and are more sensitive to the effects of ambient noise and to defectors reporting inflated status. Beta robots conserve energy by moving in a direct path to regions of confirmed high status...|$|R

Background: Decrease of {{economically}} accessible uranium resources motivates {{consideration of}} breeding of fertile {{elements such as}} thorium. Material and Method: Thorium oxide fuel burn up calculation of a simulated research reactor cooled heavy water has been proposed in the present work using MCNPX 2. 6 code. Two U- 233 and U- 235 isotopes {{have been used as}} fissile element of thorium oxide fuel. Xe- 135 and Sm- 149 reactivity variations has been studied in the core loaded (Th-U- 233) O- 2 or (Th-U- 235) O- 2 fuel matrixes during 3 months burn up process. Results: Thorium oxide having 4 % U- 233 burned 1 MW power results in less Sm- 149 reactivity than thorium oxide having 4 % U- 235 burned in 0. 5 MW power. Xe- 135 reactivity has an overestimated shift by 15 days in the core operated in 0. 5 MW than the other, after 15 days both the cores behave similarly. 480 g of U- 235 burns into the core using 0. 5 MW power and 364 g of U- 233 invents after 3 months. Burn up calculation of the modeled core of (Th-U- 233) O- 2 fuel shows a fissile mass reduction by 60 days while the consumed fissile mass reaches to its initial value after 120 days. The core flux is constant during 3 months for both modeled cores. A considerable negative reactivity occurs up to 15 days in both cores which can be refer to xenon inventory during thistime and then neutron multiplication factor is steadier up 3 months. Conclusion: Breeder thorium fuel enriched U- 233 make several advantages of good neutronic economy, U- 233 inventory and less inventory of long-lived <b>alpha</b> emitter <b>waste...</b>|$|R
40|$|In May of 1994, Lockheed Idaho Technologies Company (LITCO) in Idaho Falls, Idaho and {{subcontractors}} {{began development}} of the System Cost Model (SCM) application. The SCM estimates life cycle costs of the entire US Department of Energy (DOE) complex for designing; constructing; operating; and decommissioning treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) facilities for mixed low-level, low-level, and transuranic waste. The SCM uses parametric cost functions to estimate life cycle costs for various treatment, storage, and disposal modules which reflect planned and existing waste management facilities at DOE installations. In addition, SCM can model new TSD facilities based on capacity needs over the program life cycle. The user can provide input data (default data {{is included in the}} SCM) including the volume and nature of waste to be managed, the time period over which the waste is to be managed, and the configuration of the waste management complex (i. e., where each installation`s generated waste will be treated, stored, and disposed). Then the SCM uses parametric cost equations to estimate the costs of pre-operations (designing), construction, operations and maintenance, and decommissioning these waste management facilities. The SCM also provides transportation costs for DOE wastes. Transportation costs are provided for truck and rail and include transport of contact-handled, remote-handled, and <b>alpha</b> (transuranic) <b>wastes.</b> A complement to the SCM is the System Cost Model-Risk (SCM-R) model, which provides relative Environmental, Safety, and Health (ES and H) risk information. A relative ES and H risk basis has been developed and applied by LITCO at the INEL. The risk basis is now being automated in the SCM-R to facilitate rapid risk analysis of system alternatives. The added risk functionality will allow combined cost and risk evaluation of EM alternatives...|$|R
40|$|The {{radionuclide}} {{of uranium}} (U) is major radionuclide {{contained in the}} long life of high level radioactive liquid waste (HLLW) generated from reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The radioactive waste have to be treated to ready for long term disposal.   Separation of  the U at high efficiencies greatly lowers {{the volume of the}} long life <b>alpha</b> radioactive <b>waste</b> to be disposed and decreases the hazard level of the waste. The technology assessment of selective separation of U was carried-out as alternative and strategy for HLLW management in the future. The selective separation technology of  U  from fission products at very high efficiencies was developed by the extraction process using TBP-kerosene solvent and increasing the separation by exposure of nitrogen (N 2) laser radiation at wavelength 337. 1 nm.   In the extraction process for simulation waste containing U and Zr in 5 M HNO 3 (Zr as one of fission product which difficult to be separated from U)   using 30 % TBP-kerosene solvent and by exposure of nitrogen laser radiation shows that  increasing of distribution coefficient of U (Kd U) can obtains 135 %  and  increasing of separation factor of U and Zr (SF (U/Zr)) is 189 %. The increasing of Kd U using N 2 laser higher than using CO 2 laser (at the wave-number 944 cm - 1) which increase of Kd U only 100 %. In Indonesia, assessment for adaptation of the separation technology by extraction for separation of U process using 30 % TBP-kerosene solvent should be carried-out as alternative for treatment the HLLW generated from 99 Mo radioisotope production and from post irradiation examination of nuclear fuel. doi: [URL] [How to cite this article : Gunandjar, G.
