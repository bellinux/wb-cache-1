5|$|Apatosaurus is a genus in {{the family}} Diplodocidae. It {{is one of the}} more basal genera, with only Amphicoelias and {{possibly}} a new, unnamed genus more primitive. While the subfamily Apatosaurinae was named in 1929, the group was not used validly until an extensive 2015 study. Only Brontosaurus is also in the subfamily, with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as diplodocines. Brontosaurus has long been considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus; its only species was reclassified as A.excelsus in 1903. A 2015 study concluded that Brontosaurus is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from Apatosaurus, but not all paleontologists <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> division. As it existed in North America during the late Jurassic, Apatosaurus would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Stegosaurus.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
5|$|Theories vary among {{archaeologists and}} historians {{regarding}} {{who built the}} Polonnaruwa Vatadage, and when. One such theory suggests that it was built by Parakramabahu I during his reign in the 12th century. The Culavamsa, an ancient chronicle, mentions that he built a circular stone shrine to hold the tooth relic of the Buddha. Archaeologist Harry Charles Purvis Bell believed that this shrine is the Polonnaruwa Vatadage. This is contradicted by several ancient sources of the island, including Rajavaliya and Poojavaliya, which mention that it was built by Nissanka Malla. However, according to the studies of Arthur Maurice Hocart, Nissanka Malla only renovated an already existing building and made some additions such as the entrance and outer porch. Wilhelm Geiger, who translated the ancient Mahavamsa, and historian H. W. Codrington both <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> theory. A nearby stone inscription set by Nissanka Malla lists the Vatadage among his constructions. In this, he claims that it was built {{by one of his}} generals under his own direction.|$|E

25|$|According to sharia theory, {{conversion}} of disbelievers and non-Muslims to Islam is encouraged {{as a religious}} duty for all Muslims, and leaving Islam (apostasy), expressing contempt for Islam (blasphemy), and religious {{conversion of}} Muslims is prohibited. Not all Islamic scholars <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> interpretation of sharia theory. In practice, as of 2011, 20 Islamic nations had laws declaring apostasy from Islam as illegal and a criminal offense. Such laws are incompatible with the UDHR's requirement of freedom of thought, conscience and religion. In another 2013 report based on international survey of religious attitudes, more than 50% of Muslim population in 6 out of 49 Islamic countries supported death penalty for any Muslim who leaves Islam (apostasy). However it is also shown {{that the majority of}} Muslims in the 43 nations surveyed did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> interpretation of sharia.|$|E
25|$|PRC {{official}} statements {{have argued}} that their principle of a people's democratic dictatorship is an apt measure to enforce the compromises they deem necessary to counter these conflicting interests. Those who <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> position believe that governments with constitutionally determined and restricted authority who grant their citizens the degree of freedom and liberty present in most free nations fail {{to take on the}} responsibility of regulating these conflicting interests. This position is highly controversial.|$|E

He {{built the first}} 40-feet-long replica of a Polynesian sailing canoe while he was teaching at University of California, Santa Barbara in the 1960s. When it was finished, he shipped it to Hawaii, where ancient Hawaii scholar Mary Kawena Pukui named it Nalehia, which in the Hawaiian language means The Skilled Ones, because of the grace with which its twin hulls rode the sea.|$|E
25|$|It {{is claimed}} that Chhattisgarh takes {{its name from}} the 36 ancient forts in the area. (chhattis—thirty-six, and garh—fort.) The old state had 36 demesnes (feudal territories): Ratanpur, Vijaypur, Kharound, Maro, Kautgarh, Nawagarh, Sondhi, Aukhar, Padarbhatta, Semriya, Champa, Lafa, Chhuri, Kenda, Matin, Aparora, Pendra, Kurkuti-kandri, Raipur, Patan, Simaga, Singarpur, Lavan, Omera, Durg, Saradha, Sirasa, Menhadi, Khallari, Sirpur, Figeswar, Rajim, Singhangarh, Suvarmar, Tenganagarh and Akaltara. However, experts do not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> explanation, as 36 forts cannot be archaeologically {{identified}} in this region.|$|E
25|$|The {{founding}} of Campina Grande is credited to Captain Teodósio de Oliveira Ledo {{who led a}} group of Ariús Indians to settle the land and begin farming on December 1, 1697. However, some historians do not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> version and suggest that the place was already a settlement and named Campina Grande when Teodósio arrived with the Ariús. This position is certainly supported {{by the fact that}} Campina Grande is in a critical geographic location for people travelling between the highlands and the coast.|$|E
5000|$|Under high elaboration, a given {{variable}} (e.g., expertise) {{can serve}} as an argument (e.g., [...] "If Einstein <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> the theory of relativity, then this is a strong {{reason for me to}} as well") or a biasing factor (e.g., [...] "If an expert <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> position it is probably good, so let me see who else <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> conclusion"), at the expense of contradicting information. Under low-elaboration conditions, a variable may act as a peripheral cue (e.g., the belief that [...] "experts are always right"). While this is similar to the Einstein example above, this is a shortcut which (unlike the Einstein example) does not require thought. Under moderate elaboration, a variable may direct the extent of information processing (e.g., [...] "If an expert <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> position, I should really listen to what (s)he has to say").|$|R

25|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that this depiction of intellectual tradition in Islamic Lands is mainly dependent upon what West could understand (or {{was willing to}} understand) from this long era. In contrast, there are some historians and philosophers who do not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> account and describe this era {{in a completely different}} way. Their main point of dispute is on the influence of different philosophers on Islamic Philosophy, especially the comparative importance of eastern intellectuals such as Ibn Sina and of western thinkers such as Ibn Rushd.|$|E
25|$|Other constructivist {{scholars}} <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> {{and emphasize}} that individuals make meanings through the interactions {{with each other}} and with the environment they live in. Knowledge is thus a product of humans and is socially and culturally constructed (Ernest 1991; Prawat and Floden 1994). McMahon (1997) agrees that learning is a social process. He further states that learning is not a process that only takes place inside our minds, nor is it a passive development of our behaviors that is shaped by external forces and that meaningful learning occurs when individuals are engaged in social activities.|$|E
25|$|Kenny Neese was {{attempting}} to put the air service on a scheduled basis. Don Goodman and Oscar Winchell, two of Star’s pilots, did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> strategy, and left Star to purchase airplanes and start Alaska Interior Airlines in November 1936. In the Spring of 1937, Neese quit as Star manager and returned to flying. McGee was called back to manage the struggling company for the last time. Charlie Ruttan, {{the last of the}} Star founders, left the company. McGee bought Alaska Interior Airlines, adding two pilots and two planes to the fleet, and got the company back into good condition.|$|E

He negotiated the coalition of PNG-CD with PNL, {{but the majority of}} the liberals didn't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> measure. On 19 October 2012, Becali joined PNL, {{with the support of the}} party president, Crin Antonescu. He won the election in the 25th uninominal college with 65% of the votes. Becali requested to be a member of the Judicial Commission of the Chamber of Deputies and received assurances that he will be appointed. He resigned from PNL after receiving penal condemnation. On 29 May 2013, the Chamber of Deputies decreed the end of Becali's term as parliamentarian.|$|E
25|$|Filming for Series Four {{commenced}} on Monday 23 February 1981 {{on location}} at Pyrton Hill for {{the scenes in}} Rescue set on the planet Terminal. Location filming for the final episode, Blake, took place between 13 and 15 October 1981. Following rehearsals, recording began in the studio at BBC Television Centre on 5 November 1981. The final shoot-out was recorded on 6 November. Recording on Blake's 7 concluded on Saturday 7 November 1981. A new title sequence, featuring a new logo for the series, was created by Doug Burd. Vere Lorrimer wrote lyrics, titled Distant Star, for the series theme music {{with the notion that}} Steven Pacey would sing them over a new arrangement of the theme by Norrie Paramour. Pacey did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> idea, and Dudley Simpson created a more lively arrangement of the theme for the closing titles.|$|E
25|$|When McNamara {{took over}} the Pentagon in 1961, the United States {{military}} relied on an all-out nuclear strike {{to respond to a}} Soviet attack of any kind. This kind of strike would lead to the death of Soviet military forces and also civilians. This was the same nuclear strategy planned by the Strategic Air Command (SAC), led by General Curtis LeMay. McNamara did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> kind of action. He sought for other options after seeing how this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all Soviet nuclear weapons leaving the United States vulnerable to retaliation. McNamara’s alternative in the doctrine of counterforce was to try to limit the United States nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces. This concept would be used to prevent retaliation and escalation by holding Soviet cities hostage to a follow up strike. McNamara later concluded that counterforce was not likely to control escalation but likely to provoke retaliation. The U.S. nuclear policy remained the same.|$|E

25|$|Phar Lap at {{the time}} was owned by American {{businessman}} David J. Davis and leased to Telford. After their three-year lease agreement ended, Telford had enough money to become joint owner of the horse. Davis then had Phar Lap shipped to North America to race. Telford did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> decision and refused to go, so Davis, who along with his wife traveled to Mexico with him, brought Phar Lap's strapper Tommy Woodcock as his new trainer. Phar Lap was shipped by boat to Agua Caliente Racetrack near Tijuana, Mexico, to compete in the Agua Caliente Handicap, which was offering the largest prize money ever offered in North America racing. Phar Lap won in track-record time while carrying 129 pounds (58.5kg). The horse was ridden by Australian jockey Billy Elliot for his seventh win from seven rides. From there, the horse was sent to a private ranch near Menlo Park, California, while his owner negotiated with racetrack officials for special race appearances.|$|E
25|$|Once {{they reach}} the coordinates, an alien {{possesses}} Yuki's body and explains that the Gamilas and Iskandar are two aspects of the same race. The alien says their planet is dying and they saw Earth as the most suitable replacement, after first killing off humanity. Iskandar did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> and was imprisoned. Iskandar implants in Yuki the ability to clean the radiation from Earth. As she and Kodai return to the Yamato, Saito and Sanada sacrifice themselves by destroying the Gamilas power source. The Yamato returns to Earth, where Okita dies. The crew rejoices at their return home, but a surviving Gamilas ship ambushes them and severely damages the warship. Dessla now appears and says they no longer wish to invade the Earth; however, since {{the majority of the}} Gamilas were killed, he intends to destroy the planet with his ship to avenge his race. Kodai orders the surviving crew to abandon ship before he pilots the Yamato on a kamikaze attack against Dessler's ship. He fires the blocked Wave Motion Cannon, which destroys both spaceships.|$|E
25|$|Later decisors {{like the}} Chazon Ish (twentieth century) {{fundamentally}} <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> ruling. However, they recognize practical {{issues associated with}} the pure use {{of a line of}} longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2°E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in Changchun, China. If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by crossing the street. To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rules that the contiguous land masses to the east of that line of longitude are considered secondary (tafel) to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2°E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. Japan, New Zealand and Tasmania are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and Indonesia would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line.|$|E
