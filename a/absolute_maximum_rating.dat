50|$|The {{latch-up}} {{does not}} have to happen between the power rails - it can happen at any place where the required parasitic structure exists. A common cause of latch-up is a positive or negative voltage spike on an input or output pin of a digital chip that exceeds the rail voltage by more than a diode drop. Another cause is the supply voltage exceeding the <b>absolute</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rating,</b> often from a transient spike in the power supply. It leads to a breakdown of an internal junction. This frequently happens in circuits which use multiple supply voltages that do not come up in the required sequence on power-up, leading to voltages on data lines exceeding the input rating of parts that have not yet reached a nominal supply voltage. Latch-ups can also be caused by an electrostatic discharge event.|$|E

For example, with a typical operational amplifier the <b>Absolute</b> <b>Maximum</b> <b>Rating</b> for the supply voltage is 36 volts, but a safe operating design supply voltage is 30 volts; if this was supplied as a perfectly balanced +15V and -15V then the theoretical peak output for an ideal rail-to-rail output opamp would be 15 Volts peak (10.6V RMS, 30V peak-to-peak), but a real-world opamp such as the 741 is likely to only be able to drive about 10 volts peak into loads above 2 kilohms, i.e. about 7.1V RMS).|$|E

40|$|As {{with other}} bipolar analog devices, voltage {{regulators}} {{are known to}} be sensitive to single event transients (SET). In typical applications, large output capacitors are used to provide noise immunity. Therefore, since SET amplitude and duration are generally small, they are often of secondary importance due to this capacitance filtering. In low voltage applications, however, even small SET are a concern. Over-voltages may cause destructive conditions. Under-voltages may cause functional interrupts and may also trigger electrical latchup conditions. In addition, internal protection circuits which are affected by load as well as internal thermal effects can also be triggered from heavy ions, causing dropouts or shutdown ranging from milliseconds to seconds. In the case of FPGA power supplies applications, SETS are critical. For example, in the case of Actel FPGA RTAX family, core power supply voltage is 1. 5 V. Manufacturer specifies an <b>absolute</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rating</b> of 1. 6 V and recommended operating conditions between 1. 425 V and 1. 575 V. Therefore, according to the manufacturer, any transient of amplitude greater than 75 mV can disrupt normal circuit functions, and overvoltages greater than 100 mV may damage the FPGA. We tested five low dropout voltage regulators for SET sensitivity under a large range of circuit application conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A circuit is {{described}} to bias an avalanche photodiode {{as used in}} fiber-optic receivers. The simple boost converter with voltage-doubler output provides a digitally programmed output voltage of 25 V to 71 V from a 5 V supply. Ceramic filter capacitors and intentionally slowed MOSFET switching transitions provide a low noise output. The avalanche photodiode detector (APD) {{is used as a}} receiver in optical communications, as is the pin diode. The APD is more sensitive, but it must be biased properly to produce the appropriate electron flow for a given flux of photons. Figure 1 shows the schematic of a low-noise APD bias power supply. This circuit is based on a MAX 5026 low-noise, fixed frequency PWM boost converter operating in discontinuous inductor current mode. Figure 1. Low-noise APD bias power supply. Varying the control input voltage from 0 V to 2. 5 V results in output voltage change from 71 V to 24. 7 V. The switching time of this device has been intentionally slowed down to reduce the high-frequency spikes present in other similar devices. The internal switching frequency of the MAX 5026 is 500 kHz. The internal lateral DMOS switching device has an <b>absolute</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>rating</b> of 40 V, and along with the external voltage doubler network formed by C 3, D 2, D 3 and C 4, output voltages up to 71 V are possible.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Historical aerial {{photos were}} {{used to examine the}} early phase of forest {{succession}} after stand replacement disturbance, covering the Coast Ranges Province (CRP) and the western Cascades Province (WCP) of western Oregon. The study consisted of two components: characterizing the pattern of forest succession in western Oregon; analyzing the influence of climatic and physiographic factors on forest succession. Succession has many dimensions. In this study, I examined succession after stand replacement disturbance in terms of canopy cover change of different life forms: shrubs, hardwood trees, and conifer trees. Canopy cover changes from 1959 to 1997 for selected sample stands were obtained by photo interpretation. Canopy cover growth curves for each sample stand were developed based on a Chapman-Richards growth function. Seven successional pathways were defined to characterize forest successional processes based on projected canopy cover at age 50 and the process of canopy composition change over this 50 years period. In addition, seven parameters from the canopy cover growth curves were derived for the purpose of comparison of successional patterns in the CRP and WCP. These include time to reach 5 % and 70 % of canopy cover, weighted mean absolute growth rate, weighted mean relative growth <b>rate,</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>absolute</b> growth <b>rate,</b> time to reach <b>maximum</b> <b>absolute</b> growth <b>rate,</b> and active growth period. Results indicated that a wide range of variation in forest succession exists in western Oregon. Successional patterns for the CRP and WCP were different in terms of conifer development. Possible abiotic controls of two successional parameters were examined by stepwise regression analysis. Only 23 %, 37 %, and 29 % of the total variation in the delay, and 29 %, 25 % and 57 % of the total variation in rate parameters can be explained by abiotic factors for the WCP, CRP, and across provinces, respectively. Unexplained variation was likely due to stochastic, biotic, and management factors, as well as experimental error due to photo interpretation and derivation of successional paramters. The most important influential climatic factor was temperature, and the most important physiographic factor was elevation. Depending on location, interactions among climatic and physiographic factors also influenced successional delay and rate...|$|R

Our aim was to compare regional aortic elasticity at rest and during supine bicycle exercise at 1. 5 T MRI in healthy individuals. Fifteen volunteers (8 men), {{with a mean age}} of 29 (23 - 41) years, completed the entire protocol. Images were acquired immediately following maximal exercise. Retrospective cine sequences were acquired to assess compliance, distensibility, <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> of systolic distension and diastolic recoil at four different locations: ascending aorta, proximal descending aorta, distal descending aorta and aorta above the coeliac trunk level. Segmental aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed by through plane velocity-encoded MRI. Exercise induced a significant decrease of aortic compliance and distensibility, and a significant increase of the <b>absolute</b> values of <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> of systolic distension and diastolic recoil at all sites (p< 10 - 3). At rest and during stress, ascending aortic compliance was statistically higher compared to the whole descending aorta (p≤ 0. 0007).

PWV measured at the proximal and distal descending aorta increased significantly during stress (p = 0. 02 and p = 0. 008, respectively). Assessment of regional aortic function during exercise is feasible using MRI. During stress, aortic elasticity decreases significantly in correlation with an increase of the PWV.

Secondly, the Horst algorithm is but one aggregated Jacobi-type power method.

The physiological parameters, the maximal speed and total duration of test were measured by maximum exercise capacity testing through Bruce protocol. The HRmax was calculated by a cardio-ergometric software. Pulmonary function tests, maximal speed and total time during the physical test were performed in a treadmill (Medisoft, model 870 c).
