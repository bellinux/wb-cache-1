This incident was dubbed the Fremont Flyer, and there were no serious injuries.|$|E

50|$|Whether {{or not a}} column-oriented {{system will}} be more {{efficient}} in operation depends heavily on the operations being <b>automated.</b> <b>Operations</b> that retrieve data for objects would be slower, requiring numerous disk operations to assemble data from different columns {{to build up a}} whole-row record. However, such whole-row operations are generally rare. In the majority of cases, only a limited subset of data is retrieved. In a rolodex application, for instance, operations collecting the first names and last names from many rows in order to build a list of contacts is far more common than operations reading the data for home address.|$|E

50|$|The ModelSheet Authoring Environment {{provides}} all functionality {{needed to}} build spreadsheet models from scratch and edit existing models. It retains the visual flavor of spreadsheets, while adding in model structures such as named variables, symbolic formulas with varying scopes, time series, dimensions, and controls for optional features and <b>automated</b> <b>operations.</b> ModelSheet Authoring is the technical backend of Custom Spreadsheets. For intermediate cases (where more flexibility is needed, but the customer doesn't require frequent use of the Authoring Environment itself) the company offers consulting services in which a ModelSheet engineer uses the Authoring Environment to create a spreadsheet to the customer's specification. ModelSheet Authoring is available for testing {{but it is not}} yet commercially available on a regular basis.|$|E

50|$|Typically, {{the letters}} {{are sent to}} the check writer without a {{prosecutor}} ever having reviewed any evidence or considered whether the check writer committed a crime. These are highly <b>automated</b> <b>operations</b> in which large retailers and collection agencies transmit masses of computer data directly to the private company {{that is trying to}} collect the check, using the prosecutor's name and authority. Generally, enrollment in the program is not an admission of guilt to a crime, and will not result in criminal charges being filed or a criminal record. The check writer is told that if s/he successfully completes all program requirements, the case against him/her dismissed without any possibility of arrest, criminal charges or a record thereafter.|$|E
50|$|In {{his famous}} {{example of the}} 'primeval {{collective}} hunt', Leontiev clarifies the crucial difference between an individual action ("the beater frightening game") and a collective activity ("the hunt"). While individuals' actions (frightening game) {{are different from the}} overall goal of the activity (hunt), they all share in the same motive (obtaining food). Operations, on the other hand, are driven by the conditions and tools at hand, i.e. the objective circumstances under which the hunt is taking place. To understand the separate actions of the individuals, one needs to understand the broader motive behind the activity as a whole: this accounts for the three hierarchical levels of human functioning: object-related motives drive the collective activity (top); goals drive individual/group action(s) (middle); conditions and tools drive <b>automated</b> <b>operations</b> (lower level).|$|E
50|$|AVMON {{monitors}} availability by simulating {{a single}} terminal user in session {{with a real}} subsystem, periodically sending a brief probing message, and sensing when the subsystem becomes unavailable. When the simulated user detects unavailability, it {{sends a message to}} the operator console alerting the operator to the problem. AVMON also tracks the time it takes for the monitored subsystem to return a response, and reports whenever a user-specified performance threshold is exceeded. By using the TPNS Response Time utility, the performance statistics of the entire monitoring run can be compiled into a single report, thus providing an installation with evidence of the end-to-end response times experienced by the subsystem's end-users. For <b>automated</b> <b>operations,</b> AVMON may also be modified to perform operator functions when it senses that a real resource has become inoperative and therefore requires an operator intervention, such as restarting the resource for example.|$|E
