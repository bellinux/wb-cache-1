500|$|Conran {{summed up}} what {{influenced}} him in making Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow: [...] "We tried {{to approach it}} <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we lived in that era and were just another group of artists {{trying to make a}} work out of those pieces and inspirations. We wanted the film to feel like a lost film of that era. If we're a footnote in the history of pulp art and Golden Age comics, that'd be enough, that'd be great. If we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some of that stuff, we'd have done enough." ...|$|E
500|$|First-time {{director}} Conran incorporated many {{references to}} classic genre films {{into his own}} movie: [...] "The work of those artists and writers from the pulps and Golden Age of Comic Books like Airboy was really the template for us. To some extent we stole from it, to some extent we expanded on it [...] hopefully we added enough of our own sensibility. We tried to approach it <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we lived in that era and were just another group of artists {{trying to make a}} work [...] those pieces and inspirations. We wanted the film to feel like a lost film of that era." ...|$|E
500|$|On the geologically new Galápagos Islands, Darwin {{looked for}} {{evidence}} attaching wildlife {{to an older}} [...] "centre of creation", and found mockingbirds allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island. He heard that slight variations {{in the shape of}} tortoise shells showed which island they came from, but failed to collect them, even after eating tortoises taken on board as food. In Australia, the marsupial rat-kangaroo and the platypus seemed so unusual that Darwin thought it was <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> two distinct Creators had been at work. He found the Aborigines [...] "good-humoured & pleasant", and noted their depletion by European settlement.|$|E

500|$|As Madonna {{considered}} her alternatives, producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray were experimenting with instrumental tracks and musical ideas for her consideration. Both {{of them wanted}} to bring their unique style to the project, and composed music for the title track. Eventually, Madonna felt that the music presented to her by Leonard was more interesting, and she started to work with him. Once Madonna had conceptualized the way she would interpose her ideas with the music, she wrote [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] in about three hours. Writing and producing it with Leonard, it became the first song developed for the album. The singer has described [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] as the song of a passionate young girl [...] "so in love with God that it is <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> He were the male figure in her life." ...|$|E
500|$|Rivette {{worked with}} scriptwriters Pascal Bonitzer and Christine Laurent using an {{automatic}} writing approach that involved writing the script day by day; {{the actors and}} filmmakers {{did not know the}} direction of the story in advance of each day's filming. Eurimages provided €420,000 of funding in July 2002, and the film was shot that autumn and winter. Rivette immediately thought of Béart, who starred in La Belle Noiseuse, to play the carnal Marie. Béart has said that [...] "Of all the films I've made, this was the one which most disturbed people very close to me. They said: 'It's <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the Emmanuelle we know was up there on the screen.'." [...] Béart's image in the media at the time was characterised by the near hysteria seen when she appeared naked on the cover of Elle in May 2003 after filming ended.|$|E
500|$|During free {{practice}} on Friday and Saturday, it was Lewis Hamilton and McLaren {{who set the}} pace, closely followed by championship contender Vettel and his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. While Hamilton topped the time sheets in both Friday sessions, Jenson Button was quickest during the third session on Saturday morning. Fernando Alonso had a difficult first free practice, trailing Vettel by 0.465 seconds, {{twice as much as}} in previous races. However, he was able to lap faster than the German on the harder compound tyres in the second session. Ferrari looked stronger during the long run trials with Felipe Massa putting in the most consistently fast lap times, 0.1 seconds ahead of Hamilton. With high temperatures, tyre degradation was a concern for the teams in the paddock with Hamilton commenting that [...] "it felt <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I was sliding around the track with the tyres melting".|$|E

500|$|Angelou's {{original}} {{goal was}} {{to write about the}} lives of Black women in America, but her goal evolved in her later volumes to document {{the ups and downs of}} her own life. [...] Angelou's autobiographies had the same structure: a historical overview of the places she was living in at the time and how she coped within the context of a larger white society, as well as the ways that her story played out within that context. [...] Angelou, especially in her third autobiography, Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, successfully demonstrated the integrity of the African-American character as she experienced more positive interactions with whites. [...] In Angelou's second volume, Gather Together in My Name, Angelou was concerned with what it meant to be a Black female in the U.S., but she focused upon herself at a certain point in history. Writer Selwyn Cudjoe said regarding her second autobiography: [...] "It is <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the incidents in the text were simply 'gathered together' under the name of Maya Angelou." ...|$|E
500|$|Shooting Schindler's List {{was deeply}} {{emotional}} for Spielberg, {{the subject matter}} forcing him to confront elements of his childhood, such as the antisemitism he faced. He was surprised {{that he did not}} cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz. Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker – he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were witnessing them rather than creating a movie. Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp. Spielberg, his wife Kate Capshaw, and their five children rented a house in suburban Kraków for the duration of filming. He later thanked his wife [...] "for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row... when things just got too unbearable". Robin Williams called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set. Spielberg spent several hours each evening editing Jurassic Park, which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.|$|E
500|$|Reeves dislikes remakes, but was {{impressed}} by the script, which he deemed a reimagining. He enjoyed the original film as a child and became fonder of it as an adult when he understood how relevant it was, but prefers this version because it lacked the contradictory message of Klaatu [...] "laying down the law [...] <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the alien had the bigger stick." [...] Reeves acknowledged his Klaatu is [...] "inverted" [...] from the original, starting [...] "sinister and tough" [...] but becoming [...] "more human," [...] whereas the original was [...] "more human than human" [...] before revealing his [...] "big stick" [...] in his ending speech. He compared the remake's Klaatu to the wrathful God who floods the world in the Old Testament, but is gentle and forgiving {{by the time of the}} New Testament. He spent many weeks revising the script, trying to make Klaatu's transition from alien in human form to one who appreciates their emotions and beliefs subtle and nuanced. Derrickson, the director, said that although Reeves would not use actions [...] "that are highly unusual or highly quirky", he nevertheless [...] "keeps you aware of the fact that this being you're walking through this movie with is not a human being." [...] At Reeves' insistence, the classic line [...] "Klaatu barada nikto" [...] was added to the script after initially being omitted. The line was recorded many times, and it was decided to combine two recordings: one where Reeves said it normally, and a reversed version where he said the line backwards, creating an [...] "alien" [...] effect.|$|E

The New York Times described Leibowitz as [...] "pressing the judge <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{he were a}} hostile witness." [...] New York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia had dispatched two burly New York City police officers to protect Leibowitz. During the long jury deliberations, Judge Callahan also assigned two Morgan County deputies to guard him.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his later}} career, Arthur Mercante said: [...] "Ali {{knew all the}} tricks. He was the best fighter I ever saw in terms of clinching. Not only did he use it to rest, but he was big and strong and knew how to lean on opponents and push and shove and pull to tire them out. Ali was so smart. Most guys are just in there fighting, but Ali {{had a sense of}} {{everything}} that was happening, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he was sitting at ringside analyzing the fight while he fought it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{his claims}} have been controversial, Bob Lazar {{has stated that}} during his {{employment}} at the mysterious S-4 facility in Nevada he briefly witnessed an Aurora flight while aboard a bus near Groom Lake. He claimed {{that there was a}} [...] "tremendous roar" [...] which sounded <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> [...] "the sky was tearing". Although Lazar saw the aircraft for only a moment through the front of the bus, he described it as being [...] "very large" [...] and having [...] "two huge, square exhausts with vanes in them". [...] Lazar claims that his supervisor confirmed to him that the aircraft was indeed an [...] "Aurora", a [...] "high altitude research plane". He was also told that the aircraft was powered by [...] "liquid methane".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, a {{free-standing}} earlier structure (marked [...] "E" [...] on plan) {{was very much}} enhanced; it flanks the mansion <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were a wing of the house itself. Its origins and uses have always been debated. Possibly this was the chantry {{said to have been}} built by the D'Evercy family. Though it is known traditionally as the [...] "priest's house", its entrance faces away from the church, into the former forecourt of the 15th-century house. [...] "It may originally have been a range of lodgings for retainers or guests". Whatever its original use, it seems certain that it was remade as a dower house by Joan Stourton, who had married John Sydenham in 1434, not realising that her own son was to predecease her, thus allowing her to remain in the main house for the duration of her life.|$|E

Her costumes draw special attention, and include several examples {{on loan from}} the Metropolitan Opera Archives. Her portrait appears on the Norwegian 100 kroner bill and on the tail section of Norwegian Air Shuttle planes. [...] "That voice! How can one describe it?" [...] wrote opera critic Harold C. Schonberg in his New York Times obituary of Flagstad. [...] "It was enormous, but did not sound enormous because it was never pushed or out of placement. It had a rather cool silvery quality, and was handled instrumentally, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a huge violin was emitting legato phrases." [...] Incredibly, Flagstad sang the role of Isolde 70 times on the Met stage from 1935 to 1941, making Tristan und Isolde {{one of the greatest}} box office attractions in Metropolitan Opera history. Nine of those performances were Saturday matinee radio broadcasts.|$|E
2500|$|Production of {{the song}} began in early 1986. Joel {{considered}} Ray Charles one of his idols. [...] "Ray Charles was my hero when I was growing up," [...] Joel recalled. [...] "As big of a pianist or as big of a star I could ever become, I could never be Ray Charles." [...] According to Joel, when Charles heard that Joel named his daughter, Alexa Ray, after him, Charles contacted him saying that he'd love to do a song with Joel, {{as long as he}} had the [...] "right song" [...] in mind. When writing the song, Joel tried to compose it in the style of Charles' hit, [...] "Georgia on My Mind", while also giving it a blues sound. Joel wrote the song over a single night. [...] "It was one of those rare songs, like [...] "New York State of Mind", that seem to come all at once - it seemed <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I had heard it before." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Stephen Holden, {{the album}} [...] "teems with 60's and early 70's echoes – of the Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, and Sly and the Family Stone – all pumped {{up with a}} brash, if {{occasionally}} klutzy, 80's sense of showmanship". In Madonna's own words, the songs [...] "intertwine her search for faith with her search for her mother". The opening track is [...] "Like a Prayer", which {{was also the first}} song developed for the album. Once Madonna had conceptualized the way she would interpose her ideas with the music, she wrote the song in about three hours. She described [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] as the song of a passionate young girl [...] "so in love with God that it is <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> He were the male figure in her life." [...] It's a pop rock song with elements of gospel music. A choir provides background vocals that heighten the song's spiritual nature, and a rock guitar keeps the music dark and mysterious. [...] The second track, [...] "Express Yourself", talks about rejecting material pleasures and only accepting the best for oneself; throughout the song, subtexts are employed. According to the singer, the track is a tribute to Sly & the Family Stone. The third track, [...] "Love Song", is a duet with recording artist Prince. The song was co-written by Madonna and Prince and features the artist's [...] "signature scratchy disco guitar breaks through Madonna's synths".|$|E
2500|$|On March 6 he was {{assigned}} as the Assistant Adjutant General and Assistant Inspector General of the Forces at Charleston, and on March 16 he was appointed a captain in the Regular Confederate States Artillery. Beginning on April 11 Lee was aide-de-camp to Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard. That same day he delivered an ultimatum from Beauregard to Union Maj. Robert Anderson, demanding the evacuation of Fort Sumter, which was refused and after bombardment the fort fell on April 14, precipitating {{the start of the}} Civil War. According to Carl Sandburg (Abraham Lincoln, vol. 3, pp.208–9), Captain Lee and 3 other men with full power from Beauregard to decide what to answer Anderson heard him say he would be starved out in a few days. Anderson offered to [...] "evacuate Fort Sumter in 3 days and avoid the useless effusion of blood." [...] They could have taken Anderson's reply back to Beauregard, have it telegraphed to Jefferson Davis to see if they would wait 3 days more to see if Anderson would surrender after his food was gone. [...] "It seemed <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the 4 men had decided before they came what they would say, which was: [...] "Beauregard will open fire on Fort Sumter in one hour from this time." [...] This probably was not, as it seems, the last opportunity to avoid war because [...] "Sumpter was a symbol, a Chip on the Shoulder."
