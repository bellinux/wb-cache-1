5000|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{complying}} with an aircraft design standard that specifies a maximum permissible error in the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>system</b> {{it is necessary to}} measure the position error in a representative aircraft. There are many different methods for measuring position error. Some of the more common methods are: ...|$|E
5000|$|Position {{error is}} one of the errors {{affecting}} the systems in an aircraft for measuring airspeed and altitude. [...] It is not practical or necessary for an aircraft to have an <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>system</b> and an altitude indicating system that are exactly accurate. A small amount of error is tolerable. It is caused by the location of the static vent that supplies the altimeter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{error in}} <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> must also not be excessive. Part 23, §23.1323(b) {{includes}} the following requirement for the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicating</b> system: ...|$|R
50|$|Position error {{affects the}} <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and the <b>indicated</b> altitude. Aircraft {{manufacturers}} use the {{aircraft flight manual}} to publish details of the error in <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and <b>indicated</b> altitude across the operating range of speeds. In many aircraft, the effect of position error on airspeed is shown as the difference between <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and calibrated airspeed. In some low-speed aircraft, the position error is shown as the difference between <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> and equivalent airspeed.|$|R
50|$|Dead {{reckoning}} {{begins with}} a known position, or fix, which is then advanced, mathematically or directly on the chart, by means of recorded heading, speed, and time. Speed can be determined by many methods. Before modern instrumentation, it was determined aboard ship using a chip log. More modern methods include pit log referencing engine speed (e.g. in rpm) against a table of total displacement (for ships) or referencing one's <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> fed by the pressure from a pitot tube. This measurement is converted to an equivalent airspeed based upon known atmospheric conditions and measured errors in the <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> <b>system.</b> A naval vessel uses a device called a pit sword (rodmeter), which uses two sensors on a metal rod to measure the electromagnetic variance caused by the ship moving through water. This change is then converted to ship's speed. Distance is determined by multiplying the speed and the time. This initial position can then be adjusted resulting in an estimated position by {{taking into account the}} current (known as set and drift in marine navigation). If there is no positional information available, a new dead reckoning plot may start from an estimated position. In this case subsequent dead reckoning positions will have taken into account estimated set and drift.|$|R
5000|$|Airspeed is {{the speed}} of an {{aircraft}} relative to the air. Among the common conventions for qualifying <b>airspeed</b> are <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> ("IAS"), calibrated airspeed ("CAS"), equivalent airspeed ("EAS"), true airspeed ("TAS"), and density <b>airspeed.</b> <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> is simply what is read off of an airspeed gauge connected to a pitot static <b>system,</b> calibrated <b>airspeed</b> is <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> adjusted for pitot system position and installation error, and equivalent airspeed is calibrated airspeed adjusted for compressibility effects. True airspeed is equivalent airspeed adjusted for air density, and is also {{the speed of}} the aircraft through the air in which it is flying. [...] Calibrated airspeed is typically within a few knots of <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed,</b> while equivalent airspeed decreases slightly from CAS as aircraft altitude increases or at high speeds. With EAS constant, true airspeed increases as aircraft altitude increases. This is because air density decreases with higher altitude, but an aircraft's wing requires the same amount of air particles (i.e., mass of air) flowing around it to produce the same amount of lift for a given AOA; thus, a wing must move faster through thinner air than thicker air to obtain the same amount of lift.|$|R
50|$|Calibrated <b>airspeed</b> (CAS) is <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> {{corrected}} for {{instrument and}} position error.|$|R

50|$|The <b>indicated</b> <b>{{airspeed}}</b> {{is close}} to the true airspeed only at sea level in standard conditions and at low speeds. At 11,000 m, an <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> of 300 kn may correspond to a true airspeed of 500 kn in standard conditions.|$|R
50|$|A {{decrease}} in {{density of air}} results in {{decrease in}} both aircraft and Engine performance. High elevation airports are characterized by low pressure and high ambient temperatures. The True Airspeed (TAS) will be higher than the <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicated</b> by the <b>Airspeed</b> indicator to the pilot in air of low density. This increase in TAS leads to greater touchdown speed hence increases the landing roll. More energy has to be absorbed by the brakes thus demanding the need of a longer runway. An increased density altitude means a longer landing distance.|$|R
25|$|The actual speeds {{represented}} by these designators {{are specific to}} a particular model of aircraft. They are expressed by the aircraft's <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (and not by, for example, the ground speed), so that pilots may use them directly, without having to apply correction factors, as aircraft instruments also show <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Indicated</b> <b>{{airspeed}}</b> (IAS) is the {{airspeed indicator}} reading (ASIR) uncorrected for instrument, position, and other errors. From current EASA definitions: <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> means the speed of an aircraft as shown on its pitot static airspeed indicator calibrated to reflect standard atmosphere adiabatic compressible flow at sea level uncorrected for airspeed system errors.|$|R
50|$|An {{airspeed}} indicator {{is used to}} measure <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (IAS) in knots.|$|R
50|$|At higher altitudes, the {{air density}} {{is lower than}} at sea level. Because of the {{progressive}} reduction in air density, as the aircraft’s altitude increases its true airspeed is progressively greater than its <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b> For example, the <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> at which an aircraft stalls can be considered constant, but the true airspeed at which it stalls increases with altitude.|$|R
50|$|Calibrated {{airspeed}} {{in knots}} is usually abbreviated as KCAS, while <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> is abbreviated as KIAS.|$|R

50|$|At {{increased}} altitude (more accurately, density altitude), for {{the same}} given <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (IAS) the aircraft's true airspeed (TAS) will be higher, but the same <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> limits apply. Likewise, most efficient cruise speed, total drag, available lift, stall speed, and other aerodynamic information depend on calibrated, not true airspeed. Most aircraft exhibit a small difference between the airspeed actually shown on the instrument (<b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed,</b> or IAS) and the speed the instrument should theoretically show (calibrated airspeed or CAS). This difference, called position error, is mainly due to inaccurate sensing of static pressure. It is usually not possible to find a position for the static ports which, at all angles of attack, accurately senses the atmospheric pressure at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying.|$|R
50|$|The static {{pressure}} system {{is open to}} the exterior of the aircraft to sense the pressure of the atmosphere at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying. This small opening is called the static port. In flight the air pressure is slightly different at different positions around the exterior of the aircraft. The aircraft designer must select the position of the static port carefully. There is no position on the exterior of an aircraft at which the air pressure, for all angles of attack, is identical to the atmospheric pressure at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying. The difference in pressure causes a small error in the altitude indicated on the altimeter, and the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicated</b> on the <b>airspeed</b> indicator. This error in <b>indicated</b> altitude and <b>airspeed</b> is called position error.|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of what maximum speed to fly {{in order to prevent}} high altitude flutter has been a hot subject of discussion among experienced wave flyers for a long time. It is not trivial because a bailout at altitudes with outside temperature of - 70 °C is a considerable hazard in itself. The question is: does the red-line <b>airspeed</b> apply to <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> (IAS) or to true airspeed (TAS) as far as flutter at high altitude is concerned? Or is there an in-between limit...|$|R
5000|$|The true {{airspeed}} (TAS; also KTAS, for knots {{true airspeed}}) of an aircraft is {{the speed of}} the aircraft relative to the airmass in which it is flying. The true airspeed is important information for accurate navigation of an aircraft. Traditionally it is measured using an analogue TAS indicator, but as the Global Positioning System has become available for civilian use, the importance of such analogue instruments has decreased. Since <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> is a better indicator of power used and lift available, True airspeed is not used for controlling the aircraft during taxiing, takeoff, climb, descent, approach or landing; for these purposes the <b>Indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> [...] - [...] IAS or KIAS (knots <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed)</b> [...] - [...] is used. However, since <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed</b> only shows true speed through the air at standard sea level pressure and temperature, a TAS meter is necessary for navigation purposes at cruising altitude in less dense air. The IAS meter reads very nearly the TAS at lower altitude and at lower speed. On jet airliners the TAS meter is usually hidden at speeds below 200 kn. Neither provides for accurate speed over the ground, since surface winds or winds aloft are not taken into account.|$|R

50|$|The aircraft, {{which left}} from Posadas and {{was due to}} land in Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, Buenos Aires, was forced to divert towards Fray Bentos to avoid a storm. Examination of the aircraft's flight data {{recorder}} (FDR) revealed that shortly after the diversion occurred, the aircraft airspeed indicator began to fall to an alarmingly low <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b> Unbeknownst to the pilots, this was caused not directly, by a loss of power, but by ice formed inside the pitot tube, which reads the airspeed for the indicator by measuring the pressure of inflow air. The ice obstructing the pitot tube reduced the air inflow, thus giving an erroneously low <b>indicated</b> <b>airspeed.</b>|$|R
