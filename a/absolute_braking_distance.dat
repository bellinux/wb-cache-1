50|$|With Level 3, ETCS {{goes beyond}} pure train {{protection}} functionality with {{the implementation of}} full radio-based train spacing. Fixed train detection devices (GFM) are no longer required. As with Level 2, trains find their position themselves by means of positioning beacons and via sensors (axle transducers, accelerometer and radar) and must also be capable of determining train integrity on board to the very highest degree of reliability. By transmitting the positioning signal to the radio block centre, it is always possible to determine that point on the route the train has safely cleared. The following train can already be granted another movement authority up to this point. The route is thus no longer cleared in fixed track sections. In this respect, Level 3 departs from classic operation with fixed intervals: given sufficiently short positioning intervals, continuous line-clear authorisation is achieved and train headways come close to the principle of operation with <b>absolute</b> <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> spacing ("moving block"). Level 3 is currently under development. Solutions for reliable train integrity supervision are highly complex and are hardly suitable for transfer to older models of freight rolling stock. Some kind of end-of-train device is needed or special lines for rolling stock with included integrity checks like commuter multiple units or high speed passenger trains.|$|E
40|$|Within {{the next}} decades the railway systems will change to fully {{autonomous}} high speed trains (HSTs). An increase in efficiency and safety {{and a reduction}} of costs would go hand in hand. Today’s centralized railway management system and established regulations can not cope with trains driving within the <b>absolute</b> <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> {{as it would be}} necessary for electronic coupling or platooning maneuvers. Hence, to ensure safety and reliability, new applications and changes in the train control and management are necessary. Such changes demand new reliable control communication links between train-to-train (T 2 T) and future developments on train-to-ground (T 2 G). T 2 G will be covered by long term evolution-railway (LTE-R) which shall replace today’s global system for mobile communications-railway (GSM-R). The decentralized T 2 T communication is hardly investigated and no technology has been selected. This publication focuses on the wide band propagation for T 2 T scenarios and describes a extensive channel sounding measurement campaign with two HSTs. First results of T 2 T communication at high speed conditions in different environments are presented...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} paper {{it is necessary to}} study the waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on longitudinal train dynamics at different modes of braking. At this one should estimate the level of maximum longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> size in freight cars of various lengths. Methodology. In this paper we attempt to approximate the actual diagram of braking cylinders filling with rational functions of varying degrees. In selection of coefficients in the required functions the highest values of the longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> were used as controlled parameters. They were compared with similar values obtained as a result of experimental rides. The level of longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> amount were evaluated by means of mathematical modeling of train longitudinal vibrations, caused by different braking modes. Findings. At mathematical modeling was assumed that the train consists of 60 uniform four-axle gondola cars, weight of 80 tons, equipped with air dispenser No. 483 included in the median operation, composite braking blocks, and one locomotive VL- 8. Train before braking has been pre-stretched. Various types of pneumatic braking (emergency, full service and adjusting braking) of the freight train on the horizontal section of the track were simulated. As the calculation results were obtained values of the longitudinal forces, <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> amounts and reduction time in speed at various braking modes. Originality. Waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on the longitudinal forces level and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> amount in freight trains were investigated. Also the longitudinal loading of freight trains at various pneumatic braking was investigated. Practical value. Obtained results can be used to assess the level of largest longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> in the freight trains of different lengths by mathematical modeling of different braking modes...|$|R

The Slipping Tramcar Prevention Equipment is mainly composed of an intercepting door and a buffering system, in which an energy absorber is the key component. The braking dynamic model of the energy absorber is studied by establishing a Lagrange equation and simulating the braking progress by the software of Simulink. The <b>braking</b> simulation <b>distances</b> curves of the energy absorber are obtained under the different initial conditions of tramcar mass and velocity, which shows that the tramcar velocity and mass both have a significant influence on the <b>braking</b> <b>distance.</b> The analysis on variance and range is developed for further comparison on the two key factors implying that tramcar mass is of the most great importance.

40|$|This thesis work {{conducts a}} study on {{modelling}} car drivers’ start of brake when forward vehicle is stationary or when it is moving with constant velocity. The euroFOT data collected by Volvo Car Corporation in the Gothenburg area of Sweden has been the main data source for modelling purposes. The data segments used consist of braking events where the host vehicle is approaching the forward vehicle. The selection of data segments was further limited by addition of the constraint the forward vehicle has constant velocity or is stationary. A thorough literature investigation recommended several approaches to predict driver’s brake initiation in terms of distance {{as well as other}} perceptual or physical factors that are decisive on driver’s braking behaviour. With the help of previous knowhow, distance to target vehicle at drivers’ brake initiation and inverse time to collision (TTC) approaches have been selected for modelling. Vehicle dynamics related factors such as velocity, acceleration, yaw rate etc. and other factors presented in literature such as reaction time, visual angle, TTC, preferred time headway, preferred distance to vehicle ahead have been subjected to a correlation analysis to identify the significant parameters related to drivers’ <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> and inverse TTC preference. Single and multiple linear regression analysis have been applied to the combination of selected parameters to establish an equation, which gives the minimum prediction error. Both normal and lognormal values of measured <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> were used in regression analysis. The results suggested that, for brake events where target vehicle is stationary, the <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> is best predicted with normal <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> based modelling. On the contrary, modelling based on lognormal <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> offered better estimation results for constant target vehicle velocity events. The best population fit and smallest prediction error is resulted with lognormal <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> based modelling for constant target vehicle velocity condition. Interestingly, the inverse TTC approach provided promising results for the constant target vehicle velocity condition whereas the case for stationary target vehicle, inverse TTC did not lead to strong results. Finally, the study is concluded with various recommendations for possible future investigations...|$|R
