5|$|Tunbridge Wells local {{elections}} show a pattern since 1973 of Conservative party dominance, apart from <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> from 1994 to 1996 of no overall control and <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> from 1996 to 1998 when the Liberal Democrats held a majority. The most recent elections, held in May 2008, gave the Conservatives {{a large majority}} with 44 seats compared with the Liberal Democrats' four. The extent of the Conservatives' dominance is further illustrated {{by the fact that}} in some wards (e.g. Park) Labour did not even field a candidate in the 2008 council elections.|$|E

5|$|One of the governor's most {{important}} political powers {{is the ability}} to call a special session of the General Assembly. During <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period,</b> the assembly can meet on its own for no more than 91 days, and this often prevents them from passing all the legislation they intend to. This can give the governor considerable influence in the body which will often compromise on issues with him or her in exchange for a special legislative session.|$|E
5|$|Qubilah {{accepted}} a plea agreement {{with respect to}} the charges, in which she maintained her innocence but accepted responsibility for her actions.

For the duration of her treatment, Qubilah's ten-year-old son, Malcolm, was sent to live with Shabazz at her apartment in Yonkers, New York.|$|E
5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

In the only signing study ever conducted in a great ape's natural environment, Shapiro home-reared Princess, a juvenile female, which learned nearly 40 signs (according to the criteria of sign acquisition used by psychologist Francine Patterson with Koko, the gorilla) and trained Rinnie, a free-ranging adult female orangutan, which learned nearly 30 signs over <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b> For his dissertation study, Shapiro examined the factors influencing sign learning by four juvenile orangutans over a 15-month period.|$|E
5|$|Lautner was {{initially}} {{supposed to be}} in two films, Northern Lights and a movie based on Max Steel, but pulled out of both films due to scheduling conflicts and better offers. Other planned projects were the lead in a movie about Stretch Armstrong and a hostage thriller, Cancun. Lautner filmed a Bourne Identity-esque spy film with Lily Collins, entitled Abduction. It was released in September 2011 to universally negative reviews from critics and Lautner's performance was heavily criticised.

Vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the arduous recording process; intent on achieving a particular sound, he experimented with texturised guitar tremolo techniques and tuning systems, unorthodox production methods, obscured vocals, and sampled percussion and feedback. The group cycled through nineteen studios and {{a larger number of}} engineers during the album's two-year creation, with total recording costs rumoured to have reached £250,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} went mostly unnoticed {{upon its}} live broadcast. However, {{four years after}} the production of Casino Royale, CBS invited Fleming to write 32 episodes over <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> for a television show based on the James Bond character. Fleming agreed and began to write outlines for this series. When nothing ever came of this, however, Fleming grouped and adapted three of the outlines into short stories and released the 1960 anthology For Your Eyes Only along with an additional two new short stories.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{and during}} Israel's 1982 {{invasion}} of Lebanon, al-Wazir planned numerous attacks inside Israel against both {{civilian and military}} targets. He prepared Beirut's defense against incoming Israeli forces. Nonetheless, the Israeli military prevailed and al-Wazir was exiled from Lebanon {{with the rest of}} the Fatah leadership. He settled in Amman for <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> and was then exiled to Tunis in 1986. From his base there, he started to organize youth committees in the Palestinian territories; these eventually became the backbone of the Palestinian forces in the First Intifada. However, he did not live to command the uprising. On April 16, 1988, he was assassinated at his home in Tunis, by Israeli commandos.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualification}} process can start {{as early as}} almost three years before the final tournament and last over <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b> The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental play-offs. For example, {{the winner of the}} Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the 2010 World Cup. From the 1938 World Cup onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the 2006 FIFA World Cup onward, requiring the champions to qualify. Brazil, winners in 2002, were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.|$|E

5|$|In Italian service, Beograd and Ljubljana were repaired, re-armed, and renamed Sebenico and Lubiana respectively. Sebenico was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Italian Navy in August 1941, and Lubiana in October or November 1942. They both served mainly as convoy escorts between Italy and the Aegean and North Africa, with Sebenico completing more than 100 convoy escort missions over <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b> Neither ship {{was involved in}} any notable action. On 1 April 1943, Lubiana was either sunk off the Tunisian coast by British aircraft, or ran aground in the Gulf of Tunis and was lost. Sebenico was captured by the Germans in Venice after the Italian Armistice in September 1943 in a damaged condition. She was repaired, re-armed, and renamed TA43 and entered service in the Kriegsmarine (German Navy). TA43 served on escort and mine-laying duties in the northern Adriatic Sea, but saw little action. She was either damaged by artillery fire on 30 April 1945 at Trieste then scuttled, or just scuttled on 1 May.|$|E
5|$|NGC 2770 {{is a type}} SASc {{spiral galaxy}} located about 88 million light–years away that has hosted Type Ib {{supernova}}e: SN 1999eh, SN 2007uy, and SN 2008D. The last of these is famous for being the first supernova detected by the X-rays released very early on in its formation, {{rather than by the}} optical light emitted during later stages, which allowed the first moments of the outburst to be observed. It is possible that NGC 2770's interactions with a suspected companion galaxy may have created the massive stars causing this activity. UGC 4904 is a galaxy located about 77 million light-years from Earth. On 20 October 2004, a supernova impostor was observed by Japanese amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki within the galaxy. Observations of its spectrum suggest that it shed massive amounts of material in <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period,</b> transforming from a LBV star to a Wolf–Rayet star, before it was observed erupting as hypernova SN 2006jc on October 11, 2006.|$|E

5|$|The host {{city for}} an Olympic Games is usually chosen {{seven to eight}} years ahead of their celebration. The process of {{selection}} is carried out in two phases that span <b>a</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period.</b> The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can {{be presented to the}} International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organisation of the Olympic Games. In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>two-year</b> <b>period</b> of {{political}} turmoil followed {{the general election}} of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; {{it was followed by}} two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term. In the 2004 Indian general elections, again no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's communist parties. That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term. In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties. The Prime Minister of India is Narendra Modi, who was formerly Chief Minister of Gujarat. On 20 July 2017, Ram Nath Kovind was elected India’s 14th President and took the oath of office on 25 July 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Wolverines were seeded {{number two}} in the Midwest region of the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Michigan opened the tournament by {{defeating}} Wofford 57–40, the fewest points scored by a Michigan opponent that season, and the victory ensured that the Wolverines would not have consecutive NCAA Tournament losses {{for the first time}} since 1993. Michigan then defeated Texas 79–65, advancing to the Sweet 16 for the second straight season. The team's back-to-back trips marked the first time Michigan played in consecutive Sweet 16s since its three straight appearances in 1992–94. Michigan recorded 14 three-pointers in the game, setting a school record in NCAA tournament play and giving Beilein his 700th win. The Wolverines defeated Tennessee 73–71 in the March 28 regional semifinal. Although they led by 15 points in the second half, four turnovers in the last 97 seconds reduced the lead to 72–71 in the final seconds. Michigan set a school record for the most three-point shots in a season (312), breaking the previous record of 305 set in 2008–09. In the March 30 regional final against (RV, #22) Kentucky, Michigan led by ten points in the first half before Kentucky ended the half with a 15–5 run to tie the score at 37. Kentucky took the lead several times in the second half, with Michigan battling back to tie the score at 39, 47 and 51. With Michigan leading 55–51 with 11:31 remaining, Kentucky answered with 11 straight points for its largest lead of the game (forcing Michigan to use a timeout with 6:24 left). With less than 30 seconds left in the game, Michigan tied the game at 72 with a wild scramble (including three offensive Wolverine rebounds) before Kentucky buried a deep three-pointer with 2.3 seconds remaining to win 75–72. Michigan recorded seven three-pointers in the game, bringing the school season record to 319.
