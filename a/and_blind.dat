5|$|From 1876 to 1888, Gilkeson {{served as}} a member and {{secretary}} of the fourth, fifth, and sixth Board of Regents of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind,</b> a position that enabled him {{to become familiar with}} the school's efforts to educate its deaf <b>and</b> <b>blind</b> students.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 1870, the institute, {{which was}} later {{known as the}} West Virginia Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind,</b> opened its doors in the old Romney Classical Institute {{building}} with 25 deaf and five blind students. Following its disestablishment in 1916, the adjacent Potomac Academy (formerly Potomac Seminary) grounds were also incorporated into {{the campus of the}} Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{institute}} {{and the society}} experienced a hiatus {{during the course of}} the war. The school held sessions under Reverend Nelson, and subsequently William C. Clayton in 1866. Clayton later served in the West Virginia Senate. The Romney Literary Society was revived in 1869, and following the passage of a bill which established the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind</b> in March 1870, the society offered the institute's building and grounds to the state of West Virginia for the new school. The institute's property was transferred to the state and the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind</b> opened for its first term on September 29, 1870. Following the schools' subsequent expansions, the institute's former building became the center portion of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind,</b> in which capacity it serves at the present day. In addition to Jacob and Clayton, Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia, was also an alumnus of the institute.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the light-switch <b>and</b> <b>blinds</b> use {{behaviours}} in ten private {{offices were}} analyzed with concurrent solar irradiance, ceiling illuminance, and occupancy data. Upon this analysis, an adaptive lighting <b>and</b> <b>blinds</b> control algorithm was formulated. The algorithm learns occupants' illuminance preferences from their light switch-on <b>and</b> <b>blinds</b> closing behaviours, <b>and</b> employs {{this information to}} determine the photosensor setpoints to switch off lighting <b>and</b> to open <b>blinds.</b> The algorithm was implemented inside controllers serving five private offices and a controls laboratory 2 ̆ 013 a shared office space with a standalone controls network. Alternative control scenarios were analyzed through integrated daylighting and occupant behaviour simulations. The {{results indicate that the}} use of an adaptive lighting <b>and</b> <b>blinds</b> control algorithm developed in this paper can substantially reduce the lighting loads in office buildings 2 ̆ 013 without adversely affecting the occupant comfort.

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's South Branch line to Romney in the 1880s, a {{passenger}} train conducted three trips daily (morning, noon, and evening) from the Romney Depot at Valley to Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line. During the 1930s, passenger ridership on the South Branch line began to decline, and passenger service was finally discontinued shortly thereafter. A special passenger train carried students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind,</b> arriving at Romney Depot in Valley in the fall, and departing in the spring to take the students home. The last special train to transport the students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind</b> departed Romney Depot in the spring of 1941. Freight operations from Romney Depot later ceased, and the station was closed and demolished soon after.|$|E
5|$|Howard Hille Johnson (February 19, 1846– February 8, 1913) was a blind American {{educator}} and {{writer in the}} states of Virginia and West Virginia. Johnson {{was instrumental in the}} establishment of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind</b> in 1870, after which he taught blind students at the institution's School for the Blind for 43 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his career as an academic and educator, Johnson was a prolific writer of prose and verse. He {{was elected to the}} Romney Literary Society, which donated its buildings and the grounds of the Romney Classical Institute to the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind</b> after its establishment in 1870.|$|E

5|$|In early 1869, Johnson {{identified}} {{the need for}} a school for the blind in the new state of West Virginia; with statehood, deaf <b>and</b> <b>blind</b> West Virginia children attended schools for the deaf <b>and</b> <b>blind</b> in neighboring states (with West Virginia paying their tuition). Johnson began corresponding with West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson, canvassing across the state to arouse public sentiment in support of a school for the blind. Despite rebukes from prominent West Virginian politicians, Johnson became the leading advocate for a state institution for the blind. He and other educated blind people staged an exhibition in the legislative chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates, which was praised by the legislators.|$|E
5|$|On May 15, 1869, nine {{members of}} the Romney Literary Society, {{including}} White, commenced an effort to revive the society's activities and reconstitute its library, which had been destroyed during the war. When the state of West Virginia first founded an institution for deaf <b>and</b> <b>blind</b> students, White helped to pass the legislative act that established the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind.</b> On April 20, 1870, during {{a meeting of the}} schools' Board of Regents, in Wheeling, White and Andrew Wodrow Kercheval were sent by the Romney Literary Society to make a formal offer of the Romney Classical Institute buildings and grounds to the board. Through White's efforts, the school was established on the former campus of the Romney Classical Institute in Romney, where it remains as of 2015.|$|E
5|$|Romney Academy trustee John Baker White was a {{clerk of}} both the circuit and county courts of Hampshire County and {{was the father of}} Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia from 1877 until 1881.

Another trustee, Angus William McDonald, was the father of Marshall McDonald, who served as commissioner of the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries from 1888 until 1895.|$|E

Tommy's mother convinces him {{that he did not}} see or hear the incident and must never tell anyone about it; as a result, he becomes deaf, dumb, <b>and</b> <b>blind</b> to the outside world ("1921"). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing a fascinating inner psyche ("Amazing Journey/Sparks").|$|E

5|$|By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its facilities, and the Romney Literary Society {{was given}} {{authorization}} to raise monies from a lottery {{to build a}} new school building. The society successfully raised the funds, and in 1845 bids were called {{for the construction of a}} new school building. On December 12, 1846, the Virginia General Assembly empowered the Romney Literary Society to establish a seminary for learning at the academy. That same year, a new brick building was constructed for the academy and for the library of the society; the building now serves as the central unit of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the war, the {{contents}} of the society's library were plundered by Union Army forces, and many of its 3,000 volumes were either scattered or destroyed. After a reorganization in 1869, the society commenced construction of the present Literary Hall in downtown Romney. It transferred ownership of its Romney Classical Institute campus to the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf <b>and</b> <b>Blind</b> in 1870 and in that year completed Literary Hall, where the society reconstituted its library collection and revived its literary activities.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his tenure}} as {{superintendent}} of Hampshire County Schools, Gilkeson undertook the study of law and started a law practice in Romney; he subsequently became a prominent lawyer in the community.
