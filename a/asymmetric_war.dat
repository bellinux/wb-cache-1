40|$|Wars {{of conquest}} and wars of {{independence}} {{are characterized by}} an asymmetry in the payoff structure: The production of one party constitutes the winner’s prize, while {{the production of the}} other party is not contested. We present and solve a model of warfare, which nests this asymmetric payoff structure as well as the standard symmetric payoff structure where the winner gets aggregate production. We use this model to discuss how equilibrium behavior and outcomes depend on resource endowments and military and production technologies in asymmetric wars; and to compare equilibrium behavior and outcomes in symmetric and <b>asymmetric</b> <b>wars.</b> Among others, we find that <b>asymmetric</b> <b>wars</b> are fought less intensively, and that defending countries in wars of conquest and secessionist groups in wars of independence have higher winning probabilities in such <b>asymmetric</b> <b>wars</b> than they would have in standard symmetric wars...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{military}} engagements of the developed countries {{since the end of}} the Cold <b>War</b> have been <b>asymmetric</b> <b>wars.</b> These conflicts are characterized by a considerable imbalance of power between the two sides, but the issues that are at stake in these wars are often not issues of great national interest to the strong side. If these wars are not won by the strong side, they usually end because of a withdrawal rather than a military defeat. Since core national interests of the strong side are not at stake in <b>asymmetric</b> <b>wars,</b> whether to fight these wars or not, how to fight them, and when to withdraw from them are more subject to domestic politics than in other types of war. These questions are the focus of this dissertation. The results paint an overall pessimistic picture: developed states, and democracies in particular, have serious limitations on how they fight <b>asymmetric</b> <b>wars</b> and cannot continue fighting these wars for long. In particular, it is shown that duration of a war has a negative impact on citizens’ attitudes toward the war effort that has an effect independent of total costs of war and that developed states, especially democracies, have a tendency to have fewer soldiers than needed. Importantly, these results are obtained while assuming that citizens are rational and the type of war is publicly known...|$|R

40|$|Asymmetric warfare is {{creating}} a new frontierfor bioethics as military organizations rushto develop nonlethal, medicalized weapons. Faced with small but increasingly sophisticated guer-rilla organizations that intermingle at will with the civilian population, the United States {{and many of its}} allies are searching for ways to disable insurgents while minimizing harm to civilians. One avenue is to build increasingly sophisticated “precision-guided munitions”—“smart, ” high-explosive bombs that, in theory, zero in on and destroy their targets without widespread collateral damage. However, these weapons—the purview of electronics and ballistic experts—can only go so far. Very often, there are no clearly defined guerrilla targets, or, as often happens, the targets are destroyed early on. Nonlethal weapons are an increasingly attractive option for rooting out insurgents without bringing catastrophic harm to civilians. Rather than disabling or killing enemy forces by causing traumatic injury, nonlethal weapons temporarily incapacitate their targets by causing physical distress, disorientation, or unconsciousness. These weapons are “medicalized” in that they rely on advances in neuroscience, physi-“Medicalized ” weapons—those that rely on advances in neuroscience, physiology, and pharmacology—offer the prospect of reducing casualties and protecting civilians.

Borrowing from the recent literature on both counterinsurgency and the limitation of military power in civil wars, this thesis provides a new theoretical framework in which it connects governmental victory in <b>asymmetric</b> <b>wars</b> with an increase it its legitimacy. I argue that if the third-party helps the government increases its legitimacy, governmental victory could be materialized. I constructed a structured focused comparison on the Omani Civil War (Dhofar War) in which I compared between “before and after” the introduction of legitimacy-focused pro-government intervention. The result of the study is inconclusive, but still points towards the relevancy of the causal mechanism connecting between legitimacy-focused pro-government intervention and governmental victory...|$|R

This book tracks the {{evolution}} of the concept of warfare being subjected to higher political aims from Antiquity to the Present, using Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, English and German sources. It tracks the rise, fall, and resurrection of the belief in the Roman and later the medieval and early modern world that warfare was only legitimate if it pursued the higher goal of a just peace, which in the 19 th century gave way to a blinkered concentration on military victory as only war aim. It explains why one school of thought, from Antiquity to the present, emphasised eternal principles of warfare, while others emphasised, in Clausewitz's term, the "changing character of war". It tracks ideas from land warfare to naval warfare to air power and nuclear thinking, but it also stresses great leaps and discontinuities in thinking about strategy. It covers <b>asymmetric</b> <b>wars</b> both {{from the point of view}} of the weaker power seeking to overthrow a stronger power, and from the stronger power dealing with insurgents and other numerically inferior forces.

Although sometimes called midget submarines, these were modified versions of the unmanned torpedoes of the time and are distinct from the torpedo-firing midget submarines used earlier in the war, which were designed to infiltrate shore defenses and return to a mother ship after firing their torpedoes. Although extremely hazardous, these midget submarine attacks were not technically suicide missions, as the earlier midget submarines had escape hatches. Kaitens, however, provided no means of escape.|$|E

40|$|Conflicts – a Geopolitical Approach. Because in {{the entire}} humanity’s written history there have been too few years without {{conflicts}} – these still being present today – we can draw the conclusion that war is the natural state of human beings. Thus, {{in the past few}} decades a true general theory regarding conflicts was developed – the most important contribution belonging to the realist school – which offers, among other things, a strategy regarding the options of solving a crisis situation. Over time, three large causal chains in determining the origin of conflicts have been marked out: the fight for resources, for controlling strategic locations and for a collective identity (national, ethnical, religious etc.). There is a large variety of types of war, the latest additions to the classic ones (global, colonial, national freedom etc.) being the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>wars</b> (terrorism, organised crime etc.) and the preventive ones etc. At the end of the XXth century and the start of the XXIst a series of changes have interfered, moving the focus from interstate conflicts to intrastate ones, from classic motivations (economy, resources, territories etc.) to the identity character based on values and beliefs, from large armies to small groups (guerrilla, individual terrorism etc.). In this paper, as model of an unfolding international crisis we have chosen the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), in which the four phases are clearly identified: pre-crisis, crisis escalation, detente and impact...|$|R
40|$|Alessandro Dal Lago, Federico Rahola Il nuovo mestiere delle armi Legittimità e identità {{professional}}i dei mercenari contemporanei The new arms trade. Contemporary mercenaries’ professional {{legitimacy and}} identity Abstract The frequent hiring of contractors or mercenaries {{is one of}} the main aspects of the general process of privatisation which has affected new conflicts, with a substantial superseding of the state form of war. The paper outlines the consequences of this process, taking as a starting-point the testimonies of private soldiers to whom critical functions of operational support have been delegated in various theatres of warfare. These irregular soldiers have acquired a particular «voice» nowadays; this is first of all due to the greater adherence of conflicts to irregular forms, and also to a creeping demand for social visibility in terms of professional and «moral» legitimization. In the first case, it is above all the predisposition towards facing danger and engaging in «underhand combat», both crucial features of <b>asymmetric</b> <b>wars,</b> that is implicated. In the second case, on the other hand, more profound, grave questions are at issue: vulnerability becomes heroism and exposure to death is confused with the right to kill. On the strength of these premises, mercenaries, irregular actors in an irregular scenario, seem to turn into bearers of new regularities. And their claim for legitimisation becomes the reflection of a more general process, a consequence of the permanent unrest which has characterised global equilibria after 1989 : the normalisation of war in our culture.

40|$|The {{background}} {{of this study}} comes {{from the lack of}} documentation and knowledge about logistics in units, which has the main focus on combat or reconnaissance. The aims of the thesis is to determine and compare the different methods used to provide logistical support to units operating in enemy territory by Sweden and the Czech Republic in todays convention and <b>asymmetric</b> <b>wars.</b> Method of gathering information is through qualitative interviews using a semi-structured interview technique with both Swedish and Czech officers. The topics of the interviews are defined beforehand on an interview template and are based on the Swedish basic view of logistics. The three logistical branches that are covered are; service, movement and healthcare support. The result shows that Sweden and the Czech Republic have largely the same methods in all three branches. Sweden has one method in both service and healthcare support, which the Czech Republic does not have. For service support the method is a “forward operating place” which is similar to a forward operating base but only smaller and within the enemies territory. With healthcare support Sweden has small competent medicalgroups further out in enemy territory. The conclusion is that although Sweden and the Czech Republic have mostly the same logistical methods in supporting units in enemy territory they sometimes use them differently. The Swedish armed forces have a more evolved system for logistical support in enemy territory, which is a consequence {{of the cold war and}} the Swedish decision of not joining NATO, according to the author.

40|$|The {{political}} {{landscape of the}} world is constituted by states of varying degrees of influence and capability. Major powers have immense resources at their disposal, while minor powers are often constrained in terms of structure and material. Thus, for minor powers, engaging in conventional wars against much larger and more powerful states is potentially ruinous to their economies and endangers their political survival. While researchers have explored interstate asymmetric conflicts involving major and middle powers, this project specifically analyzes asymmetric conflicts between minor and major powers, focusing on the former, and the post Cold-war period. This research aims to analyze conditions, highlighted by theories on war, under which minor powers go to war challenging major powers. This research employs multiple theories, thereby establishing an innovative, pluri-theoretical framework. This theoretical framework works well with a mixed-methods approach, a medium-N research design (crisp set methodology in Qualitative Comparative Analysis), and three comparative case studies: Iraq (1990), Moldova (1992) and Serbia (1999). This dissertation finds that by looking through the lenses of multiple theories, one can observe a more nuanced relationship between conditions faced by minor powers in militarized disputes and their decisions to go to war against a major power. First, different combinations of conditions can result in conflict. Second, domestic crisis, not external threat, tends to be of primary concern to minor powers. Third, minor powers enter a war to win based on very modest expectations. Fourth, minor powers of autocratic regime type can also misperceive the situation through anomalous beliefs. The importance of the study stems from the observation that minor powers still fight conventional <b>asymmetric</b> <b>wars,</b> despite growing military capabilities of major powers. Understanding the risks, minor powers gamble, hoping to keep their political benefits. This study enhances our understanding of conditions shaping the occurrence of asymmetric conflict...|$|R
