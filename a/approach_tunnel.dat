40|$|Abstract. When {{a vehicle}} {{equipped}} with an artificial vision system enters or exits a tunnel, the camera may temporarly suffer from reduced visibility, or even get completely blind due to quick changes in enviromental illumination. This paper presents a vision-based system that detects <b>approaching</b> <b>tunnels</b> entrances or exits. The proposed system allows other ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) to act on camera parameters to effectively avoid the tunnel blindness effect. Information regarding <b>approaching</b> <b>tunnel</b> entrance can be helpful for other sensors as well and for sensor fusion systems. In terms of path planning, this system can also inform GNSS-based systems (Global Navigation Satellite System), which usually do not receive any signal in tunnels, and trigger dead reckoning techniques. The proposed system is noticeably fast and therefore well fit {{to be used as}} a background process to support other ADAS applications...|$|R

40|$|A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is {{a private}} data network that uses a non-private data network to carry tra#c between remote sites. An "Intranet VPN" {{establishes}} network layer connectivity between remote Intranet sites by creating an IP overlay network over the non-private network, using various tunneling mechanisms. There are two approaches for establishing such tunnels: a "CPEbased approach" and a "network-based approach". In the first <b>approach,</b> <b>tunnels</b> are established only between the CPE devices, whereas in the second <b>approach</b> <b>tunnels</b> are also established between the routers of the core non-private network. In this paper we {{address the problem of}} determining a CPEbased and a network-based layout of VPN tunnels while taking into account two factors: the cost of the links over which the VPN tunnels are established and the cost of the core routers that serve as end points for the VPN. We define related graph algorithm problems, analyze their complexity, and presents heuristics for solving these problems e#ciently. 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{extensive}} programme {{of research}} {{has been carried out}} at Oxford University on finite element analysis of the interaction between masonry buildings and ground movements induced by tunnelling. The focus has been on the development of a predictive tool for assessing the probable damage to buildings. This paper presents a brief summary of the work, with reference to other more detailed papers. The method is illustrated with reference to the case of the Ramsgate harbour <b>approach</b> <b>tunnel,</b> in which a large diameter tunnel in chalk was excavated at very low cover directly beneath a row of cottages. Both field measurements and analyses reveal that in this case the building responds flexibly, following rather closely the greenfield settlements, which were small. The slight damage to the buildings was also correctly modelled. 1...|$|E
40|$|Congestion {{on urban}} and freeway {{networks}} {{has become a}} major problem, leading to increased travel times and reduced traffic safety. In order to suggest traffic management solutions to improve the transport system efficiency, it is important to capture the travel demand patterns, expressed as origin-destination (OD) matrices, and understand the mechanisms of traffic bottlenecks. The increasing availability of traffic data offers significant opportunities to effectively address these issues. The thesis uses heterogeneous traffic data to improve three important problems. The first problem relates to the dynamic OD estimation problem, which entails significant challenges due to its complexity. The Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm has been commonly used to solve the problem, which can handle any available data that can improve the estimation accuracy. However, it encounters stability and convergence issues. The thesis proposes a general modification of SPSA, called cluster-wise SPSA (c-SPSA), that has more robust performance and finds better solutions. Its efficiency is demonstrated through simulation experiments for a network from Stockholm. The second problem focuses on the development of methods for utilizing heterogeneous traffic data for the analysis and management of freeway work zone and tunnel bottlenecks. Simulation is used as the means to evaluate and optimize various mitigation strategies for each case. The third problem analyzes multimodal impacts due to network disruptions for the case of tunnel bottlenecks, using a data-driven <b>approach.</b> <b>Tunnel</b> congestion is often dealt with temporary closures, which may cause significant disruptions. It is crucial to identify the potential multimodal impacts of such interventions so as to design efficient and proactive mitigation strategies. The thesis shows the benefits of combining multiple data sources to analyze the impacts of temporary tunnel closures for a freeway tunnel in Stockholm. QC 20180129 </p...|$|E
