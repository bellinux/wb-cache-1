5|$|Linnaeus {{entered the}} Växjö Katedralskola in 1724, {{where he studied}} mainly Greek, Hebrew, {{theology}} and mathematics, a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood. In the {{last year at the}} gymnasium, Linnaeus' father visited to ask the professors how his son's studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that the boy would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in Växjö <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> him physiology and botany. Nils accepted this offer.|$|E

He improved shoulder and thigh pads; and was the first to utilize adjustable fiber, rather than cotton. He also had his own helmet color-coding: red for backs and white for ends.|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} biography, Johnson {{disagreed}} with Plutarch's use of biography to praise <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that {{could be viewed as}} tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.|$|E

25|$|Fallen Fairies; or, The Wicked World, is a two-act comic opera, with a {{libretto}} by W. S. Gilbert {{and music}} by Edward German. The story is an operatic adaptation of Gilbert's 1873 blank-verse fairy comedy, The Wicked World. In Fairyland, the fairies are curious about wicked mortals, especially their strange capacity for love. They summon three mortal {{men from the}} world below to observe them <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> the men how to live virtuously. The fairies {{fall in love with}} the mortals, become jealous of each other and behave badly. The men return to Earth, and the fairies realize that love is overrated.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} White's style it is {{important}} note that while he spent almost {{all of his life}} from 1906 to 1925 living in New York City, there is nothing in his photographs to indicate he ever lived there. There were no streets scenes or people in the city, no buildings, bridges, ships or automobiles. Unlike most of his photographer friends, he chose to ignore the very place he lived except for the access it gave him to promote his work <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> others. Although he was pragmatic in his need to earn a living and advance his art, he remained true to his small town roots throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|Science and {{technology}} in China has in recent decades developed rapidly. The Chinese government has placed emphasis through funding, reform, and societal status on science {{and technology}} as a fundamental part of the socio-economic development {{of the country as}} well as for national prestige. China has made rapid advances in areas such as education, infrastructure, high-tech manufacturing, academic publishing, patents and commercial applications and is now in some areas and by some measures a world leader. China is now increasingly targeting indigenous innovation and aims to reform remaining weaknesses. These initiatives are dependent on attracting highly educated overseas Chinese back to China to work in the innovation economy <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> the next generation of Chinese students.|$|E

25|$|As time passed, many mathematicians gravitated towards universities. An {{emphasis}} on free thinking and experimentation {{had begun in}} Britain's oldest universities beginning {{in the seventeenth century}} at Oxford with the scientists Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle, and at Cambridge where Isaac Newton was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics & Physics. Moving into the 19th century, the objective of universities all across Europe evolved from teaching the “regurgitation of knowledge” to “encourag productive thinking.” In 1810, Humboldt convinced the King of Prussia to build a university in Berlin based on Friedrich Schleiermacher’s liberal ideas; the goal was to demonstrate the process of the discovery of knowledge <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> students to “take account of fundamental laws of science in all their thinking.” Thus, seminars and laboratories started to evolve.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, library {{services}} {{have begun to}} evolve {{in order to accommodate}} the needs and desires of local Deaf communities. At the Queens Borough Public Library (QBPL) in New York, the staff implemented new and innovative ideas in order to involve the community and library staff with the Deaf people in their community. The QBPL hired a deaf librarian, Lori Stambler, to train the library staff about Deaf culture, to teach sign language classes for family members and people who are involved with deaf people, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> literacy classes for Deaf patrons. In working with the library, Stambler was able to help the community reach out to its deaf neighbors, and helped other deaf people become more active in their outside community.|$|E
25|$|Florence Nightingale {{pioneered the}} modern {{profession}} of nursing during the Crimean War when she {{set an example}} of compassion, commitment to patient care and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration. The first official nurses' training programme, the Nightingale School for Nurses, was opened in 1860, with the mission of training nurses to work in hospitals, {{to work with the}} poor <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach.</b> Nightingale was instrumental in reforming the nature of the hospital, by improving sanitation standards and changing the image of the hospital from a place the sick would go to die, to an institution devoted to recuperation and healing. She also emphasised the importance of statistical measurement for determining the success rate of a given intervention and pushed for administrative reform at hospitals.|$|E

Like other firms that build capital equipment for industrial corporations, it also supplied consulting, erecting, and training services, such as helping a mining company to design a plant, to build its buildings and set up its machinery, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> the employees how to use and maintain it.|$|E
25|$|A rich man, who is ruined {{after having}} twelve daughters, {{abandons}} {{them in a}} forest. They are adopted by an ogress, Sandhamāra, but escape to Kutāra. After they are found in a banyan tree, emitting a golden aura, the king of Kutāra makes all of them his queens. Sandhamāra enraptures the king, is made his major queen, and persuades him to pluck out the twelve queens’ eyes, leaving only the youngest with sight in one eye. The eleven others become pregnant. Sakka sends down the Bodhisatta Rathasena to be conceived by the youngest. The king has all twelve imprisoned in a cave. When the eleven give birth, they share their babies’ flesh as food. The youngest gives birth to Rathasena. On growing up, Rathasena appeals to Sakka {{to provide them with}} cloth and ornaments, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> him to gamble.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} action to alter village society was the land {{reform of the}} late 1940s and early 1950s, in which the party sent work teams to every village {{to carry out its}} land reform policy. This in itself was an {{unprecedented}} display of administrative and political power. The land reform had several related goals. The work teams were to redistribute some (though not all) land from the wealthier families or land-owning trusts to the poorest segments of the population and so to effect a more equitable distribution of the basic means of production; to overthrow the village elites, who might be expected to oppose the party and its programs; to recruit new village leaders from among those who demonstrated the most commitment to the party's goals; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> everyone {{to think in terms of}} class status rather than kinship group or patron-client ties.|$|E

25|$|Washington's six-point plan {{included}} impartial justice toward Indians; regulated buying of Indian lands; {{promotion of}} commerce; promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Indian society; presidential authority to give presents; and punishing those who violated Indian rights. The government appointed agents, such as Benjamin Hawkins, to live among the Indians <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> them through example and instruction, {{how to live}} like whites. While living among the Choctaw for nearly 30 years, Hawkins married Lavinia Downs, a Choctaw woman. As the people had a matrilineal system of property and hereditary leadership, their children were born into the mother's clan and gained their status from her people. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, a number of Scots-Irish traders lived among the Choctaw and married high-status women. Choctaw chiefs saw these as strategic alliances to build stronger relationships with the Americans in a changing environment that influenced ideas of capital and property. The children of such marriages were Choctaw, first and foremost. Some of the sons were educated in Anglo-American schools and became important interpreters and negotiators for Choctaw-US relations.|$|E
25|$|Hawley began {{teaching}} at the University of Arizona in 1929. By 1933, the University of Arizona was faced with financial difficulties due to the Great Depression, and they asked most of the young faculty to take a year’s leave of absence, which included Hawley. In the fall of 1934, she took a job {{teaching at the}} University of New Mexico in the Department of Anthropology where she made less than the male professors. As a professor Hawley was not considered easy; she expected her students to learn and to think on their own. She taught over 20 courses, several of which were usually taught by men. She was found at one point to be teaching more courses {{than anyone else in}} the anthropology department. Hawley always brought new theoretical approaches as well as her own ideas into focus while teaching. Her students knew they were expected to organize and comprehend data, in addition to become familiar with the bibliographical material. She continued to work <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> students in the field after her retirement.|$|E
25|$|Folk {{dancing is}} a strong {{influence}} {{in many of the}} books. From Girls of the Hamlet Club (1914) and At School with the Roundheads (1915) until The Girls of the Abbey School (1921), it was shown as a fairly easy thing for girls to do, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> each other. By the time of The Abbey Girls Go Back to School (1922) it is apparent that Oxenham herself had come into contact with the English Folk Dance Society and realised that the dances were not so simple after all. The books written from this time for the next six years or so, until Abbey Girls Win Through (1928) depict members of the EFDS hierarchy with affection and almost reverence. It seems that something happened to spoil this relationship, as after 1930 these characters do not appear in the books, and are hardly referred to again, certainly not in such glowing terms. The EFDS makes a brief appearance in An Abbey Champion (1946), but the personnel are no longer named. It may have been as simple as the move to Worthing and the impossibility of maintaining as close a friendship at a distance of some sixty miles, but it has been conjectured that 'Madam' (Helen Kennedy North) and 'The Pixie' (Daisy Caroline Daking) may have objected to the way they were being portrayed. Oxenham never lost the love of folk dancing itself, however, and always shows it as a healthy form of exercise, and a way of lifting oneself out of depression.|$|E
