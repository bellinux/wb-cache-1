5|$|The stave churches {{owe their}} {{longevity}} to architectural innovations that protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most {{important was the}} introduction of massive sills underneath the staves (posts) {{to prevent them from}} rotting. Over the two centuries of stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>science.</b> After the Reformation, however, no new stave churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or because they were too small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.|$|E
5|$|Christian Tuxen Falbe, a Danish marine officer, was in Paris in January 1839 {{on behalf}} of Crown Prince Frederik when Louis Daguerre {{revealed}} the art of daguerreotyping. Falbe informed the Crown Prince of a visit to Daguerre where he had {{seen some of the}} very earliest daguerreotypes, explaining how impressed he had been by the new process and how important {{he thought it would be}} for <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>science</b> in Denmark. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Copenhagen with a camera and a couple of his own daguerreotypes for the Crown Prince who, believing them to be of scientific importance, deposited them with Hans Christian Ørsted, one of Denmark's most prominent scientists. As a result of Ørsted's own interest in photography, the new art took on rapidly: the daguerreotypist Mads Alstrup (1809–76) opened Copenhagen's first photographic studio in 1842; and by 1850 there were over a hundred studios in Copenhagen and many more in the provinces.|$|E
