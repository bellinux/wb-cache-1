5|$|The {{technique}} of using flashbacks {{had been used}} in earlier films—most notably in The Power and the Glory (1933)—but no film was as immersed in this technique as Citizen Kane. The use of the reporter Thompson acts as <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> <b>for</b> the audience, questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.|$|E
5|$|Later, Brunjes {{is found}} murdered and Mulder and Scully watch the shop's {{surveillance}} tape. They {{discover that the}} Golem has features similar to Isaac. Mulder deduces that, because Ariel and Isaac were not officially wed in a Jewish synagogue, Ariel created the Golem out of love to serve as <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> <b>for</b> her late husband. The two agents arrive at the synagogue to find Ariel and the creature exchanging wedding vows. After an intense fight, in which Jacob and Mulder are both wounded, Ariel declares her love for Isaac and returns the creature to dust.|$|E

25|$|Race in {{medicine}} {{is used as}} an approximation for more specific genetic and environmental risk factors. Race is thus partly <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> <b>for</b> environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status that are known to affect health. It is also an imperfect surrogate for ancestral geographic regions and differences in gene frequencies between different ancestral populations and thus differences in genes that can affect health. This can give an approximation of probability for disease or for preferred treatment, although the approximation is less than perfect.|$|E

In nearby New Westminster, the Victoria Day weekend is distinguished by the Hyack Anvil Battery Salute, a tradition created during colonial times as <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> <b>for</b> a 21-gun salute: Gunpowder is placed between two anvils, the top one upturned, and the charge is ignited, hurling the upper anvil into the air. Other celebrations include an evening fireworks show, such as that held at Ashbridge's Bay Beach in {{the east end of}} Toronto, and at Ontario Place, in the same city.|$|E
500|$|The poem {{was criticized}} by Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren in their {{textbook}} Understanding Poetry {{first published in}} 1938. Brooks and Warren {{were two of the}} major contributors to the New Criticism movement, where its supporters opposed using literature as <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> <b>for</b> religion. New Criticism [...] proponents analyzed poetry on its aesthetic formulae and excluded reader's response, the author's intention, historical and cultural contexts, and moralistic bias from their analysis. They attributed the popularity of Trees largely to its religious appeal and believed it was a [...] "stock response that has nothing to do, as such, with poetry", adding: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Susan {{was seen}} {{offering}} to become <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> <b>for</b> her daughter Libby. Following {{a fight with}} the hospital board, Susan became pregnant. However, this causes friction with her son-in-law. Following a fall, Susan loses the baby. Woodburne called the scenes [...] "difficult" [...] to film. Alan Fletcher said the storyline [...] "could have been dreadful in the wrong hands", but he was pleased {{at the way the}} scenes were handled. He added [...] "The notion of a mother being <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> <b>for</b> their daughter is something you can't pretend is not controversial. The writers embraced that and showed how Susan's decision divided the community, and has potential to divide the family". Neighbours timeslot presented difficulties for the storyline. The writers were forced to tone the plot down to comply with guidelines. Woodburne said [...] "Because of the time of day that our show is on—it's on at 6.30 here and day time in the UK—obviously doing something as controversial as surrogacy at that time slot we would be so restricted by censorship". The storyline received mixed reactions from viewers. Woodburne said that people believe Susan is [...] "such a good mother and it's awesome she's prepared to do this for Libby and Dan". Other viewers have said that Susan should not have got involved and that the storyline was ridiculous as Susan is too old. Neighbours executive producer Susan Bower also spoke out about the storyline and said [...] "I've had quite a few letters from people in England who'd heard about it before it was even in the papers in Australia saying they disagree and think it's shocking".|$|E

500|$|Booker {{generated}} controversy on May 12, 2012, when {{he appeared}} on Meet The Press as <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> <b>for</b> the reelection campaign of Barack Obama and made remarks that were critical of that campaign. Booker said that the attacks on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital were [...] "nauseating to me on both sides. It's nauseating to the American public. Enough is enough. Stop attacking private equity. Stop attacking Jeremiah Wright." [...] The comments were subsequently used by the Romney campaign against Obama. Booker made follow-up comments clarifying that he believed Obama's attacks on Romney's record at Bain were legitimate but did not retract his point about attacking private equity in general. Two weeks later, Booker's communications director Anne Torres tendered her resignation, although she maintained it was unrelated to Meet the Press.|$|E
500|$|Despite not {{charting}} {{in mainland}} Europe, and not selling very well initially, The Holy Bible received significant critical acclaim {{when it was}} released in August 1994, and in the years following. Simon Williams of NME saw The Holy Bible as primarily the work of James Dean Bradfield, saying [...] "The Holy Bible isn't elegant, but it is bloody effective". Melody Maker, seeing it as primarily the work of Richey Edwards, described it as [...] "the sound of a group in extremis [...] hurtling towards a private armageddon". Observed Roy Wilkinson in Select: [...] "Amid all the references to coma, carcasses, 'walking abortions' and dying in the summer sits the spectre of Richey, {{holed up in a}} private clinic, having drunk too much, eaten too little and cut himself for reasons varying between dramatic gesture, <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> <b>for</b> screaming out loud and something 'sexual' [...] Let's hope that, with a record of such unsettling, morbid resonance as The Holy Bible, no further gestures are required." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Head, about 70% of {{the season}} was filmed using green screen in the Burnaby warehouse. Unlike many other shows, {{elaborate}} sets were not built for the scenes to be filmed; instead, they are created using CGI technology. Because of the virtual sets, the actors had to visualise what the rooms they were in looked like. To aid them, practical props were placed. The production crew also used rain and wind machines to film scenes set outdoors. However, practical sets were also used throughout the season. The first 20 minutes of [...] "Sanctuary for All" [...] was filmed at the partially decommissioned Riverview Hospital, described by Kindler as a [...] "Swiss Army knife of locations". Elsewhere, the studio parking lot and alleyways of The Bridge Studios provided <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> <b>for</b> several different types of locations, like city streets. A Volvo warehouse provided the filming location for [...] "Instinct". The final filming days were spent on the North Shore Mountains outside Vancouver.|$|E
