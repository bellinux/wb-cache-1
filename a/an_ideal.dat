5|$|<b>An</b> <b>Ideal</b> World, {{authored}} by Weidong Chen {{and illustrated by}} Chao Peng, was originally published in China by the Tian Jin Creator World Comic Company and entitled Seek Self's World. It {{is part of the}} company's Cunren Fairy Tale series. <b>An</b> <b>Ideal</b> World was licensed by the French manhua company Xiao Pan, as well as several other companies, which released it in five volumes entitled Un Monde Idéal ("An Ideal World") from September 15, 2006 to March 14, 2007. Contracts were made that allowed for the French, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Mainland Chinese companies to release the five volumes {{at the same time as}} the original company; French, Chinese, and Korean language editions were published through a partnership with Beijing Total Vision Culture Spreads. <b>An</b> <b>Ideal</b> Worlds global release was meant to aid in the development of the Chinese comic industry and create a new business model, and its release marked the first simultaneous global release for a comic. Xiao Pan also made an omnibus of the original Chinese version available for purchase.|$|E

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>ideal</b> {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E

Rights were acquired from Xiao Pan, rather than Tian Jin Creator World Comic Co. On March 24, 2009, Yen Press released <b>An</b> <b>Ideal</b> World in North America as a single volume; at 176pages long, the volume also includes character sketches, the additional French covers, and information on the author, illustrator, and Chinese publisher.|$|E

5|$|Despite these {{frightening}} character traits, however, Edward's contemporaries {{considered him}} an able, even <b>an</b> <b>ideal,</b> king. Though not loved by his subjects, he was feared and respected.

In religious observance he also fulfilled the expectations of his age: he attended chapel regularly and gave alms generously.|$|E

50|$|In {{abstract}} algebra, <b>a</b> principal <b>ideal</b> domain, or PID, is {{an integral}} domain in which every ideal is principal, i.e., can be generated by a single element.
