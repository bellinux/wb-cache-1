5|$|In {{the centuries}} that {{followed}} the Reformation, many religious denominations came to Glastonbury to establish chapels and meeting houses. For such a relatively small town, Glastonbury has <b>a</b> <b>remarkably</b> diverse history of Christian places of worship, further enriched {{by the fact that}} several of these movements saw break-away factions, typically setting up new meeting places as a result of doctrinal disagreements, leaving behind them a legacy which would require a highly specialized degree of study in order to chart their respective histories and places of practice. Amongst their number have been Puritans/Undetermined Protestants, Quakers, Independents, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists, Salvationists, Plymouth Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses and Pentecostals.|$|E

5|$|Exmoor is an upland area formed almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Devonian and early Carboniferous periods. The name of the geological period and system, 'Devonian', comes from Devon, as rocks of that age were first studied and described here. With {{the exception of a}} suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks forming the lower ground between Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde (within Exmoor National Park but peripheral to the moor itself), all of the solid rocks of Exmoor are assigned to the Exmoor Group, which comprises a mix of gritstones, sandstones, slates, shales, limestone, siltstones and mudstones. Quartz and iron mineralisation can be detected in outcrops and subsoil. The Glenthorne area demonstrates the Trentishoe Member (formerly 'Formation') of the Hangman Sandstone Formation (formerly 'Group'). The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle Devonian sequence of North Devon and Somerset. These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman Grits were mainly formed in desert conditions. As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation, the plateau remains as <b>a</b> <b>remarkably</b> old landform. The bedrock and more recent superficial deposits are covered in part by moorland which is supported by wet, acid soil.|$|E
5|$|He {{made the}} Tigers team in spring {{training}} 1945 before finishing high school and without having played in the minor leagues, but {{sat on the bench}} before making his major league debut in June 1945, just a few weeks after his 18th birthday. He made three relief appearances that month and two more in September after a two-month stint with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League under manager Bucky Harris, and was on the Detroit roster for the team's victory in the 1945 World Series although he did not appear in any games. He had <b>a</b> <b>remarkably</b> unassuming presence; Paul Richards, then a catcher for the Tigers, later recalled occasionally going to his neighborhood drugstore. One day, Pierce went up to him at practice and asked why Richards never talked to him at the store, with Richards replying that he didn't know what Pierce was talking about; Pierce answered that the drugstore was his family's, and Richards slowly realized that Pierce had been the clerk behind the counter each time he went in.|$|E
5|$|Young Filitti made <b>a</b> <b>remarkably</b> early {{entry into}} the {{diplomatic}} corps, and stayed on with the Romanian Legation in France. In this capacity, he purposefully embarrassed PNL Foreign Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu by not sending in all Legation employees to receive him during an official visit. During his return trips to Romania, Filitti was focusing on researching his own family archives, and, in 1910, published the volume Așezământul cultural al mitropolitului Dositei Filitti, de la înființare până azi ("Metropolitan Dositei Filitti's Cultural Foundation, from Its Establishment to the Present Day"). In researching this work, Filitti sought input from the genealogical school in Greece and Macedonia, and from Romanian diplomats working in Istanbul. In a show of perfectionism, Filitti constantly revised the work as new data surfaced, and, in 1936, declared the 1910 edition to be entirely unusable.|$|E

5|$|On 30 June 1513, Henry invaded France, and {{his troops}} {{defeated}} a French army at the Battle of the Spurs – {{a relatively minor}} result, but one which was seized on by the English for propaganda purposes. Soon after, the English took Thérouanne and handed it over to Maximillian; Tournai, a more significant settlement, followed. Henry had led the army personally, complete with large entourage. His absence from the country, however, had prompted his brother-in-law, James IV of Scotland, to invade England {{at the behest of}} Louis. Nevertheless, the English army, overseen by Queen Catherine, decisively defeated the Scots at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513. Among the dead was the Scottish king, thus ending Scotland's brief involvement in the war. These campaigns had given Henry a taste of the military success he so desired. However, despite initial indications, he decided not to pursue a 1514 campaign. He had been supporting Ferdinand and Maximilian financially during the campaign but had received little in return; England's coffers were now empty. With the replacement of Julius by Pope Leo X, who was inclined to negotiate for peace with France, Henry signed his own treaty with Louis: his sister Mary would become Louis' wife, having previously been pledged to the younger Charles, and peace was secured for eight years, <b>a</b> <b>remarkably</b> long time.|$|E

40|$|The {{appearance}} of static magnetism, nanoscopically coexisting with superconductivity, {{is shown to}} be a general feature of optimally electron-doped LFe 1 −xRuxAsO 1 −yFy superconductors (L represents a lanthanide ion) upon isovalent substitution of Fe by Ru. The magnetic ordering temperature TN and the magnitude of the internal field display a domelike dependence on x, peaked around x= 1 / 4, with higher TN values for those materials characterized by a larger z cell coordinate of <b>As.</b> <b>Remarkably,</b> the latter are also those with the highest superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) for x= 0. The reduction of Tc(x) is found to be significant in the x region of the phase diagram where the static magnetism develops. Upon increasing the Ru content superconductivity eventually disappears, but only at x≃ 0. 6...|$|R
