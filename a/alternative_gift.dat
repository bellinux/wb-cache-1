40|$|Despite its {{significant}} role in the society, ownership has received little research attention from social psychology. Understanding ownership as a form of people-object relations has important implications for social cognition, as the relations between people and objects share similar mechanisms with the relations between people and other social entities. Adopting an associative approach to relations, the present research investigates how ownership influences self-object association—mental associations between the owner’s self and the owned objects in the owner’s associative network. It is argued that the formation of self-object associations is gated by the levels of congruence or incongruence between the owner’s active representation of the self and those of the objects. In five experimental studies, the effects of ownership on self-object associations were examined in two types of ownership scenario. In the mere-ownership scenario, participants received an object randomly selected from two <b>alternatives</b> as <b>gift.</b> In the ownership-by-choice scenario, participants were free to choose an object from two <b>alternatives</b> as <b>gift.</b> Objects with either positive or negative valence were included, under the assumption that they are evaluatively congruent or incongruent, respectively, with the self. In the mere-ownership scenario, it was predicted that the formation of self-object associations should be determined passively by pre-existing levels of self-object congruence, assuming the information processing of the alternatives should be at a minimal level. In the ownership-by-choice scenario, it was predicted that the formation of self-object associations should be determined by choice, assuming choice-related information processing creates self-object congruence for the chosen object. Consistent with the predictions, the findings show a moderating effect of object valence on self-object associations in the mere-ownership scenario, in that ownership effects on self-object associations were found for positive objects but not for negative objects. The findings also show an ownership-by-choice effect on self-object association for negative objects, indicating choice-induced changes in the representations of the chosen object. Additional findings indicate that such changes are caused by pre-choice information processing. The findings are discussed in light of the psychology of ownership, choice, and the self...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{emerges in}} the context of recent {{developments}} in the field of charity fundraising. In particular, in order to increase, or simply maintain, fundraising levels charities have had to develop innovative devices which both take charity giving into the spaces in which individuals carry out their daily activities, and provide mechanisms through which they are able to give to charity in their daily lives. This thesis focuses on one such attempt. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate both the practices of constructing alternative giving and the materials which result from this, and the practices of giving and receiving an <b>alternative</b> <b>gift.</b> Alternative giving refers to a fundraising device which is built around a range of gift cards or certificates produced by the charity, each of which represent one particular item or service provided by the charity to its beneficiaries. The cards or certificates are then sold at a price which is designed to mirror the actual cost of providing the item or service represented and are intended to be used by the purchaser as a gift for a friend or relative. As such, alternative giving, as a form of fundraising used by international development charities, raises a number of questions, particularly in terms of how it affects the relationships between individuals and charities, and individuals and the specific beneficiary. Therefore, this thesis draws on literatures around ethics, governmentality, consumption and gift theory to examine the implications of alternative giving for these relationships. Having drawn these literatures into conversations with empirical research based around interviews with charities and those engaging in alternative giving, and a range of textual materials surrounding this, the thesis argues that practices of alternative giving are carried out by ethical subjects who are situated within broad sets of social relations, and which matter to how connections in the charitable act are manifest.

40|$|At the {{intersection}} of food, regulations, and subjective experiences is {{a new way of}} understanding {{the intersection}} of wasted food—a new category of edibility. This project investigates the reasons for, and impacts of, politically-motivated dumpster diving and food reclamation activism in Toronto, Canada. The research incorporates ethnographic participant-observation and interviews with politically-motivated dumpster divers in Toronto, as well as that city’s chapter of Food Not Bombs. The project primarily asks how so much quality food/waste is thrown away and becomes, at times, available to be recovered, reworked, and eaten. My research constitutes a living critique of the hybrid experience of food and waste where the divisions between the two categories are not found in locations (the grocery store or dumpster), but rather in the circulations of actions and meanings that dumpster divers themselves re-invest in discarded edible food products. 	My research objectives are: (1) to document the experience of dumpster divers in Toronto as connected to a broader movement of food/waste activism around the world; (2) to connect this activism to discussions of food safety and food regulations as structuring factors ensuring that edible food is frequently thrown away; (3) to contextualize contemporary food/waste activism within a history of gleaning, and in relation to enclosure acts that have left Canada with no legal protections for gleaners nor recognition of the mutually beneficial social relation between gleaners and farmers; (4) to explore dumpster divers’ work as part of the circulation of urban culture within media networks. Ultimately, I isolate <b>alternative</b> <b>gift</b> economies as central to dumpster divers’ critique of industrial food distribution within the commodity systems of global capitalism. This gifting relation proves to be, in part, a nostalgic view of an idealized past. Nonetheless, the gifting relation becomes an ideal linked to broader anarchist communities that allows divers to create communal subject identities that exist outside of market relations, made global through communication networks of independent and self-published media. By connecting globally, the small-scale, local actions of Food Not Bombs chapters around the world allow surprisingly few individuals to spread a politic with the potential to impact beyond their limited political circles. This project is theoretically situated at the junction of studies of material culture, food and food waste, and new social movements; I connect political experience in local communities to the circulation of food and waste through urban environments and media networks. For the dumpster diver, edibility is delinked from purchase price and is instead imbedded in systems of power and active resistance...|$|E
40|$|This ethnographic network study {{investigates the}} {{processes}} of household disbandment and decision-making of older adults in the Midwestern United States relocating in post-Global Financial Crisis contexts. Interviews, participant observation and document review were conducted with over 75 older adults, their kin and involved professionals moving from January 2009 until May 2012. Stages observed were pre-move planning, move in-process, and post-move adjustment. Study participants moved to Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs), senior housing, condos and homes. This study utilized approaches from cultural and linguistic anthropology to analyze relocation. Discourses of accessibility, mobility and {{activities of daily living}} often frame relocation studies. This dissertation offers gift-giving as the rationale for moving. While gifts may be transfers of property and assets, this dissertation examines a processual gift. Drawing on literatures on relocation and transitions, (Litwak and Longino, 1987; Wiseman, 1980; Turner, 1967; Van Gennep, 1909) and gift-giving (Mauss, 1925 / 1990), this interdisciplinary project primarily finds that 1) older adults view moves in terms of gifts to themselves, their partners and their kin. Evidence includes why moving is considered e. g. disease diagnosis, how these gifts are given, barriers to completing the gift of moving, and related obligations, complications and anxieties. Findings also include 2) the personalization practices of older adults contributing to the “circulation” (Appadurai, 1986) of senior housing as modifiable physical entities, 3) <b>alternatives</b> <b>gifts</b> can be made if relocation is not completed and 4) post-move adjustments. Lastly, this project applies Baltes and Baltes (1990) gerontological theory of strategic functioning, i. e. the Selection, Optimization with Compensation (SOC) model, to living in a less demanding environment suggesting that 5) optimization can be extended to network members. Older adults may also experience optimization by increasing peer and kin contact and preparing for current and future health concerns. By examining how older persons and their support network negotiate moves, this study identifies ways for social workers to support for older adults relocating at a practice and policy level. This study also analyzes the situated impact of the Global Financial Crisis and the intersections of relocation with gift-giving, material culture and kinship for of older Americans...|$|R

(Benjamin Hoff, The Tao of Pooh) Whale Meat I lower my head slightly to avoid eye contact with three little boys who stand a small distance away on the beach. The boys huddle together whispering. In their hands each grips a chunk of fresh whale meat, occasional drops of blood falling to the sand. Once or twice the boys shyly glance towards where our group of women sits in the shadowy entrance of one of the najâ (boat huts). Like myself, these women are not related to the clansmen or boats that caught this whale and have therefore come to the beach to trade for meat. A few women give almost imperceptible nods to encourage the children, but the subtlety of these gestures highlights the fact that none of us may directly attract the children’s attention, for this would be to break an unspoken prohibition of this exchange.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} effects of a person 2 ̆ 7 s own variety-seeking trait on purchases made for others (e. g., gift-giving decisions). Specifically, I explore whether and when an individual 2 ̆ 7 s variety-seeking tendency influences heterogeneity in his/her consideration sets for gifts as well as final gift decisions. For example, everything else being equal, is it the case that high (vs. low) variety-seeking consumers are more likely to consider <b>gift</b> <b>alternatives</b> that come from distinctly different product categories? ^ The theoretical framework underlying the dissertation is based on a synthesis of concepts from Optimal Stimulation Level (OSL) theory and prior research in consumer decision-making. The empirical part of the dissertation consists of four experiments. In the first three experiments, {{the focus is on the}} relationship between the variety-seeking trait and the degree of heterogeneity in gift consideration sets. In these experiments, I also examine the role of two hypothesized moderating variables, (1) regulatory goals, and (2) assortment structure. In the fourth experiment, the research is extended into the influence of the variety-seeking trait on final gift decisions; in this study, participants are given a budget constraint and have the option to choose either a single gift or a set of gifts. ^ The results of the experiments provide reliable evidence that variety-seeking individuals form more heterogeneous consideration sets when buying gifts for others. Further, as hypothesized, the effect of the variety-seeking trait on the composition of gift consideration sets is attenuated in the presence of a prevention (vs. promotion) regulatory focus. However, contrary to expectations, the manner of organization of the assortment of available gift products does not significantly moderate the effect of the variety-seeking trait. The results also show that high (vs. low) variety-seeking consumers even prefer more heterogeneity in their final gift decisions. Specifically, when faced with identical budget constraints, high variety-seekers are more likely to give several moderately-priced, diverse gift items rather than fewer, more expensive products. Implications and future research directions are discussed in regard to variety-seeking consumer behavior and the composition of consideration sets. ...|$|R
40|$|Corinto, a terceira maior cidade do Império Romano, era constituída por muitos povos, culturas, filosofias, religiões, estilos de vida, e reconhecida como a mais helenista das cidades do NT. Era uma cidade cosmopolita mediada pela elite, dominada pelo poder estrangeiro, intelectualmente viva, materialmente próspera e moralmente corrupta. O ideal dos coríntios era o desenvolvimento do indivíduo. A cidade, reconstruída em 44 a C, foi repovoada por veteranos, pessoas de classes mais baixas, libertos vindos de Roma, deserdados romanos, escravos, apartados das comunidades de apoio e das suas tradições que constituíam suas identidades. O sistema dominante era o patronato escravagista. Corinto era submetida a Roma e tinha o latim como língua oficial. Nela se consolidaram os cultos mistéricos. A comunidade cristã de Corinto contrapõe-se ao contexto como sociedade alternativa. Os dons e carismas do Espírito tornam-se a discussão fundamental, {{conforme}} 1 Cor 12 - 14. Paulo põe-se em defesa dos carismas da edificação e submete os demais dons à agape. O Deus Uno e Trino constitui a fundamento dos carismas, que na unidade do seu ser age e distribui a diversidade de carismas e dons, afim de suprir as necessidades do povo de Deus. Os fenômenos carismáticos / pentecostais testemunham as guerras, as migrações em massa, as calamidades, as mudanças sociais, filosóficas e teológicas, os contextos históricos que implicam profundas mudanças no ser e na comunidade humana. O êxtase marca a história ao longo dos séculos, sendo também uma das expressões do catolicismo atual, das igrejas históricas, bem como a diversidade de igrejas pentecostais e enfoques teológicos.

40|$|Three {{months after}} writing my initial article about going green. I have been bombarded with {{information}} on the web, newspapers articles, and even Oprah, and the Philadelphia Eagles about going green. I think {{the best way for}} me to sort this information is to break-it down into three areas home, work, and entertainment/leisure. This week’s article will concentrate on home, and the following two articles will go into more depth for work and leisure activities that will involve going green. The most common of all the energy saving devices that is the easiest and least expensive that all individuals can do is to change from incandescent light bulbs to compact florescent light bulbs as they need replacing. Switching to a compact florescent cost a few dollars more but over the average life-span will save money. For example, by using a 26 -watt compact fluorescent light bulb—equivalent to a 100 -watt incandescent light bulb—users can save up to 59 on energy costs {{over the life of the}} bulb. Many of the home building stores offer 3 -pack bulbs to save money. Another way that a household can help develop wind energy is through PECOWIND program there website is www. exeloncorp. com/ourcompanies/peco/pecores/peco_wind/ and how it works is as follow: How it works is a small additional monthly cost covers the added expense of harvesting the wind power. PECO WIND energy is available for purchase in monthly blocks of 100 kilowatt-hours for 2. 54 per block. For a typical home, one block is equal to about 15 percent of your average monthly electricity usage. You may choose to sign up for Wind Blocks at 2. 54 per block per month or have 100 percent of your actual monthly electric usage charged at 2. 54 cents for each kilowatt-hour used. If you sign up for Blocks and choose more blocks than you use, you will not be billed for more than your actual electric usage. The wind energy you support is delivered directly into the Pennsylvania electric grid, reducing the need for energy from fossil fuel sources like oil and coal. The more customers who sign up, the more Pennsylvania wind energy we can buy. This means cleaner air and water for all of us! Although buying wind does not mean that electricity is being delivered straight from the windmill to your home, it does mean that more of the electricity being put into the grid comes from wind, rather than other generation sources. By participating in PECO WIND you are reducing the need to generate electricity from other sources. PECO can be reached at the following: PECO Energy Customer Service Center 2301 Market Street P. O.

I tuned in Oprah for the final 5 minutes but did mange to obtain the information on her website to help green your home. The following website: [URL] reviews items such as light bulb replacement as mentioned above, Using a reusable water bottle instead of the buying a one-time usage bottle water at the local convenience store. The reusable water bottles can be used washed thoroughly and used again, and eventually they can be recycled with the other plastics. There are many tips and ideas on her site and one of my favorites is bringing your own bag to the grocery store to save the use of paper and plastic bags. On an interesting note I asked an expert what the answer should be when the checkout clerk asks what type of bags do you prefer “paper or plastic?” I was surprised to learn that if you have a choice paper is the preferable bag as it is a renewable resource and does not require petroleum products in its formation. The Philadelphia Eagles website has a great resource to help an individual or family calculate savings by changing to green habits and the amount of CO 2 produced annually is also calculated. There website is [URL] The Philadelphia Eagles even have on their website the ability to purchase a tree in the “Philadelphia Eagles Forest” in Neshaminy State Park [URL] the price for a single tree is 62. 00.
