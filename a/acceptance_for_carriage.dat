40|$|Changes in gay and {{bisexual}} men's connectedness to {{the gay community}} {{are related to the}} declining public visibility of HIV/AIDS and greater <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> homosexuality {{and bisexual}}ity in mainstream society. Little work, however, has focused on perceived <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> subgroups within the gay community or broader society. Using interviews (n = 20) and a survey (n = 202) of gay and bisexual men in a mid-sized Canadian city, we find perceived hierarchies of <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> the various subgroups as well as an age effect wherein middle-aged men perceive the least <b>acceptance</b> <b>for</b> all groups. These differences are linked with the uneven impact of social, political, and institutional changes relevant to gay and bisexual men in Canada...|$|R
