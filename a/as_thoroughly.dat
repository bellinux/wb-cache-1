In 1939 it was transferred to the control of the NKVD (the secret police and precursor of the KGB) on the orders of Lavrentiy Beria, the head of the NKVD. International human rights defenders such as Walter Reich have long recorded the methods by which Soviet psychiatrists in Psikhushka hospitals diagnosed schizophrenia in political dissenters.

500|$|The Battle of Midway {{has often}} been called [...] "the turning point of the Pacific".

500|$|Pei's {{style is}} {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>thoroughly</b> modernist, with significant cubist themes. He {{is known for}} combining traditional architectural elements with progressive designs based on simple geometric patterns. As one critic writes: [...] "Pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method." [...] In 2000, biographer Carter Wiseman called Pei [...] "the most distinguished member of his Late-Modernist generation still in practice". At the same time, Pei himself rejects simple dichotomies of architectural trends. He once said: [...] "The talk about modernism versus post-modernism is unimportant. It's a side issue. An individual building, the style {{in which it is}} going to be designed and built, is not that important. The important thing, really, is the community. How does it affect life?" ...|$|E

He imported fine livestock [...] including thoroughbred horses and cattle [...] to his farm and invested in several commercial enterprises, including several saltworks, which passed to his sons upon his death.

500|$|Due to lack {{of funds}} at the time (the building's initial budget doubled, ending up at $325,000 ($ in modern dollars) {{including}} furnishings), Richardson devoted most of his efforts to the building's exterior. A report from the Times Union states, [...] "There wasn't enough money for Richardson {{to do the job}} <b>as</b> <b>thoroughly</b> as he would have liked. He said in his writing that if there wasn't sufficient money, he'd rather do it right on the outside and leave it to a future generation to finish the interior. The interior was finished by city architects a good 30 years after Richardson built it." [...] The interior was redesigned by Ogden and Gander in 1917. The mayor's office is {{on the first floor of}} the tower, the Council chamber and offices are on the building's second floor, and the city clerk's office is on the second floor of the tower. The mayor's office contains a painting of the city's first mayor, Pieter Schuyler.|$|E
500|$|Series 5 has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. Matt Wales of IGN gave the entire series a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8.5 out of 10, {{saying that it}} [...] "mightn't have been perfect" [...] but rebooted the show [...] "with a burst of creative energy" [...] and [...] "got bold, exciting, witty, smart, home-grown event television back on the small screen". He praised Smith for [...] " [...] with a performance that painted the Doctor <b>as</b> <b>thoroughly</b> alien" [...] and the [...] "effortless" [...] character development of the Doctor, but was more critical {{of the character of}} Amy Pond. He thought that she was [...] "thoroughly watchable" [...] with Gillan's acting abilities and chemistry with Smith, but criticised the character for being [...] "frequently painted in largely two-dimensional strokes that made for a brash, sometimes irritating turn" [...] and the series as a whole for lacking [...] "heart to ground the elaborate sci-fi trimmings". Of the story, he praised Moffat's [...] "beautifully conceived" [...] story arc and the complexities of the narrative.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon did {{not succeed}} in {{defeating}} the Allied army <b>as</b> <b>thoroughly</b> as he wanted, but historians and enthusiasts alike recognize that the original plan provided a significant victory, comparable to other great tactical battles such as Cannae. Some historians suggest that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a [...] "personal Napoleonic one" [...] after the battle. In French history, Austerlitz is acknowledged as an impressive military victory, and in the 19th century, when fascination with the First Empire was at its height, the battle was revered by the likes of Victor Hugo, who [...] "in the depth of [...] thoughts" [...] was hearing the [...] "noise of the heavy cannon rolling towards Austerlitz." [...] In the 2005 bicentennial, however, controversy erupted when neither French President Jacques Chirac nor Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin attended any functions commemorating the battle. On the other hand, some residents of France's overseas departments protested against what they viewed as the [...] "official commemoration of Napoleon," [...] arguing that Austerlitz should not be celebrated since they believed that Napoleon committed genocide against colonial people.|$|E

500|$|From 1784 to 1859 the Parisian [...] (concert pitch) rose {{steadily}} from 820 to 896 cycles per second, thus Gluck's French {{version for}} haute-contre became increasingly impractical. When Adolphe Nourrit sang the {{role at the}} Opéra in 1824 his music was altered. Giacomo Meyerbeer suggested to the French contralto Pauline Viardot that she should perform the role of Orfeo. The composer Hector Berlioz {{was a close friend}} of Viardot and the leading expert in France on the music of Gluck. He knew the score of [...] "the largely forgotten Italian original <b>as</b> <b>thoroughly</b> as he knew the French", and agreed to prepare a version of the opera – in four acts – with Viardot's voice in mind, adapting the role of Orphée for a female alto. In his adaptation, Berlioz used the key scheme of the 1762 Vienna score while incorporating much of the additional music of the 1774 Paris score. He returned to the Italian version only when he considered it to be superior either in terms of music or in terms of the drama. He also restored some of the more subtle orchestration from the Italian version and resisted proposals by Viardot and the theatre's director Léon Carvalho to modernize the orchestration. In the end Camille Saint-Saëns, who was acting as Berlioz's assistant on the project, did some of the minor rewriting which Berlioz had declined to do.|$|E
500|$|From {{the age of}} six and for {{the rest}} of his life Saint-Saëns {{composed}} mélodies, writing more than 140. He regarded his songs <b>as</b> <b>thoroughly</b> and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes ("Persian Songs", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge ("The Red Ash Tree", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: [...] "you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable." [...] Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including [...] "Le lever du soleil sur le Nil" [...] ("Sunrise over the Nile", 1898) and [...] "Hymne à la paix" [...] ("Hymn to Peace", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.|$|E
500|$|The two-colored bolete {{has several}} {{species that are}} similar to it and the {{differences}} are minute in most cases. Boletus sensibilis differs from the two-colored bolete in that it has an immediate bruising reaction and is poisonous, causing stomach upset if ingested, and in some cases a severe allergic reaction. B.miniato-olivaceus has a full yellow stem and slightly lighter cap coloration. It also has a more immediate bruising reaction than the two-colored bolete and the stem is slightly longer in proportion to the cap. B.peckii differs from the two-colored bolete by having a smaller average size, a rose red cap that turns almost brown with age, flesh that is paler in color, and a bitter taste. B.speciosus differs from the two-colored bolete by having a fully reticulated stem, more brilliant colors, and very narrow cylindrical spores. Hortiboletus rubellus subsp. rubens and the two-colored bolete have been found to have almost no difference between them, and they cannot be distinguished by appearance alone. Boletus bicoloroide is very similar to the two-colored bolete, the major differences between them being B.bicoloroide has only been found in Michigan and has larger spores. B.bicoloroide is also slightly larger than the two-colored bolete, around [...] longer in the stem and [...] in the cap. This species has not been <b>as</b> <b>thoroughly</b> researched as the two-colored bolete, thus macrochemical tests, edibility, distribution range, and the spore print color are all unknown.|$|E
