5|$|However, {{fulfilling}} these promises proves {{costly and}} Mayor Quimby denounces Homer for spending the department's yearly budget {{in only a}} month. Homer gets cities all over the United States to pay him to store their excess garbage into an abandoned mine shaft {{on the outskirts of}} Springfield. Despite the budget crisis having ended and the workers receiving their salaries as promised, the garbage builds up underground and eventually erupts, pouring trash all over the town. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> hall meeting, Homer is fired from his post and replaced with Ray Patterson, who declines reinstatement. With no other options left, Quimby moves the entire town five miles down the road.|$|E
5|$|Marge asks Belle {{to close}} down the burlesque house, but Belle refuses, saying that {{the house is a}} part of Springfield. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> meeting, Marge brings up the matter and shows {{pictures}} of several prominent citizens leaving. They form a mob so they can go destroy the burlesque house. The mob arrives at the house and immediately starts destroying things. Bart and Homer arrive and Homer decides to try to convince the mob to stop. He does so by singing a musical number accompanied by Belle and some of her dancers. The town soon joins in and are convinced to let the house stay. However, Marge arrives with a bulldozer, having missed the song. The town announces their intentions to let the house stay, but Marge tries to sing her own song about her views. During the opening lines, she accidentally puts the bulldozer into drive and destroys a wing of the burlesque house. She apologizes profusely and, to pay for the damage, she starts a ventriloquist act at the house.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Vives {{waking up and}} seeing two women in the bed with him. He remembers being seduced by them when he was drunk the night before. Realizing this, he packs his {{belongings}} and leaves the house. He is seen driving a car until it runs out fuel which forces him to travel by foot where he eventually arrives <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>town.</b> In another house, a woman (played by Fabián) wakes up recalling the events of her abusive husband (played by Zamora). She enters a church and says a prayer. Later, Vives is seen hanging out with two men at an outdoor bar when he spots the woman whom he immediately becomes smitten with. Afterwards, he {{and the two men}} are fishing on a boat when Vives sees the woman again. He begins having illusions of him and the woman having a happy life together which drives him insane in his room. That night, the woman finds her husband making love to another woman in a car. Upon discovering this, she leaves the house. At the same time, the town is holding a festival where Vives is celebrating with the townsfolk. The video concludes with him and the woman seeing each other once more and they decide to go out together.|$|E
25|$|A {{minimum of}} 75 {{registered}} voters is required as a quorum {{to hold a}} town meeting and vote on town business. The quorum requirement was reduced from 100 in 2009 because at times, meetings were failing to achieve a quorum.

25|$|An {{example of}} these {{situations}} is Michael Castle, then Representative for Delaware, who ran in 2010 for the Senate seat vacated by Vice President Joe Biden. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> hall meeting, Castle was confronted by constituents who jeered him for insisting that Obama is {{a citizen of the}} United States. Castle, one of the leading Republican moderates in the House, was later defeated by Tea Party-backed Christine O'Donnell in the Republican primary, who herself later lost the general election to Democratic nominee Chris Coons.|$|E

25|$|Miller stated <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> {{hall meeting}} that he {{believed}} East Germany {{was an example of}} a nation taking effective measures to control the flow of people across a border. Miller believes illegal immigration is a “critically important” issue to deal with because of its economic effects on health care, education and employment. Miller wants to secure the border to stop more immigrants from entering America illegally and protect the country from possible terrorist threats. Miller does not believe the millions of immigrants already here illegally should be granted amnesty. Miller supports efforts by states such as Arizona to enforce immigration laws when the federal government will not, and he believes illegal immigrants should be deported when they come into contact with law enforcement officials.|$|E
25|$|This exotic force {{suffered}} from disunity and poor discipline during the preparations {{to invade the}} Nationalist-controlled Inner Mongolian province of Suiyuan in 1936. The majority of them were also poorly armed, with {{only about half of}} them having rifles. They were primarily armed by weapons from the stocks of the defeated Young Marshal, which fell {{into the hands of the}} nearby Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Among the preparations was the setting up of an air arm for the Inner Mongolian Army, but this air force was a purely Japanese one. It consisted of Japanese aircraft flown by Japanese pilots, who did not even bother applying any Mongol insignia to their aircraft and just flew with the original Japanese ones. In total it had 28 planes and were based <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> about forty miles north of Kalgan, the Inner Mongolian capital. They flew several bombing missions against Nationalist targets in an attempt to soften them up for the coming operation.|$|E

25|$|The {{first act}} of armed {{rebellion}} in America against the British Crown was the boarding and {{burning of the}} Revenue Schooner Gaspee in Narragansett Bay on June 10, 1772. The idea of a Continental Congress was first proposed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> meeting in Providence on May 17, 1774. Rhode Island elected the first delegates (Stephen Hopkins and Samuel Ward) to the Continental Congress on June 15, 1774. The Rhode Island General Assembly created the first standing army in the colonies (1,500 men) on April 22, 1775. On June 15, 1775, the first naval engagement of the American Revolution occurred between a Colonial Sloop commanded by Capt. Abraham Whipple and an armed tender of the British Frigate Rose. The tender was chased aground and captured. Later in June, the General Assembly created the first American Navy when it commissioned the Sloops Katy and , armed with 24 guns and commanded by Abraham Whipple, who was promoted to Commodore. Rhode Island was the first Colony to declare independence from Britain on May 4, 1776.|$|E
500|$|Moran {{expressed}} {{support for}} Universal Healthcare and more specifically the public health insurance option, saying <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> hall meeting in Reston, Virginia, in August 2009 that [...] "It could do the most to bring down long-term medical costs and to adequately insure every American." [...] Moran ultimately voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which passed and {{was signed into law}} in March 2010.|$|E
500|$|René Girard has {{interpreted}} the recurrence {{of rain in}} the novel {{as one of the}} purifying rituals the community must undergo in order to wash away the contagion of violence. The fiestas may represent another ritual of purification and also symbolize war. Fiestas are held to honour the General when he arrives <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>town,</b> but at other times, political demonstrations against the General are mistaken for a fiesta. According to Rodríguez Vergara, this shows how [...] "information is manipulated" [...] and [...] "depicts an atmosphere where fiesta and war are synonymous".|$|E

When an agreement had not been reached by March, the MBTA prepared to take the issue to land court. In April 2016, with negotiations between the three parties seemingly at a standstill, the Ayer selectmen voted to begin the eminent domain process, which then went before public vote <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> warrant meeting in May. The public vote had two sections — one for just the access route, and one for the commercial property (the 1967-built USO Building) as well. Because of the delays, the federal funding for the project could have been jeopardized regardless of the vote.|$|E
500|$|Baker ran as {{a social}} liberal (in favor of gay {{marriage}} and abortion rights) but a fiscal conservative, stressing job creation as his primary focus. His campaign centered on [...] "Baker's Dozen", a plan outlining 13 areas of state government reform. Baker's campaign said that his plan, which included consolidation of government, welfare reform, and restructuring of public employee pension and retirement benefits, would lower state expenditures by over $1 billion. Baker, {{a former member of}} the Massachusetts Board of Education, advocated increasing the number of charter, magnet, and alternative schools. Believing that education is a [...] "civil right", he also aimed to close the educational achievement gap among underprivileged and minority students. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> hall meeting in Chilmark, Massachusetts, on the island of Martha's Vineyard, Baker voiced his opposition to the proposed Cape Wind project supported by Governor Deval Patrick.|$|E
500|$|On Sunday, January 16, 2011, {{eight days}} after the shooting, Vietnam War veteran James Eric Fuller, who {{had been shot in}} the knee during the attack, was arrested for disorderly conduct <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> hall meeting. After Tucson Tea Party figure Trent Humphries, who had faulted Giffords for not having enough security, stated that gun control {{measures}} should not be discussed until all those killed in the shooting were buried, Fuller allegedly took a picture of Humphries and shouted, [...] "You're dead." [...] In an interview during the week after the shooting, Fuller had criticized Palin and what he called the [...] "Tea Party crime-syndicate" [...] for promoting a divisive political climate before the attacks. The police then committed him to an undisclosed medical facility to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. A police spokesman stated that the hospital will determine when he will be released. Meanwhile, Humphries said he was worried about Fuller's threat, and the dozens of other angry e-mails he received from people blaming right-wing political rhetoric for contributing to the assassination attempt on Giffords.|$|E

500|$|The Pawnee {{government}} has shut down {{due to a}} budget crisis. When Leslie (Amy Poehler) explains <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> meeting that a family concert featuring children's entertainer Freddy Spaghetti (Brian McCann) must be cancelled due to the shutdown, the citizens are outraged. Leslie visits state auditors Chris (Rob Lowe) and Ben (Adam Scott) seeking {{a way to keep}} the concert, but Ben insists there is simply no money for it. When Leslie goes to city planner Mark (Paul Schneider) to vent about her situation and seek help, she is stunned to learn that he has taken a buyout and plans to join a construction company, partially in response to Ann (Rashida Jones) having broken up with him; she angrily calls him [...] "Mark Brendana-Quits". Meanwhile, Ann is struggling with her redeveloping feelings for her ex-boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt). Later, Ann suggests to Leslie she should hold the concert at Lot 48, as it is not a park and therefore not shut down. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy finally reveal their feelings to each other, but April still rejects him, believing Andy still has feelings for Ann.|$|E
500|$|Rockwell's final {{work was}} the result of four restarts and {{consumed}} two months. [...] According to Scholes, the subject resembles a Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart character in a Frank Capra film. Each version depicted the blue-collar man in casual attire standing up <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> meeting, but each was from a different angle. Earlier versions were troubled by the distraction of multiple subjects and the improper placement and perspective of the subject for the message to be clear. [...] An Arlington, Vermont Rockwell neighbor, Carl Hess, stood as the model for the shy, brave young workman, and another neighbor, Jim Martin, who appeared in each painting in the series, is in the scene. Rockwell's assistant, Gene Pelham, suggested Hess, who had a gas station in town and whose children went to school with the Rockwell children. According to Pelham, Hess [...] "had a noble head". Others in the work were Hess' father Henry (left ear only), Jim Martin (lower right corner), Harry Brown (right [...] top of head and eye only), Robert Benedict, Sr. and Rose Hoyt to the left. Rockwell's own eye is also visible along the left edge. Hess was married at the time and Henry Hess was a German immigrant. Pelham was the owner of the suede jacket. Hess posed for Rockwell eight different times for this work and all other models posed for Rockwell individually.|$|E
500|$|Ned meets up {{with the}} church council to suggest {{promotion}} of creationism. The next day, he and Reverend Lovejoy blackmail Principal Skinner into introducing creationism in the school. Lisa is perturbed by this, and <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> meeting asks everyone {{to make a choice}} between creationism and Darwinism, as there is only one truth. The townspeople vote for creationism, much to her chagrin, and the act of teaching or learning Darwinism and evolution is made illegal. Lisa therefore decides to start holding secret classes for people interested in evolution. However, just as the first lesson is about to begin, she is arrested by Chief Wiggum. She asks why she's being arrested when there are far worse crimes out there, and embarrassed he tells her they only have enough manpower to enforce the last three laws passed, even stating that it's the worst law system there is. Lisa is brought to trial, which is dubbed Lisa Simpson v. God. Representing her is Clarice Drummond, a despised American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawyer, while on God’s (i.e., Ned's) side is Wallace Brady, a beloved, overweight, southern lawyer. The trial does not go smoothly for Lisa, as Professor Frink (called by Clarice) gives ambiguous answers regarding God's existence, while a creationist scientist says that evolution cannot be real, as there is no proof of a [...] "missing link" [...] (depicted in a picture as a savage hominid, holding a rock over his head).|$|E
