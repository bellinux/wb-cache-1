5|$|Starting in 1959, Altgens made {{occasional}} appearances as {{an actor}} and model in motion pictures, television and print advertising. Credited as James Altgens, he played Secretary Lloyd Patterson in the low-budget science fiction thriller Beyond the Time Barrier (1960); his role included the film's final line of dialogue. Altgens' acting career also included a role <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> in Free, White and 21 (1963), and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> (not as himself) in The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1964).|$|E
5|$|However, recent {{documentary}} evidence, a Kabulatipatra dated April 1794 {{bearing the}} sign of Ramprasad Sen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness,</b> clearly proves the fact that Ramprasad Sen was alive in 1794. The said Kabulatipatra has been preserved and displayed at Sabarna Sangrahashala in Barisha.|$|E

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> {{to the murder}} of a girl by white supremacists. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety seeking strength to go forth <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness.</b> The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as stigmata. It also features a Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint. The Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, who had used the song in their commercial. The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.|$|E
5|$|After King Henry's {{death in}} 1135, Basset was not {{employed}} as a royal official, either as a justice or as a sheriff. He appears once <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> to a charter of King Stephen's in 1136, but the authenticity of this document has been questioned. He had built a castle in Normandy at Montreuil-au-Houlme, but Basset did not have possession of it in 1136, when it was held against Stephen's opponents by William de Montpincon.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, Pechersky {{returned}} to Rostov-on-Don, where he lived before the war, and started working as administrator in an Operetta theater. The mass murder of Jews at the Sobibor death camp {{became part of the}} charges against leading Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials. The International Tribunal at Nuremberg wanted to call Pechersky <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness,</b> but the Soviet government wouldn't allow him to travel to Germany to testify.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{creation}} of the new archdiocese, Jaenberht retained his position as the senior cleric in the land, with Hygeberht conceding his precedence. When Jaenberht died in 792, he was replaced by Æthelheard, who was consecrated by Hygeberht, now senior in his turn. Subsequently Æthelheard appears <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> on charters and presides at synods without Hygeberht, so it appears that Offa continued to respect Canterbury's authority.|$|E
5|$|During {{this long}} period {{the number of}} the Indians was greatly reduced. Their blood became so mixed that in many of them Indian traits were obliterated. They had no {{internal}} government, and they lived a sort of shiftless life, hunting, fishing, cultivating the ground 'Indian fashion' <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> called it, and often leaving for long periods and working in some menial capacity for the whites.|$|E
5|$|Griesbach {{produced}} {{a list of}} nine manuscripts which were to be assigned to the Alexandrian text: C, L, K, 1, 13, 33, 69, 106, and 118. Codex Vaticanus was not in this list. In the second (1796) edition of his Greek NT, Griesbach added Codex Vaticanus <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> to the Alexandrian text in Mark, Luke, and John. He still believed {{the first half of}} Matthew represented the Western text-type.|$|E

5|$|The Anthology of Pliny's Natural History is an {{epitome of}} Pliny the Elder's Natural History {{dedicated}} to King Henry II of England. It is of some {{importance in the}} transmission of Pliny's ideas to medieval Europe, {{although it has been}} shown to be less important <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> to Pliny's text than once thought.|$|E
5|$|When the Braose family fled England in 1208, with Giles {{going to}} France and William going to Ireland, Mapenor left also, going to Ireland where he appears <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> on {{documents}} of William de Braose's. It is unclear {{when he returned}} to England, but by January 1212 Mapenor was once more in Hereford.|$|E
5|$|A {{friend of}} Edward, Prince of Wales for over 20 years, in 1891 he {{attended}} a house party at Tranby Croft, Yorkshire, where he {{took part in a}} game of baccarat {{at the behest of the}} prince. During the course of two nights' play he was accused of cheating, which he denied vehemently. After news of the affair leaked out, he sued five members of the host family for slander; the Prince of Wales was called <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness.</b> The case was a public spectacle, widely reported in the UK and abroad, but the judgement went against Gordon-Cumming and he was ostracised from polite society.|$|E

5|$|Apollo and {{his mentor}} Kristoph Gavin, {{an old friend}} of Phoenix's, are called to {{represent}} him against charges of murdering one of his customers in a rigged game of poker. In the middle of his testimony, Phoenix inadvertently names Kristoph <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness,</b> {{and with the help of}} a falsified piece of evidence provided by Trucy, exposes him as the real murderer. Impressed by Apollo's performance, he invites him to start his own practice out of Trucy's talent agency.|$|E
5|$|Around 1657, Ruisdael {{moved to}} Amsterdam, by then a prosperous city which {{was likely to}} have offered a bigger market for his work. His fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to Amsterdam and found a market there. On June 17, 1657 he was baptized in Ankeveen, near Naarden. Ruisdael {{lived and worked in}} Amsterdam {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1668, his name appears <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> to the {{marriage}} of Meindert Hobbema, his only registered pupil, a painter whose works have been confused with Ruisdael's own.|$|E
5|$|Bokassa also {{hunted down}} Banza's close associates, such as Joseph Kallot, Faustin Marigot and Polycarpe Gbaguili. Kallot and Marigot died {{in prison in}} June 1969 and April 1971, respectively. With the {{exception}} of Gbaguili, who remained in prison until {{the downfall of the}} Bokassa regime on 20 September 1979, the other associates were released months after their arrest. Gbaguili served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> in Bokassa's criminal trials for treason, murder, cannibalism and embezzlement during the 1980s, explaining in detail the numerous crimes and human rights violations the former dictator had completed.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to his work {{as part of the}} NER he was seventeenth president of the Institution of Civil Engineers from 1873 to 1875, served on the Royal Commission for the Water-supply of London (1867-69), and was successful and respected <b>as</b> <b>an</b> expert <b>witness</b> and consultant engineer, from his work <b>as</b> <b>a</b> parliamentary <b>witness</b> he earned the nickname 'Honest Tom'.|$|R
5|$|Empress Maud, {{the only}} {{legitimate}} living child of Henry I, landed in England in 1139 {{in an attempt}} to press her claim to the monarchy. She was soon besieged by King Stephen's forces at Arundel castle. Stephen allowed Maud a safe conduct to Bristol and provided her with an escort, which included William de Braose, suggesting that he was an adherent of King Stephen. William was present <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> when three charters were issued by Stephen at Lewes dated to the years 1148–53, therefore it appears that he remained loyal to the king until the Treaty of Wallingford ended the hostilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Sir Charles Mordaunt, a British Member of Parliament, {{threatened}} to name Edward as co-respondent in his divorce suit. Ultimately, {{he did not}} do so but Edward was called <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> in the case in early 1870. It was shown that Edward had visited the Mordaunts' house while Sir Charles was away sitting in the House of Commons. Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion of impropriety was damaging.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Foliot, the brothers Gerard, a canon of Lincoln, and Martin, treasurer of Lincoln, were also Chesney's nephews. He {{may also have}} been related to Fulk de Chesney, another canon at Lincoln. Chesney helped to further the career of Richard Barre, who became a writer and a royal judge and first appears in the record <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> to some of Chesney's documents during 1160–1164. Geoffrey of Monmouth's last work, the Vita Merlini, was dedicated to Chesney. Foliot owned a copy of the Digest, part of the Corpus iuris civilis, that had originally been glossed for Chesney.|$|E
