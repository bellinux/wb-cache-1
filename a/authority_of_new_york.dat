5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were {{announced}} by the Port <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and New Jersey. Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and New Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight line connection from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies.|$|E

5|$|In a {{controversial}} move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and New Jersey to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region's Core rail project to highway projects.

5|$|In 1954, Regional Plan Association {{advocated}} for {{an extension of}} the BMT Canarsie Line from Eighth Avenue to Jersey City under the Hudson River. The tunnel under the Hudson would have cost $40,000,000. The extension would have provided access to commuter railroads in New Jersey as most lines converged there, and the lines that didn't would be rerouted to stop there. The RPA also suggested having a parking lot there for access from the Pulaski Skyway and the New Jersey Turnpike. It was suggested that either the New York City Transit Authority, the Port <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and New Jersey or the Bi-State Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission would do the construction.|$|E
5|$|In March 2001, the Port <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and New Jersey {{implemented}} a discount on regular toll fees during off-peak hours for those vehicles paying electronically with an EZ Pass issued in New York State.

5|$|One World Trade Center is principally {{owned by}} the Port <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and New Jersey. Around 5percent equity of the {{building}} was sold to the Durst Organization, a private real estate company, in exchange for an investment of at least $100million. The Durst Organization assisted in supervising the building's construction, and manages the building for the Port Authority, having responsibility for leasing, property management, and tenant installations. By September 2012, around 55percent of the building's floor space had been leased, but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014; the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8percent by November 2014.|$|E
5|$|Port Newark is {{the part}} of Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal and the largest cargo {{facility}} in the Port of New York and New Jersey.

The Port moved over $100 billion in goods in 2003, making it the 15th busiest in the world at the time, but was the number one container port as recently as 1985. Plans are underway for billions of dollars of improvements – larger cranes, bigger railyard facilities, deeper channels, and expanded wharves.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{initially}} {{failed to}} attract the expected clientele. During the early years, various governmental organizations became key tenants of the World Trade Center, such as the State of New York. In the 1980s, the city's perilous financial condition eased, after which {{an increasing number of}} private companies—mostly financial firms related to Wall Street—became tenants. During the 1990s, approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex, including financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, Aon Corporation, and Salomon Brothers. The basement concourse of the World Trade Center included The Mall at the World Trade Center, and a PATH station. The North Tower became the main corporate headquarters of Cantor Fitzgerald, and it also became the headquarters of the Port <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|The nearby Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel {{is being}} planned to connect northeastern New Jersey and Long Island, with portals in Brooklyn and in Jersey City, New Jersey. The tunnel is being planned {{as a result}} of {{passenger}} and commuter traffic frequencies being at capacity and precluding freight movements. As early as the 1920s, this tunnel had been planned to cross the entire New York Harbor rather than just the Narrows. As a precursor to the planned project, which could cost up to $11 billion to build, the Port <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and New Jersey (PANYNJ) compiled a Tier 1 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in November 2014.|$|E
5|$|A Master Plan {{adopted in}} 2000 {{called for the}} port to be {{transformed}} into a container port, which led to the purchase of the largest harbor crane in the state. In 2002, the Port District Commission took the lead in the development of Albany's Riverfront Park in the Corning Preserve as part of a development to enhance Albany's access to the river. The port helped in financing the project and in the construction of two bulkheads which have seasonal floating docks attached. In a 2005 audit, the Office of the State Comptroller questioned the port's involvement in the construction and financing. Two issues raised were the port district's lack of authority to build docks for non-commercial use and that the port would receive no income for facilities it was financing. The port received $3.3million in 2002 to upgrade and {{become a member of the}} Inland Distribution Network, a select group of ports that are used as satellite locations for the distribution of container cargo from the Port <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and New Jersey, resulting in less congestion at downstate ports and highways.|$|E

5000|$|On January 31, 2012, Yerushalmi's legal group, the American Freedom Law Center (AFLC) filed {{a request}} for a {{preliminary}} injunction in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> against the Metropolitan Transportation <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> the State <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> (MTA), seeking to have the MTA run an AFDI [...] "pro-Israel / anti-Jihad" [...] bus advertisement. On Friday, July 20, 2012, federal judge Paul Engelmayer ruled that the MTA violated the First Amendment rights of AFDI when it rejected their advertisement. In July 2012, Engelmayer issued a final ruling, striking down the Metropolitan Transportation <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York’s</b> (MTA) [...] "no-demeaning speech" [...] restriction and ordering the MTA to display the advertisement. The judge’s order converted an earlier preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction, and it declared that the MTA speech regulation violated the First Amendment right to free speech. The judge also awarded FDI nominal damages. Yerushalmi's subsequent effort to get advertisements critical of Islam to run on MTA property failed, after the agency changed its ad policy to prohibit bigoted material, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{scientists}} {{predict that}} extreme weather events will increase in intensity and frequency {{as the global}} climate changes. Extreme weather such as Hurricane Sandy has shown the importance of planning for climate change adaptation, but few public transit agencies have developed their own adaptation plans. As demonstrated by Hurricane Sandy’s effect on transportation infrastructure in the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City region, {{it is important for}} city officials to plan for extreme weather events and also for protecting infrastructure from the risk of flooding. The public transit agencies of nine cities were studied with a qualitative evaluation to determine the strength of their climate change planning documents. Only four transit agencies had some type of climate change document, and none of the agencies have official climate change plans. Overall, transit agencies are not developing clear goals for climate change adaptation. Possible reasons for this are a lack of funding and the perception of a lack of urgency. The Metropolitan Transportation <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York’s</b> sustainability report emerged as a model for other agencies’ adaptation planning efforts due to its level of detail...|$|R
5|$|A less {{contentious}} standoff {{also occurred}} when settlers sent by William Penn sought to establish {{what is now}} Burlington, New Jersey.

This situation was permanently resolved in 1680 when York renounced in favor of Penn his remaining claims to West Jersey.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} of the World Trade Center, of which the Twin Towers (One and Two World Trade Center) were the centerpieces, was conceived as an urban renewal project and spearheaded by David Rockefeller. The project was intended to help revitalize Lower Manhattan. The project was planned by the Port <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and New Jersey, which hired architect Minoru Yamasaki. Yamasaki {{came up with the}} idea of building twin towers. After extensive negotiations, the New Jersey and New York State governments, which supervise the Port Authority, consented to the {{construction of}} the World Trade Center at the Radio Row site, located in the lower-west area of Manhattan. To satisfy the New Jersey government, the Port Authority agreed to buy the bankrupt Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (renamed to Port Authority Trans-Hudson), which transported commuters from New Jersey to Lower Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|The damaged {{section of}} the Pentagon was rebuilt and {{occupied}} {{within a year of}} the attacks.

During {{the reconstruction of the}} station, the original subway platforms were demolished and temporary platforms were erected in the center trackways while the new platforms and mezzanine were built. During off-peak hours, trains utilized a single track. The AirTrain structure around the station was completed in 2001, and the AirTrain station opened on December 17, 2003, at which time the shuttle bus was discontinued. The transfer was popular, with 4 million people transferring between the subway and the AirTrain from 2003 to 2007. The AirTrain was designed with the same track height and track gauge as those of the subway, to facilitate a future extension of the subway over the AirTrain system.|$|E
