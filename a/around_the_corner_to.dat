Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy.

5|$|Miller's {{season ended}} early {{after he was}} called back for army service and he was {{stationed}} in the northern suburb of Broadmeadows. However, he had disciplinary problems and disliked taking orders from his officers, whom he often felt were inferior to him. He left the Militia on 8 November 1941. Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as stokers. When the navy would not take his friend, Miller tore up his paperwork in protest, left the recruiting office, and walked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) recruiting office. He was {{acutely aware of the}} risks, as many of his playing colleagues had been killed, injured or captured. The threat of combat increased when the Pacific Theatre of World War II opened on 7 December 1941 with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The 194142 cricket season was cancelled and many cricket and football grounds were converted into army bases.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} {{video for}} the remix version produced by HarDrum was {{included on the}} CD format of the single; it included unreleased footage that did not appear on the original version, featuring different angle shots of the girls, expressions from the public's faces and the band performing erratically. It also included various scenes of people on-set helping with the music video's production, and one holding the wired fence. In July and September 2015, the group uploaded two teaser videos of a remix version produced by Fly Dream in order to commemorate the single's 15th anniversary on 19 December that same year; by then, it still remained unreleased. On 7 August 2016, one year since the two trailers, t.A.T.u. uploaded an HD version of the video with new unreleased scenes and extended footage. Lasting five minutes and 37 seconds, it showed an extended cut of the girls arguing next to the brick wall and walking <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> find the vast Khodynka Field with a clearer cityscape in the distance by the fourth minute. The ending of the video portrays t.A.T.u. in the distance, similar to the original video.|$|E

25|$|On 4 December 2008 Karen Matthews and Michael Donovan {{were found}} guilty of kidnapping, false {{imprisonment}} and perverting the course of justice. The plan had been for Donovan to release Shannon at Dewsbury Market, drive <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> 'discover her' then take her to a police station and claim the £50,000 reward. This would be split between Donovan and Karen Matthews. On 23 January 2009, both were sentenced to eight years in prison by Mr Justice McCombe.|$|E
500|$|The {{filming of}} the episode's ending caused a [...] "huge divide among the writing {{staff and the}} {{director}} and the cast". Carell, Kwapis, and the actors wanted the moment when Pam and Jim kiss to [...] "follow the characters and the emotion of the moment" [...] by having the action captured in full by the show's cameramen. The writing staff, on the other hand, wanted Pam and Jim's moment to be private and only heard via the mics; Daniels explained, [...] "The writing staff was itching to do something kind of weird [...] and have it be a private moment that the doc crew didn't know {{was going to happen}} and so only heard on their mics and came running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> film." [...] Eventually, both versions were filmed, but the former was broadcast. The alternate version has never been released.|$|E
500|$|Musial was {{assigned}} to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm. He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability. During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading [...]379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher. This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as [...] "a kid peeking <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> see if the cops were coming". According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, [...] "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers {{think of him as a}} coiled rattlesnake." [...] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.|$|E

5000|$|The {{construction}} of the famous dome of the Ahsan Mazil, {{which is at the}} center of the palace, took a lot tedious planning. The square room on the ground floor was built with a round shape and brickworks were done <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners.</b> <b>To</b> give <b>the</b> room an octagonal shape, squinches were given <b>around</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>corners.</b> <b>The</b> eight <b>corners</b> of <b>the</b> octagon was slanted gradually to make the dome look like the bud of a lotus ( [...] kumud kali). The peak of this dome is 27.13 m above the ground.Ahsan Manzil was severely damaged during the tornado that occurred on 7 April 1888.the western block of Andermahal was completely demolished and later it was entirely rebuilt. The present day dome, which is situated on the top, was built during the time of reconstruction. This place was also damaged during the earthquake of 1897 but Nawab Khwaja Ahsanullah repaired the whole place again.|$|R
2500|$|On LL's response, To da Break of Dawn in 1990, he dissed Kool Moe Dee (whose {{feud with}} LL {{was far more}} publicized) as well as MC Hammer. He then devoted the third verse of the song to dissing Ice-T, mocking his rap ability ("take your rhymes <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> rap rehab"), his {{background}} ("before you rapped, you was a downtown car thief"), and his style ("a brother with a perm deserves to get burned"). He also suggested {{that the success of}} Power was due to the appearance of Ice-T's girlfriend Darlene on the album cover. Ice-T appeared to have ignored the insults and he had also defended LL Cool J after his arrest in the song [...] "Freedom of Speech".|$|E
2500|$|Evans later {{asserted}} that the tow truck was a ruse. He claimed police snipers were already {{in the area and}} targeting him and his followers for assassination. These snipers fired on Evans and his followers first, he said. He claimed he was nowhere near the tow truck when shots were fired. [...] Instead, he said, he had left his home and was walking on west on Auburndale Avenue toward the Lakeview Tavern (a few feet <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> the south) when he heard shots [...] "coming {{from the end of the}} street". A man ran past him. Evans said he ran north to Beulah in time to see the tow truck operator running toward E. 123rd Street. He said he heard submachine gun fire, and said he assumed this was the blast which killed Leroy Mansfield Williams. Evans admitted that he fired several shots from his carbine, but the weapon then jammed. He fled into the home at 1384 Lakeview Road.|$|E
2500|$|Styling was all new for the 1968 Fairlane/Torino, {{and it was}} {{drastically}} {{changed from}} the 1967 models. The new intermediate had grown in size and weight, and a new fastback model was added. The front fascia featured a full width recessed grille, with horizontal quad headlights placed at the outer edges. Horizontal dividing bars were featured in the grille depending on the model. Parking lights were placed at {{the outer edge of}} the front fenders and wrapped <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> also act as side marker lights (a new requirement in 1968). The body sides were smooth with one horizontal body crease running just below the beltline from front to back. The taillights were rectangular in shape and vertically situated in the rear panel above [...] rear bumper. Reverse lights were located in the middle of the taillights, and small side marker lights were located on the rear edge of the quarter panel. Fastback models, which Ford called [...] "SportsRoof," [...] featured a slightly concaved rear taillight panel unique to that body style. The new SportsRoof body style featured a gently sloped long roof line that extended to the edge of the trunk lid. This new fastback body style gave the Fairlane and the Torino excellent aerodynamics that would later prove to be advantageous on the race track.|$|E
5000|$|Ernst Lubitsch ( [...] ; January 29, 1892November 30, 1947) was a German American film director, producer, writer, and actor.

5000|$|According to writer Spike Feresten, Jerry Seinfeld {{and several}} members of the {{production}} team went to Soup Kitchen International for lunch weeks after [...] "The Soup Nazi" [...] aired.

50|$|The {{body was}} similar to 2+2 coupes {{produced}} by many Italian design houses, with simple, clean lines instead of the more pronounced lines of the 1961 X concept car.

The swage line started midway along the door, continued to the rear flanks and then raised up before flowing <b>around</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>corners</b> <b>to</b> form <b>the</b> top rear edge of the boot. Unlike other Toyota models of the time, horizontal rear indicators were used as part of the emerging trend in car design.|$|R
