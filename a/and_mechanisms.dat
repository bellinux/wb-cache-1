5|$|Ecological {{evolutionary}} {{developmental biology}} (eco-evo-devo) integrates research from developmental biology and ecology {{to examine their}} relationship with evolutionary theory.

5|$|The {{extended}} evolutionary synthesis (EES) is {{an extension}} of the Modern Synthesis of evolution which revisits the relative importance of different factors at play in evolutionary theory.

5|$|Research {{is being}} {{conducted}} on many {{different approaches to}} prevent Huntington's disease or slow its progression. Disease-modifying strategies can be broadly grouped into three categories: reducing {{the level of the}} mutant huntingtin protein (including gene splicing and gene silencing); approaches aimed at improving neuronal survival by reducing the harm caused by the protein to specific cellular pathways <b>and</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (including protein homeostasis and histone deacetylase inhibition); and strategies to replace lost neurons. In addition, novel therapies to improve brain functioning are under development; these seek to produce symptomatic rather than disease-modifying therapies, and include phosphodiesterase inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{problems}} that have affected the F-FDTL throughout its existence were caused by the process used to establish the force. A key flaw in this process was that FALINTIL's high command was allowed to select candidates for the military from members of FALINTIL without external oversight. As a result, the selection was conducted, to a large degree, on the basis of applicants' political allegiance. This led to many FALINTIL veterans feeling that they had been unfairly excluded from the military and reduced the force's public standing. Furthermore, UNTAET failed to establish adequate foundations for the East Timorese security sector by developing legislative and planning documents, administrative support arrangements <b>and</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the democratic control of the military. These omissions remained uncorrected after East Timor achieved independence on 20 May 2002.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} rates <b>and</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{are affected}} {{by a variety of}} factors including the strength of the surface-adparticle bond, orientation of the surface lattice, attraction and repulsion between surface species and chemical potential gradients. It is an important concept in surface phase formation, epitaxial growth, heterogeneous catalysis, and other topics in surface science. As such, the principles of surface diffusion are critical for the chemical production and semiconductor industries. Real-world applications relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters, integrated circuits used in electronic devices, and silver halide salts used in photographic film.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth was {{purchased}} from the American Smelting and Refining Company {{of the highest}} purity that it could produce. It was sent to Hanford, where it was put in aluminum cans, and placed inside a reactor for 100 days. The canned slugs then shipped to Unit IV, where they were bathed in hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the aluminum. This formed an aluminum chloride solution that was disposed of, as it was highly radioactive due to iron and copper in the aluminum alloy. The bismuth slugs were then dissolved in aqua regia. This was too weak for electroplating the polonium, so the nitric acid was removed, and then the polonium deposited on bismuth by adding powdered bismuth. This resulted in a 100–1 concentration. This could then be repeated by dissolving in aqua regia again to achieve a 1000–1 concentration. This was again dissolved, and the polonium electroplated on platinum foils. The main problem with the process was that it required glass-lined containers due to the aqua regia, <b>and</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for safe handling of the radioactive material. The Dayton Project explored alternative purification methods that {{were found to be}} workable, but less efficient or safe.|$|E

40|$|Evidence <b>and</b> {{explanatory}} <b>mechanism</b> {{are central}} to scientific practices. Using such information could also inform decisions about issues in which science can play some role, from policy issues like climate change to personal issues like vaccination. While research suggests that people {{tend to focus on}} non-science considerations when making science-related decisions, there is also evidence that people can reason very productively with evidence <b>and</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This study examines how the goals participants pursue when reading a science report influences how they attend to information about causal <b>mechanism</b> <b>and</b> evidence. Two hundred and seventeen high school students were asked either to evaluate the truthof a scientific claim, to make a personal decision based on the claim, or to make a social policy ￼decision based on the claim using an online task-based survey. All three groups of participants attended to evidence <b>and</b> <b>mechanism,</b> but participants with different goals requested different types of information and were influenced by evidence <b>and</b> <b>mechanism</b> for different reasons.
