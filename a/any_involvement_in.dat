5|$|Hunt {{sustained}} a foot {{injury in the}} Broncos Round 15 match and was sidelined for eight weeks. While out injured, {{early in the morning}} on 30 July 2006, Hunt was at the scene of a fight outside a Brisbane night club in Brisbane's CBD. The media, notably Channel 7 and Channel 10, alleged Hunt was the instigator of the incident, claiming he squirted water on a woman. The Broncos denied he had <b>any</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> the incident although a woman gave his name to police. Hunt also denied involvement, insisting he was merely a bystander.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{question}} Wilczek, who denies <b>any</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> the murder. Scully initially doubts Wilczek's involvement, but {{finds that}} his voice matches a speaking clock Drake received before his death; Lamana {{sets out to}} arrest him. Meanwhile, Wilczek fails to access the COS from his home computer. Concerned, he travels to Eurisko's headquarters, followed by Lamana. There, he is still unable to access the COS, but discovers that it has learned to talk. Lamana arrives, but is killed when the COS causes his elevator to crash.|$|E
5|$|Although the Colorados had {{defected}} to the Flores insurgency, {{the national guard}} continued to support the fusionist government. Blanco partisans filled its depleted ranks. They also replaced army officers who had deserted to Flores. The Blancos received aid from several Argentine Federalists who joined their cause. As in Uruguay, Argentina had long been a battleground of rival parties, and Bartolomé Mitre's victory at Pavón in 1861 had signaled the triumph of his Unitarian Party over the Federal Party led by Justo José de Urquiza. Mitre denied <b>any</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> the Flores rebellion, even though his complicity was widely known and taken for granted.|$|E

5|$|As the match-fixing scandal took centrestage, former player Manoj Prabhakar accused Kapil Dev {{of trying}} to bribe him in 1994 during a tournament in Sri Lanka. Under severe {{pressure}} from politicians and fans, Kapil Dev resigned as coach in September 2000, after having spent {{less than one year}} as the team coach. The reports of CBI (India's premier investigating agency) and K. Madhavan (appointed by BCCI to investigate match-fixing allegations) in November 2000 exonerated Kapil Dev of <b>any</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> match-fixing. India's performance in the coaching stint of Kapil Dev was below-par, winning just one Test match (out of 8 played) and 9 ODIs (out of 25 played).|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{survey the}} {{damage in the}} city, which {{appears to have been}} caused by an {{elephant}} even though none was seen. Ed Meecham, an animal handler at the zoo, recounts how he came to the elephant's locked cage to find it empty. His boss, Willa Ambrose, tells the agents that the zoo is in danger of closing due to other animal disappearances. She blames the zoo's decline on an animal rights group which is known to free captive animals. The group's leader, Kyle Lang, denies <b>any</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> the elephant's release. Lang tells them that Ambrose is being sued by the Malawi government over a lowland gorilla she took from their country ten years prior.|$|E
5|$|Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda. The United States {{responded by}} {{launching}} the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaeda. Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded {{the powers of}} law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks. Although al-Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, initially denied <b>any</b> <b>involvement,</b> <b>in</b> 2004 he {{claimed responsibility for the}} attacks. Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq as motives. After evading capture for almost a decade, Osama bin Laden was located and killed by SEAL Team Six of the U.S. Navy in May 2011.|$|E

5|$|The issue {{came back}} to life in February of the {{following}} year when, two days before Flores' birthday, Padilla reported being kidnapped and stabbed by two gunmen. Padilla received 57 shallow slashes from a dagger which did not put his life in danger, but he could have died from blood loss. Padilla blamed Flores for the stabbing and for an earlier attack {{in which he was}} allegedly beaten by men who warned him against criticizing the church leader. A church spokesman denied that the church or Flores had <b>any</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> the attack and suggested that Padilla may have orchestrated the attack {{in a desperate attempt to}} authenticate his previous charges against the church.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{remained}} aloof {{from the}} Italian conflict, however. Over {{the spring and}} summer of 307AD, he had left Gaul for Britain to avoid <b>any</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> the Italian turmoil; now, instead of giving Maxentius military aid, he sent his troops against Germanic tribes along the Rhine. In 308AD, he raided the territory of the Bructeri, and made a bridge across the Rhine at Colonia Agrippinensium (Cologne). In 310AD, he marched to the northern Rhine and fought the Franks. When not campaigning, he toured his lands advertising his benevolence, and supporting the economy and the arts. His refusal to participate in the war increased his popularity among his people, and strengthened his power base in the West. Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307–308AD, but soon fell out with his son. In early 308AD, after a failed attempt to usurp Maxentius' title, Maximian returned to Constantine's court.|$|E
5|$|Due to a miscommunication, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) {{failed to}} follow its own search {{parameters}} in Rock Creek Park, leaving Levy's body to decompose for a year. Furthermore, the MPDC had been informed, and soon dismissed, that Ingmar Guandique, already arrested for attacking women in Rock Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. The MPDC instead put {{much of its}} focus on the revelation that Levy {{was having an affair}} with Congressman Gary Condit, a married Democrat then serving his fifth term representing California's 18th congressional district, and a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Condit had an overwhelming alibi (he was in meetings with the Vice President), was never named as a suspect by police and was eventually cleared of <b>any</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> the disappearance. However, due to the cloud of suspicion raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} of the era of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the Prime Directive was {{indicated}} to apply not only to just pre-warp civilizations, but also, indeed, to any culture with whom Starfleet comes into contact. In such situations, the Prime Directive forbids <b>any</b> <b>involvement</b> with a civilization without the expressed consent or invitation of the lawful leaders of that society, and absolutely forbids <b>any</b> <b>involvement</b> whatsoever <b>in</b> the internal politics of a civilization.|$|R
5|$|Lana Tisdel's {{potential}} {{involvement in}} the {{rape and murder of}} Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present {{at the time of the}} murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying. When nobody answered the door, Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out. Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case—the residing judge considered most of Nissen's claims as nothing more than hearsay. Not only did Tisdel vehemently deny <b>any</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> Brandon's murder, she denied ever being present at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered. Unlike Tisdel's own evidence and the admissions presented in court, Boys Don't Cry took the liberty of placing Tisdel at the crime scene, albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up.|$|E
