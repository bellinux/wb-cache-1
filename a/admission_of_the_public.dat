40|$|From the foreward by Gary Orfield: As we {{face the}} worst {{economic}} crisis since the Great Depression, college opportunity has been negatively impacted by drastic cuts and <b>the</b> rising cost <b>of</b> education. In California specifically, higher education opportunity seems to be nearly {{out of reach for}} low-income students, academically unprepared students, and students of color. Historically, higher education has been considered a mechanism of upward mobility. Considered part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “American Dream,” parents encourage their children to strive for this goal, even if parents themselves never attended college. Academically underprepared students, or this lacking <b>the</b> basic skills <b>of</b> math ad/or English to be at college-level, represent over half of entering freshmen at the CSU. What these startling numbers really represent is a growing number of underprepared students graduating California high schools, often with excellent grades, yet being denied <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state’s <b>public</b> institutions. Despite California’s commitment to universal access to all who can benefit and tuition-free education, what we are seeing is an inability to uphold this social contract at <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> student’s futures. <b>The</b> negative impact <b>of</b> budget cuts has been felt beyond the students and their families. Recent pay cuts, furloughs, and other declines in financial support have also impacted faculty and staff at the CSU campuses. Increasingly, faculty and staff have feelings of unfairness, as they struggle to provide services and quality education to students, yet experience enormous cut after cut. Morale continues to plummet as faculty and staff are expected to perform <b>the</b> duties <b>of</b> educating <b>the</b> stat’s youth, ye <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> education seems practically non-existent within the state’s budget priorities.

40|$|<b>The</b> problem <b>of</b> funding {{universities}} in developing economies {{has become a}} reoccurring problem often resulting in calamitous effect on teaching and research, and intellectual capital flight <b>of</b> academics. <b>The</b> inadequate funding <b>of</b> {{universities in}} developing countries especially West Africa is a prime cause of other problems that have undermined quality in university education. With <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> funding in tertiary institutions in West Africa, there {{is the need to}} evolve some funding strategies that will make it possible for the universities to achieve qualitative education. In view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above, this paper examines funding strategies for qualitative university education in developing economies using <b>the</b> experiences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nigerian Universities as a case study. This paper made use of secondary data which were collected from <b>the</b> Federal Government <b>of</b> Nigeria’s Office of Statistics and National Statistics Bureau. The tuition fees analyzed in this paper were collected from <b>the</b> <b>admission</b> offices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six <b>public</b> universities purposively selected from 72 public universities (both federal and state universities) in Nigeria. Since <b>the</b> pursuit <b>of</b> qualitative university education bothers on all stakeholders – the government, parents, individuals, firms and cooperate bodies, this paper therefore recognizes funding as an external factor and a necessary condition for achieving qualitative university education in developing economies. </p...|$|R
40|$|A&M University (TAMU) {{to examine}} whether <b>the</b> {{elimination}} <b>of</b> affirmative action and implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automatic <b>admission</b> guarantee for students who graduated in the top 10 % of their class altered the social class composition of applicant pools. Using a tripartite classification scheme that sorts public high schools into affluent, average and poor, we evaluate application rates to <b>the</b> two <b>public</b> flagships. Results show that graduates from affluent schools are {{significantly more likely to}} seek <b>admission</b> to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> flagships compared with their cohorts who graduated from high schools that served students of low to moderate socioeconomic status. Not only is socioeconomic composition of applicant pools remarkably resistant to change, but the admission guarantee did little to raise flagship application rates from poor high schools. Finally, we show that the admission guarantee had highly uneven impacts at <b>the</b> two <b>public</b> flagships. <b>The</b> increase in rank-eligible applicants to UT was largely driven by students from affluent high schools, and in particular, those who graduated in the top two percentiles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> class rank distribution. By contrast, TAMU witnessed a drop in application rates from top 10 % graduates, particularly those who attended poor schools.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>The</b> profile <b>of</b> child {{morbidity}} is {{an important}} parameter for defining and altering health policies. Studies about infant mortality are more numerous than those on morbidity, especially related to hospital <b>admissions.</b> <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> {{this study is to}} describe <b>the</b> causes <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> health system for children from zero to nine years <b>of</b> age in <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> São Paulo during the years 2002 to 2006 and compare these results to those from the national data. METHOD: Through a cross-sectional study, data were obtained from the Hospital Information System, which is available in <b>the</b> Information System <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unified Health System - DATASUS. RESULTS: Within the period, 16 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total <b>admissions</b> corresponded to children from zero to nine years of age, with most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children being younger than one year <b>of</b> age. In <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> São Paulo, <b>the</b> <b>admission</b> coefficient increased 11 %, and in Brazil, it decreased 14 %. Respiratory diseases were <b>the</b> main causes <b>of</b> hospitalization. In São Paulo, the second most frequent causes <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> were diseases that originated during the perinatal period (15. 9 %), and in Brazil, the second most frequent cause <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> was infectious-parasitic diseases (21. 7 %). Admissions for perinatal diseases increased 32 % in São Paulo and 6 % in Brazil. While hospitalizations for diarrhea decreased in Brazil, an increase was recorded in <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> São Paulo for children under five years old. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> this study show a paradoxical increase in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> hospitalizations during an expansion of primary attention, indicating that the rise was not associated with a significant improvement in <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> service...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1991 Information from symposiums {{regarding}} guidance, as well {{as information}} from interviews with school guidance personnel, students and other persona concerned, revealed gaps concerning the present school guidance systems. In this connection <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private sector can play an important role by revealing the necessary information about the career world to the guidance personnel. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this investigation serves a double purpose. In the first instance to investigate the liaison between the school guidance personnel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Transvaal Education Department's secondary schools and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private sector from <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature. Secondly an empirical determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> connection between career guidance personnel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Afrikaans medium secondary schools in Transvaal and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private sector, {{as well as}} to determine what <b>the</b> attitude <b>of</b> school guidance personnel are towards liaison with <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private sector. For <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> this study, public sector can be defined as the sector where government has partial or total control, whereas in the private sector the government has no direct control. Personal visits to guidance personnel at secondary schools in Transvaal and the questionnaire method were both considered to obtain the necessary information for this study. After thorough consideration, the decision fell upon the questionnaire method. Questionnaires were therefore sent to all Afrikaans medium secondary schools in Transvaal. RECOMMENDATIONS: The following are recommended, bearing <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study in mind: 1. RENEWED INTRODUCTION <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> COMMITTEE FOR COORDINATION OF CAREER INFORMATION AND CAREER GUIDANCE. The following recommendations about <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above mentioned committee can be made: 1. 1 the private sector must be accommodated in this committee, 1. 2 this committee must be actively involved in a promotion campaign. 2. RESTRUCTURING <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> EDUCATION POLICY BY THE TRANSVAAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT. This study revealed that a number of school guidance personnel did not liaise with <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private sector due to the Transvaal Education Department's policy. The following are recommended: 2. 1 the Education Department's policy about outsiders must be clearly formulated and published to all persons involved, 2. 2 free <b>admission</b> by representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private sector to schools, 2. 3 visiting of career displays and information days by pupils during school hours, 2. 4 partnership between the Transvaal Education Department and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private sector to be emphasized to the pupils and to improve contact between the Education Department and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private sector. 3. INVOLVEMENT <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>PUBLIC</b> AND PRIVATE SECTOR. Liaison is <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initiative from the schools while they experience shortages of funds, time limits, transport problems and long distances. It is therefore recommended that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private sector will visit schools on their own initiative. FINAL REMARKS: There is a definite need for liaison between school guidance personnel and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private sector. This study emphasizes <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HRC's Study Committee: Guidance (1981) and as such <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> this study are closely related with the findings and recommendations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HRC's Study Committee. <b>The</b> quality <b>of</b> school guidance will be improved by liaison and this will improve the pupils' ability to make responsible career choices. It is therefore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> utmost importance for all partners in the school guidance programme to work closely together and to liaise more effectively. Master...|$|R
