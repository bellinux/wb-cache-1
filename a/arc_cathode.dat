40|$|The {{determination}} of the basic physical parameters of vacuum <b>arc</b> <b>cathode</b> spots is very difficult due to their small dimensions and short existence times. Values given in the literature for the spot diameter range from less than 10 micrometer up to some hundred micrometers, and spot existence times vary from nanoseconds to some microseconds, caused {{by the use of}} different measuring techniques. Using specially designed optical equipment for emission photography, we found structures of cathode spot clusters (short exposure times) and cathode spot traces (long exposure times) which are similar on different spatial scales covering the range from hundreds of micrometers down to 10 micrometer. The light spot traces were found to be similar to scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures of cathode spot craters, the latter having a higher spatial resolution.

40|$|Various models {{coupling}} the refractory cathode, the cathode sheath and the arc at {{atmospheric pressure}} exist. They assume a homogeneous cathode with a uniform physical state, and differ by the cathode layer and the plasma arc model. However {{even the most}} advanced of these models still fail in predicting {{the extent of the}} arc attachment when applied to short high-intensity arcs such as gas tungsten <b>arcs.</b> <b>Cathodes</b> operating in these conditions present a non-uniform physical state. A model taking into account the first level of this non-homogeneity is proposed based on physical criteria. Calculations are done for 5 mm argon arcs with a thoriated tungsten cathode. The results obtained show that radiative heating and cooling of the cathode surface are of the same order. They also show that cathode inhomogeneity has a significant effect on the arc attachment, the arc temperature and pressure. When changing the arc current (100 A, 200 A) the proposed model allows predicting trends observed experimentally that cannot be captured by the homogeneous cathode model unless restricting a priori the size of the <b>arc</b> attachment. The <b>cathode</b> physics is thus an important element to include to obtain a comprehensive and predictive arc model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—It {{is shown}} via {{computer}} simulations that a protru-sion on a thermionic <b>arc</b> <b>cathode</b> may dramatically change {{the pattern of}} steady-state modes of current transfer. This happens through a bifurcation of a special type occurring at certain geom-etry of the cathode and {{may play a role}} in operation of electrodes of compact high-intensity discharge lamps. Index Terms—Arc attachment, <b>arc</b> <b>cathode,</b> bifurcation of current transfer, bifurcation theory, high-pressure arc. CONSIDERABLE advances in theoretical and experimen-tal investigation of the plasma–cathode interaction in high-pressure arc discharges have been achieved during the last decade [1]. Simulation methods, available at present and validated experimentally, allow one to reliably describe many aspects of operation of thermionic cathodes. A challenging task is to simulate operation of cathodes of complex geometries, which are of practical interest, in particu-lar, those with protrusions [2], [3]. Results of such simulations are reported in this paper. Steady-state modes of current transfer have been calculated with the use of the commercial software COMSOL Multi-physics, as described in [4]. Stability of each of the steady-state modes has been investigated, as described in [5]. In Fig. 1, current–voltage characteristics U(I) are shown of axially symmetric steady-state modes of current transfer to an axially symmetric tungsten cathode in the form of a rod of radius R = 750 µm and a height of 12 mm (here, U is the near-cathode voltage drop, and I is the arc current). The cathode has a hemispherical tip. A spherical protrusion with a radius of 200 µm is located at the top of the tip. The arc operates in argon under the pressure of 2 bar. Also shown is the dependence of the maximum temperature of the cathode surface on the arc current. Stable and unstable sections of each mode are shown by solid or dotted lines, respectively...|$|E

A range of different {{cathode material}}s was investigated, and the arc current was varied over the range 50 - 500 A. We find that the ion erosion rate depends only on the cathode material, with values in the range from 16 to 173 µg/C and generally greater for elements of low cohesive energy. The application of a strong axial magnetic field in the vacuum <b>arc</b> <b>cathode</b> region leads to increase normalized ion current, only by virtue of enhanced ion charge states formed in a strong magnetic field, but the ion erosion rate value remains a constant. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{erosion of}} copper cathodes having {{different}} microstructures ranging {{from hundreds of}} nm to tens of mum were studied in both pulsed vacuum arcs and continuous running magnetically rotated atmospheric pressure <b>arcs.</b> <b>Cathodes</b> having different grain sizes were formed by various thermal spray and heat treatment methods namely, high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) method, atmospheric pressure plasma spraying (PS), vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), cold spraying (CS) and annealing techniques. The coatings produced were characterized for their chemical composition, oxide content, microstructure, porosity and thermal conductivity. Arc velocity and erosion measurements were performed on these cathodes. The results show that, the cathodes having smaller grain sizes show higher arc velocities and hence give lower erosion rates. Annealed HVOF, CS coatings and as-sprayed VPS coatings which had grains sizes from 4 to 0. 9 mum gave up to 60 % higher arc velocities and up to 70 % lower erosion rates than Cu cathodes having grains sizes from 20 to 23 mum. As sprayed HVOF and CS coatings spalled severely due to their poor coating adhesion strength, as well as low electrical and thermal conductivities. However annealing these coatings in inert atmosphere improved their properties and reduced spalling. Annealing conditions, which gave minimum or no spalling of the coatings, were determined.

These coatings were deposited on silicon substrates by using a cathodic-arc deposition system with lateral rotating <b>arc</b> <b>cathodes.</b> Chromium and Al 88 Si 12 cathodes {{were used for the}} deposition of Cr-Al-Si-N coatings. The deposited Cr 0. 38 Al 0. 56 Si 0. 06 N exhibited higher hardness of 41 +/- 2 GPa and higher H- 3 /E*(2) ratio of 0. 468 GPa than CrN due to the introduction of Al and Si to form a nanocrystalline structure. For the high-temperature oxidation test, the coated samples were annealed at 800 degrees C in air for 2 h. The Cr 0. 38 Al 0. 56 Si 0. 06 N possessed much lower oxidation rate as measured by the oxide layer of the coatings. The addition of Al and Si in the coating may inhibit the formation of Cr 2 N phase and grain coarsening as found in the deposited CrN coating. In addition, the coexisting Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 near the surface retarded the diffusion of oxygen into the Cr 0. 38 Al 0. 56 Si 0. 06 N. The deposited Cr 0. 38 Al 0. 56 Si 0. 06 N showed an oxidation behavior superior to the CrN.
