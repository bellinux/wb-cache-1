One way of accomplishing this is {{by the use of}} abradable seals which reduces clearances and limits the risk of damage to the rotating/stationary member if a rub occurs. The program presented evaluates various candidate <b>abradable</b> <b>materials</b> through performance in a test rig and the development of the final process parameters. The results of the tests indicated that for centrifugal compressor applications, the mica filled tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), silicone rubber, aluminum polyester and nickel graphite are all acceptable materials for abradable seals. Temperature limits were specified for each of these materials. For steam turbines, nickel chromium and nickel graphite are suitable and, again, temperature limits were specified. Application of abradable seals to centrifugal compressors has shown efficiency improvements of up to 0. 5 percent per stage for high flow machines, and up to 2. 5 percent per stage for low flow machines. Performance improvements in excess of two percent have been calculated for noncondensing steam turbines utilizing <b>abradable</b> <b>materials</b> in shaft end packing, blade tip and stage diaphragm seals...|$|E

Subsequent rubs over the same surface can also be monitored, with microscopic observation of the rub surface being possible after any of the passes. The device was used in tests of several potential <b>abradable</b> <b>materials,</b> ranging from porous to fully dense. It was shown that the rub energy dissipated in initial and subsequent passes is a fundamental parameter {{in the evaluation of}} material abradability.

To determine a solution for turbo-engine efficiency enhancement, we investigated the clearance reduction between the rotary parts in air systems, the successive starts and stops, the thermal expansion and the vibrations that might cause direct rub interactions between a rotary seal, known as a labyrinth seal, and a turbo-engine housing coated with a sacrificial <b>abradable</b> <b>material.</b> High interaction speeds from 0 to 130 m s− 1 were obtained using a 5 -axis milling machine fitted with a unique magnetic bearings spindle developed specifically for the study.

This interaction which can occur in an aircraft engine when the rotating blade tips rub on the compressor casing, is analyzed on an experimental laboratory set-up. Only orthogonal cutting conditions are considered in this preliminary study to monitor the load evolution with velocity. The experimental results obtained for a range of velocities 10 < V < 107 m/s and for a range interaction depth 0. 05 < t 1 < 0. 5 mm are presented. After analysis of measurements, the mean interaction force increases proportionally to the interaction depth increment. The effects of the contact geometry on the loads, especially the radius of the edge, are investigated. The increase of the radius value for a given interaction depth increases the load value.

40|$|International audienceAbradable {{materials}} {{are used to}} decrease the gas consumption of aircraft engines by minimizing {{the gap between the}} blade tips and the stator. The key idea consists in using the blades themselves to machine the gap on the abradable coating. The best compromise between soft and hard coating properties has to be reached to avoid blades wear and prevent coating erosion by gas flux and particles. The plastic parameters of abradable coating were identified by using an optimization process directly connected to FEA. The first order optimization method (conjugate gradient strategy + golden section algorithm) was applied to achieve the optimal solution. A good agreement was found between experimental and numerical results. The plastic parameters were used to study the hardness variability of <b>abradable</b> <b>materials</b> with the coating thickness. Surprisingly, a minimum hardness value was found while it was expected that hardness should be always decreasing with thickness.

40|$|International audienceThis paper reports recent {{research}} on <b>abradable</b> <b>materials</b> employed for aero-engine applications. Such thermal spray coatings are used extensively within the gas turbine, {{applied to the}} inner surface of compressor and turbine shroud sections, coating {{the periphery of the}} blade rotation path. The function of an abradable seal is to wear preferentially when rotating blades come into contact with it, while minimizing over-tip clearance and improving the efficiency of the engine. Thermal spraying of an abradable coating onto a substrate imparts two components of residual stress; rapid quenching stresses as the spray material cools on impact and stresses arising from differential thermal contraction. In-service thermal stresses are superimposed by the differential expansion of these bonded layers. The combination of the production and operation history will lead to thermal-mechanical fatigue damage within the abradable coating. The present paper will describe the numerical modeling and sensitivity analysis of the thermal spray process. The sensitivity of residual stresses (with varying material properties, coating/substrate thickness, Poisson's ratio, and substrate temperature) predicted by the Tsui and Clyne progressive deposition model enabled identification of performance drivers to coating integrity. Selecting material properties that minimize in-service stresses is a crucial stage in advancing future abradable performance...|$|E

40|$|In aero engines a {{thermally}} sprayed <b>abradable</b> <b>material</b> {{is applied}} {{to the inside of the}} casing in order to provide a seal around the blade tips of the compressor blades. During running and handling the blades cut a channel into the <b>abradable</b> <b>material.</b> This rub is poorly understood and often results in blade wear and poor sealing particularly in the later stages of the compressor. This thesis aims to investigate and characterise these rubs and provide recommendations for changes to the running and handling procedure, the abradable or the blade tip that will improve sealing and reduce blade wear. The AlSi polyester vs Ti(6 Al 4 V) and NiCrAl bentonite vs Inconel 718 rubs have been investigated through high speed rub testing. The effect of incursion rate, blade speed and abradable hardness have been investigated. Wear mechanisms have been proposed and clarified by further high speed wear testing and microstructure modelling. In addition several possible tip modifications have been tested and a successful modification has been extensively characterised. The wear mechanism was found to depend on the materials and the incursion rate while the abradable batch and, in the case of the NiCrAl bentonite abradable, the blade speed affected the severity of the mechanism. The AlSi based abradable cut at high incursion rates but wore by adhesion on to the blade an abrasion at low incursion rates. The NiCrAl bentonite abradable wore by local compaction and subsurface damage. At low incursion rate material was removed fast enough to accommodate the incursion but at higher incursion rates blade wear and compaction of the abradable were observed...|$|R
40|$|In aero-engines it is {{possible}} for the blades of the compressor, turbine or fan to incur into their casings. At these interfaces a lining of composite <b>abradable</b> <b>material</b> is used to limit damage to components and thereby sustain the efficiency and longevity of the engine as a whole. These composite materials must have good abradability and erosion resistance. Previously, the wear mechanisms at the contact between the blade and the coating have been characterised using stroboscopic imaging and force measurement on a scaled test-rig platform. This work is focused on the characterisation of the wear mechanism for two different hardnesses of abradable lining. The established stroboscopic imaging technique and contact force measurements are combined with sectioning of the <b>abradable</b> <b>material</b> in order to analyse the material’s response during the tests. A measure of the thermal properties and the resulting temperature of the linings during the test have also been made to further understand the effect of coating hardness. The wear mechanism, material response, contact force and thermal properties of the coating have been used to characterise the different material behaviour with different hardness. At low incursion rates, with a soft coating, the blade tip becomes worn after an initial adhesive transfer from the coating. Post-test sectioning showed blade material and significant compaction present in the coating. The harder coating produced adhesion on the blade tip with solidification observed in the coating. Thermal diffusivity measurements and modelling indicated that thermally driven wear observed was {{as a consequence of the}} increased number of boundaries between the metal and hBN phases present interrupting heat flow, leading to a concentration of surface heat. At higher incursion rates, the wear mechanism is more similar between the coatings and a cutting mechanism dominates producing negligible adhesion and blade wear. ...|$|R

Techniques were developed for studying such deformation in both solid (fully dense) and porous metals. Results of the analysis were verified by comparison with experimental data obtained using a pendulum-type rub test apparatus and a pin-on-disk sliding wear tester. It was found that the near-surface plastic deformation in fully dense solids was different from that for porous materials because of the compressibility of the latter.

This combination is not currently possible in late stages of the compressor as hard <b>abradable</b> <b>materials</b> can cause titanium blades to wear excessively. One solution to this is to add a surface treatment to the blade tips. Two surface treatments have been investigated, firstly cubic boron nitride (cBN) grits are bonded to the tip of the blade by electroplating. Secondly blades are coated in Cr(Al) N by cathodic arc deposition. The performance of these surface treatments is investigated on a test rig capable of monitoring the blade length, rub forces and abradable temperature during the test.

The abradability of the material was found to be excellent with no damage to the rotating member. For rub tolerant polymer seals little data are available on the effects of an aggressive rub with relation to deflection and wear at various temperatures. A series of test was done on labyrinth seals manufactured from various forms of carbon fill polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyamideimide (PAI). these test evaluated their mechanical performance at low temperatures, room temperatures, and high temperatures. The results of the tests indicated that at room temperature and low temperatures, the seals exhibited acceptable deflection properties without damage to the rotating shaft and minimal material loss from the labyrinth teeth. However, at high temperatures of 150 ?F, the PAI material had greater deflection values than the two types of PEEK, which resulted in the PAI exhibiting greater tooth height loss compared to the PEEK materials. For steam turbines, nickel chrome and nickel graphite were tested in a steam turbine and results are highlighted.

40|$|Metco 320 is a AlSi-hBN-polyester abradable, used in {{the high}} {{pressure}} compressor of commercial gas turbines. The material response to cyclic heating and cooling, and the resulting changes in microstructure, {{as well as their}} associated failure mechanisms were investigated. It was found that the top surface layer of the abradable liner degrades over its lifetime. During thermal cycling hBN is removed from the material’s microstructure, which results in the degradation of the abradable and increased brittleness of the top surface. Furthermore, material cracking and delamination behaviour during service was successfully reproduced in the laboratory. The cracking and delamination observations made during overhaul, were replicated using cyclic water-quenching, but the spallation of <b>abradable</b> <b>material</b> did not occur. Investigations into material properties and their influence upon the abradable failure mechanics revealed, that soft M 320 matched the observations made during engine overhauls. It could also be established, that the plasma spray process, grit blasting, surface treatment after deposition and the transient of the substrate affect the abradable’s performance and life-time, when heat cycled. Some service casings suffer from premature liner loss. These unscheduled overhauls are costly and their number is desired to be reduced, if possible eliminated. In order to control the material failures, the stresses introduced into the abradable seal during manufacturing need to be reduced, since this is one of main drivers for material cracking and delamination. Furthermore, it was established, that material at the top end of the hardness specification performed better in service. This is due to the fact, that more AlSi metal matrix is present in the microstructure and the hBN loss does not affect the material integrity as much as in soft material. 2 D and 3 D modelling showed temperature and strain profiles evolving during the quenching process. These show the areas of high strain, which are consistent with the crack initiation areas observed during testing. It can be concluded, that M 320 abradable is a very complex material system, which is influenced by several parameters.

A simplified approach of rotor/stator interaction was experimentally simulated for ranges of velocities and interaction depths varying from 60 m/s to 270 m/s and from 0. 13 mm to 0. 35 mm respectively.

40|$|International audienceAircraft engine {{manufacturers}} are developping {{a new generation}} of turbojet engines featuring a lower impact on the environment, increased performances as well as reduced gas consumption. The efficiency of an engine is mostly driven by the operating clearance between the rotating parts and the stator. Accordingly, modern designs focus on the minimization of these clearances. In this context, unavoidable rotor imbalances or mistuning stemming from manufacturing processes as well as distortions resulting from thermal expansion or assembly conditions may generate blade-tip/casing contacts that are now considered as non-accidental operating conditions. In order to minimize the consequences of such events, an abradable coating is sprayed along the inner surface of the casing and acts as a fuse when the blade and the casing are in contact. However, even when an abradable coating is used, significant structural damages and wear as well as blade failures have been witnessed experimentally. The understanding of the physical phenomena at play called, on one hand, for throrough experimental investigations of rotor/stator contacts on full-scale stages of compressors and underlined that blade failure is mainly due to vibratory fatigue although the abradable coating is worn. On the other hand, numerical simulations have been performed to better understand the blade dynamics: over the last decade Snecma and its academic partners jointly developed a code for the simulation of COntacts between ROtor and Stator: COROS. This code allows for the simulation of contacts—with a Lagrange multiplier contact treatment procedure—between full 3 D models of engine components and accounts for <b>abradable</b> coating <b>material</b> removal. In particular, the simulation of experimental setups with COROS highlighted the correlation between the blade vibratory response and the <b>abradable</b> <b>material</b> removal.

40|$|During aero-engine operation, rotor misalignment, thermal and {{centrifugal}} dilatations, and unbalanced parts lead {{to contact}} between the rotating blade and the abradable lining of the surrounding casing. Observation of aero-engine service has highlighted undesirable issues and relative wear mechanisms that have created problems during operation, with significant reductions in aero-engine performance. Examples of issues observed were adhesive transfer of <b>abradable</b> <b>material</b> to the blade tip, along with blade wear. These observations have highlighted the final result of the {{contact between the}} blade and abradable; however, the complexity of introducing instruments to the aero-engine {{has led to a}} gap in knowledge with respect to the parameters that influence these wear mechanisms. This issue has provided the motivation for this research, where wear mechanism between a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V rotating blade and <b>abradable</b> <b>material</b> AlSi-hBN has been investigated on a scaled test platform. AlSi-hBN has been chosen as it represents the most common technology used in the compressor stage of the engine. Alternative approaches that characterised the wear mechanism in real time were introduced {{in order to try to}} explore the nature of the contact. The introduction of an innovative stroboscopic imaging technique allowed the progression of adhesive transfer / blade wear to be investigated in real time during a test, revealing that the standard practice of performing analysis of adhered material at the end of a test does not necessarily characterise the overall mechanics of adhesive transfer satisfactorily. In addition, the measurement of contact force and the calculation of the efficiency of cut and force ratio, highlighted different material behaviour in relation to the incursion rate and hardness. It was shown that it was difficult to dislocate the material at low incursion rate, with consolidation evident, whereas at higher incursion rates the material was well fractured. The measurement of the coating temperature highlighted the heat generated in the contact, along with the effect of changing coating hardness on the thermal properties of the abradable, leading to markedly different thermal behaviour at low hardness, and in particular at low incursion rate. The wear mechanisms observed, adhesive transfer, blade wear and cutting, were mainly incursion rate dependent, with a thermal wear mechanism at low incursion rate and a well cut mechanism at high incursion rate. At low incursion rate, different wear mechanisms were observed in relation to the hardness, with adhesive transfer on the blade tip from the hard coating and blade wear in the test performed against the soft coating, with similar results observed at all blade speeds. A wear map was generated in relation to the input parameters, such as the incursion rate, speed and coating hardness, and also the reflected different thermal properties of the coating. This indicated that it is better to have a high thermally conductivity coating; therefore, the use of a hard AlSi-hBN is a better option, because less thermal damage was observed. The wear map with the highlighted wear regimes is a useful design tool with respect to planning running and handling manoeuvres for the engine, where the manufacturer has the option to control incursion parameters. As these represent the most significant incursion performed, this finding is of particular benefit...|$|R

In order to avoid catastrophic scenarios due to direct tip incursions into a bare metal housing, implementation of abradable coatings has been widely recognized as a robust solution offering several advantages: reducing potential non-repairable damage to the incurring blade as well as adjusting operating clearances, in-situ, to accept physical contact events.

The deposition of an abradable coating on casings {{is one of the}} technologies used to reduce this blade-casing clearance and ensure blade integrity in the event of blade-casing contact. Aircraft in-service condi-tions may lead to interactions between the blade tip and the coated casing, during which wear of the abradable coating, blade dynamics and interacting force are critical yet little-understood issues. In order to study blade/abradable-coating interactions of a few tens of milliseconds, experiments were conducted on a dedicated test rig. The experi-mental data were analyzed with the aim of determining the friction-induced vibrational modes of the blade. This involved a time-frequency analysis of the experimental blade strain using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, combined with a modal analysis of the blade. The latter was carried out with two kinds of kinematic boundary conditions at the blade tip: free and modified, by imposing contact with the abradable coating. The interaction data show that the blade vibration modes identified during interactions cor-respond to the free boundary condition, due to the transitional nature of the phenomena and the very short duration of contacts. The properties of the Continous Wavelet Trans-form were then used to identify the occurence of blade-coating contact. Two kinds of blade/abradable-coating interactions were identified: bouncing of the blade over short time periods associated with loss of <b>abradable</b> <b>material,</b> and isolated contacts capable of amplifying the blade vibrations without causing significant wear of the abradable coat-ing.

The polymer additive mixed with the metal is then completely volatilized to provide a porous layer between the ceramic layer and the substrate. Thermal stresses are reduced by the porous structure which gives a cushion effect. No brazing is required by using only plasma spraying for depositing both the powders of the metal and polymer material as well as the ceramic powder...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} for the rubbing of rotating (100 m/s) titanium blade specimens, with different plasma-sprayed tip coating, against an <b>abradable</b> porous seal <b>material</b> at two different incursion rates. In general, {{there was a}} good correspondence between the average transverse force of rubbing and the seal specimen surface temperature. Instantaneous seal surface temperature measurement showed a significant temperature jump before and after each rubbing with a high rate of cooling during each revolution and a high overall temperature level. Numerical predictions of both blade and seal temperature agreed well for the bare blade tip experiments but were consistently high for the coated blades. This suggests that the thermal properties of the coatings may significantly affect the temperatures and hence the wear characteristics of the system...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbradable {{materials}} {{are widely used}} as coatings within compressor and turbine stages of modern aircraft engines {{in order to reduce}} operating blade-tip/casing clearances and thus maximize energy efficiency. However, rubbing occurrences between blade tips and coating liners may lead to high blade vibratory levels and endanger their structural integrity through fatigue mechanisms. Accordingly, {{there is a need for}} a better comprehension of the physical phenomena at play and for an accurate modeling of the interaction, in order to predict potentially unsafe events. To this end, this work introduces a phenomenological model of the abradable coating removal based on phenomena reported in the literature and accounting for key frictional and wear mechanisms including plasticity at junctions, ploughing, micro-rupture and machining. It is implemented within an in-house software solution dedicated to the prediction of full three-dimensional blade/abradable coating interactions within an aircraft engine low pressure compressor. Two case studies are considered. The first one compares the results of an experimental abradable test rig and its simulation. The second one deals with the simulation of interactions in a complete low-pressure compressor. The consistency of the model with experimental observations is underlined, and the impact of material parameter variations on the interaction and wear behavior of the blade is discussed. It is found that even though wear patterns are remarkably robust, results are significantly influenced by <b>abradable</b> coating <b>material</b> properties...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} for the case of titanium blade specimens, with bare tips (or covered with wear resistant, plasma sprayed materials) rubbing at 100 m/s against specimens of <b>abradable</b> nickel-chromium seal <b>material</b> moving toward the rotating blades at 0. 0125 mm/s or at 0. 025 mm/s. Using a two component dynamometer, the normal force of the rub interaction was measured and the shear component estimated. The elastoplastic properties of the seal material have been determined and those parameters {{as well as the}} rigidity of the rub tester system are considered in conjunction with those affecting the accuracy of the measurement of the forces arising at the blade-seal interface. The average and the 'local instantaneous' temperatures of the seal specimen and the temperature of the blade tip surface during rubbing are presented as functions of time. A seal densification factor is defined and its functional relationships with contact force components, temperature, wear ratio and blade tip abrading capability are indicated...|$|R
