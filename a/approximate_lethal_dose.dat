40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the {{reliability}} of LD 50 determination using the traditional Litchfield and Wilcoxon method with that obtained by four alternative tests requiring smaller numbers of animals, for the purpose of classifying chemicals according to their acute toxicity. Acute lethal dose determinations were carried out in mice for oral and intraperitoneal administration of hexachlorophene, lidocaine, methanol, phenobarbital and physostigmine. The Molinengo method proved not to be as reliable as suggested by its author. Determination of LD 50 using the Thompson and Weil method or, alternatively, the maximal non-lethal dose and the <b>approximate</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> permitted the classification of the chemicals in essentially the same order. The <b>approximate</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> method, in particular, seems to be a very suitable alternative method to the classical LD 50 test since it requires only about 6 animals, provides enough information to order chemicals according to their toxicities, and provides useful information for planning subsequent repeated-dose studies...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} carried out in order to find both the single-dose {{intramuscular}} injection toxicity and the <b>approximate</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of samjeong pharmacopuncture (SP) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Methods: The SD rats in this study were divided into four groups, one control group (1. 0 mL/animal, normal saline) and three experimental groups (0. 25, 0. 5, and 1. 0 mL/animal, SP). All groups consisted of five male and five female rats. SP was injected as a single-dose intramuscularly at the thigh. After the injection, general symptoms and weight were observed for 14 days. After the observations had ended, hematologic and serum biochemical examinations, necropsy and a local tolerance test at the injection site were performed. The experiments were carried out at the Good Laboratory Practice firm, Biotoxtech Co. (Cheongwon, Chungbuk). Animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee (Approval Number: 130379). Results: No deaths occurred in any of the three experimental groups. The injection of SP had no effects on the general symptoms, body weights, results of the hematologic, and serum biochemical examinations, and necropsy findings. In local tolerance tests at the injection sites, mild inflammation was observed in the experimental group, but it {{did not appear to be}} a treatment related effect. Conclusion: Under the conditions of this test, the results from the injection of SP suggest that the <b>approximate</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of SP is above 1. 0 mL/animal for both male and female SD rats.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} the study is to assess both the <b>approximate</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> and the single dose intra-muscular {{injection}} toxicity of Danggui (Angelica gigan-tis radix) pharmacopuncture (DGP) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Methods: The experiments were conducted at the good laboratory practice (GLP) laboratory, Biotoxtech Co., which is a laboratory approved by the ministry of food and drug safety (MFDS). The study was performed according to the GLP regulation and the toxicity test guidelines of the MFDS (2009) after approval of the institutional animal care and use committee of Biotox-tech. Single doses of DGP were injected intramuscularly into the rats in three test groups of 6 week old SD rats (5 male and 5 female rats per groups) in the amounts of 0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 mL/animal for groups 2, 3, and 4, re-spectively, and normal saline solution in the amount of 1. 0 mL/animal was injected intramuscularly into the rats (5 male and 5 female rats) in the control group. Observations of the general symptoms and weight measurements were performed during the 14 day ob-servation period after the injection. Hematologic and serum biochemical examination, necropsy, and a local tolerance test at the injection site were done after the observation period. Results: No death was observed in three test groups (0. 1, 0. 5 and 1. 0 mL/animal group). In addition, the injection of DGP had no effect on general symptoms, weights, hematologic and serum biochemical exami-nation, and necropsy. The results from the local toler-ance tests at injection site showed no treatment relat-ed effects in the SD rats. Conclusion: The results of single dose intramuscular injection of DGP suggest that the <b>approximate</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> is above 1. 0 mL/animal for both male and female SD rats and that intramuscular injection of DGP may be safe. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to provide data on acute toxicity of beta-myrcene, a peripheral analgesic substance found in the essential oils of several plants.

40|$|Copyright © 2007 Royal Australasian Ornithologists UnionAlthough baiting for feral predators with {{sodium fluoroacetate}} (1080) benefit native fauna {{over much of}} Australia by {{reducing}} the abundance of those predators, {{there is a potential}} risk of poisoning to non-target species. Bush Stone-curlews (Burhinus grallarius) have declined over much of mainland southern Australia owing to predation by Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes), but they have the potential to eat and be affected by 1080 baits. This paper explores the extent to which 1080 -baiting programs may have an adverse effect on extant or reintroduced populations of Bush Stone-curlews. Our study used Bush Stone-curlews from a population that was not adapted to naturally occurring 1080, so our results are likely to be relevant throughout the range of the species. We determined the <b>approximate</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (ALD) of 1080 for Bush Stone-curlews to be 10 – 15 mg kg– 1. Thus a Bush Stone-curlew weighing 700 g would need to eat between three and four baits, each containing 3 mg of 1080, to receive an ALD. In unforced trials, the Bush Stone-curlews in our study did not eat (undosed) meat or grain baits. Dying food blue did not deter Bush Stone-curlews from eating it. Thus, sole reliance on blue dyes to deter non-target species from taking baits seems unwise. Our results indicate that reintroduction programs for Bush Stone-curlew are unlikely to be affected by concurrent 1080 -baiting for feral animal control. Greg Johnston and Peter McCarth...|$|E

Methods: Crude venom obtained from Apis mellifera was selected. The anti-coagulation factor of the crude venom from this species was purified by using gel filtration chromatography (sephadex G- 50), and the molecular weights of the anti-coagulants in this venom estimated by using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Blood samples were obtained from 10 rabbits, and the prothrombin time (PT) and the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) tests were conducted. The <b>approximate</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD) values of BV were determined. Results: Crude BV increased the blood clotting time. For BV concentrations from 1 to 4 mg/mL, clotting was not observed even at more than 300 seconds, standard deviations (SDs) = ± 0. 71; however, clotting was observed in the control group 13. 8 s, SDs = ± 0. 52.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{therapeutic}} use and the physiological impor-tance of iodine compounds, their pharmacological action is of particular interest. This paper is concerned primarily with the toxicity of the alkali iodates and their reaction in the environ-ment of the living organism. Massive doses of the alkali iodides are tolerated without appar-ent harmful effect. Single doses of 20 to 40 grams administered orally without harmful effect are reported by clinicians. Appar-ently the tolerated intravenous dose is practically limited only by the general salt effect on the blood. Maurer and Ducree (1) have observed in their studies on the distribution of iodides in animals after oral and intravenous administration, that the iodide content of the blood remains at a high level for from twelve to twenty-four hours and in fact may not return to the normal value for considerably longer periods. We have found that rabbits will tolerate intravenous doses of sodium iodide of 1. 0 gram per kilogram body weight without resultant injury.

Results: No deaths, abnormal clinical symptoms, or significant weight changes were observed in either male or female SD rats in the control or the test (0. 125, 0. 25, and 0. 5 mL/animal) groups during the observation period. No significant differences in hematology and serum biochemistry and no macroscopic abnormalities at necropsy were found. No abnormal reactions at injection sites were noted on the topical tolerance tests. Conclusion: The results of this single-dose toxicity study show that WCFC is safe, its lethal doses in male and female SD rats being estimated to be higher than 0. 5 mL/animal...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was {{assessment}} of gross and microscopic pathological changes resulting from sub acute and sub chronic toxicity of carbon tetrachloride CCl 4 (99. 5 %) in the liver of chicken and its relation with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. The <b>approximate</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> in three weeks old chickens was equal to (994 mg/kg i. p.). In the sub acute toxicity experiment the given dose was (497 mg/kg i. p.) twice a week for one week, the liver of treated animals with CCl 4 grossly appeared pale and mottled with white yellowish color patches represent the necrotic tissue, the histopathological changes was severe hepatitis with infiltration of inflammatory cells specially heterophiles and diffused coagulative necrosis. In sub chronic toxicity experiment the dose was given (248. 5 mg/kg i. p.) twice a week for eight weeks, in gross appearance the liver was severely congested, the histopathological changes was hypertrophy of hepatocytes, hyperplasia of lining epithelium of bile ducts and chronic venous congestion, growth depression and significant decreased in the body weight of the treated animals also noticed at this experiment in compared with control group, a significant increased in (ALT) and (AST) activities also recorded. The results suggests that pathological changes and response of the chicken’s liver to the CCl 4 toxicity relatively differs from other laboratory animal models like rats and mice when used approximate dose in the same duration of exposure, so it didn’t appear fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver of chickens, therefore it can't use chickens as a model to induce experimental fibrosis or liver cirrhosis when treated with CCl 4 according to the dose and duration of exposure of this study...|$|E

(BG) Moraceae, {{with a high}} {{frequency}} in regions of the Brazilian cerrado (shrubland) and popularly known as "mamacadela", holds photosensitizing furocoumarins. The BG's main therapeutic use is the treatment of vitiligo, a skin depigmentation disease that takes hold of approximately 1 - 2 % of the world population. There is one product on the marketplace (Viticromin®), {{for which there is}} no scientific research available about its experimental toxicity, in spite of its proven clinical efficacy. Therefore, the development of acute pre-clinical toxicity trials has been proposed (<b>approximate</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose,</b> ALD, and median lethal dose, LD 50) of the BG root exsudate in laboratory animals. Male, albino mice weighing between 25 and 30 g, in good sanitation conditions have been used. The mice received water and food ad libitum. The BG powder was mixed in 0. 9 % saline solution and 0. 5 % cremophor and was administered po and ip. The LD 50 was obtained through the Lichtfield and Wilcoxon (1949) method. A public domain software was used for the calculations. Ten mice/dose were used - 6 groups for each administration via, including the control group - and the number of deaths within up to 14 days was considered; the control group received an emulsion made up by 0. 9 saline solution and 0. 5 % cremophor. Before establishing the LD 50 and aiming at reducing the number of animals used, the DLA was determined when 1 animal per dose was used (the next dose always 50 % higher than the previous dose), until identifying the dose that led to the death of 1 animal. Thus, the DLA po was 3750 mg/kg and the DLA ip, 2920 mg/kg. The LD 50 po was 3517. 54 mg/kg and the LD 50 ip was 2871. 76 mg/kg. The product was considered as of being of low toxicity, taking into account only the single dose acute toxicity...|$|E

Although all strains gave i. g. ALD 50 S comparable to {{or less than}} their i. p.

The cells were propagated in media containing various concentrations of sodium chloride or potassium chloride. Strains 10403 S and DP-L 224 exhibited significant increases in catalase activity and listeriolysin O activity when grown in medium containing either salt at 428 mM. The superoxide dismutase activities for both strains increased when they were grown in medium containing either salt. The superoxide dismutase activity was significantly increased only when cells were propagated in medium containing no salt compared with that when they were propagated in medium containing either salt at 1, 112 mM. In addition, the listeriolysin O activity was highest for cells propagated in medium containing KCl at 428 mM, while the activity was significantly less for cells propagated in medium containing NaCl at an equal concentration. Virulence was examined in mouse livers and spleens after intravenous infection, and <b>approximate</b> 50 % <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> were determined after intragastric and intraperitoneal infection. Each method of infection indicated that listeriolysin O is required for virulence, while growth in salt-containing medium or the production of higher levels of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and listeriolysin O {{do not appear to}} enhance the virulence of L. monocytogenes...|$|R
