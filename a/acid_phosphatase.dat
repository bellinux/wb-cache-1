25|$|Tartrate-resistant <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> (TRAP or TRAPase), {{also called}} <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatase</b> 5, {{tartrate}} resistant (ACP5), is a glycosylated monomeric metalloprotein enzyme expressed in mammals. It has a molecular weight of approximately 35kDa, a basic isoelectric point (7.6-9.5), and optimal activity in acidic conditions. TRAP is synthesized as latent proenzyme and activated by proteolytic cleavage and reduction. It is differentiated from other mammalian acid phosphatases by its resistance to inhibition by tartrate and molecular weight.|$|E

They possess a binuclear metal centre to {{catalyse}} the hydrolysis of phosphate esters and anhydrides under acidic conditions. In humans, elevated purple <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatases</b> levels in sera are {{correlated with the}} progression of osteoporosis and metabolic bone malignancies, making this enzyme a target {{for the development of}} new chemotherapeutics to treat bone-related illnesses. To date, little progress has been achieved towards the design of specific and potent inhibitors of this enzyme that have drug-like properties. Here, we have undertaken a fragment-based screening approach using a 500 -compound library identifying three inhibitors of purple <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatases</b> with Ki values in the 3060 mu m range. Ligand efficiency values are 0. 390. 44 kcal/mol per heavy atom. X-ray crystal structures of these compounds in complex with a plant purple <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatases</b> (2. 32. 7 angstrom resolution) have been determined and show that all bind in the active site within contact of the binuclear centre. For one of these compounds, the phenyl ring is positioned within 3. 5 angstrom of the binuclear centre. Docking simulations indicate that the three compounds fit into the active site of human purple <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatases.</b> These studies open the way to the design of more potent and selective inhibitors of purple <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatases</b> that can be tested as anti-osteoporotic drug leads...|$|R

40|$|Nonspecific <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatases</b> are a {{group of}} enzymes whose {{activity}} increases the availability of exogenous and endogenous orthophosphate either through extra- or intracellular hydrolysis of phosphate compounds.

Additionally, the enzyme PDE5 (involved with erectile dysfunction) has additionally been associated with the G-spot area.

40|$|During seed {{formation}} of Brassica macrocarpa {{the development of}} the embryo precedes that of the integuments; structural changes and histochemical changes are associated. Esterases, <b>acid</b> <b>phosphatases,</b> phenols and starch follow a sigmoid pattern, increasing during embryogenesis and decreasing during seed maturation.
