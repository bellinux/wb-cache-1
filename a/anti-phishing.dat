5|$|<b>Anti-phishing</b> {{integrates}} with Internet Explorer. It analyzes sites, {{examining the}} website's URL, title, form, page layout, visible text and links, {{and uses a}} blacklist to detect phishing sites. Users are blocked access from suspected phishing sites, however are presented an option to continue. In PC Magazine testing, the feature blocked 22 of 24 phishing sites, while Internet Explorer 7 recognized 17 of the 24 sites. In PC Pro testing, the feature successfully blocked access to every phishing site it was tested against. Spam filtering no longer includes a language feature, Symantec claims it is less useful with current spam and created false positives. Tested against 1,500 messages by PC Magazine, Norton let {{over half of the}} spam to the inbox. Five percent of valid mail were marked as spam. This version utilizes Symantec's Veritas VxMS technology to better identify rootkits. VxMS allows Norton to find inconsistencies among files within directories and files at the volume level. A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at login. This release drops support for Windows 2000 and was compatible with Windows Vista upon its release with an update.|$|E
25|$|Phishers {{have even}} started using images instead of text {{to make it}} harder for <b>anti-phishing</b> filters to detect text {{commonly}} used in phishing emails. However, this has led to the evolution of more sophisticated <b>anti-phishing</b> filters that are able to recover hidden text in images. These filters use OCR (optical character recognition) to optically scan the image and filter it.|$|E
25|$|In the 3rd Quarter of 2009, the <b>Anti-Phishing</b> Working Group {{reported}} receiving 115,370 phishing email {{reports from}} consumers with US and China hosting more than 25% of the phishing pages each.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>anti-phishing</b> {{websites}} which publish exact {{messages that}} have been recently circulating the internet, such as FraudWatch International and Millersmiles. Such sites often provide specific details about the particular messages.|$|E
25|$|To avoid <b>anti-phishing</b> {{techniques}} that scan websites for phishing-related text, phishers {{have begun to}} use Flash-based websites (a technique known as phlashing). These look much like the real website, but hide the text in a multimedia object.|$|E
25|$|Another popular {{approach}} to fighting phishing {{is to maintain}} a list of known phishing sites and to check websites against the list. Microsoft's IE7 browser, Mozilla Firefox 2.0, Safari 3.2, and Opera all contain this type of <b>anti-phishing</b> measure. Firefox 2 used Google <b>anti-phishing</b> software. Opera 9.1 uses live blacklists from Phishtank, cyscon and GeoTrust, as well as live whitelists from GeoTrust. Some implementations of this approach send the visited URLs to a central service to be checked, which has raised concerns about privacy. According {{to a report by}} Mozilla in late 2006, Firefox 2 was found to be more effective than Internet Explorer 7 at detecting fraudulent sites in a study by an independent software testing company.|$|E
25|$|New Group Policy's Administrative Templates (.adm files) for IE7 {{are loaded}} {{automatically}} onto the Domain Controller when a Group Policy is opened from a workstation where IE7 has been installed. These new administrative templates allow for controlling the <b>Anti-Phishing</b> filter state, for example.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>anti-phishing</b> filters {{have even}} used IWR (intelligent word recognition), {{which is not}} meant to {{completely}} replace OCR, but these filters can even detect cursive, hand-written, rotated (including upside-down text), or distorted (such as made wavy, stretched vertically or laterally, or in different directions) text, as well as text on colored backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Anti-Phishing</b> Working Group, an {{industry}} {{and law enforcement}} association, has suggested that conventional phishing techniques could become obsolete {{in the future as}} people are increasingly aware of the social engineering techniques used by phishers. They predict that pharming and other uses of malware will become more common tools for stealing information.|$|E
25|$|On September 28, 2006, 3Sharp, {{a privately}} held {{technical}} services firm, published {{the results of}} a study, commissioned by Microsoft, evaluating eight <b>anti-phishing</b> solutions in which Internet Explorer 7 (Beta 3) came out on top. The study evaluated the ability to block phish, to warn about phish, and to allow good sites.|$|E
25|$|As {{recently}} as 2007, {{the adoption of}} <b>anti-phishing</b> strategies by businesses needing to protect personal and financial information was low. Now there are several different techniques to combat phishing, including legislation and technology created specifically to protect against phishing. These techniques include steps {{that can be taken}} by individuals, as well as by organizations. Phone, web site, and email phishing can now be reported to authorities, as described below.|$|E
25|$|Kaspersky's {{consumer}} software {{include the}} Antivirus, Internet Security and Total Security products. The Antivirus software includes malware protection, monitors the PC for suspicious program behavior, and warns users about potentially dangerous websites. The Internet Security software adds privacy features, parental controls, <b>anti-phishing</b> tools. Total Security adds parental controls, adult website filters, diagnostic tools, a Password Manager application, and other features. Kaspersky's software {{is available for}} Macs, PCs, Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, BlackBerry and Symbian.|$|E
500|$|Phishing {{protection}} now integrates with Mozilla Firefox. Testing by PC Magazine {{found that}} Norton blocked 94 percent of phishing sites, compared to 83 percent for Internet Explorer 7 and 77 percent for Firefox 2. CNET identified {{an issue with}} the feature; when <b>anti-phishing</b> is disabled, the Identity Safe still offers users to automatically submit personal information to websites, including phishing sites. Symantec declined {{to call it a}} [...] "flaw", stating it is recommended to use the Identity Safe with <b>anti-phishing</b> enabled. Alternatively, the Identity Safe could be used with Firefox and Internet Explorer's built-in <b>anti-phishing</b> capability.|$|E
2500|$|An {{article in}} Forbes in August 2014 {{argues that the}} reason {{phishing}} problems persist even {{after a decade of}} <b>anti-phishing</b> technologies being sold is that phishing is [...] "a technological medium to exploit human weaknesses" [...] and that technology cannot fully compensate for human weaknesses.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, Senator Patrick Leahy {{introduced}} the <b>Anti-Phishing</b> Act of 2005 in Congress on March 1, 2005. This bill, {{if it had}} been enacted into law, would have subjected criminals who created fake web sites and sent bogus emails in order to defraud consumers to fines of up to [...] and prison terms of up to five years.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007, the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Spam Data Mining for Law Enforcement Applications project {{examined}} {{a large amount}} of spam supporting Paul's candidacy. Gary Warner, UAB's director of computer forensics, called the spamming [...] "a criminal act in support of a campaign," [...] but stated that he does not believe the campaign itself is in any way responsible. Paul's spokesman, Jesse Benton, said in an email to Wired magazine calling the spamming the work of [...] "a well-intentioned yet misguided supporter or someone with bad intentions trying to embarrass the campaign." [...] The spamming resulted in the removal of at least one Paul video from YouTube, according to <b>anti-phishing</b> researcher Chris Barton of McAfee.|$|E

The {{results of this study}} have been questioned by critics, criticising that the testing data was sourced exclusively from PhishTank, itself an <b>anti-phishing</b> provider. The study only compared Internet Explorer and Firefox, and left out among others Netcraft Toolbar and the Opera browser, both of which use data from PhishTank in their <b>anti-phishing</b> solutions.
