25|$|In early 1800, Régénérée left Rochefort with Africaine {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} to Alexandria. At the Action of 19 February 1801, HMS Phoebe, under Captain Robert Barlow, captured Africaine east of Gibraltar. However, Régénérée managed to complete her mission, sailing into Alexandria on 2 March, having eluded the British blockade. The day {{before she had}} passed through the British fleet answering signals and without arousing any suspicion, until <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>she</b> hoisted the French flag as she headed into the harbor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bother! I {{did tell}} you. This {{kind of thing}} always turns up <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> <b>She's</b> a very good kind of a woman, and the {{daughter}} is all that she ought to be." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{poor woman}} hesitated, and <b>at</b> <b>last</b> said <b>she</b> {{had spent the}} night walking about the streets.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Shelby cried {{very much}} about it, but <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> though <b>she</b> was very, very unhappy she fell asleep.|$|R
500|$|As {{the evening}} progressed Huskisson {{continued}} to weaken. The doctors {{had concluded that}} without amputation {{he would continue to}} deteriorate, but that he had no realistic chance of surviving major surgery, and broke this news to the Huskissons. William Huskisson already believed that he was dying and had resigned himself to his fate; Emily Huskisson at first caused [...] "a dreadful scene... but <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>she</b> calmed herself and {{during the rest of the}} time sat weeping by the couch". Huskisson told Brandreth [...] "You see I shall never live to make any return for your kindness. You have done all that is possible, but it is all in vain." [...] After further laudanum, he complained [...] "Why endeavour to support my strength? I must die, it is only prolonging my sufferings." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{harm done}} by Formosa lies in this,— that the {{character}} is utterly false, false to human nature and false to London life. She is a wretch, abominable almost beyond conception, {{so as to be}} odious, if known, to the most odious. She is sharper as well as prostitute,—and is false to all with whom she comes in contact, to those whom she is supposed to love and to those who love her. Her peculiar profession is represented as causing her no personal remorse. And yet she is exhibited to us as a fine creature, a noble woman, one whom a man might be honoured by loving;—and <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>she</b> ends with a success! ... That which is vile and dirty, squalid and miserable,—that, of which we may say that were its horrors known such knowledge would deter more thoroughly than any ignorance,—is exhibited as a bright existence, full of danger indeed, but still open to all that is noble, and capable of final success.|$|E
500|$|Returning {{to musical}} cinema, she starred as Ruth in The Pirates of Penzance (1983), a film based on Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera {{of the same}} name, and while filming it in London sang on a {{recording}} of The Beggar's Opera. This was followed by an appearance as the grandmother in Gothic fantasy film The Company of Wolves (1984). Lansbury had also begun work for television, appearing in a 1982 television film with Bette Davis titled Little Gloria... Happy <b>at</b> <b>Last.</b> <b>She</b> followed this with an appearance in CBS's [...] (1983), later describing it as [...] "the most unsophisticated thing you can imagine". A BBC television film followed, A Talent for Murder (1984), in which she played a wheelchair-bound mystery writer; although describing it as [...] "a rush job", she agreed {{to do it in}} order to work with co-star Laurence Olivier. Two further miniseries featuring Lansbury appeared in 1984: Lace and [...]|$|E
60|$|Beatrice gave a sigh, and {{collected}} her scattered energies. The storm had burst <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> and <b>she</b> must face it.|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>last</b> came <b>she</b> whom Tarzan sought, with lithe sinews rolling beneath shimmering hide; fat {{and glossy}} came Sabor, the lioness.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>at</b> <b>last</b> did <b>she</b> speak. But {{her voice}} sounded toneless and dull, as of one who speaks in a dream.|$|R
2500|$|Many of Baudelaire's {{works were}} {{published}} posthumously. After his death, his mother paid off his substantial debts, and <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>she</b> found some comfort in Baudelaire's emerging fame. [...] "I see that my son, {{for all his}} faults, has his place in literature." [...] She lived another four years.|$|E
2500|$|She also {{starred in}} {{operetta}} and musical comedy: [...] Her 1915 Broadway debut {{came in a}} Franz Lehár operetta written especially for her entitled Alone <b>at</b> <b>Last.</b> <b>She</b> later starred for the Shuberts in revivals of H.M.S. Pinafore and The Mikado, and for the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company in Carmen. [...] In addition, she regularly toured nationally and in Europe with leading orchestras.|$|E

Insecure at Last: Losing It In Our Security-Obsessed World (Villard; Hardcover; October 3, 2006). [...] In Insecure <b>at</b> <b>Last,</b> <b>she</b> explores how people live today, the measures people take to keep themselves safe, and how people can experience freedom by {{letting go of the}} deceptive notion of [...] "protection." [...] In 2006 Ensler also co-edited A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant, and A Prayer, an anthology of writings about violence against women.|$|E
60|$|Jacinta's {{face was}} crimson <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> but <b>she</b> {{in no way}} {{attempted}} to question the correctness of the announcement he had made.|$|R
6000|$|... "The very man I {{wanted to}} see!" [...] cried Phil, with gleaming eyes, as he seized his friend's hand. [...] "I've got mother over to London <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> <b>She's</b> longing to see you. Come {{out with me}} this evening--do. But I'm in sudden perplexity: I've just been sent for to do some extra duty. It won't take me half an hour.--You're not engaged, are you?" ...|$|R

2500|$|When Changing Woman {{was ready}} to depart for her new home, the Mirage People and the Ground Mist People {{prepared}} to go with her. She said goodbye to First Man and First Woman and to her two sons. Then she and the Holy People passed through the mountains at [...] (Red Knife), and in the [...] Valley they celebrated her betrothal to [...] Her hips widened, and her breasts grew large. The elk and buffalo multiplied, and some left her herd to form other herds and spread across the land. <b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>she</b> and her party and animals came {{to the end of}} the land, and then to her floating house beyond the shore. Then , Monster Slayer, and his brother , Water Born, traveled to , where the Pine River flows into the San Juan, and there they continue to live below the earth. A petroglyph was made on the canyon wall just above the water level to mark the place.|$|E
6000|$|Even {{yet there}} was a trial in store for her patience. Some minutes elapsed--minutes that seemed hours--before she found the right key and raised {{the lid of the}} bureau. <b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>she</b> drew out the inner drawer! <b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>she</b> had the letter in her hand! ...|$|E
60|$|Then a low and awful cry, and Morris {{turned to}} behold Mary his wife. <b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>she</b> {{had seen and}} heard, and read his naked heart. <b>At</b> <b>last</b> <b>she</b> knew him--mad, and in his madness, most unfaithful--a man who loved one dead and dragged her down to earth for company.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{bound to}} admit that since I was <b>at</b> home <b>last</b> <b>she's</b> a novelty. A girl like that with such people--it IS a new type." ...|$|R

60|$|It filled Gudrun with {{a strange}} rapture.
