40|$|Anti-scatter grids {{have been}} widely used to reject scatter and {{increase}} the perceptibility of low-contrast object in chest radiography; however they also attenuate the primary x-rays, resulting in a substantial degradation of primary information. Compensation for this degradation requires the use of higher exposure technique hence higher dose to the patient. A more efficient approach to reject scatter is the slot-scan imaging technique which employs a narrow scanning x-ray fan beam in conjunction with a slit or slot shaped solid state detector or an area detector used with an aft-collimator. With this approach, scatter can be rejected effectively without the need to attenuate primary x-rays. This paper demonstrates an electronic aft-collimation method, referred to as the alternate line erasure and readout (ALER) technique, for implementing the slot-scan digital radiography with a modern flat-panel detector. With this technique, instead of first exposing the detector and then reading the image line by line, the image line on {{the leading edge of the}} scanning fan beam is reset to erase the scatter accumulated prior to the arrival of the fan beam x-rays, while the image line on the trailing edge of the scanning fan beam is read out to acquire the image signals following the fan-beam exposure. These reset and readout processes are alternated and repeated as the x-ray fan beam scans across the detector. An anthropomorphic chest phantom was imaged to evaluate the scatter rejection ability and the low-contrast performance for the ALER technique and compare them with those for the <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> method in full-field chest imaging. With a projected beam width of 16 mm, the slot-scan∕ALER technique resulted in an average reduction of the scatter-to-primary ratios by 81 %, 84 %, 82 %, and 86 % versus 65 %, 73 %, 74 %, and 73 % with the <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> method in the lungs, mediastinum, retrocardium, and subdiaphragm, respectively.

40|$|International audiencePurpose: In digital X-ray radiography, an <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> is {{inserted}} between {{the patient and}} the image receptor to reduce scattered radiation. If the <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> is used in a stationary way, gridline artifacts will appear in the final image. In most of the gridline removal image processing methods, the useful information with spatial frequencies close to that of the gridline is usually lost or degraded. In this study, a new stationary gridline suppression method is designed to preserve more of the useful information. Methods: The method is as follows. The input image is first recursively decomposed into several smaller sub-images using a multi-scale 2 D discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The decomposition process stops when the gridline signal is found to be greater than a threshold in one or several of these sub-images using a gridline detection module. An automatic Gaussian band-stop filter is then applied to the detected sub-images to remove the gridline signal. Finally, the restored image is achieved using the corresponding 2 D inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT). Results: The processed images show that the proposed method can remove the gridline signal efficiently while maintaining the image details. The spectra of a 1 -dimensional Fourier transform of the processed images demonstrate that, compared with some existing gridline removal methods, the proposed method has better information preservation after the removal of the gridline artifacts.

Methods: An anthropomorphic pelvis phantom was placed on a device that allowed the adjustment of different air gap thicknesses introduced between the phantom and the image receptor of Computed Radiography (CR) and Digital Radiography (DR) systems. Grid and non-grid images with different air gap thicknesses of both systems were produced. Ovary and testes doses were measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters. Radiographic quality of all images was rated by 5 experienced radiographers blindly using the Image Quality Score (IQS) and Visual Grading Analysis (VGA) systems. Results: Images of diagnostic quality were produced while the grid was replaced by a range of 0 - 25 cm air gap thickness in the pelvic radiographic examination. At non-grid examination with 10 cm air gap thickness, a maximum of relative dose reduction by 70. 7 % and 81. 6 % at CR; 68. 6 % and 79. 4 % at DR were achieved respectively at ovary and testes locations of the phantom as compared with their corresponding grid examinations.

As indices for grid evaluation, we calculated the selectivity, Bucky factor, and the signal-to-noise ratio improvement factor (SIF) by measuring rates of scatter transmission, primary transmission, and total transmission (based on the digitally displayed measurement values of the FPD system), using 4 acrylic phantoms of different thicknesses. The results showed that the SIF was less than 1. 0 when the phantom thickness was 5 cm. When the phantom thickness was 25 cm and the grid ratio was 16 : 1, the SIF was 1. 505 and 1. 518 (maximum value) at 90 and 120 kV, respectively. Compared with the grid ratio of 12 : 1, the SIF at the grid ratio 16 : 1 was improved by 6. 1 % at 90 kV, and by 7. 0 % at 120 kV. In a direct-conversion FPD system, the grid ratio of 16 : 1 is considered adequate for eliminating the scattered-radiation effect when much scattered radiation is present, such as with a thick imaged object or a high X-ray tube voltage. © Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics 2011.

40|$|For imaging during minimally-invasive {{treatment}} in the so-called catheter laboratory conventional X-ray projection imaging is classically used. Particularly in cardio-vascular angiography and neuroradiology, so-called C-arm systems are used, enabling a flexible positioning of X-ray tube and detector. In the last years, these systems experienced the most important technical innovation {{with the introduction of}} 3 D imaging functionality by means of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). With this technique a large number of projections is acquired during a rotation of the C-arm around the patient. Afterwards, these projections are reconstructed to volumetric images using algorithms similar to those used in classical computed tomography. The objective of current research is to improve the 3 D image quality in order to extend the imaging capability to high quality low contrast imaging with C-arm X-ray systems. In this context, this thesis addresses the problem of scattered radiation. Because in CBCT with large area X-ray detectors the irradiated patient volume is substantially larger than in classical computed tomography, also the amount of scattered radiation reaching the detector is significantly larger and can even be superior to the amount of primary radiation. Therefore, scattered radiation is a major source of image degradation and nonlinearity in flat-detector based CBCT and is the most severe cause of inhomogeneity artifacts in reconstructed images. The primary objectives of this thesis are the detailed quantitative analysis of scattered radiation, the assessment of existing scatter compensation methods as well as the development of new effective methods for the reduction of scatter induced artifacts. After an introduction to the physical and algorithmic principles of CBCT {{in the first part of}} the thesis, at first a detailed quantitative analysis of the characteristics of scattered radiation in projections of CBCT is undertaken. This analysis is based on the advancements of a Monte-Carlo CBCT simulator allowing to study realistic and clinically relevant patient geometries obtained from real data sets of conventional computed tomography. With this method practically noise free reference data sets for typical measurement objects such as the head, thorax and pelvis region are generated that allow to exactly study the influence of scattered radiation and that are used in the course of the thesis for the assessment of the various methods for scatter compensation. Subsequently, the impact of scattered radiation on the reconstructed volume is quantitatively studied. For this purpose, and as one of the key contributions of this thesis, a mathematical description of the propagation of the most relevant image quality characteristics, signal, contrast, and noise from the projections into the reconstructed volume is derived. Based on this description and based on the well known Feldkamp-algorithm, new reconstruction algorithms are developed that – instead of the usual CT Hounsfield values – allow for reconstruction of the respective image quality feature, ie, voxel-wise inhomogeneities, voxel-wise decrease of object contrast, and voxel-wise standard deviations of the noise. Using the developed analysis method and based on the created reference data sets a comprehensive study of <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grids</b> as the classical method of scatter suppression reveals that the quality of <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grids</b> available for X-ray flat-detectors is not sufficient in order to effectively suppress scatter induced artifacts. Additionally, the investigation shows that usage of strongly scatter reducing <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grids</b> has a negative impact on the signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, in order to provide the desired image quality in low-contrast CBCT, it is essential to correct for scatter contained in the projections by means of software-based a-posteriori methods. In literature, however, so far no practical methods can be found. Therefore – as second important contribution – in this thesis a number of new scatter compensation methods have been developed. These can be grouped in four different classes: post-processing techniques performed in 3 D reconstructed images, methods using model based Monte-Carlo simulations, methods based on single scatter estimation schemes, and iterative methods using artifact evaluation and feedback schemes. All correction methods are comparatively validated using the clinical reference data sets. It is shown that especially exploitation of both available data domains, the planar projection data and the 3 D information, allows for combating the large scatter background present in this application and to meet the demanding accuracy requirements to achieve the expected image quality in CBCT...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Radiation doses {{have been}} {{monitored}} {{for a long}} time, as we are aware that radiation can produce biological effects. However, there is {{a limited amount of}} information available on patient dose from cervical spine examinations. In addition, the techniques used are variable between radiographic departments and even radiographers within one department. The difference in technique of particular concern is the use of radiographic grids. While it reduces scatter and improve image quality, the use of a grid demands increased exposure factors and dose to obtain the same optical density on the film. Method: This study investigated the range of doses for lateral cervical spine examinations in the Hunter and Sydney metropolitan regions of New South Wales, Australia. Radiation doses were calculated from X-ray tube output measurements and patient exposure parameters. Results: Differences in dose for 116 patients (53 non-grid, 63 grid) examined on 13 X-ray units were analysed. The study calculated the mean entrance surface dose for the non-grid system (228 μGy) to be significantly lower at the 95 % significance level than the mean entrance surface dose for the grid techniques (505 μGy). However, the use of a grid for computed radiography systems did not produce any differences in dose with the use or non-use of a grid, while there was a three-fold increase for film-screen systems.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Current {{research}} in the area of two-phase flow utilizes a wide variety of sensing devices, but some limitations exist on the information which can be obtained. Neutron radiography is a feasible alternative to "see" the two-phase flow. A system to perform neutron radiographic analysis of dynamic events which occur on the order of several milliseconds has been developed at Oregon State University. Two different methods have been used to radiograph the simulated two-phase flow. These pulsed or "flash" radiography and high speed movie neutron radiography serve as a "snapshot" with an exposure time ranging from 10 to 20 milliseconds. In high speed movie radiography, a scintillator is used to convert neutrons into light which is enhanced by an optical intensifier and then photographed by a high speed camera. Both types of radiography utilize the pulsing capability of the OSU TRIGA reactor. In order to predict the visibility of the images in two-phase flow, two computer codes, an SN program and a Monte Carlo program, have been written. The visibility is expressed in the relative neutron density on the film. The principle difficulty with this type of neutron radiography is the fogging of the image due to the large amount of scattering in the water. This difficulty can be overcome by using thin regions for the two-phase flow, heavy water instead of light water, or an <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid.</b> The improvement using an <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> has been modeled with the computer programs.

40|$|The {{main problem}} {{connected}} to cone beam computed tomography (CT) systems for industrial applications employing 450 kV X-ray tubes {{is the high}} amount of scattered radiation which {{is added to the}} primary radiation (signal). This stray radiation leads to a significant degradation of the image quality. A better understanding of the scattering and methods to reduce its effects are therefore necessary to improve the image quality. Several studies have been carried out in the medical field at lower energies, whereas studies in industrial CT, especially for energies up to 450 kV, are lacking. Moreover, the studies reported in literature do not consider the scattered radiation generated by the CT system structure and the walls of the X-ray room (environmental scatter). In order to investigate the scattering on CT projections a GEANT 4 -based Monte Carlo (MC) model was developed. The model, which has been validated against experimental data, has enabled the calculation of the scattering including the environmental scatter, the optimization of an <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> suitable for the CT system, and the optimization of the hardware components of the CT system. The investigation of multiple scattering in the CT projections showed that its contribution is 2. 3 times the one of primary radiation for certain objects.

40|$|Breast {{cancer has}} a {{significant}} impact on the well-being of the female population both nationwide and worldwide. This bas motivated the establishment of national breast screening programmes in most western countries, in order to reduce the mortality associated with this disease via early detection. X-ray mammography is considered the current gold standard technique for breast cancer detection in such screening programmes. However, this suffers from performance limitations due to tissue superposition which can either mimic or obscure malignant pathology. Therefore, alternative X-ray modalities, such as digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), which employs a series of X-ray projections at different (but limited) angles, are being explored in order to improve breast cancer detection rates. In all such X-ray based imaging methods, scattered photons produced deleterious effects on image quality to varying degrees. In order to model such scatter distribution, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations is often chosen as the default approach, and as such is used in this thesis to quantify its effect-s in X-ray mammography and DBT scenarios. Following validation on the use of the GEANT 4 MC package for use in mammography, three commercially available full-field digital mammography (FFDM) systems were simulated with their corresponding anti-scatter grids using a CDMAM geometry. It was observed that, for the particular geometry studied, the scattered radiation recorded at the detector was 17 % using a linear <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> design. However, this figure was reduced by a factor of three when employing a cellular <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> geometry. In DBT geometries, scattered radiation is larger than in FFDM and, spatially, may vary more rapidly due to the absence of an <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid.</b> The excessively long times needed to run MC simulations (8 - 10 hours) for such analysis motivates the need for an alternative approach. A non-stationary kernel-based approach has thus been developed. It was found that using kernels based on breast thickness-only, can overestimate scatter radiation by more than 60 % (compared to MC simulations) at the breast edge region. Simulation work presented here shows that this overestimation in scatter is largely due to the air gap between the lower curved breast edge and the image receptor. In t his thesis, a more accurate scatter field estimator is proposed for use in DBT which not only considers the breast thickness and primary incidence angle, but also accounts for scatter exiting the breast edge region and traversing an air gap prior to absorption in the image receptor. This proposed approach has reduced such errors to an average error of 10 % in scatter, and a maximum of 20 % across the projected breast phantom, and has decreased the run-time ten-fold. Such an approach has potential applications in scatter correction methods in DBT, and as an efficient modelling tool in imaging system development and in evaluation of virtual clinical trials.

40|$|Purpose: A new hybrid {{simulation}} {{for medical}} imaging which combines deterministic computation of X-ray attenuation and single-scatter contributions with estimates of higher-order scattering via Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation. Method and materials: We employed mathematically defined objects in simulations of various scanner geometries. Additional {{features such as}} the use of form filters or <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grids</b> were included. For the primary signal, X-ray attenuation was computed along the direct rays from the focus to each detector element. In addition, by summing single Compton or Rayleigh scattering processes inside the object over all paths from the focus to the all detector elements, we calculated the corresponding single-scatter contribution to the signal. Standard MC simulations were used to validate the deterministic method and to compare the contribution from single scattering to the full scatter signal. Differences were determined in the hybrid simulation by a time-optimized MC estimate. The simulations compared to data measured on a CT scanner and a C-arm system using phantoms of various shapes and sizes. Results: Results for the deterministic calculated primary and single-scatter signal were in agreement to within 1 - 3 % with the MC simulations. Depending on the material and size of the object, the relative contribution of the single to the full scatter signal varied considerably. The structure in the scatter images was mainly determined by the single scatter signal in all simulations; the difference images therefore show little or no structure and can thus be estimated efficiently by an adapted coarse MC simulation. The hybrid method considerably reduced the computational costs as compared to standard MC. The images from our simulations were in good agreement with the measured data. Conclusions: The new hybrid simulation method allows to assess scatter contributions at low computational expense as compared to standard MC. Thereby it provides a potential basis for systematic scatter corrections in X-ray tomography. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Scattered {{radiation}} is an undesired signal largely present in most digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) projection images as no physically rejection methods, i. e. <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grids,</b> are regularly employed, {{in contrast to}} full- field digital mammography. This scatter signal might reduce the visibility of small objects in the image, and potentially affect the detection of small breast lesions. Thus accurate scatter models are needed to minimise the scattered radiation signal via post-processing algorithms. All prior work on scattered radiation estimation has assumed a rigid breast compression paddle (RP) and reported large contribution of scatter signal from RP in the detector. However, in this work, flexible paddles (FPs) tilting from 0 ° to 10 ° will be studied using Monte Carlo simulations to analyse if the scatter distribution differs from RP geometries. After reproducing the Hologic Selenia Dimensions geometry (narrow angle) with two (homogeneous and heterogeneous) compressed breast phantoms, results illustrate that the scatter distribution recorded at the detector varies up to 22 % between RP and FP geometries (depending on the location), mainly due to the decrease in thickness of the breast observed for FP.

The standard attenuation rate (SAR), a quantitative normalised representation of breast tissue for image analysis applications, incorporates a model of scatter, and a software correction of the image blurring arising from scatter within the image signal. A tissue equivalent phantom is used to investigate the possibility, in terms of both image sharpness and noise, of replacing the physical grid with the software correction in the SAR. Encouraging results are reported, software correction almost matching the performance of the grid, whilst maintaining a superior signal-to-noise ratio. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

H 577 P HTI 2015 Chanxliii, 378 pages :illustrations (some color); 30 cmRadiation {{safety to}} the {{patients}} in medical imaging is always of high importance. Spine and pelvic radiographic examinations that involve a relatively high radiation dose to the radiosensitive organs of the patients are of particularly concern. A major reason for the relatively high dose being delivered to patients in these examinations {{is caused by the}} application of an <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid.</b> To this end, the main theme {{of this study was to}} explore the feasibility of replacing the <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> by an optimal air gap in spine and pelvic radiography to maximize the dose reduction effect in patients while retaining the resultant images of diagnostic quality in computed radiography (CR) and digital radiography (DR) systems using an anthropomorphic RANDO phantom. To gain a holistic picture on the mechanism of this dose reduction method, it was important to uncover the scientific basis on the dose and scatter distribution patterns in diagnostic radiography. One objective of this research project was to uncover the air kerma distribution patterns of the x-ray tube output and the subsequent scatter distribution within and around a homogenous scattering medium by generating the 3 D dose maps. These were achieved by the physical measurement of air kerma at selected sites by an ionization chamber detector or thermoluminescent dosimeters and, coupled with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations on the measured data. Results on the investigation of air kerma distribution patterns among the three different brands of x-ray tube revealed the unique skewed shape 3 D distribution maps from the output of the studied x-ray tubes. This finding filled the knowledge gap on the anode heel effect investigation as was reflected on the characteristics variation of radiation intensity output of the x-ray tube. Findings on the investigation of air kerma distribution patterns on the water-equivalent dry slabs phantom by MC simulation on the photon transport uncovered the non-uniform distribution of scatter inside and around the scattering medium, and were presented in three-dimensional maps. Results on the investigation of dose reduction by the air gap method using the RANDO phantom confirmed that significant dose reduction effect with retention of image quality at diagnostic level was confirmed in all of the tested radiographic examinations in both the CR and DR systems. These examinations included cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, pelvis and full spine. Image Quality Score (IQS) and Visual Grading Analysis (VGA) tests were employed as the image evaluation methods for the assessors to determine the image quality of the images in according to the pre-set criteria. Among the non-grid images with different air gap thicknesses in place, those images being rated with the highest scores in both tests were considered as the best in image quality. Results on the IQS and VGA scores uncovered that the optimal air gap thickness for each of the tested radiographic examinations was in the range of 5 cm to 20 cm. By replacing the <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> with an optimal air gap thickness, a substantial dose reduction effect ranging from 46. 7 % to 81. 6 % at the regions of radiosensitive organs of the tested RANDO phantom was evidenced. Effective doses simulated from the PCXMC 2. 0 program further revealed that a substantial dose reduction effect ranging from 50. 3 % to 80 % was found in the non-grid examinations with the optimal air gap thickness, which indicated that the risks on cancer induction could be reduced in the similar fashion. Of the same kind of radiographic examination, a further reduction in both the effective and organ doses by 3. 8 % to 18. 2 % were achieved while changing the imaging system from CR to DR. In conclusion, the use of an optimal air gap to replace the <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> was proven to be an effective dose reduction method on high dose spine and pelvis radiographic examinations in both the CR and DR systems with image quality retained at the diagnostic level as was proven in the present study on a RANDO phantom model.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to evaluate the image quality of clinical Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) systems. This is done by evaluating image ac-quisition performance of clinical FFDM in a comprehensive way that accounts for scatter, focal spot un-sharpness, detector blur and <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> performance using an anthro-pomorphic phantom. Additionally we intend to provide a limited evaluation of the effects that image processing in clinical FFDM has in signal detectability. Methodology: We explored different strategies {{and a variety of}} mathematical model observers in order to evaluate the performance of clinical FFDM systems under different conditions. To evaluate image acquisition performance, we tested a system-model-based Hotelling observer (SMHO) model on a bench-top system using a uniform anthropomor-phic phantom for an signal known exactly background known exactly (SKE/BKE) task. We then applied this concept on two clinical FFDM systems to compare their perfor-mance. In a limited study to evaluate the effects of image processing in the detectability of FFDM, we implemented the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) model on clinically realistic images of an anatomical phantom for an SKE/BKE task...|$|E
40|$|In mammography, the {{reduction}} of scattered X-rays is vital due to the low contrast or small dimension of the details that are searched for. The typical method of doing so in current conventional mammography is the <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid.</b> The disadvantage of this method is the absorption of a proportion of the primary beam and therefore an increase in dose is required {{to compensate for the}} loss of counts. An alternative method is proposed, using quasi-monochromatic beams and a pixellated spectroscopic detector. As Compton-scattered X-rays lose energy in the scattering process, they are detected at a lower energy in the spectrum. Therefore the spectrum can be windowed around the monochromatic energy peak, removing the scattered Xrays from the image. The work presented here shows contrast improvement of up to 50 % and contrast to noise ratio improvements of around 20 % for scatter free imaging in comparison to full spectrum imaging. Contrast improvements of around 45 % were found when comparing scatter free images to conventional polychromatic imaging for both the low contrast test object and the Rachel anthropomorphic breast phantom...|$|E
40|$|The {{shape of}} the energy {{spectrum}} produced by an x-ray tube has a great importance in mammography. Many anode-filtration combinations have been proposed to obtain the most effective spectrum shape for the image quality-dose relationship. On the other hand, third generation synchrotrons such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble are able to produce a high flux of monoenergetic radiation. It is thus a powerful tool to study the effect of beam energy on image quality and dose in mammography. An objective method {{was used to evaluate}} image quality and dose in mammography with synchrotron radiation and to compare them to standard conventional units. It was performed systematically in the energy range of interest for mammography through the evaluation of a global image quality index and through the measurement of the mean glandular dose. Compared to conventional mammography units, synchrotron radiation shows a great improvement of the image quality-dose relationship, which is due to the beam monochromaticity and to the high intrinsic collimation of the beam, which allows the use of a slit instead of an <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> for scatter rejection...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of digital breast tomosynthesis into clinical practice requires quality control procedures. In {{this study we}} have investigated whether {{the assessment of the}} average glandular dose for modelled standard breasts can be performed using a combination of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyethylene (PE) slabs that matches standard breast thicknesses. For this purpose the energies absorbed per unit area of the image receptor when imaging standard breasts and PMMA-PE slabs have been matched taking account of both primary and scattered photons. To achieve this a two-step approach was used. Firstly, the behaviour of the scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR) of PMMA-PE phantoms and standard breasts was investigated using Monte Carlo simulations for various conditions. For imaging without an <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid,</b> {{it was found that the}} values of standard breast and phantom SPR were significantly different and it follows that these differences are relevant when matching the absorbed energy. In the second part, a set of PMMA-PE combinations is proposed which, for dosimetric purposes, can be used to simulate standard breasts in the thickness range 20 to 100 mm. The dosimetric error when using these PMMA-PE slabs was found to be below 6 % for thicknesses up to 7 cm and increases to 10 % for 10 cm thicknes...|$|E

30|$|Bedside CXR is {{the imaging}} {{modality}} {{of choice for}} evaluation of the chest in ICU-patients, since these patients need to be monitored closely and are often less mobile due to mechanical ventilation or other medical devices such as drains and tubes. However, the diagnostic value of portable CXR in the ICU is significantly lower when compared to a CXR obtained with a dedicated wall-mounted flat panel device. First of all, compared to a standard posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral (LAT) exam, the portable anterior-posterior (AP) exam of a bedridden patient in supine position shows an apparently enlarged width of the heart, which may obscure retrocardiac structures, especially in poor inspiration. Also, the detection and assessment of certain abnormalities (e.g. pneumothorax) {{is known to be}} more difficult on portable CXR obtained in a reclining patient when compared to CXR acquired from an upright patient [9]. Additionally, the clinical condition of the patient often hinders optimal patient positioning, causing asymmetric images and superposition of anatomical structures (e.g. of the clavicles over the lung apices). Frequently, superposition of devices, tubes and catheters as well as patient related factors (obesity, hypoventilation, motion) further reduce the quality of the portable CXR in the ICU. Finally, the portable CXR is subject to technical limitations: images are acquired using a voltage of 90 kVp instead of 120 kVp, resulting in a less translucent appearance of the ribs. Image contrast in portable CXR is also reduced due to the absence of an <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid</b> while the reduced source-image distance of only 1.2 m causes higher geometrical distortions [10].|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} whether standard X-ray acquisition factors for orbital radiographs {{are suitable for}} the detection of ferromagnetic intra-ocular foreign bodies in patients undergoing MRI. Method: 35 observers, at varied levels of education in radiography, attending a European Dose Optimisation EURASMUS Summer School were asked to score 24 images of varying acquisition factors against a clinical standard (reference image) using two alternative forced choice. The observers were provided with 12 questions and a 5 point Likert scale. Statistical tests were used to validate the scale, and scale reliability was also measured. The images which scored equal to, or better than, the reference image (36) were ranked alongside their corresponding effective dose (E), the image with the lowest dose equal to or better than the reference is considered the new optimum acquisition factors. Results: Four images emerged as equal to, or better than, the reference in terms of image quality. The images were then ranked in order of E. Only one image that scored the same as the reference had a lower dose. The reference image had a mean E of 3. 31 μSv, the image that scored the same had an E of 1. 8 μSv. Conclusion: Against the current clinical standard exposure factors of 70 kVp, 20 mAs and the use of an anti- scatter grid, one image proved to have a lower E whilst maintaining the same level of image quality and lesion visibility. It is suggested that the new exposure factors should be 60 kVp, 20 mAs and still include the use of an <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid...</b>|$|E
40|$|Radiography using {{film has}} been an {{established}} method for imaging the internal organs of the body for over 100 years. Surveys carried out during the 1980 s identified a wide range in patient doses showing that there was scope for dosage reduction in many hospitals. This paper discusses factors {{that need to be}} considered in optimising the performance of radiographic equipment. The most important factor is choice of the screen/film combination, and the preparation of automatic exposure control devices to suit its characteristics. Tube potential determines the photon energies in the X-ray beam, with the selection involving a compromise between image contrast and the dose to the patient. Allied to this is the choice of <b>anti-scatter</b> <b>grid,</b> as a high grid ratio effectively removes the larger component of scatter when using higher tube potentials. However, a high grid ratio attenuates the X-ray beam more heavily. Decisions about grids and use of low attenuation components are particularly important for paediatric radiography, which uses lower energy X-ray beams. Another factor which can reduce patient dose is the use of copper filtration to remove more low-energy X-rays. Regular surveys of patient dose and comparisons with diagnostic reference levels that provide a guide representing good practice enable units for which doses are higher to be identified. Causes can then be investigated and changes implemented to address any shortfalls. Application of these methods has led to a gradual reduction in doses in many countries. © 2007 Biomedical Imaging and Intervention Journal. All rights reserved.
