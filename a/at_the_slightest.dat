5|$|The addax live {{in desert}} terrain where they eat grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available. Primarily grazers, their staple foods include Aristida, Panicum, and Stipagrostis, {{and they will}} only consume browse, such as leaves of Acacia trees {{in the absence of}} these grasses. Perennials which turn green and sprout <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> bit of {{humidity}} or rain. The addax eat only certain parts of the plant and tend to crop the Aristida grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while they eat the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax diet, being their main source of protein.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} {{states the}} need to defeat the royalist forces and therefore proposes many possible actions similar to those employed by Jacobins during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution. It rejected the use of political moderation, considering {{that it would be}} dangerous during revolutionary times. It compared the South American revolution, still in its early stages, with the French and North American ones, and even the revolution in Spain itself, pointing out that none of those relied solely in conspiracies or secret meetings. The document proposes to favor patriots, and fill the state offices with them. Peninsulars, on the other hand, should be carefully monitored, and punished <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> proof of action against the Junta, and executed if they were rich or influential. For this end, the Junta would need to create an espionage network. This policy towards peninsulars is coherent with the actions taken against the Liniers counter-revolution, and similar to the one employed by Simón Bolívar in the North shortly after. Moreno thought that José Gervasio Artigas would be an invaluable ally, and that Buenos Aires should use any resource at its disposal to have him join the fight against absolutism. He noted the internal conflicts in Chile and Paraguay, and urged support of local patriots against local royalists.|$|E

25|$|In {{the hub of}} {{the wheel}} are three animals: a pig, a snake, and a bird. They {{represent}} the three poisons of ignorance, aversion, and attachment, respectively. The pig stands for ignorance; this comparison is based on the Indian concept of a pig being the most foolish of animals, since it sleeps in the dirtiest places and eats whatever comes to its mouth. The snake represents aversion or anger; this is because it will be aroused and strike <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> touch. The bird represents attachment (also translated as desire or clinging). The particular bird used in this diagram represents an Indian bird that is very attached to its partner. These three animals represent the three poisons, which are the core of the bhavacakra. From these three poisons, the whole cycle of existence evolves.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{begin to}} arise within the Maroons when Adéwalé plots further raids against the slave trade. Bastienne objects, as de Fayet will only punish those trapped in slavery further as punishment. Adéwalé ignores her, but is horrified when he {{witnesses}} a frigate fire on an unarmed slave ship {{to prevent the}} slaves from joining the Maroons. Adéwalé boards the slave ship and manages to save a few slaves from drowning before the ship capsized with the rest. He plans retribution, but Bastienne cautions that taking revenge will weaken the Maroons' cause; if Adéwalé is to kill de Fayet, then he should do so acting {{as an agent of}} justice. After assaulting the Governor's Mansion, pursuing him through the city and fighting off a local garrison, Adéwalé finally corners and kills de Fayet, who claims that slaves are incapable of self-governance and turn to armed uprising <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> provocation. Adéwalé points out that none of the slaves or overseers came to his aid, and instead let him die. After killing de Fayet, Adéwalé returns to say goodbye to Bastienne before returning to the Assassin Order, but pledging to use his newfound convictions to aid people who are oppressed rather than the cause of their would-be liberators.|$|E

500|$|Coward was no fan of {{the works}} of Gilbert and Sullivan, but as a {{songwriter}} was nevertheless strongly influenced by them. He recalled: [...] "I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them... my aunts and uncles, who were legion, sang them singly and in unison <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> provocation."

500|$|The American and British musical owes a {{tremendous}} debt to G, who were admired and copied by early musical theatre authors and composers such as Ivan Caryll, Adrian Ross, Lionel Monckton, P. G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton, and Victor Herbert, and later Jerome Kern, Ira Gershwin, Yip Harburg, Irving Berlin, Ivor Novello, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Gilbert's lyrics {{served as a}} model for such 20th-century Broadway lyricists as Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, and Lorenz Hart. Noël Coward wrote: [...] "I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them, my nurse, Emma, breathed them through her teeth....

500|$|Toby Creswell {{argues that}} the [...] "Sex Pistols' agenda was inchoate, to say the least. It was a general call to {{rebellion}} that falls apart <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> scrutiny." [...] Critic Ian Birch, writing in 1981, called [...] "stupid" [...] {{the claim that the}} Sex Pistols [...] "had any political significance.... If they did anything, they made a lot of people content with being nothing. They certainly didn't inspire the working classes." [...] While the Conservative triumph in 1979 may be taken as evidence for that position, Julien Temple has noted that the scene inspired by the Sex Pistols [...] "wasn't your kind of two-up, two-down working class normal families, most of it. It was {{over the edge of the}} precipice in social terms. They were actually giving a voice to an area of the working class that was almost beyond the pale." [...] Within a year of [...] "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] that voice was being echoed widely: scores if not hundreds of punk bands had formed across the country—groups composed largely of working-class members or middle-class members who rejected their own class values and pursued solidarity with the working class.|$|E
500|$|Much of Kim Possibles cast {{consists}} of Disney Channel and ABC alumnae, {{as well as}} actors known for their roles on other popular animated and comedy series. The lead role of Kim was originally offered to Anneliese van der Pol, who declined in favor of appearing as Chelsea Daniels on the Disney Channel teen sitcom That's So Raven. After auditioning several actresses to voice the title character, then-16 year-old Christy Carlson Romano was finally cast as Kim after first being introduced to Schooley and McCorkle by Disney Channel executives. Romano had already been well known to Disney Channel audiences for her portrayal of Ren Stevens on the series Even Stevens, and began voicing Kim while completing her stint on the show. Her first voice acting role, Romano immediately identified with her character because both were [...] "dealing with teenage issues" [...] at the same time, comparing Kim's challenge of battling both her personal life and villains to herself balancing schoolwork with her budding acting career; the actress was forced to forfeit her own senior prom due to Kim Possible commitments. Describing her character as [...] "very ambitious, very skilled, very smart," [...] Romano told The New York Times [...] "I've tried to make her a good role model. Her confidence and her sincerity really shine through." [...] One episode in particular, [...] "Blush", was inspired by Romano's modesty and tendency to blush <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> compliment. Romano's performance as Kim was nominated for an Emmy Award. Recognized {{for his ability to}} play [...] "over-the-top characters", Will Friedle, best remembered for his performance as Eric Matthews on the sitcom Boy Meets World, was cast as Ron. Actor Neil Patrick Harris had auditioned for the role, as did actor John Cena before he decided to pursue a professional wrestling career. Schooley attributes much of the show's success to Romano and Friedle's chemistry, explaining, [...] "they add something to this that makes it more than a typical gag-oriented cartoon." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tate {{was born}} Catherine Ford on 12 May 1968 in Bloomsbury, {{where she was}} raised in the Brunswick Centre. Her mother, Josephine, was a florist. Tate has said that the {{character}} of Margaret in The Catherine Tate Show, who shrieks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> of disturbances, is based largely on her mother. Tate never knew her father as he left very early on in her life and, consequently, she was brought up in a female-dominated environment, being cared for by her mother, grandmother, and godparents. As a child, Tate suffered from OCD and was obsessed with word association. For example, she was not able to leave a jumper on the floor because it might have brought misfortune to her mother, whose name began with the letter [...] "J" [...] like [...] "jumper".|$|E
2500|$|Pat's {{interests}} in veganism, Zen Buddhism and his unusual stances on various issues {{seem to be}} driven less by {{an appreciation of the}} philosophies, but more by a desire to feel superior to his friends, and indeed the rest of the world; a [...] "magical Mexican realism" [...] camera, which shows people as they truly feel about themselves, rather than printing an actual photograph of the person, revealed that despite his aggressive veganism, Pat would prefer to eat large quantities of meat. He will often boycott companies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> perceived provocation. His elitist, negative attitude extends to a particular focus on barbers and hairstylists, whom he absolutely despises, for reasons that are never made clear, as well as toll booth operators, Mexican motorists, and employees with disabilities.|$|E

He is cloned {{to create the}} calibani, weaker clones of himself. Caliban speaks in strange speech patterns, with much of his dialogue taken from the dramatic monologue [...] "Caliban upon Setebos" [...] by Robert Browning. Simmons chooses not to portray Caliban as the [...] "oppressed but noble native soul straining under the yoke of capitalist-colonial-imperialism" [...] that current interpretations employ to portray him, which he views as [...] "a weak, pale, politically correct shadow of the slithery monstrosity that made audiences shiver in Shakespeare's day ...
