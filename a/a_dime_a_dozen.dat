Unlike Superman, it's not because he has to do so to keep his identity under wraps—more like he uses his superhero garb to explore different facets of his personality, as evidenced by the title. Somewhere along the storyline, he must tackle the fact that his girlfriend loves his superhero identity more than his unmasked self, and, naturally, face his nemesis, the man who killed his mom and dad—although he really doesn't want to."

40|$|Analyzing a tool {{intended}} to make large projects more manageable and increase programmer productivity is a daunting task. Not only applying transformations to {{a large body of}} code and analyzing its evolution over time is a large, time-consuming effort, but also even {{in the presence of the}} appropriate logistics, measuring and quantifying the results is hard. In an attempt to focus our area of research, we decided to analyze the ArchJava language from two perspectives. One perspective focuses on a comparative analysis of the features offered by ArchJava versus those features emulated in plain Java. Our goal is to obtain some data about ArchJava’s benefits as measured in source code reduction, maintainability, decoupling, error prevention, and error correction. The other direction is performance. For each of ArchJava’s features, we compared them in speed with counterparts implemented in plain Java. The two perspectives are not orthogonal and are salient only when analyzed in simultaneity. On one hand, a feature that reduces coupling might be often useful even though it exacts a cost in performance. On the other hand, costly abstractions are <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen.</b> A good tool strikes the right balance in between the two, and we will try to assess whether this is the case for ArchJava...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: How can {{economic}} policies {{lead us to}} greater wealth, welfare and happiness? There is no bigger question in economics. The answer lies in correct economic theories that capture the causality linking policies to outcomes. Economic theories are <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> – we have more theories than we have human beings. The key need to answer any economic question lies {{in our ability to}} validate theories. Do we live in an Austrian world? In a Keynesian world? A world of rational expectations? This White Paper proposes that major advances in simulating virtual economies is possible and can form the basis for rapid and accurate assessment of current and future economic models. I make general proposals for developing infrastructure, as well as presenting specific ideas about the nature of models of sophisticated expectations that are needed to allow artificial agents to mimic the behavior of real human beings. 1 Validation by Virtual Economies – David K. Levine One of the most essential needs for developing better economic theories and policy prescriptions are improved methods of validating theories. Originally economics depended on field data gathered from surveys. The introduction of laboratory experiments added a new dimension: a good theory {{ought to be able to}} predict outcomes in the artificial world of the laboratory. Modern economics has extended this in two directions: to field experiments, keeping many of the controls of laboratory experiments, while conducting experiments in more natural environments...|$|E

40|$|Are ideas <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> as the {{expression}} says? Probably not. That’s too easy and {{somewhat of a}} cop out. It {{is relatively easy to}} get ideas, but probably more difficult to get “good ” ideas—those with the greatest probability of solving problems. However, the very best ideas to the most poorly-defined problem might as well not even exist. Anyone can have an exciting brainstorming session with hundreds of ideas. Frequently neglected, however, is devoting as much time and attention to clearly defining a challenge as is given to idea generation. As famed photographer Ansel Adams, said, “There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept. ” Most of us tend to be more solution-minded than problem-minded. Although lip service may be given about the need to “define the problem, ” relatively few people do it well. This paper will address how to focus on framing challenges, especially as they might apply to strategic innovation. Horse and Cart Innovation The description above represents a “horse before the cart ” approach to idea generation. Some organizations also may use such an approach to innovation initiatives. For instance, corporate managers often frame challenges based mostly on strategic outcome objectives (e. g., profitability, market share) along with some secondary goals such as generating new products and enhancing marketing and branding. Of course, many other objectives also need to be considered from a strategic perspective. The route to achieving any of these objectives is NOT just generating ideas. Instead, tactical maps first must be constructed to lay out the strategic terrain for all objectives. The old saying still holds true: “If you don’t know {{where you want to go}}, any road will take you there. ” It also is true that even if you think you know where you want to go (an often costly, untested assumption), you must create a map of goals to achieve along the way...|$|E
40|$|Idiomatic” expressions, {{usually called}} “idioms”, such as <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen,</b> a busman’s holiday, {{or to have}} bats in your belfry are a curious part of any language: they usually have a fixed lexical (why a busman?) and {{structural}} composition (only dime and dozen in direct conjunction mean ‘common, ordinary’), can be semantically obscure (why bats?), yet are widely recognized in the speech community, in spite of being so rare that only large corpora can provide us with access to sufficient empirical data on their use. In this compilation thesis, four published studies focusing on idioms in corpora are presented. Study 1 details the creation of and data in the author’s medium-sized corpus from 1999, the 3. 7 million word Coll corpus of online university student newspapers, with comparisons to data from standard corpora of the time. Study 2 examines {{the extent to which}} recognized idioms {{are to be found in}} the Coll corpus and how they can be varied. Study 3 draws upon the British National Corpus and a series of British and American newspaper corpora to see how idioms may be “anchored” in their contexts, primarily by the device of premodification via an adjective appropriate to the context, not to the idiom. Study 4 examines idiom-usage patterns in the Time Magazine corpus, focusing on possible aspects of diachronic change over the near-century Time represents. The introductory compilation chapter places and discusses these studies in their contexts of contemporary idiom and corpus research; building on these studies, it provides two specific examples of potential ways forward in idiom research: an examination of the idioms used in a specific subgenre of newspapers (editorials), and a detailed suggestion for teachers about how to examine multiple facets of a specific modern idiom (the glass ceiling) in the classroom. Finally, a summing-up includes suggestions for further research, particularly at the level of the patterning of individual idioms, rather than treating them as a homogeneous phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|In 1905 the Canadian {{government}} separated several districts {{from the}} Northwest Territories {{to establish the}} Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Both provinces continued the centralized education system of the Territories. The newly-formed Departments of Education were expected to provide schooling in the recently settled agricultural areas, but were often unable to persuade parents to erect school districts. In 1910 the situation was bleak; Alberta and Saskatchewan had the lowest school age enrollment figures in the country. Over the next twenty years, both departments accelerated the establishment of school districts administered by locally elected trustees and funded by local property taxes and small government grants. In rural locations this usually meant a one-room school of six to eight grades serving a four-square-mile area. In 1935 Alberta had 3, 800 such districts; while not all were active, most operated single-room, multi-grade, one-teacher schools. Elizabeth McLachlan 2 ̆ 7 s With Unshakeable Persistence contains the recollections of two men and five women who taught in one-room schools in Alberta and Saskatchewan during the Great Depression. The recollections of another forty teachers are drawn upon in discussions of the teachers 2 ̆ 7 role, their accommodation, social life, and the schools themselves. The reader is also reminded of the devastating effects the 1930 s Depression and natural disasters had on prairie life which led to many farm abandonments and a dwindling number of schools. One result of these conditions was a surplus of teachers, including many recent normal school graduates with first-class teaching certificates. One-room school job notices prompted hundreds of applications. As a McLachlan interviewee put it, 2 ̆ 2 My teaching career began in 1931. That was the year when teachers were <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen.</b> 2 ̆ 2 School trustees negotiated salaries well below the average annual wage of 1, 076 in Saskatchewan and 1, 055 in Alberta {{at the beginning of}} the Depression. For example, a teacher 2 ̆ 7 s salary was 90 a month in the Wealthy School District in Alberta in 1929 but dropped the next year to 50. By 1932 the annual salary in Saskatchewan fell to 476, but as McLachlan notes, 2 ̆ 2 Many teachers received far less and some nothing at all. 2 ̆ 2 Sometimes room and board was provided in lieu of part of a teacher 2 ̆ 7 s salary. Department officials, school trustees, and parents believed the women teachers who staffed these one-room schools had the wherewithal to serve them well. They were expected to teach a full range of subjects and grades, and while they were sometimes overwhelmed by the task, most held on. The interviewees, without exception, feared the visits of school inspectors and were not given to complaining for fear of losing their jobs. McLachlan has written a small and interesting study, and her efforts to gather the views of the teachers themselves turns out to have been much more than an anecdotal or hagiographic exercise. The book leaves the strong impression that the children who had the benefit and care of these teachers were shaped in unique, positive, and advantageous ways during the years of the Great Depression...|$|E
