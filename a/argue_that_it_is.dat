5|$|In 1851, the Oatman {{family was}} ambushed {{by a group}} of Ɖo:lkabaya Yavapai (though many historians <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{impossible}} to know whether or not these were Yavapai, or some other tribe). Roys Oatman and his wife were killed, along with four of their children. The son, Lorenzo, was left for dead but survived, while sisters Olive and Mary Ann were later sold to Mojaves as slaves. The story was widely published, and increased White settlers' fears of attack in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|The deity {{depicted}} on page 9 of the Grolier Codex {{is believed to}} be the Mountain God with split head. This image was otherwise unknown in the 1960s. Other examples of it were later discovered at the Maya sites of Tancah and Pasión del Cristo. Coe and his colleagues <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> very unlikely that a forger would have known about this deity before it was described elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pinniped}} {{continue to be}} harvested. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross seals and Antarctic fur seals. The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.|$|E
5000|$|Historians {{have also}} been divided over {{the reasons for the}} British invasion, with some <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to protect the Suez Canal and prevent [...] "anarchy", while others <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to protect the {{interests}} of British investors with assets in Egypt (see Anglo-Egyptian War).|$|R

5|$|The Chittenango ovate amber snail is {{endemic to}} the Chittenango area of Madison County, New York, United States. There {{is only one}} {{population}} of this species at Chittenango Falls State Park in central New York, {{even though it was}} believed to have a broader range previously; based on fossil records, some authors argue that the distribution of this species may have been much wider in the past. In opposition to this, other authors <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impossible to identify this species based on fossil records, because they only allow for examination of shell features. Shell features of species in this particular family of snails are usually not very distinctive.|$|E
5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E

25|$|Assigning {{monetary}} value to natural {{resources such as}} biodiversity, and the emergent ecosystem services is often viewed as a key process in influencing economic practices, policy, and decision-making.
