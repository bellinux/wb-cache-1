The president is appointed by the Board of Trustees with the consent of the Florida Board of Governors and leads the university through its daily business. Today, the president's office is located in Millican Hall on the university's main campus, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> the privilege of living in the Burnett House, also located on UCF's main campus. The fourth president of UCF, Dr. John C. Hitt has served since 1992.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{constitution}} grants the central government, acting through the President, {{the power to}} issue certain directives {{to the government of}} a state in relation to the use of minority languages for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State's population desire its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide primary education in the mother tongue for all linguistic minorities, regardless of whether their language is official in that State, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fiscal}} {{guardian}} for the nation's past reserves (that is, reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office), the President's concurrence {{is required for}} a number of financial transactions that the Government may wish to enter into. A guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, whether the transaction is authorized by a resolution of Parliament or is made under one of eight specified statutes. The President's approval is also needed for budgets of specified statutory boards and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The statutory boards that come under the President's purview are the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF Board), the Housing and Development Board, JTC Corporation and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, while the Government companies are the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte. Ltd., MND Holdings Pte. Ltd., and Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. Before the start of its financial year, every statutory board and {{the board of directors of}} every Government company must present its budget for that financial year to the President, together with a declaration by the statutory board's chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), or the Government company's chairman of the board of directors and the CEO, as to whether the budget is likely to draw upon past reserves. If so, the President may exercise personal discretion to disapprove the budget. If he approves the budget even though he is of the opinion that the budget is likely to draw upon past reserves, the decision and opinion must be published in the Government Gazette. Similarly, statutory boards and Government companies are bound to inform the President of financial transactions that are likely to draw on past reserves, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> personal discretion as to whether such transactions should be approved.|$|E

500|$|The Manhattan Engineer District (MED) was {{formally}} {{established by the}} Chief of Engineers, Major General Eugene Reybold on 16 August 1942. The name was chosen by Groves and MED's district engineer, Colonel James C. Marshall. Like other engineer districts, it was named after the city where its headquarters was located, at 270 Broadway. Unlike the others, however, it had no geographic boundaries, only a mission: to develop an atomic bomb. Moreover, Marshall had the authority of a division engineer head and reported directly to Reybold. Although Reybold was satisfied with the progress being made, Dr. Vannevar Bush was less so. He felt that aggressive leadership was required, and suggested {{the appointment of a}} prestigious officer as overall project director. Somervell, now Chief of Army Service Forces, recommended Groves. Somervell met Groves outside the hearing room where Groves had been testifying before a United States Congress committee on military housing and informed him that [...] "The Secretary of War has selected you for a very important assignment, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> approved the selection... If you do the job right, it will win the war." [...] Groves could not hide his disappointment at not receiving a combat assignment: [...] "Oh, that thing," [...] he replied.|$|E

[...] When asked how he felt about not being selected, Dean replied he would [...] "punt on that one." ...|$|E
