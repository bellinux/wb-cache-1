The {{ability to perform}} <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> {{orbit determination}} autonomously {{could lead to a}} wider array of mission possibilities for nanosatellites. This research examines the feasibility of using low-cost magnetometer measurements as a method of autonomous, simultaneous orbit <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> determination for the novel application of redundancy on nanosatellites. Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) are developed for <b>attitude</b> determination <b>and</b> orbit determination.

The EKFs are combined to provide both <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> orbit determination simultaneously. Simulations show that this approach for simultaneous, autonomous <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> orbit determination on nanosatellites provides 8. 5 degrees and 12. 5 km of <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> orbit knowledge, respectively. The results of the simulations are then validated using Hardware-In-The-Loop testing. Additionally, a Helmholtz cage is evaluated for future use in the Hardware-In-The-Loop test setup...|$|R

Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> juror verdicts may not hold true across all kinds of cases.

Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.|$|E

In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups.

40|$|Introduction: Extracted human teeth {{have been}} used {{commonly}} in dental institutions to train students acquire the skills to perform on live patients. No disinfectant mentioned in the literature as 100 % effective is completely safe. Although there are studies {{on the effectiveness of}} disinfectants, assessment of knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> practice regarding the handling of extracted teeth among dental students are rare. Aims: The aim was to assess the knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> practice regarding handling of extracted teeth among the students of a dental college in Bhopal. Materials and Methods: A self-designed, close-ended questionnaire containing 16 questions was distributed to 500 students including the undergraduates and postgraduate students of a dental college in Bhopal. The questionnaire comprised 5 questions on knowledge, 5 on <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> 6 on the practice towards handling of extracted human teeth. The responses were coded and entered in Microsoft excel and analyzed using SPSS 14. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the mean knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> practice scores across genders. Statistical significance of mean knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> practice scores across year of study was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Of the 500 questionnaires distributed, 412 were returned with a response rate of 82. 4 %. The total mean knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> practice scores were 1. 25 ± 1. 12, 5. 00 ± 1. 12 and 4. 89 ± 0. 96 respectively. Comparison of mean knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> practice scores between genders was not significant. The difference in mean <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> practice scores across year of study were statistically significant. Conclusions: Instructions regarding handling of extracted teeth need to be given to students when they enter the BDS curriculum. It′s always safe to follow the guidelines issued by the Center for Disease Control while handling extracted teeth...|$|R
