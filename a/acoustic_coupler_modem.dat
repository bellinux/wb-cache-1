50|$|The Pennywhistle was {{an early}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> <b>modem</b> {{originally}} designed and built by Lee Felsenstein in 1973, and later commercialized and offered for sale in 1976. It {{was one of the}} earliest modems available for hobbyist computer users. Like most acoustic coupler modems, the Pennywhistle was replaced by the Hayes Smartmodem and similar models from the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|On 15 August 1978, the DoC (whose {{technical}} side is {{now part}} of the Industry Canada) held a press conference and formally announced the Telidon project to the public, demonstrating a large video display sending information to the minicomputer controlling it over an <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> <b>modem.</b> They outlined a four-year development plan that included funding for further technical development at the CRC, the production of several hundred terminals that would be lent out to industry for development studies, as well as funds for marketing and lobbying in videotex standards negotiations.|$|E
5000|$|The J-CAT was Novation's {{first attempt}} to make a [...] "smart modem", albeit in a rather {{non-standard}} fashion. Its most basic feature was that J-CAT could {{be placed in a}} mode where it would automatically pick up the phone if it was called, offering rudimentary auto-answer capability. In an era when it could be safely assumed that the remote user would hang up when they were finished their call, as they were likely using an <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> <b>modem</b> like the original CAT, the lack of a [...] "hang up my phone" [...] command was not a real problem. This made the J-CAT useful for BBS use; Novation ran a simple one to allow users to test their new modems.|$|E

50|$|The Silent 700 {{was a line}} of {{portable}} computer terminals manufactured by Texas Instruments in the 1970s and 1980s. Silent 700s printed with a dot-matrix heating element onto a roll of heat-sensitive paper. Some models were equipped with an integrated <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> and <b>modem</b> that could receive data at 30 characters per second. Other models could be directly connected to computers at 300 baud, and were sometimes used as the System console where a hard copy record of the activities would be retained {{for a period of}} time.|$|R
50|$|The TDD {{concept was}} {{developed}} by James C. Marsters (1924-2009), a dentist and private airplane pilot who became deaf as an infant because of scarlet fever, and Robert Weitbrecht, a deaf physicist. In 1964, Marsters, Weitbrecht and Andrew Saks, an electrical engineer and grandson of {{the founder of the}} Saks Fifth Avenue department store chain, founded APCOM (Applied Communications Corp.), located in the San Francisco Bay area, to develop the acoustic coupler, or modem; their first product was named the PhoneType. APCOM collected old teleprinter machines (TTYs) from the Department of Defense and junkyards. Acoustic couplers were cabled to TTYs enabling the AT&T standard Model 500 telephone to couple, or fit, into the rubber cups on the coupler, thus allowing the device to transmit and receive a unique sequence of tones generated by the different corresponding TTY keys. The entire configuration of teleprinter machine, acoustic coupler, and telephone set became known as the TTY. Weitbrecht invented the <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> <b>modem</b> in 1964. The actual mechanism for TTY communications was accomplished electro-mechanically through frequency shift keying (FSK) allowing only half-duplex communication, where only {{one person at a time}} can transmit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>couplers</b> were {{sensitive}} to external noise and {{depended on the}} widespread standardization of the dimensions of telephone handsets. Direct electrical connections to telephone networks, once they were made legal, rapidly became the preferred method of attaching modems, {{and the use of}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplers</b> dwindled. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>couplers</b> are still used by people travelling in areas of the world where electrical connection to the telephone network is illegal or impractical. Many models of TDDs (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) still have a built-in <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler,</b> which allow more universal use with pay phones and for 911 calls by deaf people.|$|R

50|$|Weitbrecht {{believed}} an <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> (now {{known as}} a modem) {{could be used to}} convert electrical signals into tones that could be sent through wires. On the receiving end, the tones changed back to electrical signals so the message could be printed. After communicating with Marsters, Weitbrecht developed an echo suppressing <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> in November 1963 for the purpose of using on TTY devices. They obtained old, salvaged teletypewriters machines from Western Union and the Defense Department and hooked them up to Weitbrecht's prototype modems.|$|R

50|$|For many years, the Bell System (AT&T) {{maintained}} {{a monopoly on}} the use of its phone lines and what devices could be connected to them. However, the FCC's seminal Carterfone Decision of 1968, the FCC concluded that electronic devices could be connected to the telephone system as long as they used an <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler.</b> Since most handsets were supplied by Western Electric and thus of a standard design, <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplers</b> were relatively easy to build. Acoustically coupled Bell 103A-compatible 300 bit/s modems were common during the 1970s. Well-known models included the Novation CAT and the Anderson-Jacobson, the latter spun off from an in-house project at Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). An even lower-cost option was the Pennywhistle modem, designed to be built using parts from electronics scrap and surplus stores.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{generations of}} {{hardware}} <b>modems</b> (including <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplers)</b> and their protocols used relatively simple modulation {{techniques such as}} FSK or ASK at low speeds and with inefficient use of the telephone line's bandwidth.

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the ubiquitous fax machine, one of the first being the Exxon Qwip in the mid-1970s, facsimile machines worked by optical scanning of a document or drawing spinning on a drum. The reflected light, varying in intensity according to the light and dark areas of the document, was focused on a photocell so that the current in a circuit varied with the amount of light. This current was used to control a tone generator (a modulator), the current determining the frequency of the tone produced. This audio tone was then transmitted using an <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> (a speaker, in this case) attached to the microphone of a common telephone handset. At the receiving end, a handset’s speaker was attached to an <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> (a microphone), and a demodulator converted the varying tone into a variable current that controlled the mechanical movement of a pen or pencil to reproduce the image on a blank sheet of paper on an identical drum rotating at the same rate.|$|R
