5|$|Lépine's {{life and}} death was dramatized by Adam Kelly in his {{controversial}} play The <b>Anorak.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 21 October 1997, a 9-year-old boy, Ajit Singh, {{was dragged}} {{to his death}} after a toggle on his <b>anorak</b> was trapped in the closing doors of a Piccadilly line train.|$|E
5|$|The {{event has}} also been commemorated through {{references}} in television, theatre, and popular music. A play about the shootings by Adam Kelly called The <b>Anorak</b> was named {{as one of the}} best plays of 2004 by the Montreal Gazette. A movie entitled Polytechnique, directed by Denis Villeneuve was released in 2009, and sparked controversy over the desirability of reliving the tragedy in a commercial film.|$|E

5000|$|According to Hogarth, the title, {{nominally}} {{a play on}} {{the word}} [...] "arachnophobia", or fear of spiders, means no fear of <b>anoraks</b> ("anorak no phobia"), referring to the long-running in-joke that Marillion fans are also sometimes called <b>anoraks.</b> The artwork for Anoraknophobia {{as well as some}} other related music releases and press materials feature cartoon graphics of a boy named Barry who wears a rain parka. Inside the liner notes for the pre-order edition of the album, there is a photograph of each of the band members posed in a similar manner and standing near a telephone box.|$|R

25|$|Camouflage {{hunting is}} concealing oneself {{visually}} {{to blend in}} with the environment, for example using a white <b>anorak</b> in snowy weather.|$|E
25|$|The {{uniform of}} the GEO includes: <b>anorak,</b> jacket, sweater, t-shirt, pants, boots and beret. Overalls are used as a {{complementary}} clothing piece. During summer, GEO members use a short-sleeved shirt instead of the sweater and the jacket.|$|E
5000|$|... "The gargantuan DVD, {{bursting}} with outtakes from {{a slew of}} RTÉ recordings, is a treasure trove, with complementary versions of seminal recordings that will have ally self-respecting trad <b>anoraks</b> comparing and contrasting album and DVD for months." ...|$|R

50|$|Currently, {{though most}} {{families}} in the Thule region need at least one member in salaried employment {{in order to pay}} for electricity and other modern amenities, hunting remains a revered profession. Traditional foods like seal, walrus, narwhal and caribou are consumed frequently. Hunters still wear hand-made polar bear skin garments, caribou <b>anoraks</b> and skin boots for warmth on winter hunting trips. Many of the men maintain world-class kayaking and harpoon-throwing skills.|$|R
25|$|As {{the series}} progresses, Creek {{gradually}} changes from an asocial <b>anorak</b> {{to a man}} {{with a great deal of}} wit and charm. This helps to fuel the romantic thread between him and Maddy. Jonathan's trademark duffle coat worn in the first series was actually Alan Davies' own coat that he wore to the auditions; it helped him win the role, as the writer and producers thought it suited the character. After the first series, Jonathan's coat was supplied by the wardrobe department. Davies kept the original at his home, and wore it again for the 2009 New Year's special.|$|E
25|$|Inuit made {{clothes and}} {{footwear}} from animal skins, sewn together using needles made from animal bones and threads made from other animal products, such as sinew. The <b>anorak</b> (parka) {{is made in}} a similar fashion by Arctic peoples from Europe through Asia and the Americas, including the Inuit. The hood of an amauti, (women's parka, plural amautiit) was traditionally made extra large with a separate compartment below the hood to allow the mother to carry a baby against her back and protect it from the harsh wind. Styles vary from region to region, from the shape of the hood to the length of the tails. Boots (mukluk or kamik), could be made of caribou or seal skin, and designed for men and women.|$|E
25|$|The Glenanne gang {{carried out}} a co-ordinated attack against two Catholic {{families}} on 4 January 1976 which left {{a total of five}} men dead, and one injured. Robert McConnell purportedly led the first masked UVF unit at Whitecross, County Armagh. The gunmen entered the Reavey home by the key which had been accidentally left in the door and opened fire on three brothers who watching television at the time, killing John and Brian outright, and wounding another, Anthony. The other members of the large family had previously gone out leaving the three brothers on their own. The getaway car on this occasion had been driven by James Mitchell with Lily Shields having accompanied him. Twenty minutes later at Ballydougan, another group led by Robin Jackson broke into the O'Dowd home killing three family members. Before succumbing to a brain hemorrhage shortly afterwards on 30 January, 17-year-old Anthony Reavey had given a description of the leading gunman which was said to have fit that of McConnell. The man Anthony Reavey had described was 5"11, aged about 25 or 26, wearing a black woollen balaclava hood, green <b>anorak,</b> and dark trousers; he was carrying a submachine gun. Ballistics tests show that the Sterling submachine gun used in the Reavey shootings was the same as that used in the Donnelly's Bar attack at Silverbridge.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{traditional}} gentlemen's outfitters such as Cordings, Hackett and Gieves & Hawkes {{continued to}} sell plenty of smart walking coats in thick rubberised cotton, very popular at the time. Common in Britain around 1960 were neat zipper jackets for young and old, frequently with pinched waist, and hooded <b>anoraks</b> {{in the same}} materials - the latter in dark green for scouting, hiking, climbing, canoeing and yet more of the great outdoors.|$|R
5000|$|Marillion titled their twelfth studio album Anoraknophobia, {{referring}} to the long running in-joke that Marillion fans are sometimes called freaks or <b>anoraks.</b> The album cover, tour edition releases, and related press materials feature cartoon graphics of a boy wearing a rain parka, and holding a wire coat hanger by its hook. [...] Inside the liner notes for the deluxe edition of the album, there is a photograph {{of each of the}} band members posed in a similar manner, and standing near a telephone box.|$|R
5000|$|A scooterboy (or scooter boy) is one {{of several}} scooter-related subcultures of the 1960s and later decades, {{alongside}} rude boys, mods and skinheads. The term is sometimes used as a catch-all designation for any scootering enthusiast who does not fall into the latter three categories. Michael Brake identifies the subculture differently, classifying it as a subgroup of the mods, alongside [...] "art school mods", [...] "mainstream mods", and [...] "hard mods". Scooter boys, according to Brake, had [...] "Italian motor scooters (a working-class sports car) covered in accessories and <b>anoraks</b> and wide jeans".|$|R
500|$|... "I would {{describe}} this fellow as about 6-foot to 6-foot 2, aged 35 to 38 years, very slim, {{had a black}} moustache, long at the side. He had a stubble which was very noticeable, a week or two's growth. The moustache was much thicker than the stubble. He had dark hair, straight and to the shoulder. His hair was split at the middle {{in the front and}} brushed to each side. He had a long thin face. He had dark eyes and dark eyebrows. He was badly dressed as if the clothes did not suit him. He was dirty looking but not scruffy looking. He was wearing jeans that had a flare, blue in colour. He had dirty white runners on. He was wearing an <b>anorak</b> type coat which came down a few inches below the waist. The coat was zipped up and was a bright colour like a bright brown colour without a hood." ...|$|E

2500|$|A railfan, rail buff, or train buff (American English), railway enthusiast or [...] railway buff (Australian/British English), trainspotter or <b>anorak</b> (British English), or foamer (pejorative for American railroaders), is {{a person}} {{interested}} in a recreational capacity in rail transport. Railfans of many ages can be found worldwide. Railfans often combine their interest with other hobbies, especially photography and videography, radio scanning, model railroading, studying railroad history and participating in railway station and rolling stock preservation efforts. Magazines dedicated to railfanning include Trains and Railfan & Railroad.|$|E
5000|$|Wade Owen Watts is a {{teenager}} from Columbus, Ohio who frequents the OASIS {{and attempts to}} win [...] "Anorak’s Game", a game created by the recently-deceased creator of the OASIS, James Halliday, in search of its Easter Egg. The winner is to be granted full ownership of the OASIS and Halliday's $240 billion fortune. While Wade works with several friends from the OASIS to discover <b>Anorak's</b> treasure, the corporate giant Innovative Online Industries (IOI) employs a number of players to try to discover the treasure first and seize control of OASIS for themselves.|$|R
40|$|A mine of {{information}} about public attitudes to constitutional issues over the last decade, and a cogent commentary on those attitudes and what they imply {{for the future of}} reform, Voices of the people is essential reading for political <b>anoraks</b> and the chattering classes - and for the people themselves. The authors summarize and analyze a ten-year series of opinion surveys of British attitudes towards constitutional issues commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust. They argue that the general public have a good grasp of the underlying issues and are strongly in favor of constitutional reform that would lead to more public participation...|$|R
5000|$|... 15 {{members of}} the band, aged 66 to 88, {{appeared}} on Britain's Got Talent on 7 April 2012, performing the Beastie Boys' track [...] "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)". They walked on stage with thick coats and <b>anoraks.</b> Their oldest member, 88-year-old Grace Cooke, started the audition by singing a slow version of [...] "What the World Needs Now". They all then removed their coats, revealing ostentatious jewellery (described as 'bling' by one the judges) and hoodies and began to sing the Beasties track. They received four yes votes and survived through the live semi-finals.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2007 he {{was seen}} placing a book under his jacket, and when he next visited the library they called the police and he was arrested. Writer Tim Richardson, who {{witnessed}} the arrest, said that [...] "the man I saw looked rather anonymous in a cheap blue <b>anorak</b> – which is, perhaps, the most effective look for a book thief." [...] On being searched a list of seventy titles that he had stolen or intended to steal was discovered, which included works by Charles Darwin and Edward Lear. He denied stealing books, saying [...] "I don't know nothing about this. Do you have any evidence for this?". He refused to answer questions or give his name.|$|E
2500|$|Kayaks {{were also}} used for hunting at water {{crossings}} during annual migration. [...] Wounded animals were tied together, brought ashore, and killed there to avoid the struggle of dragging dead animals. Every part of the caribou was important. [...] The antlers were used for tools, such as the ulu ("knife") and goggles to prevent snow blindness. The hides were used for footwear and clothing, including the <b>anorak</b> and amauti, using caribou sinew to piece the articles together, and worn in many layers. Mittens were lined with fur, down, and moss. While spring-gathered caribou skins were thin, sleek, and handsome, summer-gathered caribou skins were stronger and warmer. Hides were used also for tents, tools, and containers.|$|E
2500|$|Heseltine then {{served as}} Secretary of State for Defence from January 1983 {{in which he}} used his presentational skills being used {{to take on the}} Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the June 1983 General Election. After the {{incident}} with the Commons' Mace, Heseltine acquired the nickname Tarzan and was caricatured as such, complete with loin-cloth, in the [...] "If" [...] series drawn by satirical political cartoonist, Steve Bell. Heseltine has claimed never to have been bothered what people called him, although the nickname amused his wife: [...] "It was quite fun to be married to Johnny Weissmuller". During the 1980s this macho image was reinforced by the satirical ITV puppet show Spitting Image, which portrayed him as a camouflage-clad warrior reminiscent of the 1960s white British mercenary of the Congo, Col. [...] "Mad Mike" [...] Mike Hoare. This was after an occasion when, as Defence Secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government, he had been persuaded to wear a camouflage <b>anorak</b> over his suit while inspecting troops in the rain on 6 February 1985 when he deployed 1,500 police and soldiers to fence off RAF Molesworth to prevent anti-nuclear protesters from entering the cruise missile base.|$|E
50|$|The {{service was}} started by Mr Philip Gordon Pierce-Smith who no longer runs the service he started nearly 52 years ago, and was started on limited funds and equipment, patrolling Poole Harbour with a small {{prototype}} Deep V soft bottom hulled inflatable developed by David Doderell of SWMF in Poole. It {{proved to be a}} fantastic hull until the bottom stretched or the wooden keel snapped. The crews had RAF lifejackets and <b>anoraks,</b> navigation was done with a AA road map and handheld compass, {{a far cry from the}} current standards. Since then the service has developed, seeing many different rescue boats and hundreds of crew.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} {{of international trade}} in sports goods {{is still in its}} infancy. In order to alleviate the sports economics ignorance in this area, an entirely new dataset is built up by extracting Comtrade data at the most disaggregated level (6 digits). The dataset covers 41 countries, 36 different sports goods, and 94 - 96 % of global sports goods trade (1994 - 2004). The country sample is divided into five regional areas: North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), EU + Switzerland, Eastern Europe, Asia and other emerging countries. A detailed snapshot of global trade in sports goods and its distribution by major areas, countries and products provides first empirical evidence about how much industrialisation in emerging countries and de-industrialisation in developed market economies have affected international specialisation, and indirectly tests multinational companies outsourcing and production relocation strategies in low unit cost countries in the sports goods industry. Then, studying export/import ratios and country's position in the global market, it appears that major trading areas are Asia, Europe and NAFTA. Major exporters are China, Hong Kong, the USA and France, and major importers are the USA, Japan, Germany, France, the UK and Italy. The biggest market shares are in sportswear, <b>anoraks</b> and gymnastic equipment trade. Asia, Eastern Europe and emerging countries have an excess balance in sports goods trade, whereas NAFTA and Europe are in deficit. Three indexes assess a country's comparative advantages and disadvantages and competitiveness, and describe international specialisation. NAFTA and Europe are specialised in equipment-intensive sports goods, while Asia, Eastern Europe and emerging countries are specialised in trite sports goods and some less equipment-intensive sports goods. NAFTA is not competitive in any sport good, Europe is competitive in skis, emerging countries and Eastern Europe in sportswear and <b>anoraks,</b> and Asia in sportswear, <b>anoraks,</b> rackets, balls, skates and gymnastic equipment. Such an international specialisation pattern fits with both assumptions of industrialisation/de-industrialisation and firms outsourcing strategies. A principal component analysis with hierarchical ascendant classification groups trite sports goods as opposed to intensive-equipment sports goods in global trade and shows that production relocation influences international trade specialisation. Major policy implications are that developed economies and multinational companies should continue investing in R&D in order to keep their comparative advantages in equipment-intensive sports goods, while Asian and emerging countries should more tightly supervise working conditions and child labour in their subcontracting producers that work for foreign multinational companies...|$|R
