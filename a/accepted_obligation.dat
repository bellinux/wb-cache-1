40|$|Citizenship can {{be defined}} as a set of norms, values and {{practices}} which bind society together, makes democratic government possible and helps individuals to solve collective action problems (Pattie et al., 2004). These values and practices are rooted in an implicit bargain, or an invisible handshake between the individual and the state, in which citizens claim rights and protections in exchange for <b>accepting</b> various <b>obligations</b> to deliver things that the state needs {{if it is to be}} effective. Citizens may demand that the state provides a decent standard of living for all, for example, but in exchange they have to be willing to pay their taxes. If citizens demand rights without <b>accepting</b> <b>obligations,</b> the system will not be able to deliver, and problems of governance will arise. So in a real sense successful democratic government relies on this implicit bargain...|$|R

The Belgian Constitutional Court plays an active role in EU integration: it has developed two techniques for indirectly reviewing whether formal legislation respects primary and secondary EU law, it <b>accepts</b> <b>obligations</b> based on EU law as a justification for a distinction between two categories and it takes into account the procedural limits set out by the ECJ in order to maintain EU law's full effect and uniform application. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|Some {{cosmopolitan}} {{theorists have}} raised philosophical objections to {{this picture of}} bounded solidarity, and argue that we should {{think of ourselves as}} equally obligated to all humans, close or distant, insiders or outsiders. I will not enter into that philosophical debate here, except to note that (a) all existing welfare states do rely on bounded solidarity; and (b) we should not assume that renouncing appeal to bounded solidarities and removing the distinction between insiders and outsiders will lead to levelling up the treatment of outsiders. It might instead lead to levelling down of the treatment of insiders. It may be that bounded solidarity was (and continues to be) needed to motivate people to <b>accept</b> <b>obligations</b> beyond duties of rescue and humanitarian need.|$|R
