He later {{had a major}} role {{as part of the}} supporting cast of the series, though he did not appear regularly during the following seasons as he was attempting to repair his marriage with Khloé. Kim's current husband Kanye West made his first appearance on Keeping Up with the Kardashians in July 2012 during the seventh season when he started dating Kim. However, West was seldom seen in subsequent seasons. He explained the reasons for not appearing on the show later: [...] "You know, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>backlash</b> I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore.

50|$|Standard {{practice}} {{is to make}} allowance for half the backlash in the tooth thickness of each gear. However, if the pinion (the smaller of the two gears) is significantly smaller than the gear it is meshing with then it is common practice to account {{for all of the}} backlash in the larger gear. This maintains as much strength as possible in the pinion's teeth. The amount of additional material removed when making the gears depends on the pressure angle of the teeth. For a 14.5° pressure angle the extra distance the cutting tool is moved in equals the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>backlash</b> desired. For a 20° pressure angle the distance equals 0.73 times the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>backlash</b> desired.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2014, Time was {{met with}} {{controversy}} {{for the release of}} a cover featuring Enrique Peña Nieto and the legend Saving Mexico (written by Michael Crowley), as the cover article's title inside the magazine. The controversial article praised the president and his cabinet for reforms like opening oil fields for foreign investment {{for the first time in}} 75 years (a reform towards which Mexican citizens have shown mixed feelings), ending the Mexican drug wars (which was not completely accurate), and even going as far as saying [...] "the opposition party blocked major reforms that were necessary", that [...] "American leaders could learn a thing or two from their resurgent southern neighbor" [...] and saying Mexicans citizens' [...] "alarms were replaced with applause". The last part proved false, when the cover immediately spawned heavy <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>backlash</b> on social media, becoming a meme which spawned multiple parody covers ranging from changing the legend to mock words like [...] "Selling Mexico", [...] "Slaving Mexico", [...] "Starving Mexico", [...] "Who is saving Mexico from this ass-hole?" [...] to editing Peña Nieto into clown make-up, dressed as the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ, the Pope, to one featuring an old lady holding a gun with the legend [...] "Saving Mexico... pero de Peña Nieto" [...] (but from Peña Nieto). Multiple articles criticized the article, and some websites even asked Time magazine if Peña Nieto paid for the cover story. This prompted Michael Crowley, the writer of the article, to post on Twitter: [...] "Remarkable how many critics of Mexico's president seem to believe I must have literally taken a bribe to write a positive story about him".|$|R
40|$|A multi-axis, {{step motor}} control system was {{developed}} to accurately position and control the operation of a triple axis spectrometer at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Triple axis spectrometers are used in neutron scattering and diffraction experiments and require highly accurate positioning. This motion control system can handle up to 16 axes of motion. Four of these axes are outfitted with 17 -bit absolute encoders. These four axes are controlled with a software feedback loop that terminates the move based on real-time position information from the absolute encoders. Because the final position of the actuator is used to stop {{the motion of the}} step motors, the moves can be made accurately in spite <b>of</b> the large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> mechanical <b>backlash</b> from a chain drive between the motors and the spectrometer arms. A modified trapezoidal profile, custom C software, and an industrial PC, were used to achieve a positioning accuracy of 0. 00275 degrees of rotation. A form of active position maintenance ensures that the angles are maintained with zero error or drift...|$|R
50|$|An anti-Chinese {{movement}} {{emerged during}} the Mexican Revolution and peaked during the Depression. The experience and treatment of the Chinese in Mexico was similar to what they experienced in California {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. They were initially welcomed into unpopulated areas which needed large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> cheap manpower. The frontier situation in both areas also allowed the Chinese to carve out economic niches for themselves. The Chinese as a whole turned out to be hardworking, frugal, mutually supportive within their communities, and often succeeding as entrepreneurs in agriculture and small commercial enterprises. In both cases, when their numbers reached a certain percentage of the local population and when they attained a certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> monetary success, <b>backlashes</b> occurred on both sides of the border.|$|R

40|$|A {{woman who}} acts agentically in the {{workplace}} {{is more likely to}} be disliked and viewed as less competent than a woman who acts caring and communal.

Excellent system behaviors had been experimentally verified on a laboratory model, when proposed control concepts were utilized. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{incident}} was ridiculed {{both within the}} United States and abroad, {{with a number of}} commentators considering the incident a pre-planned publicity stunt, and American commentators in particular viewing it as a sign of decreasing morality in American culture, while others considered the incident harmless and argued that it received an undue <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> attention and <b>backlash.</b> The increased regulation of broadcasting raised concerns regarding censorship and free speech in the United States, and the FCC increased the fine per indecency violation from US$27,500 to US$325,000 shortly after the event. The halftime show that year was produced by MTV and was themed around the network's Choose or Lose campaign due to the event occurring during a presidential election year. Following the wardrobe incident, the National Football League (NFL) announced that MTV, which also produced the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXV, would not be involved in any halftime shows in the future. The MTV Chief Executive stated in an interview with Reuters that Jackson engineered the stunt, while Timberlake was informed of it just moments before he took the stage.

50|$|Within the {{numerical}} systems of CNC programming {{it is possible}} for the code generator to assume that the controlled mechanism is always perfectly accurate, or that precision tolerances are identical for all cutting or movement directions. This is not always a true condition of CNC tools. CNC tools with a large amount of mechanical backlash can still be highly precise if the drive or cutting mechanism is only driven so as to apply cutting force from one direction, and all driving systems are pressed tightly together in that one cutting direction. However a CNC device with high backlash and a dull cutting tool can lead to cutter chatter and possible workpiece gouging. Backlash also affects precision of some operations involving axis movement reversals during cutting, such as the milling of a circle, where axis motion is sinusoidal. However, this can be compensated for if the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>backlash</b> is precisely known by linear encoders or manual measurement.|$|E

5000|$|In 1945, Dubuffet {{attended}} and {{was strongly}} impressed by {{a show in}} Paris of Jean Fautrier's paintings in which he recognized meaningful art which expressed directly and purely the depth of a person. Emulating Fautrier, Dubuffet started to use thick oil paint mixed with materials such as mud, sand, coal dust, pebbles, pieces of glass, string, straw, plaster, gravel, cement, and tar. This allowed him to abandon the traditional method of applying oil paint to canvas with a brush; instead, Dubuffet created a paste into which he could create physical marks, such as scratches and slash marks. The impasto technique of mixing and applying paint was best manifested in Dubuffet's series 'Hautes Pâtes' or Thick Impastoes, which he exhibited at his second major exhibition, entitled Microbolus Macadam & Cie/Hautes Pates in 1946 at the Galérie René Drouin. His use of crude materials and the irony that he infused into many of his works incited a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>backlash</b> from critics, who accused Dubuffet of 'anarchy' and 'scraping the dustbin'. He did receive some positive feedback as well—Clement Greenberg took notice of Dubuffet's work and wrote that 'from a distance, Dubuffet seems the most original painter to {{have come out of}} the School of Paris since Miro...' Greenberg {{went on to say that}} 'Dubuffet is perhaps the one new painter of real importance to have appeared on the scene in Paris in the last decade.'

5000|$|A {{prime example}} of the {{relative}} absence of political correctness is the international controversy caused by {{a photo of the}} Spanish Olympic Basketball Team in 2008. Taken before the team left for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, China, a picture of the team pulling the outer corners of their eyes to make them slanted was featured in a newspaper advertisement. This caused an uproar and a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>backlash</b> from those who construed the pose as a racist gesture towards the Chinese. Upon the publication of the picture, The Guardian, a British newspaper company, predicted that although “there is no obvious intention to upset their Olympic hosts in Beijing…the irresponsible picture is likely to cause controversy and could be interpreted so as to lead to accusations of racism.” Similarly, NBC, a major American news outlet, reported that many Asian Americans found the picture to be “an offensive, racist gesture, something borne out of playground bullying and harassment,” and stated that the photo had been criticized by the international media, with negative consequences for Madrid’s bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics. [...] The team, however, denied any ill intentions with the making of the photo. One of the basketball players in the team, Jose Manuel Calderon, said that “the picture has been interpreted incorrectly,” and that the pose was created {{as a response to the}} sponsor’s request to “pose with a ‘wink’ to our participation in Beijing.” According to Calderon, the pose was merely “an Oriental expression with our eye,” a gesture that they made because they “thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving.” [...] The Spanish media, such as El Mundo and El Pais seemed to take a neutral stance on this controversy, simply reporting on the issue and detailing what had happened and what had been said by the international media and those directly involved in the incident. Meanwhile, in the midst of such controversy, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Spain said that he did not take the gesture to be offensive or racist, and neither did his country. He maintained that the Chinese-Spanish relations were as good as usual. This sentiment was echoed by the Chinese spectators of the Olympic Games interviewed by NBC, who didn’t understand what the gesture even meant, and did not find it to be as offensive as Chinese immigrants abroad. Therefore, while many Asians abroad found the gesture to be highly racist and offensive, the Chinese living in China did not and the athletes who had made the pose did not intend for it to be, either. This demonstrates the clear differences in what is “politically correct,” and what being racially sensitive consists of. Thus while this incidence seems to be a clear example of the lack of political correctness and racial insensitivity in Spain to some, to others, it might not be—such terms are dependent on the standards that his/her society dictates, and it is important to realize that such standards can vary across different cultures and countries with different histories. One might not necessarily be more right than the other—they’re just different. Nevertheless, it is imperative that everyone—regardless of what their society dictates—is aware of, and is sensitive to differences across all boundaries, whether it is between races, nationalities, cultures, languages, and more.|$|E

(Test och implementering av en glappdetekteringsmetod) Backlash is a well documented and rather common non-linearity which is present in most mechanical and hydraulic systems. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>backlash</b> varies depending on {{the dynamics of the}} system, for example a gear box in a car needs some space for heat expansion and consequently some <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>backlash</b> in order to function. It is of interest to detect and estimate the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>backlash</b> automatically, since the time between the manual inspections often is long. This thesis covers the method described in “Automatic on-line estimation of backlash in control loops ” written by Tore Hägglund and published in the Journal of Process Control in January 2007. One of the main objectives of this master thesis is to extend the safety net to guarantee the robustness of the backlash estimation procedure described in the article. The purpose of the safety net {{is to make sure that}} backlash estimates are only calculated when the system behavior resembles backlash. Conditions for period time, curve form and setpoint are discussed and investigated. The backlash estimation procedure is implemented as a control module in a prototype library in ABB Control Builder, a software used for PLC programming in an ABB 800 xA environment. Finally, industrial field tests are performed to confirm the robustness of the method...|$|E
