25|$|The first {{empirical}} research {{about the social}} sharing of emotions was conducted in 1991. These were retrospective studies where participants filled out a questionnaire which asked them to recall a specific personal experience that provoked an emotion. They then were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to questions related to their social sharing behaviors related to that event. In all of these studies, 88–96% of emotional experiences were followed by social sharing of those experiences at least one time.|$|E

[...] Jeter further asserted that many defensive factors cannot be quantified. The controversy over Jeter's fielding has become a flash point for the debate over whether the analyses of statistics or subjective observation is the better method to assess a player's defensive ability, and for criticism of the Gold Glove Award.|$|E

This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again. When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack did not attend the funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at Cap d'Antibes. [...] <b>Asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to his brother's death, Jack said, [...] "I didn't give a shit about Harry." [...] At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President Dwight D.

500|$|On 14 August 1880, a [...] "fanciful and {{sometimes}} wildly inaccurate fictionalising" [...] {{of the events}} of the late 1840s on the Eyre Peninsula, written by Henry John Congreve, was published in the Adelaide Observer, an Adelaide weekly newspaper, as [...] "A Reminiscence of Port Lincoln". It ascribed four murders to one Aboriginal male, stated that Easton's infant had also been murdered, said that many Aboriginal people were shot and survivors driven over a cliff, and mixed up several of the recorded details. In a letter to the editor, a correspondent noted several errors in the account, and Congreve was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond.</b> He stated that he never intended the story to have the [...] "weight of a historical document", and that it was written merely as [...] "illustrative of the trials and dangers of the early settlers". According to authors Robert Foster, Rick Hosking and Amanda Nettelbeck, Congreve's account was [...] "not history, but fiction designed to illustrate", which had [...] "exaggerated and distorted what had (probably) happened".|$|E

2500|$|Due to his {{constant}} visibility next to Method Man, and his tendency to wear Wu-Tang related clothing on stage, some fans have confused Redman for being {{more than just}} an affiliate of the Wu-Tang Clan.

2500|$|This finding led {{to another}} test that was {{designed}} to assess the presence of a deficiency in pitch perception. In this test, Monica heard a sequence of five piano tones of constant pitch followed by a comparison sequence of five piano tones in which the fourth tone could be the same pitch as the other notes in the sequence or a completely different pitch altogether. Monica was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> [...] "yes" [...] if she detected a pitch change on the fourth tone or respond [...] "no" [...] if she could not detect a pitch change. [...] Results show that Monica could barely detect a pitch change as large as two semitones (whole tone), or half steps. While this pitch-processing deficit is extremely severe, {{it does not seem to}} include speech intonation. This is because pitch variations in speech are very coarse compared with those used in music. In conclusion, Monica's learning disability arises from a basic problem in pitch discrimination, which is viewed as the origin of congenital amusia.|$|E
2500|$|Reelected to the Assembly {{as one of}} the PȚ representatives for Bessarabia, Buzdugan {{focused on}} agrarian issues such as the {{liquidation}} of the zemstva, and defended the latter as tools of peasants' self-management. He and Halippa were also <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> in the Assembly about how they had carried out the land reform. He fought over the matter with Alexandru C. Constantinescu of the National Liberals, but also with more radical Bessarabian agrarianists such as Ludovic Dauș. His other focus was Romania's defense against a hostile Soviet Union, which had not recognized Bessarabia as part of Romania. His speeches applauded by all political camps, Buzdugan depicted Romania as a bastion of Christendom and Western civilization. Unlike other PȚ deputies, he did not see Romania's social backwardness as an impediment, and suggested that making Romanians [...] "healthy and strong" [...] would ensure that the country fulfilled her cultural mission. Documenting the Comintern links of the Romanian Communist Party, he also suggested that the PȚ itself was being infiltrated by the Krestintern. In December 1924, Buzdugan had a public row with Artur Văitoianu, Minister of Transport in the new Brătianu cabinet—at stake was the issue of the state railways, which Buzdugan deemed unfit for an imminent war with the Soviets.|$|E
