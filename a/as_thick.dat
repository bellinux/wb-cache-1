5|$|The game {{retains the}} classic pastel / crayon visuals from its predecessor. Small changes are {{noticeable}} — water animation has been improved, the black outlines around objects are not <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> and the backgrounds are less cluttered; but the visuals are still tightly-centered on {{those of the}} SNES game.|$|E
5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Spores are spherical, hyaline (translucent), {{and measure}} 2.5–3.4μm in diameter. They are {{thick-walled}} {{with a short}} pedicel (a tubelike extension), and are ornamented with tiny spines (verrucae) that are roughly equidistant from each other. Capillitial threads are long, hyaline, and branched, measuring 2.4–4μm thick. They are septate and occasionally have pits on their walls. The exoperidium comprises thick-walled, inflated hyphae mixed with sphaerocysts (spherical cells), while the endoperidium is made of tightly interwoven, thick-walled hyphae. In the rhizomorphs, the hyphae in the central core are several times <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> {{as those in the}} surrounding subcortex.|$|E

5000|$|Reversible {{garments}} {{have some}} features unlike {{other types of}} garments, such <b>as</b> <b>thicker</b> overall fabric (since two fabric are often sewn together), buttons on both sides (in garments that have buttons), different types of stitching, and no tags ...|$|R
5|$|The king cheetah is {{a variety}} of cheetah with a rare {{mutation}} for cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide stripes extending from their neck to the tail. In 1926 Major A.Cooper wrote about an animal he had shot near modern-day Harare. Describing the animal, he noted its remarkable similarity to the cheetah, but the body of this individual was covered with fur <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> {{as that of a}} snow leopard and the spots merged to form stripes. He suggested that it could be a cross between a leopard and a cheetah. After further similar animals were discovered, it was established they were similar to the cheetah in having non-retractable clawsa characteristic feature of the cheetah.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} is very thin {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's {{battered}} surface lies {{on top of}} a cold, stiff, and icy lithosphere that {{is between}} 80 and 150km thick. A salty ocean 150200km deep may lie beneath the crust, indicated by studies of the magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was found that Callisto responds to Jupiter's varying background magnetic field like a perfectly conducting sphere; that is, the field cannot penetrate inside Callisto, suggesting a layer of highly conductive fluid within it with a thickness of at least 10km. The existence of an ocean is more likely if water contains a small amount of ammonia or other antifreeze, up to 5% by weight. In this case the water+ice layer can be <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> as 250300km. Failing an ocean, the icy lithosphere may be somewhat thicker, up to about 300km.|$|E
5000|$|The {{portrait}} {{served as}} the basis for many later depictions of Philip, though not all stuck to Van der Weydens idealised view point, especially since the 17th century he has been shown <b>as</b> <b>thicker</b> set, aligning with contemporary written descriptions.|$|R
50|$|Anzu was {{probably}} an omnivore or herbivore, although the beak {{is not as}} heavily constructed as in the Asian Oviraptoridae. Other differences from its Asian cousins include size - the Asian Oviraptoridae were smaller - <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>thicker</b> legs and different lower jaws.|$|R
3000|$|Surface states: The {{needle-like}} nanostructures {{obviously have}} a far higher surface state density than other nanostructures, such <b>as</b> <b>thicker</b> nanorods and thin films synthesized in zones 1, 3, 4, and 5.

5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted <b>as</b> <b>thick,</b> brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses {{are used in the}} tropics. A streamline {{analysis is}} a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within the tropics and subtropics.|$|E
5|$|Suillus intermedius, {{found in}} northeastern and {{northern}} North America, {{is similar in}} appearance to S.salmonicolor. It may be distinguished by a lighter-colored cap, cream to yellowish or pale ochraceous flesh, and a ring that is neither <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> nor as wide as S.salmonicolor. It is also larger, with a cap diameter of up to , and its pore surface sometimes slowly stains reddish-brown when bruised. Although {{it has not been}} definitively established whether S.cothurnatus is a distinct species, several characteristics have been reported to differentiate it from S.salmonicolor: a thinner, less rubbery veil that usually lacks a thickened cottony roll at the base; glandular dots on the stem that consist of bundles of multiseptate hyphae in a parallel arrangement ending in an even row of large, sterile cystidia (60–140μm long) that resemble basidia; and small hyaline cystidia shaped like swollen bottles with narrowed bases. Other Suillus species with which S.salmonicolor might be confused include S.acidus and S.subalutaceus. Both of these species have a less well-developed partial veil, and their flesh is a duller tone lacking yellow-orange tints.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{indications}} of the colour and skin {{texture of the}} animal because no skin impressions or mummies are known. Most life restorations show the creature's skin <b>as</b> <b>thick,</b> folded, grey, and hairless, based on modern rhinoceroses. Because hair retains body heat, modern large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses are largely hairless. American palaeontologist Donald Prothero has proposed that, contrary to most depictions, Paraceratherium had large, elephant-like ears that it used for thermoregulation. The ears of elephants enlarge the body's surface area and are filled with blood vessels, making the dissipation of excess heat easier. According to Prothero, {{this would have been}} true for Paraceratherium; he points to robust bones around the ear openings. The palaeontologists Pierre-Olivier Antoine and Darren Naish have expressed scepticism towards this idea.|$|E
5000|$|As Robert Godin, {{owner of}} Godin guitars, put it: “Our {{motivation}} {{for this project}} {{was to create a}} new acoustic design that would simultaneously improve sound and structural integrity. As a general rule better sound comes with more delicate construction. Conversely, stronger construction, such <b>as</b> <b>thicker</b> tops and heavier bracing, stifles the sound.” ...|$|R
50|$|They {{underwent}} various alterations {{during their}} working lives, such <b>as</b> <b>thicker</b> tyres giving slightly larger wheels, the gradual adoption of cylinders with a 26 in stroke, and larger diameter boilers of various sorts, as was usual at this period. In 1910-15 {{some of the}} class received taller chimneys resembling those of the Dean Singles.|$|R

5|$|Several {{years ago}} the {{government}} built sluice gates for the silt fertilization method, though many people disagreed with the plan. In spite of all opposition it was carried through, yet it had little success. When the torrents on Fan Shan were abundant, the gates were kept closed, and this caused damage (by flooding) of fields, tombs, and houses. When the torrents subsided in the late autumn the sluices were opened, and thus the fields were irrigated with silt-bearing water, but the deposit was not <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> as what the peasants call 'steamed cake silt' (so they were not satisfied). Finally the government got tired of it and stopped. In this connection I remember reading the Jiayipan of Bai Juyi (the poet) in which {{he says that he}} once had a position as Traffic Commissioner. As the Bian River was getting so shallow that it hindered the passage of boats he suggested that the sluice gates along the river and canal should be closed, but the Military Governor pointed out that the river was bordered on both sides by fields which supplied army grain, and if these were denied irrigation (water and silt) because of the closing of the sluice gates, it would lead to shortages in army grain supplies. From this I learnt that in the Tang period there were government fields and sluice gates {{on both sides of the}} river, and that irrigation was carried on (continuously) even when the water was high. If this could be done (successfully) in old times, why can it not be done now? I should like to enquire further about the matter from experts.|$|E

50|$|Other design {{factors may}} prevent a {{manufacturer}} from maximizing visibility. These include safety, as narrower pillars cannot be made strong <b>as</b> easily <b>as</b> <b>thicker</b> pillars, and size restraints pertaining to aerodynamics, as taller, more vertical windshields create additional drag and reduce fuel efficiency. They also include fashion and cost, whereby design and appearance considerations can be deemed preeminent.|$|R

25|$|The {{evolution}} of carnivorous plants is {{obscured by the}} paucity of their fossil record. Very few fossils have been found, and then usually only as seed or pollen. Carnivorous plants are generally herbs, and their traps are produced by primary growth. They generally do not form readily fossilisable structures such <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> bark or wood.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, more {{products}} and techniques {{have been developed}} to make lip augmentation more effective and patient friendly. The relative ease of many injections is due to surgeons using tiny 30 and 31 gauge (about <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> as a dozen human hairs) needles that are used to inject the very sensitive lips. Nonetheless, topical anesthesias are often used for lip augmentation procedures.|$|E
