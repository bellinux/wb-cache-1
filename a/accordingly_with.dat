5|$|During 1958–1960 VAT focused {{increasingly}} on custom-building vehicles {{according to}} customer request. Typically a potential customer just {{walked into the}} main office in Helsinki or factory in Hämeenlinna and described what kind of vehicle he wanted. The enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer's wishes and designed vehicles <b>accordingly,</b> <b>with</b> two or three axles, desired layout, wheelbase and with conventional or forward control cabin. Many vehicle types were only produced {{for one or two}} units. The volume model, however, was a nine-tonne variant of the VAK series.|$|E

5|$|After Hergé had redrawn The Black Island for {{publication}} in the United Kingdom, his British publishers at that time, Methuen, suggested that alterations be made to Land of Black Gold before releasing it into the UK market. In the original versions Tintin arrived in British-occupied Palestine, where he was arrested by British police before being captured by the Zionist paramilitary organization Irgun, who mistake him for {{one of their own}} agents. In this revised version Tintin arrives in Khemed, where he is arrested by the Arab military police before being captured and taken to Bab El Ehr. The inclusion of forces from the British Palestinian Mandate and the Irgun were no longer seen as relevant and so were removed from the story. Background detail was changed <b>accordingly,</b> <b>with</b> Jewish shop fronts with Hebrew signage being removed. A number of characters were also dropped, including the British officers Thorpe and Lieutenant Edwards. Whereas earlier versions had contained fictional Arabic script, for the 1971 version this was corrected to real Arabic.|$|E

5|$|South Florida is a {{transitional}} zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical ecozones, {{resulting in a}} wide variety of plant and animal life. The intersection of ecozones brings opportunities for visitors to see species, particularly birds, that are not seen elsewhere in North America. The park includes four distinct ecosystems, each supporting its own flora and fauna. Mangrove swamp, lagoon, island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species. In this semi-tropical environment, the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall. Warm to hot and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms. Though only marginally cooler, the winters tend to be relatively drier. Bay salinity varies <b>accordingly,</b> <b>with</b> lower salinity levels in the wet summer, trending to more fresh water on the west side where new fresh water flows in.|$|E

25|$|As {{with many}} things, {{prevention}} {{is the best}} cure. Any open wound, even one so small as a blister, is a potential infestation site, and should be treated <b>accordingly</b> <b>with</b> approved pesticides. At {{times of the year}} when livestock are most vulnerable (castration, birthing, etc.), daily inspections should be conducted when possible. Infestations detected early are quite treatable, but fatalities can and do result from advanced infestation, particularly in sheep and newborn calves.|$|E
25|$|Jíbaro music came to {{be marketed}} on {{commercial}} recordings in the twentieth century, and singer-poets like Ramito (Flor Morales Ramos, 1915–90) are well documented. However, jíbaros themselves were becoming an endangered species, as agribusiness and urbanization have drastically reduced the numbers of small farmers on the island. Many jíbaro songs dealt <b>accordingly</b> <b>with</b> the vicissitudes of migration to New York. Jíbaro music has in general declined accordingly, although it retains its place in local culture, especially around Christmas time and special social gatherings, {{and there are many}} cuatro players, some of whom have cultivated prodigious virtuosity.|$|E

25|$|The {{remoteness}} of {{the monarch}} is also notorious in the Kingdom of Galicia having lost his {{vote in the}} Cortes (Parliament) sometime during the late 14th or early 15th centuries. In 1423, {{in the absence of}} other Galician cities, the city of Zamora (located in León, but historically linked to Galicia) asked to be treated <b>accordingly</b> <b>with</b> its claimed condition of capital of the Kingdom of Galicia, honour which was recognised to the city, with their deputies sitting next to the monarch at his right. Till 1640 Zamora represented the Kingdom of Galicia in the Cortes, usually against the will and the advice of the Galician cities.|$|E
25|$|However, no {{attack was}} forthcoming. The Spanish social fabric, {{shaken by the}} shock of rebellion, gave way to {{crippling}} social and political tensions; the patriots stood divided on every question and their nascent war effort suffered <b>accordingly.</b> <b>With</b> {{the fall of the}} monarchy, constitutional power devolved to local juntas. These institutions interfered with the army and the business of war, undermined the tentative central government taking shape in Madrid, and in some cases proved almost as dangerous to each other as to the French. The British army in Portugal, meanwhile, was itself immobilized by logistical problems and bogged down in administrative disputes, and did not budge.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being the}} sole decision-makers, both Ci'an and Cixi {{were forced to}} rely on the Grand Council and a complex series of {{procedures}} {{in order to deal with}} affairs of state. When state documents came in, they were to be first forwarded to the Empresses Dowager, then referred back to Prince Gong and the Grand Council. Having discussed the matters, Prince Gong and his colleagues would seek the instruction of the Empresses Dowager at audiences and imperial orders would be drawn up <b>accordingly,</b> <b>with</b> drafts having to be approved by the Empresses Dowager before edicts were issued. The most important role of the Empresses Dowager during the regency was to apply their seals to edicts, a merely mechanical role in a complex bureaucracy.|$|E

25|$|Malta {{first issued}} revenue stamps in 1899, when {{the island was}} a British colony. From that year to 1912, all revenue issues were postage stamps overprinted <b>accordingly,</b> <b>with</b> the {{overprinting}} being done either locally or by De La Rue in London. Postage stamps also became valid for fiscal use from 1912–13, so no new revenues were issued until 1925–30, when a series of key type stamps depicting King George V were issued. These exist unappropriated for use as general-duty revenues, or with additional inscriptions indicating a specific use (Applications, Contracts, Registers or Stocks & Shares). The only other revenues after this series were £1 stamps issued in 1941, 1948 and 1954. Postage stamps remained valid for fiscal use until at least the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|It {{may seem}} that the {{erstwhile}} numbers of seabirds may only ever be approached again by the wholesale eradication of the feral cats. While this has been since shown to be feasible, {{it is not clear}} whether even a severe curtailing of the cat population would be desirable. Though it previously was assumed that the small Polynesian rat is of little if any harm for seabirds, even house mice have been shown to eat seabird nestlings. Most nesting birds, in particularly Procellariiformes, are now accepted to be jeopardized by Rattus exulans. The Kiritimati's cats are meanwhile very fond of young seabirds; it even seems that their behavior has shifted <b>accordingly,</b> <b>with</b> cats being less territorial generally and congregating in numbers at active bird colonies, and generally eschewing rats when seabird chicks are in plenty.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the plan}} {{approved}} in 2006, the Husky Stadium station would have three entrances, connected via underground walkways or overpasses: {{on the east}} side of Montlake Boulevard adjacent to Husky Stadium; on the north side of Pacific Place on the Burke-Gilman Trail; and on the west side of Montlake Boulevard near the University of Washington Medical Center. In 2007, the Seattle Design Commission recommended an overpass to cross Montlake Boulevard in lieu of the underground walkway, and Sound Transit updated the station's design plan <b>accordingly</b> <b>with</b> a bridge on the north side of the Rainier Vista triangle. The University of Washington unveiled its plans to redevelop the Rainier Vista triangle into a landscaped park, with a land bridge over Pacific Place, and requested that Sound Transit connect the station through a mid-block crosswalk instead of the bridge. The mid-block crosswalk was rejected by the FTA, and a compromise pedestrian overpass connecting to the center of the Rainier Vista triangle was adopted in 2011.|$|E

Observing Pillai's work, Acharya and Iyer suggested to the Paris Indian Society that their work by expanded beyond {{the work of the}} Paris publication. <b>Accordingly,</b> <b>with</b> funds from Madam Cama, Virendranath Chattopadhyaya was sent to Berlin to begin publication of the Talvar.
