The results illustrated the farm mechanization average cost was about 963. 8 Riyals / hectare. However, the average cost has decreased from 1685 Riyals / hectare for farm size less than 100 hectare to 576 Riyals / hectare for farm size larger than 200 hectare. The mechanization <b>costs</b> include; the <b>annual</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> (398 R/h), repairing and maintenance costs (288 R/h), labor costs (210. 8 R/h), and machines operation costs (66 R/h). The farms have spent a lot of investments on farm machines about one third of their net annual revenues; the net annual revenues have reached about 309 % compared to the investments in farm machines. The study has evaluated the relative size standard of the invested capital in mechanization related to both of laborer number and the farm production of wheat and barley, and the farm size represented by its area, it has reached 193. 02 Riyals/laborer and 4. 6 Riyals/ton and 9. 04 Riyals/Hectare. The invested capital economic average revenue in the sample mechanization has reached 0. 8 % and the direct operation cost of the land preparation for farming has reached 400 Riyals/hour, and for irrigation, it has reached 210. 5 Riyals/hour, and for the harvester 241, 99 Riyals/hour.

This analysis was performed to provide a decision making model for the acquisition of computer assets. It is additionally intended {{to serve as a}} framework to compare {{the costs and benefits of}} leasing over purchasing. To address this issue, a capital budgeting model was developed and net present value analysis performed. In constructing this model, several factors were considered, including: The purchase cost of computer equipment, <b>annual</b> lease payments, <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs,</b> the opportunity cost of purchasing, tax revenue implications and various leasing terms. Data for this thesis was collected using historical records, literature reviews, and interviews.

40|$|Background: Studies {{into the}} costs of syndromic {{surveillance}} systems are rare, especially for estimating the direct costs involved in implementing and maintaining these systems. An Integrated Surveillance System in rural China (ISSC project), {{with the aim of}} providing an early warning system for outbreaks, was implemented; village clinics were the main surveillance units. Village doctors expressed their willingness to join in the surveillance if a proper subsidy was provided. This study aims to measure {{the costs of}} data collection by village clinics to provide a reference regarding the subsidy level required for village clinics to participate in data collection. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a village clinic questionnaire and a staff questionnaire using a purposive sampling strategy. We tracked reported events using the ISSC internal database. Cost data included staff time, and the <b>annual</b> <b>depreciation</b> and opportunity <b>costs</b> of computers. We measured the village doctors’ time costs for data collection by multiplying the number of full time employment equivalents devoted to the surveillance by the village doctors’ annual salaries and benefits, which equaled their net incomes. We estimated the <b>depreciation</b> and opportunity <b>costs</b> of computers by calculating the equivalent annual computer cost and then allocating this to the surveillance based on the percentage usage. Results: The estimated total annual cost of collecting data was 1, 423 Chinese Renminbi (RMB) in 2012 (P 25 [*]=[*] 857, P 75 [*]=[*] 3284), including 1, 250 RMB (P 25 [*]=[*] 656, P 75 [*]=[*] 3000) staff time costs and 134 RMB (P 25 [*]=[*] 101, P 75 [*]=[*] 335) <b>depreciation</b> and opportunity <b>costs</b> of computers.

40|$|Seven {{different}} remaining value {{functions for}} tractors and harvesters were estimated {{using data from}} advertised prices for used farm equipment. The generalised Box-Cox model was used to nest six of the seven functions. The more complex Box-Cox function explained the data no better than simpler models such as the linear, sum-of-the-year’s-digits, or double-square root models. The simpler functions were easier to manipulate to estimate <b>depreciation</b> rates and <b>costs.</b> There were up to four components of depreciation, drive-away, brand, age, and use related, depending on functional form. Drive-away depreciation is the immediate loss in value of a machine due to purchase, in some models this <b>depreciation</b> <b>cost</b> was higher than either age or use related <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs.</b> When drive-away <b>depreciation</b> {{was treated as a}} separate cost to age and use depreciation, or when there was no drive-away depreciation due to functional form, the age to use <b>depreciation</b> <b>cost</b> ratios were in the range of 1. 5 - 2 to 1.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the issue of}} allocation of <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> in the dynamic inputoutput model of an industrial enterprise. Accounting the <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> in such a model improves the policy of fixed assets management. It is particularly relevant to develop the algorithm for the allocation of <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> {{in the construction of}} dynamic input-output model of an industrial enterprise, since such enterprises have a significant amount of fixed assets. Implementation of terms of the adequacy of such an algorithm itself allows: evaluating the appropriateness of investments in fixed assets, studying the final financial results of an industrial enterprise, depending on management decisions in the depreciation policy. It is necessary to note that the model in question for the enterprise is always degenerate. It is caused by the presence of zero rows in the matrix of capital expenditures by lines of structural elements unable to generate fixed assets (part of the service units, households, corporate consumers). The paper presents the algorithm for the allocation of <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> for the model. This algorithm was developed by the authors and served as the basis for further development of the flowchart for subsequent implementation with use of software. The construction of such algorithm and its use for dynamic input-output models of industrial enterprises is actualized by international acceptance of the effectiveness of the use of input-output models for national and regional economic systems. This is what allows us to consider that the solutions discussed in the article are of interest to economists of various industrial enterprises...|$|R

40|$|In the Tokachi District {{there has}} been an {{astonishing}} increase in the development of large-scale upland farming, especially in the peripheral areas where agricultural production capacity is lower. Recently, {{there has been}} an increase in number of upland farms that are more than 50 hectares in size. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to illustrate the potential problems associated with expanding the scale of upland farms. The study examined four upland farmers in the Tokachi District. 1) The proportion of cultivated crops relative to farm size has steadily declined in the last ten years. By changing work procedures it is possible to maintain current upland farming land use patterns and the crop rotation system for farms up to 50 hectares in size. When farms reach 70 hectares in size, however, it is very difficult to maintain the crop rotation system without changing work procedures and the combination of cultivated crops. If changes are not made the farmer is forced to perform work at less than optimal times. Expanding upland farming scale to 70 hectares, without a technical foundation, will cause a decrease in land productivity. 2) Enlarging farm size while maintaining the crop rotation system requires an increase in fixed capital expenditures. This in turn raises <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs.</b> The <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> for a 70 -hectare farm are especially high and the <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> per hectare cannot be reduced. In short, economies of scale do not exist in large-scale upland farming. This suggests that fixed machinery costs will not decrease with an increase in farm size. 3) Enlarging farm size, up to 50 hectares, in peripheral areas clearly increases farm income, but at 70 hectares, because of a decrease in land productivity and an increase in <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs,</b> farm income is severely restricted. At 70 hectares the efficiency of farm management decreases and both income ratio and income per acre falls...|$|R
