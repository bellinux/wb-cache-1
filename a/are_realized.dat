5|$|The Incredible Hulk is a 2008 American superhero film {{based on}} the Marvel Comics {{character}} the Hulk, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Universal Pictures. It is the second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Louis Leterrier, with a screenplay by Zak Penn. It stars Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson, Ty Burrell, and William Hurt. In The Incredible Hulk, a new backstory is established where Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the supersoldier program through gamma radiation. On the run, he attempts to cure himself of the Hulk before he is captured by General Thaddeus Ross, but his worst fears <b>are</b> <b>realized</b> when power-hungry soldier Emil Blonsky becomes a similar, but more bestial creature.|$|E

25|$|Dynkin {{diagrams}} {{have been}} drawn {{in a number of}} ways; the convention followed here is common, with 180° angles on nodes of valence 2, 120° angles on the valence 3 node of Dn, and 90°/90°/180° angles on the valence 3 node of En, with multiplicity indicated by 1, 2, or 3 parallel edges, and root length indicated by drawing an arrow on the edge for orientation. Beyond simplicity, a further benefit of this convention is that diagram automorphisms <b>are</b> <b>realized</b> by Euclidean isometries of the diagrams.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} reading traditions have been {{preserved}} in liturgical use.

The Samaritan tradition has a complex vowel system which does not correspond closely to the Tiberian systems.|$|E
25|$|Besides the forms, the {{cross-reference}} tables another useful supplement. They {{summarize the}} measures {{and most important}} threats for individual components. Measures, as well as threats, are cited with mnemonics. Measures are cited with a priority and a classification. The table contains correlations between measures and the threats they address. However, the cross-reference tables only cite the most important threats. If the measure cited for a given threat is not applicable for the individual IT system, it is not superfluous. Baseline protection can only be ensured if all measures <b>are</b> <b>realized.</b>|$|E
40|$|Tay [6] {{characterized}} the multigraphs which can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-and-bar frameworks. Subsequently, Tay [7] and Whiteley [11] independently {{characterized the}} multigraphs which can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-and-hinge frameworks. We adapt Whiteley’s proof technique {{to characterize the}} multigraphs which can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-bar-and-hinge frameworks. More importantly, we obtain a sufficient condition for a multigraph to <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as an infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-and-hinge framework in which all hinges lie in the same hyperplane. This result is related to a longstanding conjecture of Tay and Whiteley [8] which would characterize when a multigraph can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as an infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-andhinge framework {{in which all the}} hinges incident to each body lie in a common hyperplane. As a corollary we deduce that if a graph G has two spanning trees which use each edge of G at most twice, then its square can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as an infinitesimally rigid 3 -dimensional bar-and-joint framework...|$|R

25|$|Proponents of a {{consumption}} tax {{argue that the}} income tax system creates perverse incentives by encouraging taxpayers to spend rather than save: a taxpayer is only taxed once on income spent immediately, while any interest earned on saved income is itself taxed. To the extent that this is considered unjust, it may be remedied {{in a variety of}} ways, e.g. excluding investment income from taxable income, making investments deductible and therefore only taxing them when gains <b>are</b> <b>realized,</b> or replacing the income tax by other forms of tax, such as a sales tax.|$|E
25|$|In many {{synthetic}} processes using {{transition metal}} catalysts, metal nanoparticles {{play an important}} role as the actual catalyst or as a catalyst reservoir. ILs are an appealing medium for the formation and stabilization of catalytically active transition metal nanoparticles. More importantly, ILs can be made that incorporate coordinating groups, for example, with nitrile groups on either the cation or anion (CN-IL). In various C-C coupling reactions catalyzed by a palladium catalyst, it has been found that palladium nanoparticles are better stabilized in CN-IL compared to non-functionalized ionic liquids; thus enhanced catalytic activity and recyclability <b>are</b> <b>realized.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aversive {{racism is}} a form of {{implicit}} racism in which a person's unconscious negative evaluations of racial or ethnic minorities <b>are</b> <b>realized</b> by a persistent avoidance of interaction with other racial and ethnic groups. As opposed to traditional, overt racism, which is characterized by overt hatred for and explicit discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, aversive racism is characterized by more complex, ambivalent expressions and attitudes. Aversive racism is similar in implications to the concept of symbolic or modern racism (described below), which is also a form of implicit, unconscious, or covert attitude which results in unconscious forms of discrimination.|$|E
