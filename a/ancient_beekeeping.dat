50|$|The {{honey bee}} {{is one of}} the few {{invertebrate}} animals to have been domesticated. Wild honey was collected by man in the Palaeolithic or Mesolithic periods, with evidence from rock art from France and Spain around 8,000 years old. Bees were likely first domesticated in <b>ancient</b> Egypt, where <b>beekeeping</b> is depicted in tomb paintings. Bees were brought to North America in 1622.|$|R
5000|$|Crane wrote over 180 papers, articles, and books, many {{when she}} was in her 70s and 80s. Honey: A Comprehensive Survey (1975), in which she contributed several {{important}} chapters, and edited, came about because she told the publisher (Heinemann Press) that a book on the subject was sorely needed. Although now out of print, it remains the most significant review on the subject ever written. A Book of Honey (1980) and The Archaeology of Beekeeping (1983) reflected her strong interests in nutrition and the <b>ancient</b> past of <b>beekeeping.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Amos {{released}} {{two more}} albums with the label, The Beekeeper (2005) and American Doll Posse (2007). Both albums received generally favorable reviews. The Beekeeper was conceptually {{influenced by the}} <b>ancient</b> art of <b>beekeeping,</b> which she considered a source of female inspiration and empowerment. Through extensive study, Amos also wove in {{the stories of the}} Gnostic gospels and the removal of women from a position of power within the Christian church to create an album based largely on religion and politics. The album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, placing her in an elite group of women who have secured five or more US Top 10 album debuts. While the newly merged label was present throughout the production process of The Beekeeper, Amos and her crew nearly completed her next project, American Doll Posse, before inviting the label to listen to it. American Doll Posse, another concept album, is fashioned around a group of girls (the [...] "posse") who are used as a theme of alter-egos of Amos's. Musically and stylistically, the album saw Amos return to a more confrontational nature. Like its predecessor, American Doll Posse debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200.|$|R
50|$|The Lithuanian Museum of <b>Ancient</b> <b>Beekeeping</b> (Senovinės bitininkystės muziejus), {{established}} in 1984 near Stripeikiai in northeastern Lithuania, displays {{the history of}} beekeeping in the area.The museum, part of Aukštaitija National Park, was founded by the beekeeper Bronius Kazlas.|$|E
50|$|Ezra Marcus of the University of Haifa, {{said the}} finding was {{a glimpse of}} <b>ancient</b> <b>beekeeping</b> seen in Near Eastern texts and ancient art. Religious {{practice}} was evidenced by an altar decorated with fertility figurines found alongside the hives.|$|E
50|$|Utena County is {{the second}} most popular tourism {{destination}} in Lithuania (after the seaside). Approximately 31% of territory is covered with forests. There are 1002 lakes in the county. They are connected by rivers and provide good opportunities for water tourism. One of the biggest tourism attractions is Aukštaitija National Park. In addition, the county has six other regional parks. There are a number of unique places of interest that can be found only in Utena county, e.g., Asveja, the longest lake in Lithuania and Lake Tauragnas, the deepest one; Horse Museum, <b>Ancient</b> <b>Beekeeping</b> Museum, Ethnocosmological Museum, narrow gauge railway, a burial mound exposition, an exhibition of stone dust pictures.|$|E
50|$|The {{archaeologist}} Amihai Mazar cites 30 intact hives {{that were}} discovered {{in the ruins of}} the city of Rehov (2,000 residents in 900 BC, Israelites and Canaanites). This is evidence that an advanced honey industry existed in Israel, approximately 4,000 years ago. The beehives, made of straw and unbaked clay, were found in orderly rows, with a total of 150 hives, many broken. Ezra Marcus from the University of Haifa said the discovery provided a glimpse of <b>ancient</b> <b>beekeeping</b> seen in texts and ancient art from the Near East. An altar decorated with fertility figurines was found alongside the hives and may indicate religious practices associated with beekeeping. While beekeeping predates these ruins, this is the oldest apiary yet discovered.|$|E
50|$|There are 116 {{villages in}} the park with about 2300 residents. The first villages are {{mentioned}} in the 14th century (Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, was first mentioned in written sources in 1323). The most famous of the villages is Palūšė where the park administration is based. The church, built in 1750, {{is thought to be}} the oldest surviving wooden church in Lithuania and was featured on 1 litas banknote. Stripeikiai is the oldest village in the park, now known for its unique Lithuanian Museum of <b>Ancient</b> <b>Beekeeping.</b> Ginučiai is another famous village and tourists are attracted by its 19th-century watermill. Being one of the few mills that still has the original mechanisms, it has been declared an engineering monument. Two hillforts of national importance are nearby. Kaltanėnai, with 300 inhabitants, is the largest village.|$|E
40|$|In {{the ancient}} world beeswax and honey were of crucial {{importance}} not only for nutrition, but also {{for a range of}} activities including various artisanal practices. A rich body of iconographic and literary evidence has proven very informative, but archaeological data are strongly underrepresented in studies on <b>ancient</b> <b>beekeeping.</b> A multidisciplinary excavation project of the Etruscan trade center of Forcello near Bagnolo San Vito (Mantua province), led to the discovery of charred honeycombs in a workshop dated to 510 - 495 BCE. Morphoscopical, palynological and chemical analyses (IR, LC-MS, GC-MS) were conducted on these honeycombs and their associated materials (bee-breads and a mixture of melted honeycombs) in order to reconstruct beekeeping practices and the local environment. Palynological data indicate that honeybees were feeding on plants from both aquatic and ruderal landscapes. The palynological record from the bee-breads suggests the practice of itinerant beekeeping along rivers, an activity described by Pliny the Elder (Natural History, XXI. 43. 73) a few centuries later in relation to the town of Ostiglia (Mantua province) ca. 20 km downstream the investigated site. Hence, confirming the historical source, beekeeping in Iron Age Northern Italy appears to be characterized by a remarkably high degree of specialization. In addition, the pollen content of the melted honeycombs provides evidence for an unprecedented Vitis vinifera (grapevine) honey. The pollination syndrome suggests that bees fed on nectar of pre-domesticated or early-domesticated varieties of Vitis vinifera, confirming the archaeobotanical record of pips from Iron Age Northern Italy...|$|E
