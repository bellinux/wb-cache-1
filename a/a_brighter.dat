5|$|Most sights {{have either}} active or passive {{adjustments}} for the reticle brightness, which help the shooter adapt to different lighting conditions. A very dim reticle will help prevent loss of night vision in low-light conditions, while <b>a</b> <b>brighter</b> reticle will display more clearly in full sunlight.|$|E

25|$|Temporary flash blindness. This works {{exactly like}} <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> camera flash: {{there is no}} injury, but night vision is {{temporarily}} knocked out. There may be afterimages—again, exactly like <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> camera flash leaving temporary spots.|$|R
2500|$|For {{a set of}} {{subtractive}} {{primary colors}} for humans, as in mixing of pigments for printing, cyan (<b>a</b> <b>bright</b> greenish-blue), magenta (<b>a</b> <b>bright</b> reddish purple), and yellow are often used (usually supplemented by black to make CMYK).|$|R

5|$|Greenhouse foreman George Romaine {{propagated}} an American Beauty {{rose with}} longer, more-pointed buds and <b>a</b> <b>brighter</b> color, and Paul M. Pierson registered {{it with the}} American Rose Society as the Briarcliff Rose. It is Briarcliff Manor's village symbol, and since 2006 has been used on village street signs. Although the Briarcliff Manor Garden Club also uses the Briarcliff Rose as its symbol, the variety is now lost.|$|E
5|$|Krypton {{is mixed}} with argon in energy {{efficient}} fluorescent lamps, reducing the power consumption, but also reducing the light output and raising the cost. Krypton costs about 100 {{times as much as}} argon. Krypton (along with xenon) is also used to fill incandescent lamps to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures. <b>A</b> <b>brighter</b> light results with more blue color than conventional incandescent lamps.|$|E
5|$|Reflective of the {{documentary}} theme, Yamaguchi saw the album expressing {{the ups and downs}} of regular days, more so than previous albums. Despite the inspiration taken from the heavy events of the earthquake, Yamaguchi felt that because the album featured three singles that were tailored to be heard by a wide audience, which pushed the album into <b>a</b> <b>brighter</b> sound.|$|E

5|$|S.coccinea var. jurana was {{described}} by Jean Boudier (1903) as a variety of the species having <b>a</b> <b>brighter</b> and more orange-colored fruit body, and with flattened or blunt-ended ascospores. Today it {{is known as the}} distinct species S.jurana. S.coccinea var. albida, named by George Edward Massee in 1903 (as Geopyxis coccinea var. albida), has a cream-colored rather than red interior surface, but is otherwise identical to the typical variety.|$|E
5|$|The Acanthizidae are a {{group of}} 35 species of small to medium mostly insectivorous {{passerine}} birds found in Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand and the south-west Pacific. They have short rounded wings, slender bills, long legs and a short tail. Most species have olive, grey or brown plumage, although some have patches of <b>a</b> <b>brighter</b> yellow. Six species are found in Tasmania, of which three are endemic.|$|E
5|$|First and Second World War dazzle camouflage, {{pioneered by}} English artist Norman Wilkinson, was {{used not to}} make ships disappear, but to make them seem smaller and/or faster, to {{encourage}} misidentification by an enemy {{and to make the}} ships harder to hit. In the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy trialled a form of active camouflage, counter-illumination, using diffused lighting to prevent ships from appearing as dark shapes against <b>a</b> <b>brighter</b> sky during the night. It reduced visibility by up to 70%, but was unreliable and never went into production.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting {{his players}} {{to be more}} {{distinctly}} dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to <b>a</b> <b>brighter</b> pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for {{the origin of the}} white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the {{original}} clock was moved from its location near 42nd Street, {{and the building}} where the sign had been mounted was demolished so One Bryant Park could be built. An updated model was installed one block away {{on the side of}} a Durst building at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, facing Sixth Avenue near the southeast corner of the intersection with West 44th Street. The new clock is located next to an Internal Revenue Service office. The new clock, which can run backward, is outfitted with <b>a</b> <b>brighter</b> seven-segment display with multiple LEDs per segment, allowing the numbers to be read more easily.|$|E
5|$|The snoring rail (Aramidopsis plateni) {{also known}} as the Celebes rail or Platen's rail is a large flightless rail, {{the only member of the}} genus Aramidopsis. It is an Indonesian endemic found in dense {{vegetation}} in wet areas of Sulawesi and nearby Buton. The rail has grey underparts, a white chin, brown wings and a rufous patch on the hindneck. The sexes are similar, but the female has <b>a</b> <b>brighter</b> neck patch and a differently coloured bill and iris. The typical call is the snoring ee-orrrr sound that gives the bird its English name.|$|E

50|$|A typical coronal mass {{ejection}} {{may have}} {{any or all}} of three distinctive features: a cavity of low electron density, a dense core (the prominence, which appears on coronagraph images as <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> region embedded in this cavity), and <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> leading edge.|$|R
5|$|United's playing kit {{consists}} of tangerine shirts and black shorts, first used {{when the team}} played under the Dallas Tornado moniker in the United Soccer Association competition of 1967, which they {{were invited to participate}} in after their first European excursion had created many headlines in the football world. After persuasion by the wife of manager Jerry Kerr, the colour would soon be adopted as the club's own in 1969 to give the club <b>a</b> <b>brighter,</b> more modern image. The new colour was paraded {{for the first time in}} a pre-season friendly against Everton in August.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, Stojanović wrote poems, {{only one}} of which is published—in a 1918 issue of the {{literary}} magazine Književni jug, whose editor was future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić. For this poem, Stojanović was inspired by the Serbian epic hero Ailing Dojčin. A number of Stojanović's poems are preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ilić. According to the poet Dragan Kolundžija, Stojanović's poems are lyrical miniatures composed in free verse, focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolundžija finds that what inspired Stojanović to write poetry is reflected in his verse Krvav je bol (Pain is bloody). According to poet Miroslav Feldman, who first met Stojanović in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a yearning for <b>a</b> <b>brighter,</b> more joyous life.|$|E
5|$|Kerry was {{disappointed}} with his performances, {{feeling that he}} had failed to perform to his potential amid the pressure and excitement of an Olympics. However, he felt that his experience of racing against the likes of Naber and Roland Matthes would hold him in good stead. On <b>a</b> <b>brighter</b> note, Kerry's performances impressed the leading American coach Doc Counsilman, who invited him to come and swim at Indiana University after Kerry finished his secondary schooling in Australia. Kerry successfully defended his 200m backstroke national title in 1977, but the time was more than four seconds slower than his effort in the previous year. He combined with his New South Wales teammates to win all three relays, again in times substantially slower than in the preceding Olympic year. The performances earned him selection for the Australian team for the Coca-Cola Meet in London, but Kerry felt that he lacked motivation after the Olympics. Upon returning, he decided to absent himself from such events.|$|E

5|$|Located in {{the west}} of the {{constellation}} and depicting the peacock's tail are Eta and Xi Pavonis. At apparent magnitude 3.6, Eta is a luminous orange giant of spectral type K2II some 350 light years distant from Earth. Xi Pavonis is a multiple star system visible in small telescopes as <b>a</b> <b>brighter</b> orange star and fainter white companion. Located around 470 light years from Earth, the system has a magnitude of 4.38. AR Pavonis is a faint but well-studied eclipsing binary composed of a red giant and smaller hotter star some 18000 light years from Earth. It has some features of a cataclysmic variable, the smaller component most likely having an accretion disc. The visual magnitude ranges from 7.4 to 13.6 over 605 days.|$|E
5|$|Seyfert's Sextet is a {{group of}} six galaxies, four of which are {{interacting}} gravitationally and two of which simply appear {{to be a part of}} the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light-years from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large elliptical galaxy. The radio source 3C 326 was originally though to emanate from a giant elliptical galaxy. However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead <b>a</b> <b>brighter,</b> smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north. This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due to the energy from the radio galaxy nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Two red keto-carotenoid pigments, {{canthaxanthin}} and adonirubin, {{are responsible}} for the redness in the red-capped robin's plumage. The birds are unable to synthesize these compounds themselves, and hence need to obtain them from their food. Carotenoids are costly to metabolise and are also required for use in immune function, hence birds need to be in good condition to have enough left for use in red feathers. This makes red plumage a good advertisement to prospective mates. A 2001 field study at Terrick Terrick National Park in Victoria found that males who had greater reproductive success and were in better condition moulted into <b>a</b> <b>brighter</b> plumage the following year. However, male age and condition at the time were more likely to predict mating success for the following breeding season. Adult males can breed at one year of age and may do so while yet in non-breeding plumage, but they are less successful at reproducing at this age. The oldest recorded age is 5 years and 7 months for a bird banded near Beverley, Western Australia, in 1990.|$|E
