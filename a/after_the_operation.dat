5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> closed, {{at the end}} of June 1944, {{the threat}} of {{invasion}} from the United States was informally kept alive. It was revisited as Ironside II in mid-July as support for Operation Ferdinand. The invasion story was replaced with a supposed Allied plan to increase French resistance in the Bordeaux region to tie up German forces. Most of Ironside II was ignored by the Germans, whose interest had turned away from the region.|$|E

5|$|For both NSCLC and SCLC, the {{two general}} types of staging {{evaluations}} are clinical staging and surgical staging. Clinical staging is performed prior to definitive surgery. It {{is based on}} the results of imaging studies (such as CT scans and PET scans) and biopsy results. Surgical staging is evaluated either during or <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> and {{is based on the}} combined results of surgical and clinical findings, including surgical sampling of thoracic lymph nodes.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess whether}} {{regional}} abnormalities of ventricular function {{are present in}} patients <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation</b> and to explore the implications of any such abnormalities for ventricular filling. DESIGN AND PATIENTS [...] Prospective study in which 25 patients <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation</b> were compared with 25 healthy controls and 12 patients with a univentricular atrioventricular connection, before <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation.</b> INTERVENTIONS [...] Doppler echocardiography, with simultaneous electrocardiogram, phonocardiogram, and respirometer. RESULTS [...] Isovolumic relaxation time was significantly longer in patients <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation</b> than in normal children (p less than 0. 001) or the preoperative patients (p = 0. 001). Systolic intraventricular flow was detected in 60 % of patients <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation</b> and in 42 % of preoperative patients. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation</b> 80 % of patients showed intraventricular flow during isovolumic relaxation compared with 8 % of normal children {{and none of the}} preoperative patients. CONCLUSIONS [...] Incoordinate ventricular relaxation is common <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation.</b> This may have important implications for ventricular diastolic filling, pulmonary blood flow, and cardiac output in these patients...|$|R

5|$|During the {{recording}} of the album Pop in 1996, Mullen suffered from severe back problems. Recording was delayed due to surgery. When he left the hospital, he arrived back in the studio to find {{the rest of the}} band experimenting more than ever with electronic drum machines, something driven largely by guitarist The Edge's interest in dance and hip-hop music, and, given his weakness <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> he relented, allowing The Edge to continue using drum machines, which contributed heavily to the album's electronic feel.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{fighting}} around Arras, the 33rd {{was moved to}} Nieuwpoort, Belgium, {{as part of the}} build-up for the planned Operation Hush, a breakthrough along the coastal front coupled with an amphibious landing behind German lines. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> was cancelled, the division remained at Niewpoort, where Pinney was hospitalised and temporarily relinquished command. He remained in hospital for two months, during which time he missed heavy fighting by the 33rd at the Battle of Passchendaele. After VIII Corps Commander Hunter-Weston had sacked the current divisional commander, Philip. R. Wood, for lack of aggression (unjustifiably, in Simon Robbins’ view), Pinney returned to the division on 30 November, amid rumours that he had got the return posting through personal influence.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Ravel {{began to}} suffer pain from his condition, and was {{examined}} by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment.

Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> {{there seemed to be}} an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma.

5|$|Laubenstein {{developed}} appendicitis in 1984 and {{was afraid}} to undergo surgery {{because of the risk}} that general anesthesia would pose to her lungs, already compromised from polio. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> her surgeons had trouble weaning her off the ventilator and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill with a combination of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking corticosteroids for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To study {{regional}} {{wall motion}} of the systemic ventricle in patients <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation.</b> DESIGN AND PATIENTS [...] Systemic ventricular angiograms of 15 patients <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation</b> and of 11 unoperated patients with a univentricular atrioventricular connection were digitised frame by frame. Strict criteria for abnormal wall motion were used so that minor abnormalities were not considered. RESULTS [...] Incoordinate contraction of the ventricular wall was found {{in five of the}} 11 patients before and in four of <b>the</b> 15 patients <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation</b> (NS). Only three of the 11 patients before <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation,</b> showed incoordination of ventricular relaxation, but incoordinate relaxation was seen in 12 of <b>the</b> 15 patients <b>after</b> <b>operation</b> (p less than 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS [...] Whereas incoordination of ventricular contraction was common in patients with a univentricular atrioventricular connection, before or <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation,</b> incoordinate relaxation of the ventricular wall was a common consequence of <b>the</b> Fontan <b>operation</b> and was rare in patients before operation...|$|R

5|$|The first {{successful}} heart transplantation {{was performed in}} 1967 by the South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. This marked an important milestone in cardiac surgery, capturing the attention of both the medical profession and the world at large.

Louis Washkansky, the first recipient of a donated heart, died 18 days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> while other patients did not survive {{for more than a}} few weeks. The American surgeon Norman Shumway has been credited for his efforts to improve transplantation techniques, along with pioneers Richard Lower, Vladimir Demikhov and Adrian Kantrowitz.

5|$|The offensives were {{accompanied}} by the displacement {{of most of the}} Croatian Serb population of the area captured by the HV. The refugees initially fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the majority were soon settled in the JNA-held Baranja region of eastern Croatia. The offensive provoked accusations that Croatian troops had committed ethnic cleansing and civil-rights abuses. These accusations were contested by the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM). A month <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> the retreating paramilitary unit known as the White Eagles perpetrated the Voćin massacre, and its war crimes were prosecuted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.|$|E

5|$|On 27 December 2011, presidential {{spokesman}} Alfredo Scoccimaro {{announced that}} Kirchner {{had been diagnosed}} with thyroid cancer on 22 December and that she would undergo surgery on 4 January 2012. The standard procedure in these operations is to expose the thyroid gland so that a pathologist can take a sample, analyze it looking for carcinogenic cells, and then decide whether it needs to be removed. In Kirchner's case, this step was omitted and the gland was removed directly. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> it was revealed that she had been misdiagnosed and did not have cancer. On 5 October 2013, doctors ordered Kirchner to rest for a month after they found blood on her brain caused by a head injury she received on 8 August 2012. She was re-admitted to hospital and had successful surgery on 8 October 2013 to remove blood from under a membrane covering her brain.|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffe command {{understood}} that their support would be {{crucial for the}} success of Operation Citadel, but problems with supply shortfalls hampered their preparations. Partisan activity, particularly behind Army Group Center, slowed the rate of re-supply and cut short the Luftwaffe's ability to build up essential stockpiles of petrol, oil, lubricants, engines, munitions, and, unlike Red Army units there were no reserves of aircraft {{that could be used to}} replace damaged aircraft over the course of the operation. Fuel was the most significant limiting factor. To help build up supplies for the support of Citadel, the Luftwaffe greatly curtailed its operations during the last week of June. Despite this conservation of resources, the Luftwaffe did not have the resources to sustain an intensive air effort for more than a few days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> began.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{returned}} to Germany <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> was complete. Throughout 1998–2002 it would train with German engineers, including German units from Lahnstein and Speyer, {{as well as}} the German Engineering School. The brigade also set up marksman competitions with German units, to give US soldiers the chance to earn the German Armed Forces Badge of Marksmanship, the German Sports Badge, and other badges. Over 2,500 of these badges would be earned by soldiers of the 130th over the years that it served in Germany. It also trained extensively in bridging operations at rivers throughout Germany. In summer of 2000, the brigade participated in a joint engineering exercise in Moldova with US Navy Seabees and the 505th Engineer Brigade of the North Carolina Army National Guard. The exercise was the first ever conducted in Moldova and featured numerous training scenarios {{as well as the}} construction of a medical clinic. Several other such exercises were conducted in nations throughout Europe including Albania, Romania, Georgia, Latvia, Bulgaria and Macedonia. They also performed annual humanitarian missions to Poland, working on community projects around the country with the assistance of Polish Armed Forces every September, as a training exercise.|$|E
5|$|The {{unit was}} {{split into two}} regiments in December 1939, with Fegelein in charge of both. By March 1941 their {{strength}} was 3,500 men.

The two regiments were amalgamated into the SS Cavalry Brigade on 31 July, twelve days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> started. Fegelein's final report, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, and 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700. The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses in November 1941 in the Battle of Moscow, with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons. Fegelein was appointed as commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer on 20 April 1943. This unit saw service in the Soviet Union in attacks on partisans and civilians. In addition, SS Cavalry regiments served in Croatia and Hungary.|$|E
