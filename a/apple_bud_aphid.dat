40|$|Increasing {{interest}} in cryopreservation of dormant buds reveals {{the need for}} {{better understanding of the}} role of dormancy in cryotolerance. Dormancy stage and low temperature survival of vegetative <b>apple</b> <b>buds</b> (Malus domestica Borkh.), cultivars Sampion and Spartan, collected from orchard were evaluated during three seasons contrasting in temperature and precipitation throughout the arrested plant growth period. During each season, the cultivars differed either in the onset of the endodormancy or in the length of the endodormant period. A simple relation between endodormancy of the buds and their water content was not detected. The cryosurvival of vegetative <b>apple</b> <b>buds</b> of both cultivars correlated with their cold hardening without direct regard to their particular phase of dormancy. The period of the highest bud cryotolerance after low temperature exposure overlapped with the endodormant period in some evaluated seasons. Both cultivars had the highest cryosurvival in December and January. The presented data were compared with our previous results from a dormancy study of in vitro apple culture. Endodormancy coincided with the period of successful cryosurvival of <b>apple</b> <b>buds</b> after liquid nitrogen exposure, but as such it was not decisive for their survival and did not limit their successful cryopreservation...|$|R

40|$|A {{biological}} {{method was}} developed to evaluate the dormancy state of <b>apple</b> <b>buds</b> under controlled conditions. Cuttings (20 - 25 cm long) of ‘Castel Gala’ and ‘Royal Gala’ were sampled during the winter period, evaluating different cold and heat regimes to induce budbreak. Contrasts were tested in plant material processing (single node x intact cuttings), cold storage method to break dormancy in incubator chambers (planted in pots with floral foam x wrapped in plastic film, vertically or horizontally) and budbreak method in plant growth chambers (base immersed in water x planted in floral foam). Intact cuttings stored vertically in the cold represented better the natural interactions between buds than single node cuttings. Budbreak of lateral buds was strongly influenced by apical dominance. Wrapping cuttings in plastic film optimized internal space usage in the incubators {{and the number of}} evaluated buds, compared to planting cuttings in pots. During the warm period in the growth chambers, intact cuttings on floral foam resulted in better bud preservation and survival throughout the evaluation period, compared to cuttings with bases immersed in water. The most suitable conditions to evaluate dormancy evolution in <b>apple</b> <b>buds</b> used plastic-wrapped intact cuttings stored vertically during the cold period, with budbreak evaluation in the warm period after planting the cuttings in floral foam.

40|$|Evolution and {{characteristics}} of <b>apple</b> <b>bud</b> dormancy in mild winter conditions. In order to study bud dormancy in mild winter climate, the evolution of bud bursting capabilities was investigated, using the « one-node-cutting test », during three successive years. The buds were sampled from Golden delicious apple trees grown {{in the region of}} Meknes (Morocco), where now and then abnormal bud burst occurs. The made-up graphs of mean bursting time display a fi rst phase of bud inertia, weak and temporary, of correlative origin, but variable from year to year. This is followed by a peak of true dormancy, wich appears fi rst induced and afterwards removed by the chilling temperatures from november to march. The bud break disorders result thus from the combined effect of a high initial inertia, linked to the previous growth conditions, and a short period of chilling. In fact, the very cause of the disorders is less the insuffi cient chilling avalaible than the double action of these low temperatures that partly increase at fi rst the depth of dormancy before starting to eliminate it...|$|R

Damage is inflicted by nymphs, which feed on developing fruit causing dimpling and fruit distortion. As apple fruits mature, they become {{less susceptible to}} campylomma injury. Injury appears shortly after petal fall as small corky areas alone or small corky areas surrounded by a depression. Golden Delicious is typically more susceptible to damage than Red Delicious. Pear fruit rarely suffer damage, even at high campylomma populations. Campylomma overwinter as eggs laid in the young twigs of apple, pear and other rosaceous plants.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the dormancy dynamic of Imperial Gala <b>apple</b> tree <b>buds</b> and Hosui pear tree buds in a region of low chill occurrence. Experiments were conducted between April and August in 2007 and 2008. Branches were collected every two weeks from an orchard at Porto Amazonas (Paraná State, Brazil). On the last sampling day, an additional set of branches was collected and refrigerated between 4 °C and 7 °C for 1, 440 hours. Dormancy was evaluated using a biological test of single node cuttings isolated in growth chambers (GC) at 25 °C with 16 hours of light exposure. The number of chill hours (CH) and chill units (CU) for the region were recorded. The two species were evaluated in separate experiments. We used 11 completely randomized treatments with four replicas for each species.

Insufficient winter chilling results in irregular and suboptimal bud break in the spring, with negative impacts on apple yield. Trees from apple cultivars with contrasting chilling requirements for bud break were used to investigate {{the expression of the}} entire set of apple genes in response to chilling accumulation in the field and controlled conditions. Total RNA was analysed on the AryANE v. 1. 0 oligonucleotide microarray chip representing 57 000 apple genes. The data were tested for functional enrichment, and differential expression was confirmed by real-time PCR. The largest number of differentially expressed genes was found in samples treated with cold temperatures. Cold exposure mostly repressed expression of transcripts related to photosynthesis, and long-term cold exposure repressed flavonoid biosynthesis genes. Among the differentially expressed selected candidates, we identified genes whose annotations were related to the circadian clock, hormonal signalling, regulation of growth, and flower development. Two genes, annotated as FLOWERING LOCUS C-like and MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING, showed strong differential expression in several comparisons. One of these two genes was upregulated in most comparisons involving dormancy release, and this gene's chromosomal position co-localized with the confidence interval of a major quantitative trait locus for the timing of bud break. These results indicate that photosynthesis and auxin transport are major regulatory nodes of apple dormancy and unveil strong candidates for the control of bud dormancy...|$|R

The experiment was designed to determine the effectiveness of a system sprinkling beginning at the end of rest and at Celsius growing degree hour accumulations relating to stages bud development. The evaluation of limited and unlimited water use and the relation to bloom delay was obtained. The two sprinkler types studied were umbrella and impact. On the umbrella sprinklers, four cycling times (1 / 2, 1 / 3, 1 / 4, and 1 / 6 time) and three threshold temperatures (7, 10, and 13 C) were tested. On the impact sprinkler, three nozzle sizes (4. 0, 3. 6, and 2. 8 mm) were evaluated. The investigation answered many questions, the most important of which were: (1) when only limited bloom delay is needed, more freeze protection can be obtained by sprinkling in the early spring than in the late spring; (2) bloom delay can be regulated by terminating sprinkling at different stages of bud development; (3) to obtain maximum delay, sprinkling should begin at the end of rest and a low threshold temperature for sprinkling should be used for sprinkler initiation; (4) when limited delay is required, greater efficiency of water use can be obtained by lowering the threshold temperature and lowering the application rate...|$|R

Samples were examined {{for the presence of}} overwintering structures of Ampelomyces, common mycoparasites of powdery mildews. Pycnidia and resting hyphae resembling those of Ampelomyces were found on six plant species, including apple. Their viability and subsequent mycoparasitic activity of the hyphae emerging from the overwintered fungal structures were studied in vitro to determine whether they can serve as sources of primary inocula of Ampelomyces in the spring. Overwintered pycnidia of Ampelomyces collected in the spring, and produced in both the ascomata and the conidiophores of powdery mildews during the previous season, initiated the life cycle of these mycoparasites when placed close to fresh powdery mildew colonies in vitro. Similarly, thick-walled resting hyphae, found in the dried powdery mildew mycelia which covered the overwintered aerial parts of the host plants, also germinated and gave rise to new intracellular pycnidia of Ampelomyces when powdery mildew colonies were inoculated with them in vitro. On apple trees, Ampelomyces mycoparasites overwintered as resting hyphae in the dried powdery mildew mycelia covering the shoots and in the parasitized ascomata of Podosphaera leucotricha on the bark and the scales of the buds. Approximately 31 % of the field samples collected from apple trees in spring between 1998 and 2003 contained overwintered structures of Ampelomyces. Artificial bursting of <b>apple</b> <b>buds</b> in the laboratory showed that both P. leucotricha and Ampelomyces start their life cycle during or soon after bud burst, but Ampelomyces can only slowly follow the spread of its mycohost on infected leaves. Most probably, the mycoparasites did not overwinter in the dormant hyphae of P. leucotricha in the buds, but only on the bark and the bud scales, as their hyphae were not found in the young hyphae of apple powdery mildew that appeared on the leaf tissues during bud burst. This study demonstrated that Ampelomyces mycoparasites can survive the winter in the field as pycnidia and as resting hyphae in the dried mycelia of their mycohosts...|$|R

In 2008, trees were pruned and inoculated in April. In 2009 and 2010, another experiment {{was conducted with}} pruning and inoculation in March, April, May and post-harvest. Pruned branches averaged 3. 5 cm diameter and cuts left a stub, average 20 -cm-long. In 2008, flush cuts were compared to stub cuts in a separate experiment. Cut surfaces were inoculated with copper-sensitive Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Pss) (10 to the 8 th cfu/ml). In 2010, the impact of natural and induced freeze events on canker progression was examined. Canker progression was assessed during the growing season. In 2008, bacteria were re-isolated from inoculated cuts and Pss identified with biochemical and PCR assays. In 2008, the efficacy of phosphite or copper against leaf scar infections generated by inoculating branches at 80 percent leaf drop was tested and bud blast assessed. In the 2008 - 2009 dormant season, six sweet cherry orchard planting systems and five cultivars were assessed visually for incidence of cankers to rate relative susceptibility. Laboratory experiments with detached shoots and green cherry fruit were conducted to determine pre-infection and post-infection activity of labeled or specified rates of copper hydroxide (standard), phosphite, Pentra Bark, kasugamycin, biological MOI- 106, biological yeast in proprietary buffer, oxytetracycline, urea, Bacillus subtilis, and hydrogen dioxide against Pss, compared to untreated. The isolate of Pss used for inoculum in the field experiments (Ps 34 collected by Burr from sweet cherry, Wayne County, NY) was submitted for genome sequencing. Three naturally-occurring, streptomycin resistant isolates of Pss were recovered from <b>apple</b> <b>buds</b> in Geneva, NY. Events: A 2009 Sweet Cherry Field Meeting and a 2010 Summer Fruit Tour held at NYSAES, Geneva, NY featured our research, reaching over 240 sweet cherry growers, nurserymen, industry personnel, consultants, educators and faculty. Services: We ruled out bacterial canker outbreaks at three orchards and verified bacterial canker at three orchards.

Singhai et al. (2011) recorded appreciable suppression of common scab of potato through application of vermicompost. According to Arancon et al. (2005), vermicomposts provide some essential nutrient elements that are not available in inorganic fertilizers and these could either have increased the plants resistance to pests or made the plants less palatable to the pests, based on the observation that there was decrease in dry weight losses of peppers, tomatoes and cabbage grown with substitutions of different rates of vermicompost {{in response to the}} aphid, mealy bug and caterpillar infestations. According to Rao (2002), there were considerable decreases in the population of aphids, coccinellid beetles and spider mites in groundnuts grown on soils amended with vermicompost, compared to those grown on soils amended with inorganic fertilizer. Munroe (2007) reported the presence of chitinase enzyme in vermicompost which breaks down the chitin in the exoskeleton of insects and thus repels many different insect pests. Thus the significant increase in marketable fruit yield of S. melongena might be attributed to improved availability of nutrients from macrophyte based vermicompost, in addition to the protection from pests.|$|R

40|$|The U. S. National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation (NCGRP) {{is focused}} on {{research}} associated with the long-term preservation {{of plant and animal}} genetic resources in conjunction with the long-term storage of these resources. The Center securely stores over 730, 000 inventories of plant genetic resources, the majority consisting of the base collection for the National Plant Germplasm System (> 480, 000 inventories). These collections are predominately seed which is dried to between 6 % - 10 % moisture content and stored at - 18 oC. However, ~ 8 % of this base collection is stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen. The criteria of which accession to store in liquid nitrogen and which to store conventionally (- 18 oC) is largely made on a genus-by-genus basis and usually crypreservation is not considered for large sized see and seed with high oil content. Germination of every seed accession which is considered for liquid nitrogen storage is tested both with and without a 24 hour liquid nitrogen exposure to ensure that a particular accession can tolerate liquid nitrogen exposure. In addition to the seed accessions stored at the NPGRP, we also have a large program in the operational storage of vegetatively-propagated accessions in the National Plant Germplasm System. At present, many of these accessions are maintained in a single field site and only ~ 10 % of the 30, 000 vegetatively-propagated accessions in the National Plant Germplasm System are backed up in cryopreservation. Due to the very high labour requirements for cryopreserving clonal germplasm collections (20 - 40 accessions/person/year), the NCGRP has operationally developed a priority system based on existing technology to determine which crops to process for long-term storage. Practically, our efforts are concentrated on crops with developed cryopreservation methods and where support of the crop curator is available. Examples of this collaboration include: 1. Apple (and sour cherry), where a robust dormant bud cryopreservation technology exists. Over 2, 500 apple accessions are in cryostorage at NCGRP yet all phases of this work are dependent on the curator doing all grafting to test post-cryo viability as well as carrying out the monitor testing over time. 2. Garlic, where shoot tips are cryopreserved from field grown bulbs. The quantity of bulbs and number of accessions cryopreserved per year is very much dependent on the curator s ability to do the field work. 3. Accessions that require tissue culture plantlets as a source of the shoot tips (mint, strawberry, currents, blackberries, hops, sweet potato, pear). The NCGRP currently does not have the resources to do the isolation and establishment of the shoot cultures and therefore the curator must be willing to do this work in order to have the crop cryopreserved. Operationally, our criteria for having an accession successfully back-up in cryostorage are a minimum of 40 % viability in the cryopreserved shoot tips and a minimum 60 viable shoot tips cryostored. For most crops, we store 10 shoot tips/cryo vial and with the criteria for success mentioned above, we have a 99 % chance of having at least one viable shoot tip per vial. Fortunately, for the crops we work with, vial-to-vial variability is very low. Research in our operational setting focuses on applying existing techniques to our accessions and laboratory. Often, we need to make minor modifications in techniques so that the techniques are applicable in our system. This research phase may take 1 - 2 years before we consider a technique for a crop ready to start on a large-scale germplasm preservation project. Banana is a crop in this category in our laboratory where very good existing techniques exist yet it takes time to fully implement them into our operational system. Another area of research in our applied preservation setting is extension of the <b>apple</b> dormant <b>bud</b> cryopreservation system to other woody crops. A major determinant for this research is the relative ease of preserving entire collections if dormant buds can be cryopreserved. This operational research approach was only initiated two years ago but we already have initial success with butternut and preliminary data indicates that material from our warmer-winter sites where vegetatively-propagated material is grown (west coast of the U. S.) can be cryopreserved as well as from colder growing regions. The focus crops for this research include a Prunus program (apricot, almond, peach, sweet cherry and plum), walnut, pear, hazelnut, blueberry, pomegranate and pistachio. vokMyynti: MTT, Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R
