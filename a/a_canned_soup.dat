The period after this tour was, for Coupland, “one of the darkest periods of his life”. “I could barely open <b>a</b> <b>can</b> of <b>soup</b> or put gas in the car tank”. During this dark period, Coupland began to write a new novel. This novel became Girlfriend in a Coma; however, he wasn’t sure where the novel {{was going to take}} him when he began to write it.

40|$|Choosing {{an object}} from {{an array of}} similar objects is a task that people {{complete}} frequently throughout their lives (e. g. choosing <b>a</b> <b>can</b> of <b>soup</b> from many <b>cans</b> of <b>soup).</b> Research has also demonstrated that items {{in the middle of}} an array or scene are looked at more often and are more likely to be chosen. This middle preference is surprisingly robust and widespread, having been found in a wide range of perceptual-motor tasks. In a recent review of the literature Bar-Hillel (2015) proposes, among other things, that the middle preference is largely explained by the middle item being easier to reach, either physically or mentally. We specifically evaluate Bar-Hillel’s reachability explanation for choice in non-interactive situations in light of evidence showing an effect of item valence on such choices. This leads us to conclude that the center-stage heuristic account is a more plausible explanation of the middle preference...|$|R

2500|$|Typically sold as <b>a</b> {{condensed}} <b>soup,</b> <b>canned</b> chicken <b>soup,</b> such as Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, {{is notable}} for its high sodium content, 890mg per 1/2 cup serving, giving a 1 1/2 cup bowl [...] of soup about 2,500mg, a full days allowance {{in the case}} of the mainstream brand, Campbell's. Other condensed chicken soups such as Chicken with Rice or Chicken & Stars Soup produced by Campbell have similar amounts, as do generic versions of the product. <b>Canned</b> chicken <b>soup</b> with much less sodium than the traditional formulation is available, including many varieties produced by Campbell's, some with at little as 100mg of sodium. Campbell's claims production of a chicken noodle soup that will find broad consumer acceptance, in short, that will sell, is very difficult.|$|R

50|$|I guess remodernist is {{the next}} {{variation}} of post-modernist, which is to take something {{that was in the}} culture before and then turn it into something else, like taking it out of context. So it's kind of what pop art was in a way. I was using Warhol as kind of <b>a</b> <b>soup</b> <b>can.</b> It's like redoing that but it's done in a completely remodernist way because it's using the technology and the sensibility of contemporary rather than nostalgia.|$|R
50|$|The {{right to}} {{exclusive}} {{use of a}} specific color as a trademark on packaging has generally been mixed in U.S. court cases.

When you start the game, you discover that the Bohines, a nation in the game, are at war with the Prochas, another nation.|$|R
500|$|Warhol clearly {{changed the}} concept of art appreciation. Instead of {{harmonious}} three-dimensional arrangements of objects, he chose mechanical derivatives of commercial illustration {{with an emphasis on}} the packaging. His variations of multiple <b>soup</b> <b>cans,</b> for example, made the process of repetition an appreciated technique: [...] "If you take <b>a</b> Campbell's <b>Soup</b> <b>can</b> and repeat it fifty times, you are not interested in the retinal image. According to Marcel Duchamp, what interests you is the concept that wants to put fifty Campbell's <b>Soup</b> <b>cans</b> on <b>a</b> canvas." [...] The regimented multiple can depictions almost become an abstraction whose details are less important than the panorama. In a sense, the representation was more important than that which was represented. Warhol's interest in machinelike creation during his early pop art days was misunderstood by those in the art world, whose value system was threatened by mechanization.|$|R

The light weight can be any type of object such as a 1-5 lb dumbbell weight, or <b>a</b> <b>soup</b> <b>can.</b> Also you can foam roll the pectorals.

5000|$|Since the 1990s, the <b>canned</b> <b>soup</b> {{market has}} burgeoned with soups marketed as [...] "ready-to-eat", which require no {{additional}} liquid to prepare.

2500|$|Randomly {{included}} with OK Soda selections in vending machines was an OK Soda [...] "prize can".

The design of the prize can {{was different from the}} others and represented a fifth design overall. It was also more cylindrical in shape, considerably lighter (without soda inside) and included a light-blue banner, the only such design to include this color. This program was similar to Coke's previous MagiCan campaign.|$|R
50|$|Product line {{extension}} is {{the procedure}} of {{entering a new}} market segment in its product class by means of using a current brand name. An {{example of this is}} the Campbell Soup Company, predominately <b>a</b> producer of <b>canned</b> <b>soups.</b> They utilize <b>a</b> multiproduct branding strategy by way of soup line extensions. They have over 100 soup flavours putting forward varieties such as regular Campbell soup, condensed, chunky, fresh-brewed, organic, and soup on the go. This approach is seen as favourable as it <b>can</b> result in <b>a</b> lower promotion costs and advertising due to the same name being used on all products, therefore increasing the level of brand awareness. Although, line extension has potential negative outcomes with one being that other items in the company's line may be disadvantaged because of the sale of the extension. Line extensions work at their best when they deliver an increase in company revenue by enticing new buyers or by removing sales from competitors.|$|R
25|$|Warhol {{produced}} both comic {{and serious}} works; his subject could be <b>a</b> <b>soup</b> <b>can</b> or <b>an</b> electric chair. Warhol {{used the same}} techniques—silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors—whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962–63 Death and Disaster series. The Death and Disaster paintings included Red Car Crash, Purple Jumping Man, and Orange Disaster. One of these paintings, the diptych Silver Car Crash, became the highest priced work of his when it sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction on Wednesday, November 13, 2013, for $105.4 million.|$|R

50|$|Parish's most {{well-known}} character, Amelia Bedelia, is extremely literal minded and interprets idioms and other verbal expressions literally, which amusingly causes great havoc in each story. This idea originated in conversations between Parish and Greenwillow Books founder Susan Hirschman about the author's observations of her third grade students. Amelia {{works as a}} household cook and occasional servant, jobs that Parish did in her home when she was young. She uses no recipes, but, by intuitively combining {{a little bit of}} this and a little bit of that, her cakes and cookies and meals are always delicious. She is such a good cook that her employers cannot fire her, despite the disastrous way she misinterprets their instructions: prune the shrubs, scale and ice the fish, file the letters, run over the tablecloth with an iron, shorten these dresses, serve coffee with porridge, heat <b>a</b> <b>can</b> of <b>soup,</b> and so on. The author's word-play, and Amelia Bedelia's fundamental goodness and childlike simplicity appeal to youngsters who are beginning to see and enjoy more than one meaning in a word or a phrase.|$|R
