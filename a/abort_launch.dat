Crew safety was of utmost importance with the HL-20 design emphasizing crew protection during <b>aborted</b> <b>launches</b> and vehicle recovery.

40|$|The Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle is America s next {{generation}} of human rated spacecraft. The Orion <b>Launch</b> <b>Abort</b> System will take the astronauts away from the exploration vehicle {{in the event of}} an <b>aborted</b> <b>launch.</b> The pad <b>abort</b> mode of the <b>Launch</b> <b>Abort</b> System will be flight-tested in 2009 from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. This paper examines some of the efforts currently underway at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center by the Controls & Dynamics group in preparation for the flight test. The concept of operation for the pad abort flight is presented along with an overview of the guidance, control and navigation systems. Preparations for the flight test, such as hardware testing and development of the real-time displays, are examined. The results from the validation and verification efforts for the aerodynamic and atmospheric models are shown along with Monte Carlo analysis results...|$|R

50|$|About 40 {{minutes after}} the <b>aborted</b> <b>launch,</b> the booster and {{spacecraft}} were safed and the service tower raised up to it. After removing the propellants from the Titan II, the booster was checked out and they quickly uncovered the main culprit, which was an electrical plug that {{dropped out of the}} base of the booster prematurely. Testing revealed that some plugs came out more easily than others, so they were replaced by different ones that would stay in place properly.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the flight test objectives and performance of the Orion <b>Launch</b> <b>Abort</b> System during Exploration Flight Test- 1. Exploration Flight Test- 1, the first flight test of the Orion spacecraft, was managed and led by the Orion prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, and launched atop a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. This flight test was a two-orbit, high-apogee, high-energy entry, low-inclination test mission used to validate and test systems critical to crew safety. This test included the first flight test of the <b>Launch</b> <b>Abort</b> System performing Orion nominal flight mission critical objectives. Although the Orion Program has tested a number of the critical systems of the Orion spacecraft on the ground, the launch environment cannot be replicated completely on Earth. Data from this flight will be used to verify the function of the jettison motor to separate the <b>Launch</b> <b>Abort</b> System from the crew module so it can continue on with the mission. Selected <b>Launch</b> <b>Abort</b> System flight test data is presented and discussed in the paper. Through flight test data, <b>Launch</b> <b>Abort</b> System performance trends have been derived that will prove valuable to future flights as well as the manned space program...|$|R

50|$|At ignition, {{one of the}} strap-on {{boosters}} {{failed to}} start and so an automatic command shut down the core stage and remaining strap-ons. Launch personnel began safeing the booster in preparation to take it down from the pad for examination. About 30 minutes after the <b>aborted</b> <b>launch,</b> the launch escape system suddenly activated. The Soyuz descent module was blasted free of the stack and touched down a quarter mile from the pad. Meanwhile, the exhaust from the LES caught the third stage of the booster on fire. Flames began curling {{down the side of}} the booster as launch personnel ran for cover. After a few minutes, the core stage and strap-ons exploded, completely destroying the entire launch vehicle and causing major damage to LC-31. Three people on the ground were killed and the pad was not used again for seven months following the disaster.|$|R

Various other potential landing sites were mooted, including Guiana Space Centre, Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport {{on the island of}} Fort de France, and unspecified airstrips in Bermuda; {{in the event of an}} <b>aborted</b> <b>launch</b> within the first 84 second of ignition, Hermes would be able to return to Kourou, a later-timed abortion was to have likely necessitated a water landing in the Atlantic Ocean, after which the vehicle would need to be retrieved via a recovery ship.

50|$|The fourth Atlas test {{involved}} Missile 10A, {{which was}} erected on LC-12 in September {{and would have}} been the third Atlas launched, but there were considerable difficulties getting it ready for flight. Two PFRF tests resulted in damage to the booster engine thrust chambers, necessitating their replacement, after which 10A was taken down from the pad for a complete overhaul following the findings from 6A's flight. After a pair of <b>aborted</b> <b>launch</b> attempts on December 16 and January 7, the missile finally launched on January 10, 1958 and flew successfully, with no significant abnormalities occurring in the flight. This was also the first Atlas with functioning vernier engines, although they were not attached to the autopilot loop.|$|R

40|$|The Constellation {{program is}} an {{organization}} within NASA whose mission is to create {{the new generation of}} spacecraft that will replace the Space Shuttle after its planned retirement in 2010. In the event of a catastrophic failure on the launch pad or launch vehicle during ascent, the successful use of the <b>launch</b> <b>abort</b> system will allow crew members to escape harm. The Flight Test Office is the organization within the Constellation project that will flight-test the <b>launch</b> <b>abort</b> system on the Orion crew exploration vehicle. The Flight Test Office has proposed six tests that will demonstrate the use of the <b>launch</b> <b>abort</b> system. These flight tests will be performed at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and are similar in nature to the Apollo Little Joe II tests performed in the 1960 s. An overview of the <b>launch</b> <b>abort</b> system flight tests for the Orion crew exploration vehicle is given. Details on the configuration of the first pad abort flight test are discussed. Sample flight trajectories for two of the six flight tests are shown...|$|R
2500|$|To {{protect the}} crew during an <b>aborted</b> <b>launch,</b> the HL-20 PLS {{incorporates}} several safety features. Its interior layout with a ladder and hatch arrangement {{was designed to}} permit rapid egress of passengers and crew for emergencies on the launch pad. For emergencies during which the crew must leave at once (launch vehicle fire or explosion), the HL-20, in a manner much similar to Apollo program rockets, would be equipped with emergency escape rockets to push the PLS away from the booster. Once at a safe distance, three emergency parachutes would open to slow the vehicle's descent into the ocean. [...] Upon splashdown, inflatable flotation devices would ensure {{that at least one}} of the PLS's two hatches is above the water and available for emergency crew egress.|$|R
