25|$|With the {{introduction}} of <b>AutoPlay</b> in Windows XP, the final stage action (stage 7 above) for some drive types changed from executing an application to invoking <b>AutoPlay.</b> From Windows Vista, the <b>AutoPlay</b> system is integrated into every aspect of media handling {{and there is no}} automatic execution of the AutoRun task.|$|E
25|$|Any {{user can}} {{configure}} <b>AutoPlay</b> to make various decisions for them; by checking the appropriate {{box in the}} <b>AutoPlay</b> dialog, running flash drive malware becomes silent and automatic.|$|E
25|$|Detection of Blu-ray Disc, HD DVD, Super Video CD and Video CD {{were added}} to <b>AutoPlay.</b> <b>AutoPlay</b> in Windows Vista and later is a global Control Panel setting instead of a per-device setting.|$|E
50|$|Limits <b>AutoPlay's</b> {{content search}} to only those folders listed, and their subfolders. The folder names are always taken as {{absolute}} paths (a {{path from the}} root directory of the media) {{whether or not a}} leading slash is used.|$|R
50|$|<b>AutoPlay's</b> {{content search}} system will not scan the folders listed, nor their subfolders. IgnoreContentPaths takes {{precedence}} over ExclusiveContentPaths so if a path given in a &#91;IgnoreContentPaths&#93; section is a subfolder of a path given in an &#91;ExclusiveContentPaths&#93; section it is still ignored.|$|R
5000|$|Safari {{has a new}} [...] "Intelligent Tracking Prevention" [...] feature {{which uses}} machine {{learning}} to block third parties from tracking the user's actions. Safari can also block <b>autoplaying</b> videos from playing. The [...] "Reader Mode" [...] {{can be made to}} be always turned on.|$|R
25|$|The terms AutoRun and <b>AutoPlay</b> {{tend to be}} interchangeably {{used when}} {{referring}} to the initiating action, the action that detects and starts reading from discovered volumes. The flowchart illustration in the <b>AutoPlay</b> article shows how AutoRun is positioned as a layer between <b>AutoPlay</b> and the Shell Hardware Detection service and may help in understanding the terminology. However, to avoid confusion, this article uses the term AutoRun when referring to the initiating action.|$|E
25|$|<b>AutoPlay</b> {{is based}} on a set of handler {{applications}} registered with the <b>AutoPlay</b> system. Each media type (Pictures, Music, Video) can have a set of registered handlers which can deal with playing or display that type of media.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{sequence}} is handled {{much the same}} in every version of Windows from Windows 95. However, the way the autorun.inf file is read and acted upon {{and the level of}} integration of AutoRun with <b>AutoPlay</b> has changed significantly from the time <b>AutoPlay</b> was introduced in Windows XP until the present handling in Windows 7. In Windows 10, Microsoft has added the option to enable autorun in its settings. Not only users can turn it on but also they can choose specific external devices for <b>autoplay.</b>|$|E
5000|$|NPR One is an app from NPR (formerly National Public Radio, first {{launched}} in July 2014 for iOS and Android smartphones and other mobile devices, which aimed {{to make it}} easier for listeners to stream local NPR stations live, and listen to NPR podcasts by <b>autoplaying</b> content and permitting easy navigation.|$|R
50|$|Jun Group is an {{advertising}} company founded in December 2005 by Mitchell Reichgut. The company focuses on avoiding ad gimmicks {{that tend to}} annoy consumers, such as pop-unders and <b>autoplaying</b> video ads. A large part of their business is serving video ads to online games, rewarding players who watch with in-game currency.|$|R
50|$|In May 2015, Google {{introduced}} new sets of APIs to Google Cast. The Cast Remote Display APIs allow {{developers to}} create second-screen experiences for apps such as games without needing to mirror displays. The Game Manager APIs offer developers more options for creating multiplayer games. Lastly, additional APIs were provided to control <b>autoplaying</b> and queuing of content.|$|R
25|$|After AutoRun completes, <b>AutoPlay</b> initiates {{by doing}} an {{examination}} of the volume for content. This is called content sniffing. <b>AutoPlay</b> decides whether the volume is an Audio CD, movie DVD, a blank recordable medium (a CD-R, CD-RW, DVD+R etc.) or a generic volume which contains files.|$|E
25|$|Note that {{examination}} of the AutoPlayHandlers section of the Windows Registry reveals the ContentTypeSniffers and ContentTypeHandlers keys. Off these keys, various subkeys and values would appear to relate to and even control volume-based <b>AutoPlay.</b> However, as of Windows XP SP2, these keys are defined solely for future use and are not accessed by <b>AutoPlay.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{this policy}} is enabled, <b>AutoPlay</b> will be {{disabled}} for non-volume devices.|$|E
25|$|In July 2014, NPR {{launched}} NPR One, an app for iOS and Android smartphones {{and other}} mobile devices, which aimed {{to make it}} easier for listeners to stream local NPR stations live, and listen to NPR podcasts by <b>autoplaying</b> content and permitting easy navigation. Since launch NPR has made the service available on additional channels: Windows mobile devices, web browsers, Chromecast, Apple Car Play, Apple Watch, Android Auto, Android Wear, Samsung Gear S2 and S3, Amazon Fire TV, and Amazon Alexa-enabled devices.|$|R
2500|$|The first trailer for {{the series}} debuted {{exclusively}} on Netflix, <b>autoplaying</b> after the final episode of the second season of Daredevil. In July 2016, Colter, Woodard, Ali, Rossi, Missick, Whaley, and Coker appeared at San Diego Comic-Con to promote the series and debut footage. At the end of August, Netflix released {{the first part of}} the [...] "Street Level Hero" [...] digital social video series. The series looked to [...] "blend fiction with history by taking audiences behind the curtain on the themes that give the show its street-level authenticity and cultural relevance." [...] The first part was centered on the music of the series, with commentary from Coker, Colter, composers Younge and Muhammad, A$AP Ferg and Method Man. At the end of September, the second part of the [...] "Street Level Hero" [...] series was released, focusing on Harlem, with commentary from Coker, Colter, A$AP Ferg, Method Man, and Harlem style icon Dapper Dan. On September 28, 2016, a premiere {{for the series}} was held at the AMC Magic Johnson in Harlem.|$|R
30|$|Massively {{multiplayer}} online {{role playing}} games (MMORPGs) have become extremely popular among network gamers. Despite their success, one of MMORPG's greatest challenges {{is the increasing}} use of game bots, that is, <b>autoplaying</b> game clients. The use of game bots is considered unsportsmanlike and is therefore forbidden. To keep games in order, game police, played by actual human players, often patrol game zones and question suspicious players. This practice, however, is labor-intensive and ineffective. To address this problem, we analyze the traffic generated by human players versus game bots and propose general solutions to identify game bots. Taking Ragnarok Online as our subject, we study the traffic generated by human players and game bots. We find that their traffic is distinguishable by 1) the regularity in the release time of client commands, 2) the trend and magnitude of traffic burstiness in multiple time scales, and 3) the sensitivity to different network conditions. Based on these findings, we propose four strategies and two ensemble schemes to identify bots. Finally, we discuss the robustness of the proposed methods against countermeasures of bot developers, and consider a number of possible ways to manage the increasingly serious bot problem.|$|R
25|$|AutoRun and the {{companion}} feature <b>AutoPlay</b> are {{components of the}} Microsoft Windows operating system that dictate what actions the system takes when a drive is mounted.|$|E
25|$|Each {{hardware}} device {{can have a}} default action occurring on discovery of a particular media type, or the <b>AutoPlay</b> dialog can prompt the user what action to take.|$|E
25|$|If no DeviceHandlers {{entry is}} found under the device instance, <b>AutoPlay</b> checks for the {{existence}} of a DeviceGroup entry, again under the device instance. This allows a whole set of devices to share device parameters.|$|E

25|$|When AutoRun is disabled, Windows {{should not}} proceed further through the {{activation}} sequence than the Registry check. However, it parses any autorun.inf found and does {{everything except the}} final action to invoke <b>AutoPlay</b> or execute an application.|$|E
25|$|The EventHandler is {{the title}} of a table that makes an {{association}} between various Handlers and the triggering Event. In the case of volume-based events, the EventHandlers are generated completely internally to <b>AutoPlay</b> with no reference to the Registry.|$|E
25|$|The AutoRun layer {{initially}} consults Windows Registry {{values to}} decides whether to initiate actions for any particular drive or drive type. If AutoRun {{has been disabled}} for the newly discovered volume, then the process halts at that point, effectively disabling <b>AutoPlay</b> for that volume.|$|E
25|$|Windows 95 and Windows 98 {{do have a}} {{primitive}} version of <b>AutoPlay.</b> Its sole job is to deal with Audio CDs and Movie DVDs and start an application to deal with them. If the new arrival does not {{fall into one of}} these categories Windows proceeds with the usual AutoRun process.|$|E
25|$|<b>AutoPlay</b> is {{a feature}} {{introduced}} in Windows XP which examines removable media and devices and, based on content such as pictures, music or video files, launches an appropriate application to play or display the content. If available, settings in an autorun.inf file {{can add to}} the options presented to the user.|$|E
25|$|With a {{standard}} flash drive, social engineering attacks {{can be employed}} to entice a user to click on the appropriate item in the <b>AutoPlay</b> dialog. An alluring action string promising free games or pornography would lure many users into the trap. At any time, double clicking on the drive icon will use the autorun.inf automatically, a trap more advanced users could fall into.|$|E
25|$|Content is {{considered}} to be Unknown if the content sniffing process finds no categorisable content. This does not mean that there are no files present, just no files falling into {{one or more of the}} above three content types. In this case <b>AutoPlay</b> opens an Explorer window on the root directory of the medium and the process flow finishes here.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Windows Vista, when media {{containing}} an autorun.inf specifying an AutoRun {{task was}} inserted, the default action was to automatically execute the program without user intervention. From Windows Vista the default behaviour is to invoke <b>AutoPlay</b> {{and represent the}} AutoRun task {{as one of the}} dialog options. This is also the behaviour when this policy is Not configured or Disabled.|$|E
25|$|When a non-volume {{device is}} being analysed, <b>AutoPlay</b> looks {{in several places}} in the Registry for a DeviceHandlers entry. This is simply a string which, when {{combined}} with other information, selects an EventHandler (which tables the Handlers). The DeviceHandlers entries are commonly placed into the Registry by the manufacturer of the device. There are also broader categories of devices which have preassigned DeviceHandlers, Video Camera devices for example.|$|E
25|$|This Registry entry {{disables}} or {{enables the}} AutoRun feature on all drives {{of the type}} specified. It reflects {{the setting of the}} relevant <b>Autoplay</b> Group Policy. Valid data ranges from 0x00 to 0xFF in hexadecimal notation. If the entry is not present, the default data value is either 0x95 or 0x91 depending on the version of Windows used. An entry present in HKLM overrides any entry present in HKCU.|$|E
25|$|As Windows cannot perform content {{sniffing}} on non-volume devices, <b>AutoPlay</b> analyses {{these devices}} by their characteristics {{rather than by}} their content. Every newly discovered device has identification information, normally stored within the device itself. This information is gather by enumerators and is used to build identification strings which Windows refers to when accessing and referring to the device. An identification string for a particular device is called a Device ID.|$|E
25|$|As Windows cannot {{examine the}} files on {{the device to}} {{determine}} content type, it is left to the manufacturer {{to decide how to}} proceed. A manufacturer can register Handlers against their particular device, can add their device to a group of devices (e.g.: ZipDrives) or allow a device class (e.g.: all devices which are Video Cameras) to handle their device for them. This determines which Handlers will be listed in the <b>AutoPlay</b> dialog when their device is discovered.|$|E
25|$|When a user inserts a CD-ROM into a {{drive or}} {{attaches}} a USB camera, Windows detects the arrival and starts {{a process of}} examining the device or searching the medium. It is looking for properties of the device or content on the medium so that <b>AutoPlay</b> can present a set of meaningful options to the user. When the user makes a particular choice, they also {{have the option to}} make that selection automatic the next time Windows sees that content or device.|$|E
25|$|When a {{compatible}} {{device is}} plugged in, the Windows <b>AutoPlay</b> dialog offers an additional option {{to use the}} flash drive {{to speed up the}} system; an additional ReadyBoost tab is added to the drive's properties dialog where the amount of space to be used can be configured. The minimum cache size is 250MB. In Vista or with FAT32 formatting of the drive, the maximum is 4GB. In Windows 7 with NTFS or exFAT formatting, the maximum cache size is 32GB per device. Windows Vista allows only one device to be used, while Windows 7 allows multiple caches, one per device, up to a total of 256GB.|$|E
