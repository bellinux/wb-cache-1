50|$|Fancier {{versions}} use clips, teeth or clamps to {{hold the}} paper in place. Commercial versions can be constructed of various materials. They are usually sized to hold a quarter or half sheet of sandpaper. Some versions use the sandpaper belts intended for a power belt sander. Construction workers often use commercial one-piece sanding blocks consisting of a foam plastic block with an <b>abrasive</b> <b>coating.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ringsaw blades are {{abrasive}} {{rather than}} toothed. The brittleness of this <b>abrasive</b> <b>coating,</b> {{and the need}} to avoid flexure, is why they are made as rings rather than oval bands. As the ring is a circle of constant radius, the blade is not flexed or bent in operation. The blades themselves are not usually rigid and may be bent slightly in fitting, but are not designed to be flexed as they rotate.|$|E
5000|$|Abrasive wear is {{distributed}} more evenly across the flaps, {{and through the}} length of each flap. Flaps wear from their outer ends and the sheet carrier cuts back as the <b>abrasive</b> <b>coating</b> is worn away. The wheel remains useful even as the flaps erode. Compared to flat sheets, that are discarded after only a small area of the abrasive is truly worn-out, {{this is a much}} more efficient use of the abrasive material.|$|E

50|$|A <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> {{comprises}} an abrasive {{fixed to}} a backing material such as paper, cloth, rubber, resin, polyester or even metal, {{many of which}} are flexible. Sandpaper is a very common <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive.</b> <b>Coated</b> <b>abrasives</b> are commonly the same minerals as are used for bonded abrasives. A bonding agent (often some sort of adhesive or resin) is applied to the backing to provide a flat surface to which the grit is then subsequently adhered. A woven backing may also use a filler agent (again, often a resin) to provide additional resilience.|$|R
50|$|With {{developments}} in <b>abrasive</b> <b>coating,</b> the sheet material could withstand greater forces and speeds. This allowed {{the production of}} flapwheels for use with high speed angle grinders. These disks were different in format: flatter, like the original rigid angle grinder disks, and with the flaps arranged in a densely overlapped layout rather than radial. The extra lifetime this gave to the disk allowed their use for stock removal and metal shaping, not just finishing and polishing.|$|E
5000|$|Once the {{interior}} scaffolding was installed, a thorough evaluative survey of {{the interior}} coatings was executed. The acknowledged presumption of most involved in the restoration was that all coatings would {{be removed from the}} interior metals, that repairs would be made, that metals would be recoated, and the interior would be adequately weatherproofed. The preexisting interior coatings on both the secondary wrought iron framework and the wrought iron central pylon would be removed along with the multiple layers of coal tar and paint that had been applied to the internal copper sheathing. A New York Times article from February 8, 1984, mentioned that the interior copper which was at that time painted [...] "government green" [...] would be cleaned to resemble the salmon color of a new penny. That outermost [...] "government green" [...] layer was a vinyl paint applied in 1975. Because certain sections that had corroded were hidden beneath the layers of coatings, no attempt was made to salvage any of the seven layers of paint, (consisting of a base coat of red lead primer plus six additional coats) and the two layers of bituminous paint (a coal tar coating) that had been used as a water sealant in the statues interior around 1911. The three available coating removal methods tested, developed (or not) and implemented (or not) were: thermal coating removal, <b>abrasive</b> <b>coating</b> removal and chemical coating removal. The methods contemplated for the removal of the coatings on the interior copper differed from that of the other interior metals. For the preparation of the wrought iron parts of the statue, an abrasive removal method also known as dry sandblasting was implemented in order to prevent against flash rusting, The low dusting abrasive material used in the dry sandblasting technique was aluminum oxide.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} use CBN {{grinding}} wheels technologically and economically successful, their correct use preparation is of decisive importance. Systematic investigations when truing ceramic bonded CBN grinding wheels with a diamond form roller should show {{the influence of}} the process setting parameters and the contour inclination of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>coating</b> on the grinding result. Analogous considerations made it possible to carry out the tests using a single grinding wheel with a straight profile. In doing so, a loading of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>coating</b> was produced in axial direction by special grinding kinematics. The influence of the inclination angle on the coherence of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>coating</b> becomes clear particulary for the wear behaviour. A reason for this is the loading of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>coating</b> by an axial force component. What is more, {{the influence of the}} speed ratio on the performance of CBN grinding wheels was examined with a high-speed device for diamond form rollers...|$|E

50|$|In India, Pakistan, Brazil and Chile, {{there have}} been {{reported}} accidents involving the <b>abrasive</b> <b>coated</b> cutting line. These accidents range in severity from small cuts on the fighter's fingers to a few reported deaths from contact with the line while riding motorcycles. In recent years, the fighting lines have evolved from the traditional cotton, rice and glass line to nylon or synthetic line coated with metallic or chemical abrasive compounds. To prevent further injury, many countries have implemented restrictions or bans {{on the use of}} cutting line. Some have set limits on the materials used to make the line, others have mandated safety devices on motorcycles when riding during kite festivals. People have been injured while fixated on capturing a cut kite. Other injuries have been due to not paying attention to one's actions while watching battles. Most of these accidents are preventable when fighting is strictly controlled to a specific arena and proper safety gear is worn by the fighters. Other accidents have occurred due to the masses of people present during large kite festivals for which kite fighting has taken the blame.|$|R
