5|$|Carrington and Johnson {{speculated that}} Leigh was {{assaulted}} {{by the group}} of boys after returning from the beach, as punishment for complaining about being raped, and was murdered by Webster and two others because they were <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> would tell other people. They refused to specifically name the two other suspects for fear of legal repercussions, though clarified that one had sexually assaulted Leigh earlier in the night, and the other likely sexually assaulted her with a beer bottle before she died, as punishment for publicly refusing {{to have sex with}} him. Webster talked to the media about the murder {{for the first time in}} 1997, and insisted that he acted alone in killing Leigh.|$|E
25|$|When the lizards {{approach}} them, Nancy is fascinated but {{a little}} <b>afraid.</b> <b>She</b> remains close to Charlie. Though she does not agree with him, she does find him a small stick {{to use as a}} defense. It is Nancy who comes {{up with the idea of}} lying down in a submissive posture when Leslie and Sarah come near. Charlie follows Nancy's directions in most of the dealings with the lizards. After it becomes clear that the lizards will not harm them, Nancy is excited by their presence. She does everything she can to learn about them and make a connection with them. She wants to shake hands with them first.|$|E
25|$|Shepherd {{was convicted}} of the crime on October 9, 2008, after jurors deliberated for four hours. He was given the maximum {{sentence}} of 99 {{years in prison and}} a $10,000 fine. During the punishment phase of the trial, Shepherd revealed how he murdered Stewart. He pressured her to reveal her new relationship at college, but she refused to answer and grabbed a knife from a table and approached him with it in her hand. She swung at him with the knife and nicked his fingers. <b>Afraid</b> <b>she</b> was going to stab him again, he grabbed her around the neck with one arm and tried to reach the knife with his other hand. He ended up choking her to death out of anger. He later went to the hardware store to purchase a jigsaw. He undressed the body and dismembered it in his bathtub using the jigsaw and other tools. He barbecued the remains on his grills in his patio.|$|E

500|$|In {{the later}} Tandy period (1946– 1949) and {{continuing}} throughout the 1950s, Nancy is depicted less {{frequently in the}} center of the action. The Ghost of Blackwood Hall shows an assertive Nancy leading more timid friends up the front steps of the haunted house, and marks a transition to later illustrations. From 1949 forward, she is likely to be observing others, often hiding or concealing herself. Her mouth is often open in surprise, and she hides her body from view. However, although Nancy [...] "expresses surprise, she is not <b>afraid.</b> <b>She</b> appears to be a bit taken aback by what she sees, but she looks as if she is still in control of the situation." [...] Many of these covers feature Nancy poised in the observation of a clue, spying on criminal activity, or displaying her discoveries to others involved in the mystery. Only occasionally is she shown in action, such as running from the scene of a fire, riding a horse, or actively sleuthing with a flashlight. At times she is only involved in action as her hiding place has been discovered by others. In most cases, more active scenes are used for the frontispiece, or in books after 1954, illustrations throughout the text drawn by uncredited illustrators.|$|E
500|$|The planet Venom's {{forces were}} all but destroyed, and there {{is thought to be}} peace. This is not to be, however, as a race of beings known as the Anglar rise from the acidic oceans of Venom, thought to be unable to support life. The leader of the Anglar plans on {{destroying}} the Lylat system, which Fox McCloud and crew set out to save. The Star Fox team has broken up, but re-assembles to fight the threat. Peppy is made the General of the Cornerian Army, replacing Pepper. Fox flew around the Lylat system with ROB on patrol, and Krystal broke off her relationship with Fox after she left the team, because he was <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> would receive injury and it would affect him. Slippy finds love with a frog named Amanda, and spends less time with the team. Falco left the team and went around on solo missions (as he has done before in Star Fox Adventures), spending less time with a team also. Peppy's daughter Lucy joins the team for some missions. There are nine endings depending on paths chosen by the player, though the player is required to finish the game before having the options. Designers have hinted that a possible Star Fox game in the future may begin in the middle of Star Fox Command, revealing a true ending[...]|$|E

Sending for her, he proclaims his basic credo of revenge: S'avvicina il tuo momento / [...] "Your moment approaches, dread thirst for vengeance".

At the novel's end, she returns to the Elias-Clark building to discuss a position {{at one of the}} company's other magazines and sees Miranda's new junior assistant, who looks as harried and put-upon as she once did.|$|E

Enraged, Tonio grabs Nedda, but she takes a whip, strikes him and drives him off. Silvio, who is Nedda's lover, comes from the tavern, where he has left Canio and Beppe drinking.

Tonio, who has been eavesdropping, leaves to inform Canio {{so that he might}} catch Silvio and Nedda together. Canio and Tonio return and, as Silvio escapes, Nedda calls after him, [...] "I will always be yours!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{appeared}} in the film Ziegfeld Follies as herself. This {{was followed by the}} musical Thrill of a Romance. Van Johnson co-starred as a decorated war veteran who falls in love with Williams while on her honeymoon. Thrill of a Romance was the 8th highest-grossing film of 1945. Williams had to help Johnson swim, and she placed her hand under his back to keep him afloat. The studio's publicity department tried to put the two together in public as much as possible in the hopes of encouraging a romance, even though Williams was involved with Gage at the time. When asked why they didn't date, Johnson replied, [...] "because I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> can't get her webbed feet into a pair of evening sandals." ...|$|E

[...] Rachel Plummer, who was pregnant, was <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> would not be able to keep up while carrying her two-year-old son, and so she stayed in the fort. [...] She began running after seeing the Indians come into the fort, holding her little boy's hand, while behind her she said she saw Indians stabbing Benjamin with their lances, and then she heard “Uncle Silas shout defiance as though he had a thousand men with him. Alas, he was alone, and soon dead.” [...] Lucy Parker, who also had a small child, stopped to argue with her husband Silas, begging him to come with her. [...] Elizabeth Duty Kellogg stopped to gather up their savings, $100 in coins, before she attempted to escape.|$|E
2500|$|Dolly was the {{youngest}} daughter to be born; doctors was <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> wouldn't make it after birth as she only weighed 780grams at birth. She lived a full life and died at the ripe age of 96 years. The oldest son, Louis was very full of himself and had this attitude after studying in England, referring to himself as [...] "Young Lord Louis" [...] , even signing his letters with the initials [...] "YLL". Sammy once entered a party where the coat boy took his hat and jacket and tipped the young man a generous 1 pound. After taking the tip, the boy turned to Sammy {{and asked if he}} could tip him more as his son Louis tipped him five pounds when he came in earlier. Sammy looked at the young man and replied with a well thought comeback: [...] "Remember that my son has a very rich father, I on the other hand, do not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nasya Nenova {{attempted}} suicide. She {{testified that}} she confessed and attempted suicide {{because she was}} <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> would be tortured again. She was interrogated alongside Ashraf and told the court they were beaten {{and that there was}} no interpreter. She did not confess to having illegal sexual relations with him. She, along with Vulcheva, are the only nurses who admitted knowing Ashraf by sight beforehand, but she said she had never spoken with him. She denied having attempted suicide out of guilt for what she had done. In court she stated that [...] "I am not guilty on any of the counts. My conscience is clear." [...] and [...] "We had protection from no-one, we had no doctor. We were alone there with those men who did everything they wanted to do". She said she attempted to retract her confession on 17 July 1999, but that a Colonel Juma came and threatened to renew the torture if she persisted.|$|E

2500|$|It is later, as Lexa {{is running}} into Clarke's room, that Lexa is accidentally shot by Titus, who {{intended}} to kill Clarke. Clarke catches Lexa as she falls {{and they take}} her to the bed. Lexa realizes she is going to die and tells Clarke not to be <b>afraid.</b> <b>She</b> tells Titus to never harm Clarke again, and he swears he will not. She tells him serve the next commander as he served her. Clarke continues to try and save Lexa, but she tells Clarke that her spirit will find a new commander. She says her fight is over and that Clarke was right that life should be about more than just surviving. Clarke recites the Traveler's Blessing, an Arkadian prayer. As Lexa dies, Clarke kisses her one last time. Titus extracts a tech from Lexa's neck, where her tattoo is. The tech is called [...] "the flame," [...] and it is revealed to be Lexa's spirit. She was augmented to carry an AI (the flame). The flame is how every new commander is chosen, with each new commander becoming a part of the flame. It is only compatible with Nightbloods. Aden is meant to succeed Lexa, but, in [...] "Stealing Fire," [...] he is murdered by Ontari, a rogue Nightblood who seeks the throne for herself.|$|E
2500|$|Press {{reported}} on November 6, 2006, {{the arrest of}} a construction worker Diego Pillco, a 19-year-old Ecuadorian illegal immigrant who according to police had confessed on tape to attacking Shelly, and then staging the fake suicide by hanging her. Pillco's original version of {{what happened was that}} when Shelly asked if the noise could be kept down, he threw a hammer at her and, <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> would make a complaint that might result in his deportation, followed her back to her apartment, where the petite 40-year-old hit him, and was killed by a fall during a struggle. Subsequently, Pillco gave a completely different [...] account in which he said while on a break he had noticed Shelly returning to her apartment and followed her. After assaulting her and rendering [...] her unconscious, he killed her by staging the fake suicide. The second version was consistent with the lack of dust on Shelly's shoes (which she was not wearing when found) and seemed to be a confession to murder, but prosecutors reportedly thought if charged with murder Pillco might return to his original account and a jury trial could find him guilty of a lesser charge. The medical examiner determined that Shelly was still alive when hanged. Pillco pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter and was sentenced to 25 years in prison without parole.|$|E
