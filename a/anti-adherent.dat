Objective: Formulation development of MCG of DM and optimization of the formulation by screening of different excipients. Material and methods: MCG containing DM was prepared by screening different concentrations of sweeteners, flavouring agents, softening agents, lubricants and <b>anti-adherents</b> by changing one variable at a time. Performance evaluation {{was carried out by}} evaluating size, shape, thickness, taste, scanning electron microscopy, texture analysis, in vivo drug release study, ex vivo buccal permeation study and by studying statistical analysis for quality. Results and discussion: The statistical analysis showed significant improvement in organoleptic properties such as chewable mass, product taste, product consistency, product softness, total flavour lasting time and pharmaceutical properties like micromeritic properties after incorporation of appropriate excipients in an optimum amount in final optimized MCG formulation. In vivo drug release study showed 97 % DM release whereas ex vivo buccal permeation study through goat buccal mucosa exhibited 11. 27 % DM permeation within 15 min indicating its potential for increasing bioavailability by decreasing time of onset. The optimized formulation showed good surface properties and the peak load required for drug release was found to be acceptable for crumbling action. Conclusion: The developed formulation of medicated chewing gum can be a better alternative to mouth dissolving and conventional tablet formulation. It may be proved as a promising approach to improve the bioavailability as well as to improve patient compliance...|$|R
40|$|Materiais superhidrofóbicos vêm sendo cada vez mais utilizados devido às inúmeras propriedades que acarretam na superfície, como de serem auto-limpantes, anti-corrosivos, anti-aderentes, dentre outras. Muitos pesquisadores vêm tentando modificar as superfícies poliméricas para obter tal estado de molhabilidade devido ao seu grande uso em diversas indústrias. O polipropileno (PP) e o polietileno (PE) são polímeros {{commodities}} com um elevado nível de produção onde muitas aplicações podem ser beneficiadas através do uso de superfícies superhidrofóbicas. Alguns produtos específicos podem se tornar disponíveis comercialmente após modificações superficiais. O objetivo deste trabalho foi modificar a superfície do PP e do PE através da aplicação de um recobrimento com nanopartículas (NPs) de dióxido de titânio (TiO 2) funcionalizadas com compostos de organosilano para a obtenção de polímeros superhidrofóbicos. A metodologia se baseia através do método de imersão em uma única etapa, onde variações nos parâmetros experimentais, como o solvente da suspensão, o tempo de imersão, a concentração de NPs de TiO 2 e a temperatura de imersão, permitiram o controle das propriedades superhidrofóbicas da superfície as quais foram analisadas e caracterizadas através das técnicas de WCA, MEV, FTIR-ATR, XPS, DRX e perfilometria óptica. Após a aplicação do recobrimento, superfícies com WCA≥ 150 º foram facilmente obtidas pela imersão do substrato polimérico por poucos segundos em suspensões aquecidas com xileno. Propriedades superhidrofóbicas estática e dinâmica foram controladas com a dependência da concentração de -OH na superfície, onde concentrações maiores que 25 % levam à superfícies superhidrofóbicas estáticas perdendo suas propriedades de auto-limpeza. Objetivando aumentar a adesão entre o substrato de PP e o recobrimento aplicado, tratamento com radiação ultravioleta (UV) foi utilizado para conferir ligações covalentes entre o nanorecobrimento aplicado e o substrato polimérico que até então eram inexistentes. Foi observado um aumento de mais de 80 % na adesão para a superfície tratada por 1 h com radiação UV quando comparada com a superfície sem tratamento. Entretanto, após o tratamento com UV as superfícies perdiam suas características superhidrofóbicas. Ao se alternar ciclos de irradiação com UV e tratamento térmico, superfícies inteligentes de PP com nanorecobrimento são produzidas e a reversibilidade entre superhidrofilicidade e superhidrofobicidade pode ser facilmente controlada. Após três ciclos de tratamento, as superfícies atingiram os extremos de WCA, variando de 0 º à 155 º com tratamento fotoquímico e térmico, respectivamente. A metodologia desenvolvida para o preparo de superfícies superhidrofóbicas de PP e PE é simples e de baixo custo para expandir o processo. Superhydrophobic {{materials are}} being increasingly used {{due to the}} many properties that cause on the surface, such as to be self-cleaning, anti-corrosive, <b>anti-adherents,</b> among others. Many research groups {{have been trying to}} modify polymer surfaces to obtain such state of wettability due to its potential uses in several industries. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) are commodities polymers with a very high production levels where many applications will benefit from non-wetting surfaces. Some specific products may have the potential to become commercially available after such surface modifications. The aim {{of this study was to}} modify the surface of PP and PE by coating with titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized with organosilanes compounds to obtain superhydrophobic polymers. The methodology is based in one-step dipping method, where the changes in the experimental parameters, such as suspension solvent, dipping time, TiO 2 NPs concentration and dipping temperature allows the control of the superhydrophobic properties. The polymers surfaces were analyzed and characterized by WCA, SEM, FTIR-ATR, XPS, XRD and optical profilometry techniques. After the coatings, surfaces with WCA ≥ 150 º were easily obtained by dipping the substrates for a few seconds in hot xylene suspensions. Static and dynamic superhydrophobic properties were controlled depending on the -OH surface concentration, where concentrations higher that 25 % led to static superhydrophobic surfaces losing the self-cleaning properties. Aiming to increase the adhesion between the PP substrate and the applied coating, ultraviolet (UV) treatment was carried out to induce covalent bonds between the nanocoating and the substrate that were previously inexistent. An increase of more than 80 % in the adhesion of the coating was observed for the PP substrates treated for 1 h with UV radiation when compared with untreated surface. However, after UV treatment, the surfaces lose their superhydrophobic characteristics. By switching between UV light illumination and soft thermal treatment, smart PP nanocomposite surfaces were produced, where the reversibility between superhydrophylicity and superhydrophobicity can be easily controled. After three cycles of photochemical-thermal treatments, surfaces reached the extremes of wettability achieving WCA of 0 º and 155 º by UV and thermal treatments respectively. The methodology used to prepare PP and PE superhydrophobic surfaces is simple and represents a potential low cost method for scale up the process...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{technical}} strategies for seismic upgrading of ordinary masonry buildings, often utilized after earthquakes, consist in strengthening walls by means of thin reinforced mortar slabs applied at one or {{both sides of the}} wall and linked to it. This type of technical provision has been currently employed in Italy and widely utilized after the 1976 Friuli earthquake. In spite of this, no experimental investigation has been performed until now to asses structural behaviour of the composite structure masonry wall-reinforced mortar slabs. In this work an experimental investigation has been carried out on masonry wall panels strengthened with different technical and executive strategies commonly used for ordinary masonry of private building. To evaluate shear strength of strengthened masonry walls, four wall test units (panels) with dimensions of 100 x 100 x 25 cm and subjected to in-plane loads have been experimented.

Eleven strains of C. albicans were studied, of which six were susceptible and five were resistant to fluconazole. All 11 strains were susceptible to aminocandin in vitro, regardless of the culture medium used for the microdilution method. Aminocandin induced a significant (p < 0. 005) decrease in adherence when polystyrene was coated with ECM gel (ten strains) or fibronectin (seven strains).

Traditionally, Anadenanthera colubrina, Commiphora leptophloeos and Myracrodruon urundeuva have been used by communities in the Brazilian Caatinga to treat several infectious diseases. The ability to impair bacterial adhesion represents an ideal strategy to combat bacterial pathogenesis, because of its importance {{in the early stages of}} the infectious process; thus, the search for <b>anti-adherent</b> compounds in plants is a very promising alternative. This study investigated the ability of stem-bark extracts from these three species to control the growth and prevent biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important opportunistic pathogen that adheres to surfaces and forms protective biofilms. A kinetic study (0 - 72 h) demonstrated that the growth of extract-treated bacteria was inhibited up to 9 h after incubation, suggesting a bacteriostatic activity.

When measured microscopically or by cultural methods, significant reductions in adherence (56 % and 71 %, respectively) of C. sakazakii were observed in the presence of GOS (16 mg/ml). Adherence inhibition also occurred (48 %) when the GOS-PDX blend (8 mg/ml each) was tested, although PDX by itself had less effect. Subsequently, the ability of several prebiotic agents, including chitooligosaccharides (COS) and mannan oligosaccharides derived from yeast cell walls (MOSy) and konjac root (MOSk), to inhibit adherence of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterohemorragic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and Salmonella typhimurium to a human HEp- 2 cell line was tested. In addition, a high molecular weight component of cranberry (CHMW) was also assessed for anti-adherence. Different fractions of COS significantly reduced adherence of EPEC at a concentration of 16 mg/ml. Although MOSy inhibited EPEC, EHEC, and S. typhumiurim, adherence inhibition was not observed for MOSk. Adherence inhibition of EPEC, EHEC, and S. typhumiurim by CHMW was observed. Finally, the ability of two different types of lactoferrin to inhibit adherence of Cronobacter sakazakii to a HEp- 2 human cell line was assessed. Results showed that the adherence of C. sakazakii was significantly reduced at a minimum concentration of 10 mg/ml. However, at higher concentrations (up to 50 mg/ml), further reductions in adherence were not observed. These results show that different prebiotics, plant extracts, and other molecules may be added to foods as a prophylactic treatment to prevent or mitigate infections by enteric pathogens.

The use of light as a trigger for the release of a therapeutic agent from a polymeric matrix is attractive, as wavelength, intensity, site and duration of application of light can be coupled to release of the therapeutic agent. The pphotolabile ester of 3, 5 -dimethoxybenzoin with a model acidic drug (ibuprofen) attached was synthesised and loaded into the polymer scaffold, which comprised of 2 -(hydroxyethyl) methacrylate crosslinked with ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, once irradiated, the porous hydrogel allowed the diffusion of the model drug from the polymer matrix once liberated, and the retention of the photolytic by-product within the polymer structure. A second 3, 5 -dimethoxybenzoin ester was synthesised with ciprofloxacin attached, achieving controlled release of an antimicrobial in situ, thus preventing bacterial adherence and subsequent biofilm formation. The idea of chromatic orthogonality was explored and the 3, 5 -dimethoxybenzoin and nitrobenzyl derivatives were synthesised and utilised due to their differential reactivities at specific wavelengths, allowing multi-drug release, stimulated using monochromic light of different wavelengths. Light triggered transdermal drug delivery was examined,. novel pHEMA microneedles with the light reactive conjugate incorporated into the matrix were successfully synthesised. Drug release studies demonstrated the ability of the pHEMA microneedles to penetrate the synthetic skin and deliver the model drug ibuprofen.

40|$|The {{urinary bladder}} has certain unique {{anatomical}} features which {{enable it to}} form an effective barrier to toxic substances diffusing from the urine into the blood. The barrier function {{is due to the}} epithelial surface of the urinary bladder, the urothelium, which has characteristic umbrella cells, joined by tight junctions and covered by impenetrable plaques, as well as an <b>anti-adherent</b> mucin layer. Diseases of the urinary bladder, such as bladder carcinomas and interstitial cystitis, cause acute damage to the bladder wall and cannot be effectively treated by systemic administration of drugs. Such conditions may benefit from intravesical drug delivery (IDD), which involves direct instillation of drug into the bladder via a catheter, to attain high local concentrations of the drug with minimal systemic effects. IDD however has its limitations, since the permeability of the urothelial layer is very low and instilled drug solutions become diluted with urine and get washed out of the bladder during voiding, necessitating repeated infusions of the drug. Permeation enhancers serve to overcome these problems to some extent by using electromotive force to enhance diffusion of the drug into the bladder wall or chemical molecules, such as chitosan, dimethylsulphoxide, to temporarily disrupt the tight packing of the urothelium. Nanotechnology can be integrated with IDD to devise drug-encapsulated nanoparticles that can greatly improve chemical interactions with the urothelium and enhance penetration of drugs into the bladder wall. Nanocarriers such as liposomes, gelatin nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles and magnetic particles, have been found to enhance local drug concentrations in the bladder as well as target diseased cells. Intravesical drug carriers can be further improved by using mucoadhesive biomaterials which are strongly adhered to the urothelial cell lining, thus preventing the carrier from being washed away during urine voiding. This increases the residence time of the drug at the target site and enables sustained delivery of the drug over a prolonged time span. Polymeric hydrogels, such as the temperature sensitive PEG-PLGA-PEG polymer, have been used to develop in situ gelling systems to deliver drugs into the bladder cavity. Recent advances and future prospects of biodegradable nanocarriers and in situ gels as drug delivery agents for intravesical drug delivery are reviewed in this paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

In related work {{the effect of}} freeze- drying on the transfection efficiency of a peptide/pDNA complex following freeze-drying- rehydration was also achieved. The effect of disaccharide and <b>anti-adherent</b> concentration on the stability of spray- dried liposomes was investigated. The optimum formulations contained a combination of 10 % sucrose or 15 % trehalose together with 0. 5 % (w/w) leucine. However, a marked increase in size of the rehydrated liposomes was obtained with further addition of 1 % (w/w) leucine. Liposomes prepared by both the ethanol injection and proliposome method retained similar characteristics. Liposome powder containing 15 % trehalose/ 0. 5 % leucine displayed the best aerodynamic characteristics probably because of the higher Tg value for trehalose. Next liposomes were prepared by the alcohol-based proliposome method to investigate the effects of sucrose or trehalose concentration on stability to freeze-drying. Tg' values of these dispersions were {{much lower than the}} Tg' of the pure sugar solutions leading to product collapse, while drug leakage and increased liposome size was seen for those formulated with 10 % trehalose. Inclusion of an ethanol expulsion step increased Tg' and enabled preservation of structural stability and drug encapsulation following freeze-drying- rehydration. A spray-freeze-drying study demonstrated that inclusion of 30 % (w/w) sucrose or trehalose prevented drug leakage but could not prevent size increase. The powders obtained exhibited a more compact structure with particle sizes of around 10 urn instead of the typical porous structure seen for spray freeze-dried powders. Addition of 5 % PVP into liposome suspensions containing 10 % disaccharide demonstrated some Iyoprotective effect in terms of entrapment efficiency was not as protective as the formulation containing 30 % trehalose. An attempt to develop spray-dried polymer-coated liposomes suitable for nasal delivery was made. A combination of 10 % (w/w) trehalose dihydrate and 0. 2 % (w/w) L-Leucine could effectively protect liposomes constituted of soya lecithin, DMPG and cholesterol against spray-drying damage albeit with a slight liposomal size increase. The addition of polymer coatings reduced the protective effect of sugars to a differing extent, while the size of chitosan- and TMC-coated liposomes was substantially greater than those with alginate coating. TMC-coated liposomes retained the highest BSA encapsulation and also still exhibited the ability to penetrate bovine nasal mucosa. The mucoadhesive strength of the powders was TMC-coated ~ chitosan-coated > alginate-coated liposome ~ uncoated liposomes. The peptide:pDNA (RALA-pEGFP-N 1) complexes at various N/P ratios were freeze-dried. The N/P ratio of 1 : 10 exhibited the highest transfection efficiency, that was unexpectedly slightly increased after freeze-drying. Surprisingly, it was found that transfection efficiency of pEGFP-N 1 complexed with RALA tended to gradually decrease with increasing concentration of trehalose and could unexpectedly be slightly improved by freeze-drying. CD spectra demonstrated that the a-helix structure of RALA became predominant upon association with pDNA and was not affected by trehalose. However, as added amount of trehalose at 50 : 1 or over 600 : 1 (w/w) of Iyoprotectant to pDNA, the secondary structure conversion of a-helix to partly random coil of RALA in the peptide/pDNA complexes was observed following freeze-drying although this was not correlated with transfection efficiency.

40|$|Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) {{technology}} {{has a significant}} impact {{in the treatment of}} various respiratory disorders. DPI formulations consist of a micronized drug (< 5 ìm) blended with an inert coarse carrier, for which lactose is widely used to date. DPIs are one of the inhalation devices which are used to target the delivery of drugs to the lungs. Drug delivery via DPI formulations is influenced by the physico-chemical characteristics of lactose particles such as size, shape, surface roughness and adhesional forces. Commercially available DPI formulations, which utilise lactose as the carrier, are not efficient in delivering drug to the lungs. The reasons for this are the surface morphology, adhesional properties and surface roughness of lactose. Despite several attempts to modify lactose, the maximum efficient drug delivery to the lungs remains limited; hence, exploring suitable alternative carriers for DPIs is of paramount importance. Therefore, the objective of the project was to study the performance of spherical polymer microparticles as drug carriers and the factors controlling their performance. This study aimed to use biodegradable polymer microspheres as alternative carriers to lactose in DPIs for achieving efficient drug delivery into the lungs. This project focused on fabricating biodegradable polymer microparticles with reproducible surface morphology and particle shape. The surface characteristics of polymeric carriers and the adhesional forces between the drug and carrier particles were investigated in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of their influence on drug dispersion. For this purpose, two biodegradable polymers- polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) were used as the carriers to deliver the anti-asthmatic drug - Salbutamol Sulphate (SS). The first study conducted for this dissertation was the aerosolization of SS from mixtures of SS and PCL or PLGA microparticles. The microparticles were fabricated using an emulsion technique and were characterized by laser diffraction for particle size analysis, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for surface morphology and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) to obtain surface elemental composition. The dispersion of the drug from the DPI formulations was determined by using a Twin Stage Impinger (TSI). The Fine particle Fraction (FPF) of SS from powder mixtures was analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). It was found that the drug did not detach from the surface of PCL microspheres. To overcome this, the microspheres were coated with <b>anti-adherent</b> agents such as magnesium stearate and leucine to improve the dispersion of the drug from the carrier surfaces. It was found that coating the PCL microspheres helped in significantly improving the FPF of SS from the PCL surface. These results were in contrast to the PLGA microspheres which readily allowed detachment of the SS from their surface. However, coating PLGA microspheres with antiadherent agents did not further improve the detachment of the drug from the surface. Thus, the first part of the study demonstrated that the surface-coated PCL microspheres and PLGA microspheres can be potential alternatives to lactose as carriers in DPI formulations; however, there was no significant improvement in the FPF of the drug. The second part of the research studied the influence of the size of the microspheres on the FPF of the drug. For this purpose, four different sizes (25 ìm, 48 ìm, 100 ìm and 150 ìm) of the PCL and PLGA microspheres were fabricated and characterized. The dispersion of the drug from microspheres of different sizes was determined. It was found that as the size of the carrier increased there was a significant increase in the FPF of SS. This study suggested that the size of the carrier plays an important role in the dispersion of the drug from the carrier surface. Subsequent experiments in the third part of the dissertation studied the surface properties of the polymeric carrier. The adhesion forces existing between the drug particle and the polymer surfaces, and the surface roughness of the carriers were quantified using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). A direct correlation between adhesion forces and dispersion of the drug from the carrier surface was observed suggesting that adhesion forces play an important role in determining the detachment potential of the drug from the carrier surface. However, no direct relationship between the surface roughness of the PCL or PLGA carrier and the FPF of the drug was observed. In conclusion, the body of work presented in this dissertation demonstrated the potential of coated PCL microspheres and PLGA microspheres to be used in DPI formulations as an alternative carrier to sugar based carriers. The study also emphasized the role of the size of the carrier particles and the forces of interaction prevailing between the drug and the carrier particle surface on the aerosolization performances of the drug...|$|E
