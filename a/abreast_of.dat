5|$|During production, Hergé kept <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> the {{turbulent}} political developments in Tibet. In March 1959, Tibet's foremost political and spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled the region into self-imposed exile in India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising. In May 2001, when Tintin in Tibet {{was published in}} China, state authorities renamed it Tintin in Chinese Tibet. When Casterman and the Hergé Foundation protested, the authorities restored the book's original title.|$|E

He had kept <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> national politics since college, though, and {{the circumstances of his}} father's presidential campaign loss had irked him for decades. He registered as an Independent and voted in the 1992 presidential primaries for the Democratic former senator from Massachusetts, Paul Tsongas.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945, {{removal of}} two quadruple torpedo tubes was {{authorized}} to permit substitution of two 40mm quad mounts. In June, {{removal of the}} third centerline tube was authorized {{to make way for}} two 40mm twin mounts <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> the aft stack. All ships receiving these AA modifications were to have directors installed with their new 40mm mounts; these Mark 51s were to be replaced by new blind-firing GFFC Mark 63 installations with radar.|$|E

5|$|Glorious carried four BL 15-inch (381mm) Mark I guns in two twin-gun turrets, {{one each}} fore ('A') and aft ('Y'). Her {{secondary}} armament was 18 BL 4-inch (102mm) Mark IX guns mounted in six triple mounts. These mounts had the three breeches too close {{together and the}} 23 loaders tended to interfere with one another. This negated the mount's intended high rate of fire against torpedo boats and other smaller craft. A pair of QF 3-inch (76mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> the mainmast on Glorious. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|HMS Swordfish was {{developed}} to meet a requirement of Royal Navy's Submarine Committee for a large submarine capable of operating with the fleet at a surfaced speed of 20 knots. Most of the earlier British submarines had been single-hulled vessels built by Vickers, and the Navy was interested in evaluating other designs. Captain Roger Keyes, Inspecting Captain of Submarines, had previously served as naval attaché in Italy and had kept <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> Italian submarine developments, which notably included double-hulled submarines designed by Cesare Laurenti of Fiat-San Giorgio. Three boats of the S class were ordered first and Laurenti was invited to submit a design to meet the RN requirement.|$|E

Heavy surf advisories were posted from central portions of the state northward to Georgia, and the National Hurricane Center advised that swimming and boating should be avoided. The Mayport Naval Station ordered 25ships out to sea {{in advance of the}} approaching storm. The Salvation Army was on standby in Jacksonville, prepared to act when needed. Hardware stores in the state reported up to a 75% increase in the sales of emergency supplies.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{demanded that}} Diệm appoint an officer as prime {{minister}} and that Diệm remove Madame Nhu from the palace. Saigon Radio broadcast a speech authorised by Thi's Revolutionary Council, claiming that Diệm was being removed because he was corrupt and suppressed liberty. Worried by the uprising, Diệm sent his private secretary Vo Van Hai {{to negotiate with the}} coup leaders. In the afternoon, Khanh left the palace to meet with rebel officers to keep <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> their demands, which they reiterated. The rebels' negotiators were Đông and Major Nguyen Huy Loi. They wanted officers and opposition figures to be appointed to a new government to keep Diệm in check.|$|E
5|$|After the Lancaster House negotiations, the anti-colonial {{movement}} had {{split into two}} parties, the Kenya African National Union (KANU), which was dominated by Kikuyu and Luo, and the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU), which was led largely by members of smaller tribal groups. In May 1960, KANU nominated Kenyatta as its President, although the government vetoed it, insisting {{that he had been}} an instigator of the Mau Mau. KANU then declared that it would refuse to take part in any government unless Kenyatta was freed. KANU campaigned on the issue of Kenyatta's detainment in the February 1961 election, where it gained a majority of votes. KANU nevertheless refused to form a government, which was instead created through a KADU-led coalition of smaller parties. Kenyatta had kept <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> these developments, although refused to back either KANU or KADU, instead insisting on unity between the two parties.|$|E

5|$|At 11:00, Napoleon drafted {{his general}} order: Reille's Corps {{on the left}} and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward {{position}} on the ridge. To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves, since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A grande batterie of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.|$|E
5|$|Christy {{could have}} {{graduated}} in 1940, {{but could not}} then be a teaching assistant, and this would have left him jobless and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This {{brought him to the}} attention of Eugene Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.|$|E
5|$|Garrard was {{regarded}} as a strong chief executive who surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors. His friend, John Edwards, and his son, William Garrard, were both in the state senate and kept him <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> issues there. He showed {{that he was willing to}} continue with Shelby's direction for the state by re-appointing Secretary of State James Brown, but the aging Brown retired in October 1796, only a few months into Garrard's term. Garrard then appointed Harry Toulmin, who had resigned the presidency of Transylvania Seminary in April due to opposition from the institution's more conservative trustees. Although he did not retain outgoing Attorney General John Breckinridge, who had sided with Logan in the disputed gubernatorial election, Garrard still frequently consulted with him on complex legal questions.|$|E
60|$|Among {{the various}} other vocations, all driven <b>abreast</b> on board <b>of</b> the Neversink, {{was that of}} the schoolmaster. There were two academies in the frigate. One {{comprised}} the apprentice boys, who, upon certain days of the week, were indoctrinated in the mysteries of the primer by an invalid corporal of marines, a slender, wizzen-cheeked man, who had received a liberal infant-school education.|$|R
50|$|On {{the second}} day, 16 March, {{indications}} that the Germans were fighting {{no more than a}} delaying action increased everywhere except, again, on the two flanks. It seemed particularly apparent in the zone of the XV Corps, where all three attacking divisions improved on their first day′s gains. Mines, demolitions, and strongpoints usually protected by a tank or an assault gun were the main obstacles. By nightfall, both the 3rd and 45th Divisions were well across the German frontier, scarcely more than a stone′s throw from the outposts of the Siegfried Line, and the 100th Division, relieved at Bitche by a follow-up infantry division, had begun to come <b>abreast.</b> Fighter-bombers <b>of</b> the XII Tactical Air Command again were out in force.|$|R

5|$|In the {{subsequent}} fiscal years 1941 and 1942, {{the federal government}} partially funded the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools. Through that initiative, 3,800 inactive nurses received refresher courses and 4,800 graduated nurses received postgraduate training. By the end of 1942, 47,500 students were enrolled in nursing schools {{but that did not}} meet the country's need. At this point, it was clear that nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> both civilian and military needs. The need for additional federal aid for the recruitment of nurses became apparent when the U.S. Army and Navy called for 2,500 new nurses each month during the fiscal year 1943.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs {{came during}} a time of great {{innovation}} in naval warfare. He kept <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> developments in other navies, and he made sure that the U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, {{were in the process of}} converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from paddles to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage of a bill providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Herring's {{twenty years}} as Chief Justice {{was a period}} of {{significant}} change and growth in the administration of the law. During his period of office the number of judges on the Court increased from six to fourteen, reflecting the growth in cases. Herring earned a reputation as a fine judge and able administrator. He set up the Chief Justice's Law Reform Committee to try to ensure justice in Victoria's courts was <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> the times, and a committee for religious observances and services to arrange the religious services marking the opening of the legal year. Herring retired as Chief Justice in 1964 but stayed on as Lieutenant Governor until his 80th birthday in 1972, serving in the position for a record 27 years. For his service as Lieutenant Governor, Herring was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the King's Birthday Honours of 9 June 1949.|$|E
50|$|The {{warships}} of the Vladivostok Cruiser Squadron {{formed in}} a line <b>abreast</b> at intervals <b>of</b> 4 nmi km and headed southward at 14 kn, in hourly expectation of sighting the Port Arthur Squadron. However, the Port Arthur Squadron had not been sighted by the following morning. As the Vladivostok Cruiser Squadron approached Busan, Jessen advised his captains {{that he had no}} intention of attempting to pass Tsushima Straits, and ordered the squadron back to Vladivostok.|$|R
50|$|On 14 February 1808, Raposa was {{cruising}} some {{fifty miles}} west of Cartagena, Colombia, when she sighted four vessels {{that turned out to}} be a schooner and three sloops. Raposa chased them to an island where they anchored and formed a line abreast. As Raposa sailed towards them she hit a sandbank. Seeing that she was aground, the enemy vessels came towards her in the late afternoon, and at dusk took up position in line <b>abreast</b> ahead <b>of</b> her. During the night Raposas crew endeavoured to lighten her, but were unable to free her. At five in the morning Violet surrendered, but not before he and the crew were able to set fire to her and take to her boats. The enemy ships then took all 55 men prisoner.|$|R
50|$|On 30 January, seven Japanese bombers {{appeared}} {{over the}} city and were engaged by British Brewster Buffalo fighters. As the alert continued, 30 more Japanese planes appeared overhead, on course over Keppel Harbor. Several bombs fell on shore, eastward of West Point's moorings, while another stick fell in the water to the southward. In the interim, bombs hit other targets. A small tanker moored near Wakefield was sunk at dockside; bombs fell <b>abreast</b> Empress <b>of</b> Japan; and Wakefield took a direct hit forward which destroyed her sick bay, killed five men and wounded nine. The last bombs in this stick straddled West Point and showered her with shrapnel. As the raid lifted, West Point sent two medical officers and 11 corpsmen on board Wakefield, at the latter's request, to render medical assistance.|$|R
5|$|She was {{decommissioned}} {{for a major}} reconstruction the day {{she returned}} to Germany. The work was done at the Kaiserliche Werft in Wilhelmshaven from December 1901 to 1904. New, more powerful electrical generators were installed, the upper deck was enclosed, and the 10.5cm guns that had been located on the upper deck were moved to gun ports in the hull. The two 5cm guns that were located <b>abreast</b> <b>of</b> the center funnel were moved further aft, to the third funnel. After completion of the work, Gefion was left out of service in reserve. Following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Admiralstab ordered Gefion to be reactivated, and on 10 August Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) Waldeyer was placed {{in command of the}} ship. A crew could not be assembled due to shortages in personnel, however, and so the ship could not be placed back into service. Waldeyer was therefore transferred to another ship on 21 August. Gefion was thereafter moved to Danzig in 1916 for use as a barracks ship for crews of warships being repaired at the Kaiserliche Werft there. She remained there {{for the duration of the}} war, and was stricken from the naval register on 5 November 1919.|$|E

500|$|Convoy Faith was {{detected}} by a German Condor at 8:00pm on 11July while about [...] off the Portuguese coast. This aircraft circled near the ships, broadcasting a homing signal. Two other Condors joined the first aircraft at about 9:00pm, and they commenced their attack on the convoy shortly thereafter. At this time, Convoy Faith was deployed in a formation intended to protect the ships from submarines. The two troopships and Port Fairy were sailing line <b>abreast</b> (Duchess <b>of</b> York was the westernmost of the three ships, California was in the centre and Port Fairy at the east of this group), Iroquois was located [...] ahead and the two other escorts were on each flank of the troopships. Busk-Wood had maintained this formation after the first Condor was spotted {{in the belief that}} the aircraft would call in submarines rather than conduct an attack.|$|R
60|$|As {{the old man}} had predicted, {{their sport}} was but small, but this {{concerned}} them little. Thinking that they might be watched, they continued steadily all the afternoon casting and drawing in the nets, until the sun neared the horizon. Then they gathered the nets into the boat and rowed quietly towards the shore. Just as they were <b>abreast</b> the end <b>of</b> the promontory the bell of the chapel began to ring the vespers. A few more strokes and Archie could see the clump of bushes.|$|R
