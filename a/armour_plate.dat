Sergeant Mabbet was mortally wounded but made a wheels-up landing near St Omer. Impressed with his skilful flying while badly wounded, the Germans buried him with full honours. On 23 July, Johnson damaged another Bf 109.

5|$|Australias keel {{was laid}} at John Brown & Company's Clydebank yard on 23 June 1910, and was {{assigned}} the yard number 402. The ship was launched by Lady Reid on 25 October 1911, {{in a ceremony}} which received extensive media coverage. Australias design was altered during construction to incorporate improvements in technology, including the newly developed nickel-steel <b>armour</b> <b>plate.</b> While it was intended that the entire ship be fitted with the new armour, manufacturing problems meant that older armour had {{to be used in}} some sections: the delay in sourcing the older armour plates set construction back half a year. Despite this, John Brown & Company delivered the ship £295,000 under budget.|$|E

5|$|The battleships of {{the late}} 1880s, for {{instance}} the , were armoured with iron and steel compound armour. This was soon replaced with more effective case-hardened steel armour made using the Harvey process developed in the United States. First tested in 1891, Harvey armour was commonplace in ships laid down from 1893–1895. However, its reign was brief; in 1895, the German Kaiser Friedrich III pioneered the superior Krupp armour. Europe adopted Krupp plate within five years, and only the United States persisted in using Harvey steel into the 20th century. The improving quality of <b>armour</b> <b>plate</b> meant that new ships could have better protection from a thinner and lighter armour belt; 12inches (305mm) of compound armour provided the same protection as just 7.5inches (190mm) of Harvey or 5.75inches (133mm) of Krupp.|$|E
5|$|During gunnery {{training}} on 5 May, {{there was a}} premature detonation in the left gun of Hyūgas Turret No. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen. Both aft magazines were flooded to douse the resulting fire and save the ship. She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular <b>armour</b> <b>plate</b> on which three triple 25mm gun mounts were positioned. On 11 May a valve in Ises No. 2 engine room stuck {{in the open position}} and flooded the engine room. While under repair at Kure, both ships received prototype Type 21 radars. Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, {{at the same time that}} most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).|$|E
5|$|The cannonade started {{fires in}} the main {{fortress}} and rapidly disabled Russian guns. Once Russian fire started to decrease, the gunboats moved into position behind the fortresses and began to bombard them as well. In {{the course of the}} morning, the three French vessels fired some 3,000 shells into the fort, and by 12:00, it had been neutralized by the combined firepower of the Anglo-French fleet. A single Russian hoisted a white flag above the fort to indicate their surrender, and Kokhanovitch walked out to speak with the French ground commander. According to historian James Grant, around 1,100 Russians of the 1,500-man garrison survived the battle and were allowed to leave without their weapons. Herbert Wilson puts the Russian casualties much lower, at 45 dead and 130 wounded. For the French and British, the only men killed were the two aboard Dévastation, with a further 25 wounded, all of whom were aboard the floating batteries. In the course of the battle, Dévastation was hit 75 times, while Lave received 66 hits and Tonnante was hit around the same number of times. None of the ships emerged from the battle with more than minor dents in their <b>armour</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{design and}} purpose of the vehicle determines the amount of <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> carried, as the plating is often very heavy and {{excessive}} amounts of armour restrict mobility. In order to decrease this problem, some new materials (nanomaterials) and material compositions are being researched which include buckypaper, and aluminium foam <b>armour</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicles}} {{became more}} sophisticated as time went, with <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> on the vehicle, protected vision slits, <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> over the wheels {{so they would}} withstand being shot at, and also in some cases, additional metal grating over {{the front of the}} vehicle designed to activate rocket propelled grenades before hitting the actual surface of the vehicle.|$|R
5|$|The series {{production}} of the T-26, equipped with new higher turrets with observation window, began in August 1931. Such turrets {{proved to be more}} suitable for mass production. The {{production of the}} T-26 encountered many problems: a lot of armoured hulls and turrets supplied by the Izhora Factory were of low quality (with cracks) and were 10mm thick instead of the planned 13mm. Poor production standards were the reason behind the frequent failures of tank engines, gear boxes, springs in suspension, tracks and rubber-covered road wheels of early T-26s. Thirty-five of the 100 T-26s produced by the Bolshevik Factory in 1931 had hulls and turrets made from mild steel. Later, it was planned to replace these hulls with ones built of <b>armour</b> <b>plate</b> as well as to mount engines of better quality. The business plan for 1932 called for 3,000 T-26s. For this, the tank workshop of the Bolshevik Factory was reorganised into the Factory No. 174 named after K.E. Voroshilov in February 1932. The director of the tank factory became K. Sirken and the chief engineer was S. Ginzburg. The problems with organizing the complicated new technological processes, poor production planning of parts suppliers, a great shortage of qualified engineers and technicians as well as of necessary equipment still resulted in many of the tanks being flawed, and they were not accepted by army representatives. On 26 October 1932, the Trust of Special Machine Industry, consisting of four factories, was established {{to solve the problem of}} tank production in the USSR. The planned production of T-26s for 1932 was decreased significantly and special attention was given to increasing the quality of the tanks. A production run of the new model single-turreted T-26 armed with the 45mm gun was launched in mid-1933.|$|E

25|$|Work {{on a more}} {{advanced}} armoured fighter, conceived as an armoured version of the Sopwith Snipe, began early in 1918. The forward portion of the fuselage was a 605lb (275kg) box of <b>armour</b> <b>plate,</b> forming {{an integral part of}} the aircraft structure, protecting the pilot and fuel system, with a 0.315 in (8mm) front plate, a 0.433 in (11mm) bottom plate, 0.236 in (6mm) side plates and rear armour consisting of an 11-gauge and 6-gauge plate separated by an air gap. The rear (unarmoured) section of the fuselage was a generally similar structure to the Snipe’s, but flat sided, to match the forepart. The two-bay wings and tailplane were identical in form to those of the Snipe, but were strengthened to cope with the extra weight, while the fin and rudder were identical to the Snipe. The new aircraft used the same Bentley BR2 rotary engine as the Snipe, covered by an unarmoured cowling – the foremost <b>armour</b> <b>plate</b> forming the firewall.|$|E

The tank can also be equipped with a 60mm mortar.|$|E
25|$|Sopwith's design, the 3F.2 Buffalo, was a single-engined tractor biplane, {{with its}} two-bay wooden wings taken from Sopwith's earlier Bulldog fighter. Like the Salamander, the forward {{fuselage}} was {{made out of}} <b>armour</b> <b>plate,</b> weighing about 750lb (340kg), with {{the bottom of the}} fuselage 0.315in (8mm) thick, with the sides and front of 0.179in (5mm) plate. The armoured box reached back to the observer's cockpit, protecting the crew together with the fuel tanks and pipes, the carburettor and the magnetos.|$|E

50|$|However, as {{effective}} and advanced as <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> has become, tank survivability against newer-generation tandem-warhead anti-tank missiles {{is a concern}} for military planners. For example, the RPG-29 from 1980s is able to penetrate the frontal hull armour of the Challenger II and also managed to damage a M1 Abrams.As well, even tanks with advanced <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> can have their tracks damaged by RPGs, which may render them immobile.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} vehicles use {{far less}} welded sections than at first intended. To reduce the price, Renault has opted {{to implement a}} novel construction technique, using large flat screws, serving both as bolts and, applied heated, as rivets, attaching the main <b>armour</b> <b>plates</b> to each other by means of thin connecting steel strips. This way no internal girders, forming a real chassis, are needed. The <b>armour</b> <b>plates</b> are 40 mm thick.|$|R
25|$|Typically {{constructed}} of hardwood planking and selectively clad with <b>armour</b> <b>plate,</b> this shallow-draft, barge-like boat {{with a crew}} of four could ferry an infantry platoon of 31, with space to spare for five additional specialist troops, to shore at 7 knots (13km/h). Men generally entered the boat by walking over a gangplank from the boat deck of a troop transport as the LCA hung from its davits. When loaded, the LCA was lowered into the water. Soldiers exited by the boat's bow ramp.|$|E
25|$|German armour-piercing shells {{were far}} more {{effective}} than the British ones, which often failed to penetrate heavy armour. The issue particularly concerned shells striking at oblique angles, which became increasingly the case at long range. Germany had adopted trinitrotoluene (TNT) as the explosive filler for artillery shells in 1902, while the United Kingdom was still using a picric acid mixture (Lyddite). The shock of impact of a shell against armour often prematurely detonated Lyddite in advance of fuze function while TNT detonation could be delayed until after the shell had penetrated and the fuze had functioned in the vulnerable area behind the <b>armour</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{controversy}} surrounding the battle stemmed from disbelief that a modified merchant ship could totally defeat a modern cruiser, with most theories describing how the Germans deceitfully gained the advantage. However, the two ships' armament was closer to equal than this matchup implied, and although Sydney normally {{had the advantage of}} <b>armour</b> <b>plate</b> and superior range, these were lost by closing with Kormoran. The proximity meant that the advantage would go to the ship that fired first; while Burnett likely assumed that Sydney was dealing with a merchantman, Detmers was ready for Kormoran to surprise the cruiser, and the raider's gun crew knew where to aim for maximum effectiveness.|$|E
5000|$|More remarkable, {{at least}} in terms of European cars of the time, was a large 5.2-litre engine {{delivering}} [...] The engine came from a Praga truck. Because of the weight of the <b>armour</b> <b>plating,</b> the standard car weighed nearly 4 tons, however. The top speed was restricted to 80 km/h (50 mph) on the orders of the interior ministry. A “Light-weight” version without all the <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> was also listed.|$|R

25|$|J. S. White of Cowes built a {{prototype}} to the Fleming design. Eight weeks later the craft was doing trials on the Clyde. The craft behaved admirably, though it tended to bury its {{nose in the}} sea at full throttle. The din from the engines, however, was tremendous. The metal hull served as an amplifier for the two 120hpChrysler engines. Also, there remained the difficulty of applying <b>armour</b> <b>plate</b> to the hull. The sides were not flat, but rounded – a complicated shape for which to roll an armoured skin. The Birmabright alloy used also presented chemical and physical obstacles {{for the application of}} hardened steel plates.|$|E
25|$|The canopy stayed {{essentially}} {{the same as that of}} the E-4, although the handbook for the 'F' stipulated that the forward, lower triangular panel to starboard was to be replaced by a metal panel with a port for firing signal flares. Many F-1s and F-2s kept this section glazed. A two-piece, all-metal <b>armour</b> <b>plate</b> head shield was added, as on the E-4, to the hinged portion of the canopy, although some lacked the curved top section. A bullet-resistant windscreen could be fitted as an option. The fuel tank was self-sealing, and around 1942 Bf 109Fs were retrofitted with additional armour made from layered light-alloy plate just aft of the pilot and fuel tank. The fuselage aft of the canopy remained essentially unchanged in its externals.|$|E
25|$|Production was {{intended}} to be on a very large scale – an initial order for 500 aircraft was placed with Sopwith on 18 June, followed by additional orders with Wolseley Motors, the Air Navigation Co., Glendower Aircraft, Palladium Motors and the National Aircraft Factory No. 1. A total of 1,400 Salamanders were ordered. Production was slowed, however, by problems producing the <b>armour</b> <b>plate,</b> this being prone to distortion during the hardening process, and shortages of the BR.2 engine. By the end of October 1918 only 37 Salamanders were on RAF charge, and just two of these were in France. The first Salamander-equipped squadron, 157 Squadron, was due to fly out to France with 24 aircraft on 21 November, with more squadrons in the process of forming in the United Kingdom.|$|E
