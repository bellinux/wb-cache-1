40|$|An {{analytical}} model is fitted to experimental data {{to show that}} rod-to-coil (RTC) transformations in single strand polymers (SSPs) are close to true phase transitions. The RTC are known to occur when the temperature or pH of a solvent in which the SSP is immersed is varied abruptly. Long wavelength degrees of freedom in the SSPs induce long range interactions in the molecule which lead to a first order phase transition. The Landau formalism suggests that a long-range ordered state can <b>appear</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> temperature.

The concentration is put on the onset of Taylor-GSrtler (TG) vortices generated in the sidewall boundary layers. By following the sidewall vorticity evolutions, the onset of TG vortices is able to be detected in a more practical way which is independent of the variation of the sidewall torque Ts. Thus, those weak TG vortices {{which may not be}} seen in terms of Ts histories [10], [19] can also be observed through the sidewall vorticity evolutions and a TG vortex bubble is reported to <b>appear</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> Reynolds number around 300. On the other hand, as the onset time of TG vortices based on the sidewall vorticity evolutions refers to an actual appearance of a TG vortex another onset time obtained from Ts histories in fact corresponds to a strong formation of TG vortices in the sidewall boundary layers. Meanwhile, it is revealed from both flow evolution and spectral amplitude analyses that the onset of TG vortices are followed by a range of evident increases for the spectral amplitudes which are formulated on the Fourier transformation of the stream functions in the sidewall boundary layers. Clearly, The onset times obtained by tracing the sidewall vorticity evolutions have a much better agreement with the experimental results of Euteneuer [4] than those from Ts histories. Besides, from the investigation into the assumption of the midplane symmetry by considering a halLcylindrical geometry, it is confirmed that such an assumption is able to hold well during the initial stage of the onset of TG vortices but tends t [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} {{learning}} systems {{that has received}} wide acknowledgment is that promulgated by Squire (1992). The model describes explicit and implicit learning systems as being encapsulated and operating in parallel. This paper aimed to investigate if implicit procedural sequence learning could be affected by explicit learning processes in an alternating serial reaction time task (ASRTT). The ASRTT involved visual-stimuli appearing in one of four spatial-locations placed horizontally across a computer screen. The stimuli followed a four-unit repeating sequence which alternated with random trials (1 r 2 r 4 r 3). This meant certain sets of three sequential trials or triplets <b>appeared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> high frequency (HFT) whilst others <b>appeared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> frequency. Sequence learning is represented by improved performance of response time and accuracy when responding to the third trial of a HFT compared to a LFT. This is called the triplet-type effect. The experiment also investigated if implicit sequence learning could be facilitated by observation alone. Results revealed {{that the level of}} implicit sequence learning occurred to the same extent, whether or not subjects intentionally tried to learn the repeating sequence during the training phase. The level of implicit sequence learning was also equivalent between participants that observed the visual stimuli in the training session and those that responded to it. These findings indicate that implicit sequence learning occurs independently of explicit learning processes with implicit sequence learning also being facilitated by observation alone. This study provides evidence that supports the theory of encapsulated learning systems...|$|R

Even though obvious cracks will not <b>appear</b> <b>at</b> such <b>a</b> <b>low</b> temperature, local microstructures will change {{in terms of}} superstructure formation. Electron energy-loss near-edge structure (ELNES) analysis reveals that newly appeared superstructures formation is mainly attributed to the reduction of Ce 4 + to Ce 3 +. Furthermore, the ELNES at the oxygen K-edge illustrates that such superstructures have enhanced oxygen vacancy ordering level, compared to non-H- 2 -treated YDC samples. This type of long-range ordered structure may act as trap/sink centers for mobile oxygen vacancies, the charge carrier of oxide ionic conductors, which is detrimental to solid oxide fuel cell performance. In the light of this study, it elucidates that microstructural evolution under an operating environment may be one possible reason for the degradation of the fuel cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results demonstrate that telomeres of early-senescing cells are the same length, and must shorten at the same rate, as cycling sister cells in the culture. Therefore, senescent cells in young mass cultures occur as a result of a stochastic, nontelomere-dependent process that we have described: sudden senescence syndrome.

40|$|Conformational {{changes of}} the retinal {{chromophore}} about the C 14 -C 15 bond in bacteriorhodopsin (BR) have been proposed in models for the mechanism of light-driven proton transport. To determine the C 14 -C 15 conformation in BR's L 550 intermediate, we have examined the resonance Raman spectra of BR derivatives regenerated with retinal deuterated at the 14 and 15 positions. Vibrational calculations show that the C 14 - 2 H and C 15 - 2 H rocking modes form symmetric (A) and antisymmetric (B) combinations in [14, 15 - 2 H]retinal chromophores. When there is a trans conformation about the single bond between C 14 and C 15 (14 -s-trans), a small frequency separation or splitting is observed between the A and B modes, which are found at approximately equal to 970 cm- 1. In 14 -s-cis molecules, the splitting is large, and the Raman-active symmetric A mode is predicted at approximately equal to 850 cm- 1. In addition, the monodeuterium rock should <b>appear</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> unusually <b>low</b> frequency (920 - 930 cm- 1) in the 14 - 2 H-labeled 14 -s-cis molecules. These patterns are insensitive to computational details: similar results are predicted by a modified Urey-Bradley force field and by MNDO (modified neglect of differential overlap) calculations for twisted chromophores and for highly delocalized protonated Schiff base cations. Time-resolved resonance Raman spectra were obtained of BR's L 550 intermediate regenerated with [14 - 2 H]-, [15 - 2 H]- and [14, 15 - 2 H]retinal. The symmetric A rock in L 550 is found at 968 cm- 1, within 4 cm- 1 of the frequencies for the monodeuterio derivatives, and no scattering is observed between 800 and 940 cm- 1. The rocking frequencies of deuterated L 550 are within 5 cm- 1 of those observed in BR 568, which contains a 14 -s-trans chromophore.

Materials and methods: We explored different neutron dose rates as well as possible implication of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), apoptosis, and energy-provider adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels during HRS. Results: HRS in melanoma cells <b>appears</b> only <b>at</b> <b>a</b> very <b>low</b> dose rate (VLDR), while a high dose rate (HDR) induces an initial cell-radioresistance (ICRR).

Fibroblast survival after neutron irradiation is also dose rate-dependent but without HRS. Conclusions: Melanoma cells or fibroblasts exert their own survival behaviour at very low doses of neutrons, suggesting that in some cases there is a differential between cancer and normal cells radiation responses. Only the survival of fibroblasts at HDR fits the linear no-threshold model. This new insight into human cell responses to very low doses of neutrons, concerns natural radiations, surroundings of accelerators, proton-therapy devices, flights at high altitude.

40|$|Severe plastic {{deformation}} (SPD) and the mechanical properties of Magnesium (Mg) alloy AZ 31 were studied in multi-directional forging (MDF) under decreasing temperature conditions. MDF {{was carried out}} up to a cumulative strain of 5. 6 with changing the loading direction during decreasing temperature from pass to pass. MDF can accelerate the uniform development of much finer grain structures in high strain, and the minimal grain size of 0. 23 μm can be developed by continuous dynamic recrystallization at 403 K. The fine-grained alloy shows higher strength as well as rather high ductility at room temperature and also superplastic elongation in low temperature. The relationship between the grain size and the yield stress or hardness at room temperature can be represented by a Hall-Petch equation. Superplasticity <b>appears</b> even <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> temperature of 393 K with a stress exponent of around 5. 6 and a total elongation of over 370 %. This relative large stress exponent can be connected with grain coarsening or refinement taking place during tensile deformation. A strong deformation texture, i. e. the (0001) basal plane parallel to tensile axis, exits stably during superplasticity. It is concluded that superplsaticity of fine-grained Mg alloy caniiibe controlled by grain boundary sliding {{and at the same}} time grain growth and refinement take place during deformation, while grain rotation hardly takes place. The effect of anisotropy on superplasticity was also studied in MDFed Mg alloy. Tensile test specimens were cut from the MDFed plate parallel (90 °specimen), with an inclination angle of 45 ° (45 °specimen) and perpendicular (0 °specimen) to the final compression axis. Superplasticity shows the following remarkable anisotropic behaviors. In the 0 °specimens, the texture change hardly takes place during super{{plastic deformation}}; i. e. no grain rotation occurs. In the 45 ° and 90 °specimens, in contrast, lower flow stresses as well as larger elongations appear accompanying with grain rotation. It is concluded that superplasticity or large elongation of Mg alloys can be controled not only by the grain size, but also the texture of Mg products. 電気通信大学 200...|$|R

The observation that the main oval emissions are observed to corotate with Jupiter's magnetic field further constrains the origin of these currents to be within about 30 R_J, so that the source region for the main oval auroral is now fairly well constrained to a region in Jupiter's middle magnetosphere and within the current sheet.

A novel genetic element, algP, was identified immediately downstream of algQ. This gene appears to act synergistically with algQ. Unlike a biosynthetic gene, algD, and another regulatory gene, algR, which undergo transcriptional activation in mucoid cells, both algP and algQ are equally transcribed in mucoid and nonmucoid isogenic strains of P. aeruginosa.

40|$|Leaner is an {{autosomal}} recessive mutation {{of the mouse}} which results in a severe ataxia accompanied by cellular losses in the cerebellar cortex. The purpose of this report is to construct a developmental profile of these losses. Of the three cerebellar cell types studied, the granule cells {{are the first to}} show obvious degenerative changes. Pycnotic cells are numerous in the internal granule cell layer at postnatal day 10, and, while they are found throughout the cortex, they are more concentrated in the anterior folia. Initially, there is a strong tendency for the pycnotic cells to be located in the deep half of the internal granule cell layer. By four postnatal months the rate of loss has slowed but the findings of occasional pycnotic cells in animals up to one year old suggests it continues {{for the life of the}} animal. Quantitative analysis of Purkinje and Golgi cells in leaner cerebella reveals a progressive loss of these cells as well. The number of Golgi cells falls uniformly to around half of the wild-type number. By contrast, the Purkinje cells show much more extensive degeneration. Further, the rate of cell death shows a regional variation; it is significantly more rapid in anterior folia. Overall, the number of Purkinje cells in leaner falls to about one-fifth of the wild-type number. The loss of both Purkinje and Golgi cell occurs late relative to the major events of cerebellar maturation. Significant cell loss is not observed until the end of the first postnatal month.

"May 2011 "This study intends to test how consumer behavior changes across income levels using time series data of the meat markets in Korea and the U. S. An income growth {{is one of the most}} significant and powerful trends in the modern economy and expected to continue its trend in the future. So finding relationships between income growth and consumer behavior can offer a higher level of understanding of both the current and future demand. Three relationships are found in the Korean and American meat market: (1) Since meat products are more desirable, even though meat is more expensive than other food, substitution of meat for grain <b>appears</b> to occur <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> income level. <b>As</b> a consequence, they have a property of being luxury goods when income is low and eventually become a necessity as income rises. (2) As income growth occurs, it makes the relative price and the expenditure share for meat to become smaller. These diminished prices and shares are likely to make consumers feel less sensitive to changes in price or income. As a result, price and income elasticities become smaller in absolute value as income rises. (3) Consumption is expanded as income rises and this expansion follows the order of urgency. A good on the expansion frontier faces severe competition in terms of the marginal utility. As a result, a good for which demand increases with incomes has a high possibility to maintain its elasticities even though income rises...|$|R
40|$|Community {{participation}} is now widely accepted as one important condition to achieve sustainable tourism development. The twelve aims of sustainable tourism {{determined by the}} United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) emphasises the significance of destination community, for example, local control, local prosperity and community well-being. This is because local people are the effected groups who are most directly impacted by tourism. Based on literature, generally community participation in developing countries <b>appears</b> to be <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> level, particularly in participation in tourism planning and decision making which largely affects community participation in tourism operation and management, and receiving benefits. Literature also reveals several obstacles impeding community participation. Therefore, this research aims to explore how community participation works in Thailand. Although the tourism industry in Thailand has grown enormously and rapidly within the last five decades, benefits from tourism are mostly restricted to large enterprises while local people participate at low levels and gain very little despite being burdened with negative impacts of tourism in their respective communities. This research explored issues surrounding community participation in tourism in two case study communities; Koh Samet, <b>a</b> community <b>at</b> the ‘consolidation stage’ of Butler’s Tourism Area Life Cycle (TALC), and Mae Kam Pong, <b>a</b> community <b>at</b> the ‘involvement’ stage of the TALC. Forms of community participation are assessed through three issues: participation in tourism planning and decision making; participation in tourism operation and management, and participation in benefits from tourism. Both qualitative methods (interviews, participant observation) and quantitative methods (surveys) were employed to collect data from two case study communities. ‘Social capital’ was a central concept utilised to examine community participation in tourism development. This concept has been widely used in many fields at the community level, for example public health and natural resource management, however, there are few studies exploring the relationship of social capital and community tourism development. The literature that does exist suggests that communities {{with high levels of}} social capital {{are more likely to have}} extensive community participation in tourism development. Findings from the Thai context show that community participation in tourism decision making is evidenced from the low to the high rungs of Arnstein’s (1969) ladder of citizen participation. This research explains what makes community participation different based on three themes. The first theme is that community participation in tourism development may be influenced by the social capital. The findings reveal that social capital is significantly associated with community participation in tourism development; however, social capital alone may not be sufficient to foster effective community participation in tourism development in these communities. It is argued that power relations and cultural factors appear to have a strong influence on community participation. The second theme is that communities at different stages of tourism development tend to have different levels of forms of participation. It seems promoting a high level of community participation may be easier when tourism is at the initial stage of development, but becomes more difficult as communities shift to later stages in the TALC. A process to monitor community participation over time is vitally required to ensure the balance of power within the community which appears to be a significant condition to achieve genuine community participation. Lastly, the levels and forms of community participation are likely to occur <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher level <b>at</b> the communities where tourism is developed as community-based, rather than mass tourism. These findings may have important implications for ensuring genuine community participation in tourism development in other parts of Thailand, and perhaps the developing world...|$|R
