The role of facticity in relation to authenticity involves letting one's actual values come into play when one makes a choice (instead of, like Kierkegaard's Aesthete, [...] "choosing" [...] randomly), so that one also takes responsibility for the act instead of choosing either-or without allowing the options to have different values.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} elocutionary {{theory and}} practice on a national, literary, and individual level, placing emphasis on {{the ways in which}} the eighteenth century treatises of elocutionist Thomas Sheridan address, and ultimately promote, speaking as both a public (or performative) and private (or <b>authentic)</b> <b>act.</b> Moreover, the thesis extends a consideration of the impact of elocutionary theory on various historical moments throughout the eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first centuries, respectively. Beginning with the works of elocutionist Thomas Sheridan and concluding with an analysis of recent pedagogical theories and narratives within the field of composition studies, this thesis also defines the impact of Sheridan's theories on the construction of Irish national identity. It presents nineteenth and twentieth-century Irish theatre as a compelling case study in order to argue that performance?a key theoretical concept in elocutionary theory?remains essential to the study and investigation of voice in the contemporary English classroom. Focusing on the dramatic works of Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw and Brian Friel, this thesis contends that Irish drama, in addition to presenting a forceful illustration of the ways in which Sheridan's elocutionary theories have been adapted and challenged on the national and civic level, provides current scholars access to recent dramatic representations of authenticity and voice as well as the virtues/pitfalls of performativity. Wilde, Shaw and Friel specifically present linguistic performance as a process of negotiation and exchange, using the stage to reflect and construct Irish national and civic identity. Each playwright offers a lens through which to reevaluate ongoing debates over language acquisition, particularly as such debates arise within the context of composition studies. Through a careful examination of elocutionary theory and its various influences across a variety of historical moments, this study encourages contemporary composition scholars and pedagogues to reconsider the role of authenticity and performance within the writing classroom, prompting students and teachers to explore writing as an expression of both the public and private self. In doing so, this thesis argues that scholars and teachers will become better equipped to address discussions of voice, authenticity and performance in their writing classrooms...|$|E

To achieve that goal then to discuss it, researchers used the approach legislation and conceptual approaches that research moved from the views and doctrines in the science of law, which is the method used in normative research. The type of data used in this research is secondary data obtained from the study of literature. And then analyzed by using deductive logic or legal material processing by means of deductive that describes a case of a general nature and then pull it into more specific conclusions. The results of research and studies it is known that electronic documents have evidence proving the minimum limit is different from authentic deed. Authentic deed has a minimum limit of proof on her own, so it does not require any other evidence, while the electronic evidence has a minimum threshold of evidence that can not stand alone in the sense that {{in order to be able}} to put forward evidence, electronic documents must be supported by other evidence. On the basis of studies that have been done before and the opinion of legal experts, the strength of evidence against electronic evidence can be in Liken or analogous to the strength of evidence photocopy and the strength of evidence is a copy of itself on the letter or the original deed. And by jurisprudence-jurisprudence that exists when for evidence in the form of a photo copy of which was not accompanied by a letter or the original deed, it must be followed by means of other evidence. Thus proving the power of electronic documents can not be equated with authentic document, meaning that the value of the strength of evidence electronic evidence is still as usual evidence, it can not stand alone in sufficient minimum threshold of proof, although the electronic document is a print out, output or outcome print (photo copy) of an <b>authentic</b> <b>act.</b> And proof strength values given in consideration of the judge.

40|$|Kafka's work {{provoked}} {{more than}} three decades of interpretations before Wagenbach provided information showing that Kafka was quite familiar with the work of Brentano and his Prague followers, including their unique conceptions of natural law, ethical concepts, and human acquaintance with them. Kafka took a lively interest in discussions in this Prague circle, and The Trial may without violence be read as a deliberate illustration for issues in philosophy of law as they would have been understood within this circle. This does not require that it be read as a reflection of Kafka's personality, nor does it require that he accepted Brentano's views. Wagenbach demonstrated Kafka's familiarity with unique conceptions, in the work of Brentano and his Prague followers, of natural law and ethics. Issues involved in these conceptions are cogently illustrated in The Trial. K. is tried for violating a law which is no positive law but a necessary condition for all positive law since all positive laws imply that they ought to be obeyed. Brentano adamantly rejected all forms of nativism. The opposite of 'natural' in the phrase 'natural law' is not 'acquired' but 'conventional. ' Acquaintance with natural norms is entirely acquired: persons having no such acquaintance can exist; K. is such a person. Natural norms, have a cognizable inherent correctness; any other norms oblige only through being authoritatively decreed. Conventional guilt or innocence is subject to influence. K. 's quest for a person to exert such influence on his behalf is evidence of his guilt. K. is unaware that absolute guilt is possible. In the Prometheus myth related by Plato's Protagoras, a sense of justice and right is necessary for politically organized society. Without insight into the natural sanction for correct positive laws, citizens cannot fulfill the duty rationally to choose positive laws: citizens will wrong one another, cities perish, humankind will be threatened. The myth gives important clues to the imagery of the parable "Before the Law. " Every <b>authentic</b> <b>act</b> of willing requires that something be desired for its own sake. Since there is a plurality of intrinsic goods, authentic action requires recognizing the chosen action to be better than its alternatives. Acquaintance with good, evil, better, and worse is acquired, Brentano insisted, only by perceiving certain affects to be correct. Like judgments, affects are either blind or evident. Basic moral concepts arise like all others from perception. K. could become innocent by acquiring the lacking concepts. Then, actual acquittal would be just despite his guilt when arrested. His trial tests whether he is likely to experience intrinsically correct emotions. Guilt would be objective, independent of any finding by the Court. K. 's guilt entails his lacking any such concept of absolute guilt. He is convinced that guilt depends entirely on the Court, is altogether a matter of authority. This is K. 's delusion concerning his relation to the Court and the Law, the delusion illustrated by the legend, "Before the Law. ...|$|E

5000|$|Major Cajun/Zydeco festivals {{are held}} {{annually}} in Rhode Island, {{which does not}} have a sizable Cajun population, but is home to many Franco-Americans of Québécois and Acadian descent. It features Cajun culture and food, as well as <b>authentic</b> Louisiana musical <b>acts</b> both famous and unknown, drawing attendance not only from the strong Cajun/Zydeco music scene in Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York City, and California, but also from all over the world. In recent years, the festival became so popular, now several such large summer festivals are held near the Connecticut-Rhode Island border: The Great Connecticut Cajun and Zydeco Music & Arts Festival, The Blast From The Bayou Cajun and Zydeco Festival, also in California the Cajun/Zydeco Festival; Bay Area Ardenwood Historic Farm, Fremont, Calif. and The Simi Valley Cajun and Blues Music Festival.|$|R
40|$|Cancer is {{commonly}} {{described as the}} uncontrolled reproduction of abnormal cells in the body. This definition enacts the disease as a local process, whose temporality is linear. In this article we challenge this approach, from a case study on breast cancer, analysed from the actor-network theory. Starting from the conception of disease as a material-semiotic trajectory, we establish the role of regulation and the processes of pre-symptomatic diagnosis in the materiality of cancer. Echoing the proposal of Alfred North Whitehead, we define cancer as a potential object. Then, we describe how propositions are articulated in biomedical patients, affect their anatomy and establish an <b>authentic</b> embodiment, which <b>acts</b> as a socio-material assemblage. We conclude {{that it is necessary}} to think about interventions that consider the heterogeneity of the material aspects that come with cancer, conceived from this perspective. </p...|$|R

In the last decade however, the phenomenal growth of the Internet — along with its perceived insecurity — has transformed a relatively obscure and esoteric science into a key link to the promises of the New Economy: as the current wisdom goes, e-commerce will not flourish until the public gains sufficient confidence that electronic transactions are secure. "Security", in this context, is generally equated {{with the ability to}} exchange information confidentially (e. g. credit card numbers), using cryptology-based technologies. Yet, the main impact of cryptology might not lie so much in its ability to provide confidentiality to the masses, but rather in the way it has come to define authentic-ity of electronic transactions (identification of parties + non-repudiation) and its technological realization in the electronic world (public-key infrastructures). In the world of paper-and-ink documents, the practices by which authenticity is enacted and sustained over time resists simple reduction to algorithmical processes. In France, for example, "authenticity " refers to a precise legal concept, as defined by article 1317 of the Napoleonic civil code: "the <b>authentic</b> [legal] <b>act</b> is that one which has been received with the required solem-nity by public officers [...] . " Authenticity is thus at once a professional privilege (for the most part, that of notaries), the outcome of a ritual with carefully prescribed forms, an economical interest (French law require...|$|R
