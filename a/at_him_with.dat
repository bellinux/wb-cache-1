5|$|Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{monitors}} Erwin Lukesh, {{a suspected}} serial killer who cuts out his victims' tongues. While pursuing him, Reyes goes {{into an apartment}} building and is attacked by Lukesh with a razor. John Doggett (Robert Patrick), observes the pursuit electronically and hears a scream. He rushes to help Reyes and finds her dying, her throat cut. Doggett chases Lukesh into an alleyway, where the killer seemingly vanishes. Lukesh then appears behind Doggett and fires <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> Reyes' gun.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{immediately}} guided Palace {{back to the}} Premier League as runaway {{champions of}} the second tier, Chris Armstrong top-scoring with 23 league goals. During this period the badge was changed with the bird being replaced by one which Ron Noades felt more closely resembled an eagle. 1995 again saw the club making news for off the field reasons. On 25 January 1995 Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park. Following a bad tackle on Richard Shaw, United's maverick French forward Eric Cantona was sent off. As Cantona walked towards the tunnel he was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons. This angered Cantona, who launched a flying kick <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> both feet. Manchester United suspended Cantona {{for the remainder of}} the season, while the French Football Federation dropped Cantona from the France national football team, and stripped Cantona of the captaincy of Les Bleus. Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail; this was reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal. Simmons was immediately banned from Selhurst Park, and in 1996 was found guilty of two charges of using threatening words and behaviour towards Cantona. More was to follow at Selhurst in March, when Chris Armstrong was suspended by the FA for failing a drugs test. In 1995 Palace reached the semi-finals of both domestic cups, but a shortage of Premier League goals counted against them alongside the introduction of a fourth relegation place. The Premiership was being cut from 22 to 20 clubs at the end of the 1994–95 season, and Palace found themselves demoted on the last day of the season once again.|$|E
25|$|In Limitless (2011), {{the protagonist}} Eddie Morra blinds one of Gennady's thugs in self-defence, then lunges <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a grand piano, {{throwing}} {{him out of}} a window.|$|E

Women dressed as courtesans enter and Willmore flirts with one of them, while Belvile snipes <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> references to venereal diseases.|$|E
25|$|Finally the {{authorities}} {{were able to}} raise an army to confront Aquino. To the army were added many residents of San Vicente, who wanted to take revenge for the sacking of the city. One of the army commanders, Major C. Cuellar, wanted to confront Aquino alone, but he was defeated. According to legend, Aquino rushed <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> the cry Treinta arriba, treinta abajo, y adentro Santiagueños ("Thirty above, thirty below, and inside Santiagueños"). This probably referred to the place occupied by his troops {{at the moment of}} the attack.|$|E

25|$|Between 1888 and 1890, Narendra visited Vaidyanath in Allahabad. In January 1890 he {{went from}} Allahabad to Ghazipur and met Pavhari Baba, an Advaita Vedanta ascetic who {{spent much of his}} time in meditation. At the time he {{suffered}} from lumbago, and it was becoming impossible for him to move or sit in meditation. After meeting Baba, Narendra wanted to become his disciple and Baba asked him to stay a few more days at Ghazipur. However, the night before his initiation Narendra had a dream in which Ramakrishna looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a melancholy face. This dream convinced Narendra that no one other than Ramakrishna could be his teacher, and he abandoned the idea of becoming Baba's disciple.|$|E
25|$|On April 14, 2005, a Red Sox fan {{leaned over}} the railing at Fenway Park and distracted Sheffield as {{he was going to}} field a ball hit by Jason Varitek. After Sheffield took a swing <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> his glove, he threw the ball back into the infield, and then got into a verbal altercation with him. Fan Interference was not called, {{resulting}} in a game tying RBI Triple for Varitek. The fan, a long-time season ticket holder, was not ejected from Fenway Park, but he donated his remaining 2005 season tickets to charity in an effort to avoid any controversy {{for the remainder of the}} season. Sheffield was fined for the incident. Charges were dismissed against both the fan and Sheffield.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Gold {{receives}} {{a visit from}} The Snow Queen, who is {{ready to make a}} deal with him, as she has now figured out what his plan is. The Snow Queen knows that Gold wants to leave Storybrooke with Belle and to be free of the Dagger of Kris, while the Snow Queen wants Storybrooke all to herself, and she says that she has the secret to the missing ingredient he needs. She then asks for the ribbons, and as he gives them to her, the Snow Queen whispers the secret into his ear. Then, Mr. Gold says that he will obtain the final ingredient with great pleasure, causing the Snow Queen to stare <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a shocked expression.|$|E

25|$|The warlord Oda Nobunaga's notorious {{reputation}} led {{to several}} attempts on his life. In 1571, a Kōga ninja and sharpshooter {{by the name}} of Sugitani Zenjubō was hired to assassinate Nobunaga. Using two arquebuses, he fired two consecutive shots at Nobunaga, but was unable to inflict mortal injury through Nobunaga's armor. Sugitani managed to escape, but was caught four years later and put to death by torture. In 1573, Manabe Rokurō, a vassal of daimyō Hatano Hideharu, attempted to infiltrate Azuchi Castle and assassinate the sleeping Nobunaga. However, this also ended in failure, and Manabe was forced to commit suicide, after which his body was openly displayed in public. According to a document, the Iranki, when Nobunaga was inspecting Iga province—which his army had devastated—a group of three ninja shot <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> large-caliber firearms. The shots flew wide of Nobunaga, however, and instead killed seven of his surrounding companions.|$|E
25|$|Shepherd {{was convicted}} of the crime on October 9, 2008, after jurors deliberated for four hours. He was given the maximum {{sentence}} of 99 {{years in prison and}} a $10,000 fine. During the punishment phase of the trial, Shepherd revealed how he murdered Stewart. He pressured her to reveal her new relationship at college, but she refused to answer and grabbed a knife from a table and approached him with it in her hand. She swung <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> the knife and nicked his fingers. Afraid she was going to stab him again, he grabbed her around the neck with one arm and tried to reach the knife with his other hand. He ended up choking her to death out of anger. He later went to the hardware store to purchase a jigsaw. He undressed the body and dismembered it in his bathtub using the jigsaw and other tools. He barbecued the remains on his grills in his patio.|$|E
25|$|Short was {{reported}} by Bat Masterson to have killed six drunken Sioux Indians at various times. Later writers have relied on Masterson's story as truthful and added to it, but no documentation of these killings has been found. Nonetheless, Short did experience fighting Indians while working for the government. His first fight with the Indians happened in 1869 and since then he's been in over thirty engagements. The Omaha Daily Bee wrote an obituary for Luke Short which mentioned that he first worked as a scout for General George Crook in 1876, and was stationed in the Black Hills during the Sioux insurrection. While conducting one of his usual dispatches for the army in the hills, a band of fifteen Indians suddenly ambushed and fired <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> rifles. Short managed to draw his pistols and fired back, killing three of them in quick succession. Some of the Indians gave chase on horseback, and Short killed two of them before finally reaching safety.|$|E

25|$|Classical rabbinical sources also {{allude to}} a war between the Canaanites and Judah's family (not {{mentioned}} in the Hebrew Bible), {{as a result of}} their destruction of Shechem in revenge for the rape of Dinah; Judah features heavily as a protagonist in accounts of this war. In these accounts Judah kills Jashub, king of Tappuah, in hand-to-hand combat, after first having deposed Jashub from his horse by throwing an extremely heavy stone (60 shekels in weight) at him from a large distance away (the Midrash Wayissau states 177⅓ cubits, while other sources have only 30 cubits); the accounts say that Judah was able to achieve this even though he was himself under attack, from arrows which Jashub was shooting <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> both hands. The accounts go on to state that while Judah was trying to remove Jashub's armour from his corpse, nine assistants of Jashub fell upon him in combat, but after Judah killed one, he scared away the others; nevertheless, Judah killed several members of Jashub's army (42 men according to the midrashic Book of Jasher, but 1000 men according to the Testament of Judah).|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} Lizaveta Prokofyevna {{and her daughters}} visit Myshkin to check on his health and assure him of their friendship. They are {{followed}} by Ippolit, who informs the Prince that he and others (such as Lebedyev and Ganya) have been intriguing against him, and have been unsettling Aglaya with talk of Nastassya Filippovna. Ippolit has arranged, at Aglaya'a request and with Rogozhin's help, a meeting between the two women. That evening Aglaya, having left her home in secret, calls for the Prince. They proceed in silence to the appointed meeting place, where Nastassya Filippovna waits for Aglaya to begin. It soon becomes apparent that Aglaya has not come there to discuss anything, but to chastise and humiliate Nastassya Filippovna. Nastassya Filippovna responds in kind and a bitter exchange of accusations and insults ensues. Nastassya Filippovna orders Rogozhin to leave and hysterically demands of Myshkin that he stay with her. Myshkin, once again torn by her suffering, is unable to deny her and reproaches Aglaya for her attack. Aglaya looks <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> pain and hatred, and runs off. He goes after her but Nastassya Filippovna stops him desperately and then faints. Myshkin stays with her.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} two years, {{especially}} during the period between April 1867 and March 1868, the 8th US Cavalry were in almost constant combat with the Apache {{and became one of}} the US Army's most experienced cavalry regiments. When several bands of Apache began raiding settlements, killing settlers and stealing livestock throughout the territory in the late summer and fall of 1868, Wortman was among the troopers tasked with protecting the entire Arizona Territory. These consisted of no more the 50 or 60 soldiers, mainly taken from Troops B and L of the 8th US Cavalry, who faced repeated ambushes and were often shot at by snipers during their duties. On one of these patrols, Wortman led a 15-man scouting party across the Salinas River. He had made three previous patrols in the area under Lieutenant Colonel Thomas C. Devin, then commanding officer of the 8th US Cavalry, and was familiar with the area. He and his group found a small rancheria nearby, seemingly deserted like many other camps they had come across, where they were attacking in a poorly planned ambush by four Apaches. All four were killed by the troopers. One of them was killed, shot in the chest at point-blank range, by Wortman himself when the Apache charged <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a knife.|$|E

25|$|In 1561, Kenshin and Shingen {{fought the}} biggest battle they would fight, the fourth battle of Kawanakajima. Kenshin used an ingenious tactic: a special {{formation}} where {{the soldiers in}} the front would switch with their comrades in the rear, {{as those in the}} frontline became tired or wounded. This allowed the tired soldiers to take a break, while the soldiers who had not seen action would fight on the front lines. This was extremely effective and because of this Kenshin nearly defeated Shingen. In Kōyō Gunkan there {{is one of the most}} famous instances of single combat in samurai history; during this battle, Kenshin managed to ride up to Shingen and slashed <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> his sword. Shingen fended off the blows with his iron war fan or tessen. Kenshin failed to finish Shingen off before a Takeda retainer drove him away. Shingen made a counter-attack and the Uesugi army retreated. The result of the fourth battle of Kawanakajima is still uncertain. Many scholars are divided on who the actual victor was, if the battle was actually decisive enough to even declare one, thus is generally considered a draw. It is considered to be the largest casualty battle in the Sengoku period, with loss of estimated 72 percent of Kenshin's army and 62 percent of Shingen's army, but Shingen also lost two of his most important generals during the battle, namely his advisor Yamamoto Kansuke and younger brother Takeda Nobushige. Some more conservative estimates place the casualties around 20 percent.|$|E
500|$|The Tsuchigumo (translated as [...] "Earth spiders") of Japan, is a mythical, supernatural {{creature}} {{faced by}} the legendary Minamoto no Raiko. Depending on the version of the story, the Tsuchigumo {{was able to take}} the visage of either a boy or a woman. In one version, while on a search for a mythical giant skull, Minamoto is lured to a house and placed in an illusion created by a Tsuchigumo {{in the guise of a}} young boy. However, after suspecting foul play, Minamoto breaks this illusion by striking out <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> his sword. Minamoto then discovers himself as actually being covered in a spider's web, and after tracking him down, learns that the boy is in reality, a giant spider Tsuchigumo.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's {{tall and}} robust figure {{combined}} with his odd gestures were confusing to some; when William Hogarth first saw Johnson standing near {{a window in}} Samuel Richardson's house, [...] "shaking his head and rolling himself about in a strange ridiculous manner", Hogarth thought Johnson an [...] "ideot, whom his relations had put {{under the care of}} Mr. Richardson". Hogarth was quite surprised when [...] "this figure stalked forwards to where he and Mr. Richardson were sitting and all at once took up the argument... such a power of eloquence, that Hogarth looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> astonishment, and actually imagined that this ideot had been at the moment inspired". Beyond appearance, Adam Smith claimed that [...] "Johnson knew more books than any man alive", while Edmund Burke thought that if Johnson were to join Parliament, he [...] "certainly would have been the greatest speaker that ever was there". Johnson relied on a unique form of rhetoric, and he is well known for his [...] "refutation" [...] of Bishop Berkeley's immaterialism, his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist: during a conversation with Boswell, Johnson powerfully stomped a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeley's theory, [...] "I refute it thus!" ...|$|E
