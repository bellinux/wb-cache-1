Betances and Basora had the city's unsanitary slave barracks torched and a temporary camp set up for its dwellers. A large field <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the city was set aside for a supplementary cemetery, and Betances set and managed a temporary hospital next to it (which was later housed in a permanent structure and became the Hospital San Antonio, the Mayagüez municipal hospital, which still serves the city). However, the epidemic struck the city soon after; Betances' stepmother and one of his brothers-in-law would die from it. By October 1856 Betances would {{have to take care of}} the entire operation on his own temporarily.|$|E

500|$|In {{water tank}} testing, {{engineers}} subjected G-ALYU to repeated re-pressurisation and over-pressurisation, and on 24 June 1954, after 3,057 flight cycles (1,221 actual and 1,836 simulated), G-ALYU burst open. Hall, Geoffrey de Havilland and Bishop were immediately {{called to the}} scene, where the water tank was drained to reveal that the fuselage had ripped open <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the forward left escape hatch cutout. A further test reproduced the same results. [...] Based on these findings, Comet 1 structural failures could be expected at anywhere from 1,000 to 9,000 cycles. Before the Elba accident, G-ALYP had made 1,290 pressurised flights, while G-ALYY had made 900 pressurised flights before crashing. Dr P.B. Walker, Head of the Structures Department at the RAE, {{said he was not}} surprised by this, noting that the difference was about three to one, and previous experience with metal fatigue suggested a total range of nine to one between experiment and outcome in the field could result in failure.|$|E

500|$|The show {{is mainly}} {{divided into four}} parts with the last part being the encore.

The video was projected on a giant screen in front of the stage.

500|$|The scene wherein Peppermint Butler teaches Finn and Jake {{to enter}} {{the land of the}} dead by {{crossing}} their eyes and staring <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> was inspired by a story that Moynihan's father told him when he was younger. According to the artist, his father told him that if you [...] "concentrate really hard enough", you would [...] "walk into another dimension". Moynihan recalled the story when he was storyboarding, and worked it into the episode. The climax featuring Death and Finn engaging in a musical competition was specifically written so as to not be [...] "corny". According to Ward, scenes featuring contests were often avoided because they were [...] "the easiest traps to fall into when you're writing an outline". For [...] "Death in Bloom", the writing staff realized that a contest would work towards the story's strengths. In original drafts of the episode, Finn and Jake were guided through the Land of the Dead by a mysterious rabbit. Sanchez continually felt that the rabbit was misplaced in the episode. When it came time to revise the story, the rabbit was inevitably cut because it was agreed by the writers and series staff that the character did not fit within the story. The rabbit's role was later partially replaced by an ominous talking skull that tries to get Jake to drink from the [...] "River of Forgetfulness". According to storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar, a rough draft for the original ending featured Princess Bubblegum becoming a man without the Princess Plant. Moynihan later noted that the writers were being a [...] "little reckless" [...] when it was pitched, and Ward joked that he had to step in and be [...] "quality control" [...] to prevent the idea from making it into the final episode.|$|E

2500|$|Exterior angle – The {{exterior}} angle is the supplementary {{angle to the}} interior angle. Tracing around a convex n-gon, the angle [...] "turned" [...] <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> is the exterior or external angle. Tracing {{all the way around}} the polygon makes one full turn, so the sum of the {{exterior angle}}s must be 360°. This argument can be generalized to concave simple polygons, if external angles that turn in the opposite direction are subtracted from the total turned. Tracing around an n-gon in general, the sum of the exterior angles (the total amount one rotates at the vertices) can be any integer multiple d of 360°, e.g. 720° for a pentagram and 0° for an angular [...] "eight" [...] or antiparallelogram, where d is the density or starriness of the polygon.

Four minutes into injury time, Marlon King grabbed his first Middlesbrough goal as volleyed in from close range.

2500|$|Though Christian {{is often}} {{referred}} to as being a church architect he also designed about 120 houses, mainly for wealthy gentlemen. Many were built in a heavy Tudor style with large stone mullioned and transomed windows, steep roofs with dormers and tall brick chimney stacks and displaying decorative timber-framing and tile-hanging. One of his earliest was Market Lavington Manor in Wiltshire (completed in 1865) for Edward Pleydell Bouverie (1818–89) a Liberal MP, Church Estates Commissioner and from 1869 an Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The house has an impressive gabled exterior in red brick with blue brick diapering. Christian commented in his own list of works that the house had 'brought many others in its train'. His work at Glyndebourne, East Sussex in 1876 for William Langham Christie (1830–1913) involved encasing the original Tudor house in a new Tudor style brick exterior with large bay windows added to give more light to the interior. Malwood (1883–84), a house Christian designed near Minstead in Hampshire (not to be confused with Castle Malwood which is a different house) was built for the Liberal statesman Sir William Harcourt (1827–1904) and shows the influence of the architect Norman Shaw's 'Old English' style. Christian designed the building for its setting in the ridge-top clearing of a wood, close to the ancient earthworks of an Iron Age hill fort. It displays extensive half-timbering above a red brick ground floor with stone dressings and the steep roofs have large gables and dormers and clusters of tall brick chimneys. Christian's own house, 'Thwaitehead', named after his mother's home village in Lancashire, was built by him in 1881–82 on an excellent site in Well Walk, Hampstead, overlooking Hampstead Heath. (The view was obscured in 1904 when The Pryors – large Edwardian mansion blocks – was built opposite.) The house is picturesquely designed in red brick and is set at an angle to the corner of the road with large stone mullioned windows and a tile-hung projecting bay. The reddish-brown tiled roofs of different levels have hipped dormers and massive ribbed chimney stacks (in dark grey-brown brick to match the roofs). A very typical tower with its own pyramidal roof is placed asymmetrically <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the building and there is a charming first-floor open trellis-work balcony which had views of the heath. The band of text which ran around the building at first-floor level and included Christian's favourite [...] "God's Providence is Mine Inheritance" [...] has recently been restored in a restoration of the building by Belsize Architects. Thwaitehead's design predominantly displays the influence of the Domestic Revival style of architecture made popular at that time through the work of Richard Norman Shaw (1831–1912) and W. E. Nesfield (1835–88). Shaw also lived in Hampstead in a house that he designed for himself (completed in 1876) and his house for the children's book illustrator Kate Greenaway in nearby Frognal, Hampstead, built in 1884–85, displays pretty tile-hanging and a balcony and is in its character similar to Christian's own house, built only three years before.|$|E
