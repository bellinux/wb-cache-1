25|$|Accordingly, it was {{recognized}} that {{work on a}} third edition would have to begin to rectify these problems. The first attempt to produce a new edition came with the Oxford English Dictionary Additions Series, {{a new set of}} supplements to complement the OED2 with the intention of producing a third edition from them.

25|$|The {{question}} of a catalog was to Cogswell's mind a matter of prime importance. By the end of 1855, Cogswell was able to report that the catalog was finished, excepting {{only a small portion}} of history. The collection was grouped into 14 departments, for each of which a separate catalog was prepared. The <b>alphabetical</b> <b>index</b> to these separate catalogs formed the basis of the printed catalog issued during 1857–1861 in 4 volumes. The timing and the format of the catalog went against Cogswell's judgment, but accorded with the desire of the trustees to put before the public a tangible result of their work. In 1866, a supplement was issued. The first catalog recorded approximately 115,000 volumes. The supplement of 1866 recorded the accessions of five years, about 15,000 volumes, and carried with it an index to subjects. It was imperfect, but also the work of someone who knew books and knew how to guide others to them.|$|E

500|$|Following Hughes's view, Duckles also {{believed}} the manuscript {{was written in}} two hands. In his view, the first hand wrote the titles for songs nos. 1-176 of the Cattalogue, and the second hand, probably that of Gamble himself, wrote of nos. 177-266 (leaving space left to accommodate future additions) {{as well as the}} <b>alphabetical</b> <b>index.</b> Duckles described the writing style of Hand 1 as favoring [...] "round, compact letter forms, vertical alignment, calligraphic flourishes on capitals and heavy down strokes," [...] when writing with a broad pen. Duckles admits that Hand 1 has [...] "two forms": [...] "When the hand writes with a finer quill, the letter forms are more loosely connected, the flourishes a little more pronounced, and there is a slight inclination to the right." [...] Hand no. 2 has a [...] "pronounced slant to the right, letter forms are thin and elongated and the pen is a fine one." [...] Duckles observed that hand no. 2 participated slightly in the preparation of part 1 (nos. 1-176) with only six songs, but all of the text incipits. Likes Hughes, Duckles also felt that Hand 2 is probably that of Gamble.|$|E

6000|$|I {{think of}} {{translating}} Blumenbach's Manual of Natural History: {{it is very}} well written, and would, I think, be useful both to students, as an admirable direction to their studies, and to others it would supply a general knowledge of the subject. I will state {{the contents of the}} book: 1. Of the naturalia in general, and their divisions into three kingdoms. 2. Of organised bodies in general. 3. Of animals in general. 4. Of the mammalia. 5. Birds. 6. Amphibious. 7. Fishes. 8. Insects. 9. Worms. 10. Plants. 11. Of minerals in general. 12. Of stones and earthy fossils. 13. Of mineral salts. 14. Combustible minerals. 15. Of metals. 16. Petrifactions. At the end there is an <b>alphabetical</b> <b>index,</b> so that it is at once a natural history and a dictionary of natural history. To each animal, etc., all the European names are given, with of course the scientific characteristics. I have the last edition, [...] "i.e.", that of April, 1799. Now, I wish to know from you, whether there is in English already any work of one volume (this would make 800 pages), that renders this useless. In short, should I be right in advising Longman to undertake it? Answer me as soon as you conveniently can. Blumenbach has been no very great discoverer, though he has done some respectable things in that way, but {{he is a man of}} enormous knowledge, and has an [...] "arranging" [...] head. Ask Beddoes, if you do not know. When you have leisure, you would do me a great service, if you would briefly state your metaphysical system of impressions, ideas, pleasures, and pains, the laws that govern them, and the reasons which induce you to consider them as essentially distinct from each other. My motive for this request is the following:--As soon as I [...] "settle", I shall read Spinoza and Leibnitz, and I particularly wish to know wherein they agree with, and wherein differ from you. If you will do this, I promise you to send you the result, and with it my own creed.|$|E

50|$|With the {{exception}} of some extra details recorded on death certificates since 1969, the information given on certificates of birth, marriage and death has not changed since 1837, but {{the amount of information}} given in the index volumes has increased from time to time. Up until 1983, the copies received by the Registrar General were bound into volumes and three separate <b>alphabetical</b> <b>indexes</b> were prepared on a quarterly basis. The number of volumes depends on the number of people registered in each quarter. Thus there may be 10 volumes for some quarters - Vol.1 A-B, Vol.2 C-D, Vol.3 E-G and so on. From their inception, the <b>alphabetical</b> <b>indexes</b> give the surname, the forenames if registered, the registration district and the volume and the page on which the entry may be found. These details enable the appropriate record to be located. Before 1866, the indexes were written by hand on heavy parchment, though some have been replaced by printed copies. From 1984, the indexes are in annual instead of quarterly volumes from 1984. The indexes from 1984 give the month of registration as the first and second digits in the document reference number. The next two digits give the year. Thus the reference number 0485 9 2128 refers to an event registered in April 1985. From 1860 the GRO death index specifies an age of death and from 1911 the birth index also specifies the maiden name of a child's mother.|$|R
