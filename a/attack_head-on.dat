While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies.

From Pulleine's vantage point in the camp, at first only the right horn and then the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine sent out first one, then all six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu <b>attack</b> <b>head-on</b> and checking it with firepower. Durnford's men, upon meeting elements of the Zulu centre, had retreated to a donga, a dried-out watercourse, on the British right flank where they formed a defensive line. The Rocket Battery under Durnford's command, which was not mounted and dropped behind the rest of the force, was isolated and overrun very early in the engagement. The two battalions of native troops were in Durnford's line; while all the officers and NCOs carried rifles, only one in 10 in the ranks was armed with a muzzle-loading musket with limited ammunition and many of them started to leave the battlefield at this point.|$|E

5000|$|From July {{through to}} {{the first week of}} November 1943 the Squadron was mostly engaged on {{offensive}} fighter [...] "sweeps" [...] (an operation to draw up enemy fighters, hopefully to shoot them down in large numbers), and bomber escorts. On 22 August 485 Sqn. suffered its worst day; during a high cover escort mission for American Marauders two enemy fighter squadrons <b>attacked</b> <b>head-on.</b> Four 485 Sqn pilots were shot down with two enemy aircraft shot down in return.|$|R
50|$|This {{maneuver}} {{prevented the}} regiment from being <b>attacked</b> <b>head-on</b> {{by a group}} of Confederate soldiers. As the Confederates passed by the regiment, Private Peter Schwartz of Company I suddenly stood up and opened fire on the Confederates. The regiment quickly followed Schwartz's example, completely destroying the extreme left wing of the Confederate advance. Shortly after this success, during a withdrawal ordered by General Kearny, Col William Brown was shot through the temple by a Confederate sharpshooter. Maj. Wheeler assumed command of the regiment.|$|R

One well-placed machine gun nest, located in a clump of bushes, was deemed too dangerous to <b>attack</b> <b>head-on.</b> Wold asked for and received permission to crawl up to the position and investigate. While {{the rest of the}} group took cover, he crept up to the rear of the emplacement, killed two occupants, and captured the remaining three. As the group continued on, clearing ambuscades, sniper posts, and gun emplacements, Wold volunteered four more times to single-handedly attack machine gun nests. He was successful each time except the last. He was killed by machine gun fire while penetrating a camouflage screen which concealed the fifth emplacement. His comrades then charged the position, killed the occupants and recovered Wold's body.|$|E

50|$|The first {{ships to}} {{actually}} mount heavy cannon capable of sinking ships were galleys, with large wrought-iron pieces mounted {{directly on the}} timbers in the bow. The first example is known from a woodcut of a Venetian galley from 1486. Heavy artillery on galleys was mounted in the bow which fit conveniently with the long-standing tactical tradition of <b>attacking</b> <b>head-on</b> and bow-first. The ordnance on galleys was quite heavy from its introduction in the 1480s, and capable of quickly demolishing medieval-style stone walls that still prevailed until the 16th century.|$|R
5000|$|Carvajal, Pescara, and Palude {{converged on}} the French cavalry, which split into two bodies and met both Spanish <b>attacks</b> <b>head-on.</b> [...] The initial Spanish charges were {{unsuccessful}} in breaking the French line; Taylor attributes their failure to the depleted morale of the Spanish cavalry after the artillery bombardment, the effect of [...] "ditches and vegetation" [...] on the Spanish formations, the better tactics of the French, {{and the arrival of}} reinforcements sent by La Palice from the French vanguard. [...] The bodies of French and Spanish cavalry then engaged in a lengthy fight along the left of the French positions.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of March 1825 he embarked with his family on a ship called [...] "Livonia" [...] destined for Chile. After a brief stay in Santiago {{he returned to the}} Río de la Plata where the government made him the leader of the 1st Cavalry Regiment with the rank of lieutenant colonel. On February 20, 1827 in the Battle of Ituzaingó his regiment was faced to the Brazilian infantry occupying a fortified position protected by a very deep ditch. General Carlos María de Alvear, ordered him to <b>attack</b> <b>head-on,</b> but Brandsen told him that success was impossible in those conditions. Alvear did not accept his prudent arguments and he charged at the head of his troops, dying heroically. The attack failed, but the battle was won because other colonels such as Tomás de Iriarte, Miguel Estanislao Soler and José María Paz, amended the errors of Alvear. Brandsen was posthumously promoted to colonel; his remains rest in the Cementerio de la Recoleta, in Buenos Aires, in front of the mausoleum of General Alvear.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 November, Paul von Hindenburg was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} two German armies on the Eastern Front. His Eighth Army was defending East Prussia. It was withdrawn from the frontier to occupy a defensive line. The Russians followed, attacking the line and re-occupying the eastern parts of the province, so its inhabitants fled once again. Hindenburg's Ninth Army, under General August von Mackensen, was {{on the border between}} Poland and Silesia. Intercepted, decoded Russian wireless messages revealed that Silesia would be invaded on 14 November. Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided not to meet the <b>attack</b> <b>head-on,</b> but to seize the initiative by shifting their Ninth Army north by railway to the border south of the German fortress at Thorn, where they would be reinforced with two corps transferred from Eighth Army. The enlarged Ninth Army would then attack the Russian right flank. [...] In ten days Ninth Army was moved north by running 80 trains every day. Conrad von Hotzendorf, the Austrian commander, transferred the Austrian Second Army from the Carpathians to take over the German Ninth Army's former position.|$|E
5000|$|These {{bilateral}} tensions were partly {{moderated by}} {{the web of}} personal relationships that the war spawned between officials in the two governments. As a result, recalled one Canadian diplomat, [...] "there developed a collaboration in international organizations so habitual that it was taken for granted by the 1950s." [...] These officials quickly discovered a mutual interest in making certain that {{the concerns of the}} small and middle powers in the postwar international system were not ignored by the great powers. Canada and Australia, however, differed on how to achieve this. For the Australian prime minister, John Curtin, the solution lay in transforming the Commonwealth into an institution that would rival the major powers in stature and influence. Canadian officials were suspicious of suggestions for closer Commonwealth consultation, which they feared might limit Canada's flexibility in dealing with the United States. Mackenzie King took an even dimmer view of Curtin's ideas. Such notions, he fumed, were part of a [...] "deliberate design... to revive an imperialism which left the Dominions something less than national sovereignty" [...] and represented [...] "an attack on his personal position." [...] The difference in approach was even greater at the United Nations where Evatt enjoyed a free hand in shaping Australian policy. The outspoken and combative foreign minister preferred to <b>attack</b> <b>head-on</b> the privileges enjoyed by the great powers. At the U.N.'s founding conference in San Francisco in 1945, he stubbornly opposed every clause in the U.N.'s charter that seemed to weaken the new organization or that gave the major powers undue influence. While some Canadian officials quietly admired Evatt's determination to strengthen the U.N., most were dismayed by his confrontational tactics. As Cold War tensions reduced the likelihood that the great powers would achieve a sufficient level of cooperation to ensure the survival of the U.N., discretion seemed the greater part of valour.|$|E

40|$|One {{year into}} the Hanford contract, Fluor had learned {{a number of}} hard lessons very quickly. Although the Hanford {{remediation}} contract {{was in many ways}} a new endeavor for Fluor and a different kind of contract, the organization moved quickly to increase communication with all employees, <b>attack</b> <b>head-on</b> what it considered unsafe and inappropriate safety practices, and strongly inject its own corporate cultural beliefs into the Hanford organization. It wasn't easy, and it didn't happen overnight. From the beginning, Fluor established processes and programs to drive down injury rates. For example, whereas the previous contractor's approach to injuries had been passive, Fluor took a much more aggressive approach to worker injuries. The previous contractor had established a practice of sending injured workers home with the basic directive 'to come back when you are well'. Instead of using outsourced medical assessment, Fluor internalized it and evaluated all claims aggressively. Legitimate claims were quickly settled, and management moved to identify 'repeat offenders' when it came to reportable safety incidents. In the first year of Fluor's management, reportable injuries dropped from 5. 37 to 2. 99 per 200, 000 man-hours. Despite the drop in injury rates, the safety record at Fluor Hanford was not at a level that met either Fluor or the Department of Energy's expectations. Earlier in 1997, Fluor Hanford's proposed safety program was rejected by the DOE. The DOE was not satisfied with Fluor Hanford's proposal for various reasons, including insufficient worker involvement and a lack of accountability. With the need for change clearly established, Fluor Hanford management embarked on a decade-long mission to change the safety culture and improve safety performance. This case describes the key changes and their impact on Fluor Hanford...|$|E
50|$|The main {{drawback}} of <b>attacking</b> <b>head-on</b> {{was that}} as the leading British ships approached, the Franco-Spanish fleet {{would be able to}} direct raking broadside fire at their bows, to which they would be unable to reply. To lessen the time the fleet was exposed to this danger, Nelson had his ships make all available sail (including stuns'ls), yet another departure from the norm. He was also well aware that French and Spanish gunners were ill-trained and would have difficulty firing accurately from a moving gun platform. The Combined Fleet was sailing across a heavy swell, causing the ships to roll heavily and exacerbating the problem. Nelson's plan was indeed a gamble, but a carefully calculated one.|$|R
