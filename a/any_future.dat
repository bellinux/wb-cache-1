5|$|After the Festival, the Nimrod was showcased {{for three}} weeks in October at the Berlin Industrial Show, where it also drew crowds, {{including}} the West Germany economics minister Ludwig Erhard. Afterwards, however, as it had served its purpose the Nimrod was dismantled. As the Nimrod was not intended as an entertainment product, it was not followed up by <b>any</b> <b>future</b> games, and Ferranti continued its work on designing general purpose computers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Any</b> <b>future</b> {{renovation}} to {{the stadium}} will involve replacing the old North Stand of the former National Stadium with a new one similar to the three existing stands of the new Millennium Stadium. This will make the stadium bowl-shaped and will increase its capacity to around 80,000. It will resolve the existing problems of deteriorating concrete quality on the old structure in the north stand.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{informed}} Rialto by {{mail that}} he had learned of the two complaints from the Postmaster, arranged for himself to be notified of <b>any</b> <b>future</b> complaints, and arranged to represent Rialto in a hearing before the Postmaster before any sanctions would issue. Burton continued to represent Rialto before the Postmaster, and draw his monthly salary, for five months. Burton's intervention was successful, and the Postmaster's investigation was ceased without the entry of a fraud order.|$|E

If panellists of a Delphi study notice that the study has practical relevance, usability and impact they are typically more ready to provide high quality arguments and judgments.|$|R

5|$|Chamberlain {{decided to}} stand for the House of Commons, and was adopted as Unionist {{candidate}} for Birmingham Ladywood. After the war ended, a general election was called almost immediately. He was elected with almost 70% of the vote {{and a majority of}} 6,833. He was 49 years old, which remains to date the oldest age at which <b>any</b> <b>future</b> Prime Minister has first been elected to the Commons.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{needed to}} fly long {{distances}} to be economically viable; this required high efficiency from the powerplant. Turbofan engines were rejected {{due to their}} larger cross-section producing excessive drag.

5|$|It is also {{conceivable}} that <b>any</b> <b>future</b> {{members of the}} Commonwealth such as applicants (for example South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen) may participate in future games.

5|$|Shortly after Thomas' election, Lanfranc, {{pursuing}} {{a claim that}} Canterbury was the primatial see, or bishopric, of England, demanded that Thomas provide a written oath swearing to obey both Lanfranc and <b>any</b> <b>future</b> Archbishops of Canterbury. Thomas declined {{to make such a}} written promise, so Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. Thomas argued that Lanfranc's demand was unprecedented, as no other Archbishop of York had been required to swear such an oath before. King William wanted clear lines of authority in the church to match the lines of authority in the secular sphere; thus, the King supported Lanfranc in the dispute. Royal pressure induced Thomas to submit to Lanfranc and Thomas was consecrated, but his profession of obedience was made orally to Lanfranc personally and not in writing or to <b>any</b> <b>future</b> archbishops of Canterbury. Although this settled the issue between Thomas and Lanfranc, {{it was the beginning of}} the long-running Canterbury–York dispute over the claims of Canterbury to have jurisdiction over York.|$|E

He could not marry a woman from a family of senatorial rank, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law. <b>Any</b> <b>future</b> children of a freedman would be born free, with full rights of citizenship.|$|E
30|$|A major {{obstacle}} in <b>any</b> <b>futures</b> research {{is related to}} how to incorporate wildcards and weak signals into the analysis. Weak signals are small changes that are currently observable but may only trigger bigger changes in the future. These {{can be incorporated into}} statistical models, where accounting for certain destabilizing events in conjunction with latent structural risk factors may allow for the early-warning of an impending political crisis [47]. Likewise, unexpected outcomes may result from agent-based simulations as emergent phenomena due to micro-level interactions with initially unclear implications.|$|R

5|$|A {{stretch of}} land {{containing}} the later strategic strongholds of Amida (Diyarbakır, Turkey) and Bezabde came under firm Roman military occupation. With these territories, Rome {{would have an}} advance station north of Ctesiphon, and {{would be able to}} slow <b>any</b> <b>future</b> advance of Persian forces through the region. Many cities east of the Tigris came under Roman control, including Tigranokert, Saird, Martyropolis, Balalesa, Moxos, Daudia, and Arzan– though under what status is unclear. At the conclusion of the peace, Tiridates regained both his throne and the entirety of his ancestral claim. Rome secured a wide zone of cultural influence, which led to a wide diffusion of Syriac Christianity from a center at Nisibis in later decades, and the eventual Christianization of Armenia.|$|E
5|$|According to Skeat {{the note}} in the codex {{indicated}} that the manuscript had not previously been in the Patriarchal Library in Alexandria. The manuscript was carried from Constantinople to Alexandria between 1308 and 1316, together with two mentioned above manuscripts of Chrysostom. It remained in Alexandria until 1621, when Cyril removed it once to Constantinople. Whether was originally written, in Constantinople or in Alexandria, is another question. Skeat {{did not try to}} give the answer on this question ("if <b>any</b> <b>future</b> scholar wisches to claim a Constantinopolitan origin for the Codex Alexandrinus, it is at least open to him to do so"). This view was supported by McKendrick, who proposes Ephesian provenance of the codex.|$|E

5|$|After {{some notable}} successes and some early {{failures}} in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was somewhat weakened {{by the fact that}} the United States never officially joined the League and the Soviet Union joined late and only briefly. Germany withdrew from the League, as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed that the League had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent <b>any</b> <b>future</b> world war. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it after the end of the Second World War and inherited several agencies and organisations founded by the League.|$|E
5|$|Another siege {{was mounted}} in 1727 but the Spanish failed to retake Gibraltar, as the British {{were once again}} able to {{reinforce}} and resupply the garrison by sea. Following the siege, the Spanish began the construction in 1730 of the Lines of Contravallation, a fortified structure across the entire width of the isthmus anchored by two major forts on each end. This was intended to block access from Gibraltar to the Spanish mainland, and also {{to serve as a}} base for <b>any</b> <b>future</b> sieges. The territory's importance increased following Britain's defeat in the Battle of Minorca in 1756, when a French naval victory led to the surrender of the British garrison there.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the post-medieval period, the tower was {{deliberately}} damaged to put it beyond military use, a process called slighting. This probably occurred {{towards the end of the}} English Civil War, after the defeat of the Royalist forces in Kent at the Battle of Maidstone. The tower was then owned by Sir John Rayney of Wrotham Place, a Royalist, and would have been an effective lookout tower in <b>any</b> <b>future</b> conflict. There appears to have been an attempt to bring down the whole tower by damaging the stair turret at its base, possibly using gunpowder, which failed due to the spiral staircase's unusually strong design. After this the upper storey of the tower was carefully removed instead, leaving the building roofless.|$|E
