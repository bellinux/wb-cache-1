40|$|This study {{examines}} the additivity of the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) as {{an index of}} the early interactions between vowels <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> when sung. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants were presented with sung vowels. Sixteen percent of stimuli deviated in pitch only, in vowel only, or in both <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> vowel. All three kinds of deviants elicited an MMN of similar amplitude. The MMNs to vowel <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> deviants did not show significant additivity. This suggests that vowel <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> are processed by shared neural substrates at the preattentive level. Journal ArticleSCOPUS: cp. kFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5|$|Robert soon left Avalona {{and sailed}} {{to the island}} of Corfu, which {{surrendered}} because of a small garrison. Having won a bridgehead and a clear path for reinforcements from Italy, he advanced on the city of Dyrrhachium, the capital and chief port of Illyria. The city was well defended on a long, narrow peninsula running parallel to the coast, but separated by marshlands. Guiscard brought his army onto the peninsula <b>and</b> <b>pitched</b> camp outside the city walls. However, as Robert's fleet sailed to Dyrrhachium, it {{was hit by a}} storm and lost several ships.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{made his}} first {{appearance}} as a professional ballplayer in an inter-squad game on March 7, 1914. He played shortstop <b>and</b> <b>pitched</b> the last two innings of a 15–9 victory. In his second at-bat, Ruth hit a long home run to right field; the blast was locally reported to be longer than a legendary shot hit by Jim Thorpe in Fayetteville. Ruth made first appearance against a team in organized baseball in an exhibition game versus the major-league Philadelphia Phillies. Ruth pitched the middle three innings and gave up two runs in the fourth, but then settled down <b>and</b> <b>pitched</b> a scoreless fifth and sixth innings. In {{a game against the}} Phillies the following afternoon, Ruth entered during the sixth inning and did not allow a run the rest of the way. The Orioles scored seven runs {{in the bottom of the}} eighth inining to overcome a 6–0 deficit, and Ruth was the winning pitcher.|$|E

5|$|Wensloff {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career in the}} Arizona–Texas League, pitching for the Class-D, El Paso Texans, a team not affiliated with any major league squad, in 1937. The team included future Major League players Bill Bevens and Milo Candini, and one former Major League player, Jimmy Zinn. Wensloff pitched 34 games that season, going 17–10 with a 4.67 ERA in 233 innings pitched. At {{the end of the}} season, he was the third most successful pitcher in the league in terms of wins <b>and</b> <b>pitched</b> in the eighth highest number of innings.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm {{was nearly}} 30 {{years old when}} he entered the major leagues, <b>and</b> <b>pitched</b> until he was nearly 50. He retired with one of the lowest career earned run averages, 2.52, in {{baseball}} history. After retiring as a player in 1972 Wilhelm held longtime coaching jobs with the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves. He lived in Sarasota, Florida for many years, and died there in 2002.|$|E
5|$|After winning 15 {{games again}} in 1927, Aldridge {{expected}} a raise, but instead Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss traded {{him to the}} New York Giants on February 11, 1928, for Burleigh Grimes, citing Aldridge's 4.25 ERA in 1927 as a reason not {{to give him a}} raise. He held out for much of the year; by the time he returned, he was out of shape <b>and</b> <b>pitched</b> poorly. During the time Aldridge refused to report, Giants manager John McGraw threatened Aldridge with less pay, and at one point tried to trade him to the Cincinnati Reds. After the season, in which Aldridge's record was four wins and seven losses with a 4.83 earned run average after 119 innings pitched, he was sent to the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, Aldridge refused to report and retired from baseball instead. His final game was on August 29, 1928.|$|E

40|$|Perceived {{congruence}} {{between the}} changing patterns of a visual image <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> {{of a sound}} was examined {{by a series of}} rating experiments. Vertical correspondence of direction between the movement of an image <b>and</b> the <b>pitch</b> shift of a sound had a strong effect on the perceived congruence; the combination of a rising image <b>and</b> an ascending <b>pitch,</b> <b>and</b> that of a falling image <b>and</b> a descending <b>pitch,</b> created higher congruence than the alternative combinations. The combination of an enlarging image <b>and</b> an ascending <b>pitch,</b> <b>and</b> that of a reducing image <b>and</b> a descending <b>pitch,</b> also created higher congruence. Furthermore, the combination of a movement sliding from left to right <b>and</b> an ascending <b>pitch,</b> <b>and</b> that of a movement sliding from right to left <b>and</b> a descending <b>pitch,</b> created higher congruence. When the visual transformation pattern was a complex of these three kinds of movements, the vertical direction transformation was the most effective factor in determining congruent pitch pattern. The next most effective transformation factor was the enlarging and reducing image. The transformation of right and left direction movement was not strongly effective in determining the perceived congruence between complex visual movements <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> patterns...|$|R

5|$|Alexios {{advanced}} from Salonica <b>and</b> <b>pitched</b> camp on {{the river}} Charzanes near Dyrrhachium on October 15. He held a war council there and sought advice from his senior officers; among them was George Palaiologos, who had managed to sneak out of the city. A majority of the senior officers, including Palaiologos, urged caution, noting that time was with the Emperor. Alexios, however, favoured an immediate assault, hoping to catch Guiscard's army from the rear, {{while they were still}} besieging the city. Alexios moved his army to the hills opposite the city, planning to attack the Normans the next day.|$|E
5|$|Bob Napolitano, Wilson's {{coach at}} Londonderry High School, noticed Wilson's ability to {{concentrate}} on baseball. Napolitano specifically remembered the first home game of Wilson's senior year, which happened shortly after his father's death. No fewer than 29 professional scouts, all with radar guns, showed up to see him pitch. According to Napolitano, Wilson was completely oblivious to their appearance; he ate and drank in the dugout, warmed up, <b>and</b> <b>pitched</b> a two-hitter while apparently not noticing that scouts were there. The Cleveland Indians offered him a contract straight out of high school, {{but he did not}} sign, opting to attend college instead.|$|E

Casting began in February 2004 and filming took place the following month primarily on the Colonial Street backlot set at Universal Studios. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was watched by 21.6million viewers on its original American broadcast, becoming the most-watched program of the week. The pilot received extremely positive reviews, with critics complimenting the series' tonal diversity. The cast, particularly the four leads and Sheridan, also received praise. The episode won various awards, including three Emmys.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{internal}} air pressure and bottom water {{pressure of the}} buckets, the acceleration of swaying, surging and heaving of platform were determined by the sensors fixed on the platform, as a naval bucket foundation platform for example. The motion rules of heave and sway of bucket foundations are studied with different drafts. The results of this test showed that the added mass coefficient of heave, roll <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> are declined {{with the increase of}} the draft; the natural frequency of heave is constant with different drafts but the roll frequency <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> frequency are consistent with the changes of the draft; the frequency of heave is larger than that of roll <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> but the added mass coefficient of heave is lesser than that of roll <b>and</b> <b>pitch...</b>|$|R
