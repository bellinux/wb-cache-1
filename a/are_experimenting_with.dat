5|$|A {{wide range}} of foreign music styles have been popularized in Madagascar, {{including}} French chanson performed by artists such as Poopy, reggae, gospel music, and pop rock performed by bands such as Green and AmbondronA. Jazz has been popularized by artists such as Nicolas Vatomanga. Malagasy hip hop broke into the mainstream in the mid-nineties and has since skyrocketed to popularity through artists such as Da Hopp and 18,3. More recently bands like Oladad <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> the fusion of hip-hop and traditional Malagasy musical styles and instruments.|$|E

The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. The remake also features new items, additional areas, mini-bosses, difficulty levels, and a rewritten story which explores Samus's past.|$|E
5|$|Cord goes to {{the uranium}} mine to locate Kiefer, but finds him dead. While there, he overhears a {{conversation}} between Chi-Ling Cheung (a secret agent of the People's Republic of China) and Byrdoy Tolstov (a professor in applied physics and chemistry). Tolstov reveals {{that they are not}} mining for uranium, but that they <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> a special compound called tri-nepheline. Tolstov's daughter Alexandria is being held hostage at Security Headquarters (HQ), and Cord rescues her with the help of Chi, who is suspected of being a spy. Afterwards, Cord plants a bug on a secure server and removes a hard drive containing information relating to the VFF. Cord {{goes to the}} Containment Facility to apprehend Nagarov.|$|E

25|$|The above {{methods are}} not {{mutually}} exclusive. It is becoming common for wells to be put through one CSS injection-soak-production cycle to condition the formation prior to going to SAGD production, and companies <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> combining VAPEX with SAGD to improve recovery rates and lower energy costs.|$|E
25|$|China has {{a policy}} of {{universal}} metering, including metering of individual households in apartment complexes, where most urban residents live. Metering in urban areas is now relatively widespread {{with an average of}} 90% connections being metered. Some cities <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> pre-paid debit cards that residents must put into their meters in order to receive service.|$|E
25|$|Vapor Extraction Process (VAPEX) is an in situ technology, {{similar to}} SAGD. Instead of steam, {{hydrocarbon}} solvents are injected into an upper well to dilute bitumen and enables the diluted bitumen to flow into a lower well. It {{has the advantage}} of much better energy efficiency over steam injection, and it does some partial upgrading of bitumen to oil right in the formation. The process has attracted attention from oil companies, who <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> it.|$|E

25|$|While recioto are {{typically}} sweet, {{with high levels}} of residual sugar, the must can be allowed to ferment completely dry. Often producers will label this wine as Amarone, but they may also choose to produce it as Valpolicella DOC wine or even an Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) table wine if they choose to use grape blends outside the DOC requirement. Some producers <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> international varieties and producing dry Amarone style wines from grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon.|$|E
25|$|Vouvray {{produces}} {{more than a}} million cases of wine a year. The traditional style of winemaking in Vouvray is a minimalist approach, often using neutral fermentation vessel such as stainless steel and not submitting the wine to malolactic fermentation. While some winemakers <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> oak, very few wines are made with new oak. Vouvrays are usually bottled early and expected to age in the wine bottle. Sparkling wines are made according to the traditional method and can either be pétillant (semi-sparkling) or mousseux (fully sparkling).|$|E
25|$|To {{generate}} {{a signal that}} is detectable, approximately 50,000 active neurons are needed. Since current dipoles must have similar orientations to generate magnetic fields that reinforce each other, it is often the layer of pyramidal cells, which are situated perpendicular to the cortical surface, that gives rise to measurable magnetic fields. Bundles of these neurons that are orientated tangentially to the scalp surface project measurable portions of their magnetic fields outside of the head, and these bundles are typically located in the sulci. Researchers <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> various signal processing methods {{in the search for}} methods that detect deep brain (i.e., non-cortical) signal, but no clinically useful method is currently available.|$|E

In one example, littleBits implements open-source business models {{by making the}} design files available for the circuit designs in each littleBits module, {{in accordance with the}} CERN Open Hardware License Version 1.2. In another example, Arduino has registered its name as a trademark. Others may manufacture their designs but can't put the Arduino name on them. Thus they can distinguish their products from others by appellation. There are many applicable business models for implementing some open-source hardware even in traditional firms. For example, to accelerate development and technical innovation the photovoltaic industry has experimented with partnerships, franchises, secondary supplier and completely open-source models.|$|E
25|$|The white wines of the Coteaux du Layon, Montlouis-sur-Loire, Savennières, and Vouvray {{are based}} on Chenin blanc and {{are known for their}} high acidity when young and ability to develop and age well. The villages of Sancerre and Pouilly-sur-Loire are known for their crisp and {{herbaceous}} Sauvignon blancs. Some producers in the area <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> oak aging their Sauvignon blanc to give them more rounder and softer appeal. The villages of Bourgueil, Chinon and Saumur are known for their Cabernet franc based wines that range from light and fruity in Saumur to rich and velvety in Chinon. The Muscadet wines from the Pays de la Loire are made from the Melon de Bourgogne grape and are known for their citrus and mineral notes.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Arden {{investigates the}} death chute {{to find the}} empty cart Grace was taken from and inhuman {{footprints}} leading out of the tunnel. He later shows Kit a plaster cast of the footprint, believing it to be alien. He asks Kit if {{he had sex with}} wife Alma (Britne Oldford) and Grace (Lizzie Brocheré) before their abductions, thinking the aliens <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> eugenics. Arden asks Kit's permission to cause his temporary death to see if the aliens return. Kit consents, believing it will allow him to see Alma again. Arden renders Kit dead by a potassium chloride injection, promising to revive him in a few minutes with atropine and epinephrine. Bright light and loud sounds fill the hallways, and Arden leaves Kit to find Pepper (Naomi Grossman) and a naked full-term pregnant Grace.|$|E

25|$|The Barbera grape is {{the most}} widely planted variety {{in all of the}} Piedmont and makes a juicy, muscular red wine that is not as tannic as Barolo and Barbaresco. It is grown in nearly every major wine making region of the Piedmont but seems to do best in the {{southern}} part of the province of Asti in the Nizza DOCG zone. Some producers <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> blending Barbera with Nebbiolo to combine the former's fruitiness with the later's structure. The light fruitiness of wines from the Dolcetto grape has caused some wine writers to describe it as the Italian version of Beaujolais. The wines have a sense of spiciness to them with little acid and tannins. They are able to be drunk relatively young and tend to be the every day drinking wines of the Piedmontese.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern {{part of the}} Sierras, {{from the}} Villa General Belgrano area to the Punilla Valley, was {{generally}} considered to be too cool and humid, following the old Argentine stereotype of hot-desert wine-making. Over the last decade, however, boutique wineries have discovered the potential of the exceptional variety of soils and micro-climates in the area, producing wines that have won significant national awards (some near La Cumbrecita, an alpine town that would have been considered too cool for vines recently). The scale of production remains minimal, but large numbers of new producers <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> grape varieties and techniques to make wines that are significantly different from the stereotypical Mendoza Malbecs, often with great success. The large variation in elevation in the Sierras make them suitable for high-altitude wine experimentation, similar to what producers have done in Mendoza.|$|E
25|$|More and more, architects are {{investigating}} ways that courtyards {{can play a}} role in the development of today's homes and cities. In densely populated areas, a courtyard in a home can provide privacy for a family, a break from the frantic pace of everyday life, and a safe place for children to play. With space at a premium, architects <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> courtyards as a way to provide outdoor space for small communities of people at a time. A courtyard surrounded by 12 houses, for example, would provide a shared park-like space for those families, who could take pride in ownership of the space. Though this might sound like a modern-day solution to an inner city problem, the grouping of houses around a shared courtyard was common practice among the Incas as far back as the 13th century.|$|E

25|$|As of 2007, several {{airlines}} <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> {{base station}} and antenna systems {{installed on the}} airplane, allowing low power, short-range connection of any phones aboard to remain connected to the aircraft's base station. Thus, they would not attempt connection to the ground base stations as during take off and landing. Simultaneously, airlines may offer phone services to their travelling passengers either as full voice and data services, or initially only as SMS text messaging and similar services. The Australian airline Qantas is the first airline to run a test aeroplane in this configuration {{in the autumn of}} 2007. Emirates has announced plans to allow limited mobile phone usage on some flights. However, in the past, commercial airlines have prevented the use of cell phones and laptops, due to the assertion that the frequencies emitted from these devices may disturb the radio waves contact of the airplane.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{publishing}} academic {{journals and}} textbooks {{is a large}} part of an international industry. Critics claim that standardised accounting and profit-oriented policies have displaced the publishing ideal of providing access to all. In contrast to the commercial model, there is non-profit publishing, where the publishing organization is either organised specifically for the purpose of publishing, such as a university press, or is one of the functions of an organisation such as a medical charity, founded to achieve specific practical goals. An alternative approach to the corporate model is open access, the online distribution of individual articles and academic journals without charge to readers and libraries. The pioneers of Open Access journals are BioMed Central and the Public Library of Science (PLoS). Many commercial publishers <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> hybrid models where certain articles or government funded articles are made free due to authors' payment of processing charges, and other articles are available as part of a subscription or individual article purchase.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the wines}} {{produced}} under the Valpolicella DOC are red and usually contain a sizable {{amount of the}} area's most distinguished grape, Corvina. Other grapes used {{in the production of}} Valpolicella wine most often include Rondinella and Corvinone, but also Molinara, Rossignola, Negrara, Barbera, Sangiovese and Bigolona. A few producers <b>are</b> <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> reviving the indigenous grape Oseleta in Valpolicella. The wines are produced {{in a wide variety of}} styles ranging from basic nouveau table wines, full-bodied red wines, sweet dessert wines and even sparkling spumante. The most basic Valpolicella are light-bodied and often served slightly chilled. They have many characteristics similar to a Beaujolais wine and are often noted for their sour cherry flavor. While full-bodied recioto and Amarone styles reach alcohol levels of 15–16%, most Valpolicellas have more moderate alcohol levels around 11%. For wines labeled Valpolicella Superiore the wines must be aged a minimum of one year in wood and reach a minimum alcohol level of 12%.|$|E
