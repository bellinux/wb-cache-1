5|$|The JNA {{launched}} repeated {{assaults on}} Vukovar {{but failed to}} make any progress. Its armour, designed for combat in open country, was barely able to enter Vukovar's narrow streets. Support from regular infantry was lacking, and the TO's poorly trained <b>and</b> <b>motivated</b> troops were inadequate substitutes. The JNA's soldiers appeared to have little {{understanding of how to}} conduct urban operations and its officers displayed slow and reactive decision-making on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Dallas, Texas, to Eddie and Essie Banks on January 31, 1931; he was the second of twelve children. His father, who had worked in {{construction}} and was a warehouse loader for a grocery chain, played baseball for black, semi-professional teams in Texas. As a child, Banks was not very interested in baseball, preferring swimming, basketball and football. His father bought him a baseball glove for less than three dollars at a five and dime store <b>and</b> <b>motivated</b> him with nickels and dimes to play catch. His mother encouraged him to follow one of his grandfathers into {{a career as a}} minister.|$|E
5|$|In March 2000, he {{left for}} Pakistan with Waleed and Ahmed al-Nami; later, {{they went on to}} Afghanistan. Wail al-Shehri {{followed}} the standard path for new al-Qaeda recruits in Afghanistan, spending time in the Khalden training camp and then Al Farouq training camp near Kandahar. Details on how the non-pilot ("muscle") hijackers were chosen for the September 11 attacks are vague, though the hijackers appear to have been selected by senior al-Qaeda leaders in 2000 from the thousands of recruits at training camps in Afghanistan. The most capable <b>and</b> <b>motivated</b> volunteers were at al-Farouq, and Saudi citizens were good candidates, since it would be easy for them to obtain visas to travel to the United States. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet later said that the muscle hijackers were probably told little about their mission in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1967, the 4th Infantry Division's 1st and 2nd Brigades {{conducting}} Operation Francis Marion {{in western}} Kon Tum Province were making heavy contact with PAVN forces. These contacts prompted division commander Lieutenant General William R. Peers to request reinforcement and, as a result, on 17 June, two battalions of Brigadier General John R. Deane's 173rd Airborne Brigade were {{moved into the}} Dak To area to begin sweeping the jungle-covered mountains in Operation Greeley. The 173rd had been operating near Bien Hoa Air Base outside Saigon and had been in combat only against Viet Cong guerrillas. Prior to its deployment to the highlands, Peers' operations officer, Colonel William J. Livsey, attempted to warn the Airborne officers of the hazards of campaigning in the highlands. He also advised them that PAVN regulars were a much better equipped <b>and</b> <b>motivated</b> force than the Viet Cong. These warnings, however, made little impression on the paratroopers, who were about to become victims of their own overconfidence.|$|E
5|$|Khánh {{soon came}} to {{dominate}} the MRC. He {{turned out to be}} far more politically astute <b>and</b> <b>motivated</b> than the previous junta, seeking out veteran Vietnamese politicians and technocrats to create a new government. A week after taking power, Khánh summoned Dr. Nguyen Ton Hoan, a Catholic {{who was one of the}} former leaders of the southern branch of the Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam). Hoan had been exiled in Paris during the Diệm era, but remained active, publishing a magazine and keeping up to speed with developments in Vietnam. Hoan had generated little popular following during his campaign for power in the 1940s and 1950s and was unable to form a government as prime minister when he returned. Khánh thereupon decided to act as both Prime Minister and Chairman of the reorganized MRC, which he expanded to include 17 generals and 32 further officers for a total of 50 members. Hoan was appointed as the first Deputy Prime Minister in charge of rural pacification. He was given control of five ministries including the Interior, National Defense and Rural Affairs and two special commissions, which were primarily engaged in consolidating the strategic hamlets of Ngô Đình Nhu into the renamed New Rural Life Hamlets. The second Deputy Prime Minister was Harvard University-trained banker and economist Nguyễn Xuân Oánh, who was associated to the Đại Việt. Oanh was charged with managing the finance and economy of the country. Mậu was the Third Deputy Prime Minister, overseeing social and cultural affairs. Other Đại Việt politicians given cabinet posts included Phan Huy Quát as foreign minister and Ha Thuc Ky as interior minister. However, the second most powerful member of the new regime was Khiêm, who was defense minister, and Khánh firmly controlled the civilian government through the junta, which he rearranged to give greater weight to his fellow coup-plotters.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{his life}} Gregory faced stark choices. Should he pursue studies as a rhetor or philosopher? Would a monastic life be more {{appropriate}} than public ministry?

During 1869-85, they served as appointed agents on numerous reservations and superintendencies in a mission centered on moral uplift and manual training. Their ultimate goal of acculturating the Indians to American culture was not reached because of frontier land hunger and Congressional patronage politics.|$|E
