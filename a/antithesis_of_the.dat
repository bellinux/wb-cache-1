25|$|Near Kirkhill outside Stewarton {{are several}} farms having the name 'Kilbride' in their title. Bride - an anglicization of Brìghde, Brìd or Saint Brigid - was {{originally}} the Celtic Goddess {{linked with the}} festival of Imbolc, {{the eve of the}} first of February. She was the goddess of Spring and was associated with healing and sacred wells, therefore the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carlin or Cailleach.|$|E
25|$|The first, {{introduced}} by the priest Chōgen, was based on Song Dynasty architecture and represented the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simple and traditional wayō style. The Nandaimon at Tōdai-ji and the Amida Hall at Jōdo-ji are the only extant examples of this style. Originally called , because {{it had nothing to}} do with India it was rechristened by scholar Ōta Hirotarō during the 20th century, and the new term stuck. Ōta derived the name from Chōgen's work, particularly Tōdai-ji's Daibutsuden.|$|E
25|$|During {{the history}} of slavery in the United States, most African Americans styled their hair {{in an attempt to}} mimic the styles of the {{predominantly}} white society in which they lived. Afro-textured hair, characterized by its tight kinks, has been described as being kinky, coarse, cottony, nappy, or woolly. These characteristics represented the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European American standard of beauty, and led to a negative view of kinky hair. As a result, the practice of straightening gained popularity among African Americans.|$|E

As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plan, he takes human form and runs an {{operation}} in Las Vegas that sees him create several clones of X-23 and bond them to genetically created symbiotes. After Ghost Rider accidentally transports Hell to Las Vegas, Blackheart is confronted by the Ghost Rider, Venom, Red Hulk, and X-23, and summons four creatures that represent <b>the</b> <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four and sets them against the heroes.|$|R
25|$|Dews play {{a crucial}} role in <b>the</b> cosmogonic drama <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian view of {{creation}} completed in the 12th century. In this text, the evil spirit Ahriman (the middle Persian equivalent of Avestan Angra Mainyu) creates his hordes of dews to counter <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> Ormuzd (Avestan Ahura Mazda). This notion is already alluded to in the Vendidad (see Younger Avestan texts above), but only properly developed in the Bundahishn. In particular, Ahriman is seen to create six dews that in Zoroastrian tradition are <b>the</b> <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amahraspands (Avestan Amesha Spentas).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reflects}} {{research on}} <b>the</b> semantic structure <b>of</b> <b>antitheses.</b> <b>The</b> thesis being proposed is that <b>the</b> defining quality <b>of</b> <b>antitheses</b> was {{implemented by the}} Syrian church father Ephrem as a rhetoric technique to enhance <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> arguments in his hymns. Examples are being investigated to explain <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> <b>antitheses</b> in <b>the</b> surface structure <b>of</b> some of his arguments...|$|R
25|$|A takkanah is an {{enactment}} which (1) revises {{an ordinance}} {{that no longer}} satisfies {{the requirements of the}} times or circumstances, or which (2), being deduced from a Biblical passage, may be regarded as new. It is, therefore, the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gezerah. Takkanot were framed even in the time of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, those of unknown origin being ascribed to earlier leaders, and they have been promulgated at all subsequent periods of Jewish history. The term is applied also to the institution provided for in the enactment.|$|E
25|$|While the Elvish {{languages}} {{remained at}} the center of Tolkien's attention, the requirements of the narratives associated with Middle-earth also necessitated the development at least superficially of the languages of other races, especially of Dwarves and Men, but also the Black Speech designed by Sauron, the main antagonist in The Lord of the Rings. This latter language was designed to be the ostensible <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideal of an artistic language pursued with the development of Quenya, the Black Speech representing a dystopian parody of an international auxiliary language just as Sauron's rule over the Orcs is a dystopian parody of a totalitarian state.|$|E
25|$|The {{plethora of}} {{religious}} names {{in this area}} – the Kirkmuirs, Kirkhill, Lady Moss, High Cross, Canaan and the Kilbrides, suggest {{that at some point}} in the distant past a pre-Christian and Christian site was located here. No documentary evidence appears to survive and the earliest record is for Kirkry in 1654, now Kilbride. Bride, Brigit or St. Brigid was originally a Celtic Goddess linked with the festival of Imbolc, the eve of the first of February. She was the goddess of spring and was associated with healing and sacred wells. Interestingly the Carlin Stone at Commoncrags in Dunlop is associated with the 'old winter hag', the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goddess Bride. The name Canaan at Kirkmuir was in use as early as 1779. In 1922 James Martin and Mary Gilmour purchased Gillmill and Canaan from the Cunninghames of Lainshaw.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{primordial}} Baphomet, Erathis claimed <b>the</b> patronship <b>of</b> {{his former}} creations, the Minotaurs. Erathis is closely allied to Pelor, Ioun and Moradin, and {{is perhaps the}} only god who is on cordial terms with Asmodeus, since tyranny and dystopia are some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forms that civilization can take. As <b>the</b> goddess <b>of</b> civilization, she is <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> Melora, <b>the</b> embodiment <b>of</b> wilderness.|$|R
40|$|Following a {{trajectory}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virtual/material dichotomy as it {{stems from a}} classicist position of a mind/body and male/female split, I propose feminist theory as a potent tool to effectively analyze <b>the</b> artistic implications <b>of</b> virtual materiality.

2500|$|Religious themes have {{inspired}} many environmentalists as they contemplate the pristine West before the frontiersmen violated its spirituality. Actually, as historian William Cronon has demonstrated, <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> [...] "wilderness" [...] was highly negative and <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> religiosity before <b>the</b> romantic movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century.|$|R
25|$|However, Carol II {{himself was}} highly hostile to antisemitism. His lover, Elena Lupescu, was Jewish, as {{were a number}} of his friends in government, and he soon reverted to his {{original}} policies (that is, fiercely opposing the antisemites and fascists), but with a newly violent sting. On February 12, 1938, he used the rising violence between political groups as context to seize absolute power (a move which was tacitly supported by the liberals who had come to view him as a lesser evil in comparison to Codreanu's fascist movement). As an authentic Romanian nationalist (albeit, one who had a view of a Westernized, forcefully industrialized Romania {{at the expense of the}} peasants whom he viewed with disdain; making him completely the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> views of Codreanu), Carol was determined that Romania should not fall into the near-absolute economic and political control that many of its neighbors already had, and moved to theatrical resistance against Nazi ideology.|$|E
25|$|Under his presidency, the AAPR {{launched}} a heavily pro-Puerto Rican campaign, on occasion crossing political lines {{to support a}} certain cause. One of these instances was joining several multi-sectorial protests against Via Verde, an oleoduct that may damage the natural resources of Puerto Rico's karst region. Santiago also led an activity for the entity in Comerío, where he was joined by other prominent figures such as Luis Gutiérrez, to support {{the release of the}} last Puerto Rican political prisoner, Oscar López. The AAPR also engaged in regular practices. Santiago personally opposed the revocation of a legal agreement reached between all of the municipalities and the Autoridad de Energia Electrica (AEE), which would endanger the availability of the electrical grid to smaller towns. The entity also reclaimed a direct line to guarantee education funds. In his role as spokesman, Santiago was also responsible for denouncing disparity in the assignment of funds between PPD and PNP municipalities. The AAPR decided to boycott official activities under the PNP administration to express their contempt at these actions. Santiago has also directly opposed his <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PNP's Federación de Alcaldes de Puerto Rico (FAPR), Héctor O'Neill, most notably when a large scale fraud took place in Guaynabo's District 6 primary, which was schemed from within the municipality's government structure.|$|E
500|$|In 1937, Polish {{historian}} Wanda Dobrowolska, {{wrote in}} her Polish Biographical Dictionary entry on Chodkiewicz {{that he was one}} of the chief members of the [...] "Great Hetman era", renowned for his talent as a strategist and organizer. She notes that Chodkiewicz possessed an iron will, which he was able to impose on the troops under his command, and that he was an efficient commander, although more respected and feared than beloved by his troops. Dobrowolska notes that he was an energetic and explosive <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composed Żółkiewski, another great hetman of this era, whom Chodkiewicz disliked and competed with throughout his life.|$|E
2500|$|Courts in non-Muslim {{majority}} {{nations have}} generally ruled against <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> sharia, both in jurisprudence {{and within a}} community context, based on sharia's religious background. In Muslim nations, sharia has wide support with some exceptions.

500|$|The {{late nineteenth}} century also brought the {{systematic}} study of color theory, and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other. These studies were avidly followed by artists such as Vincent van Gogh. Describing his painting, The Night Cafe, to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: [...] "I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most different reds and greens." ...|$|E
500|$|Silverman {{mentions}} {{that he became}} in an [...] "archetypal figure of the Belle Époque", a [...] "handsome monsieur with a beard" [...] (joli monsieur avec une barbe) admired by Félicien Rops, and an [...] "elegant storyteller" [...] (l'élégant conteur) according to Anatole France. Silverman notes a contrast between the snobbish, dandy and reactionary side of Uzanne {{with a penchant for}} forgotten authors of the 17th and 18th centuries, and he, in turn, was an innovative artist and bibliophile, the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antique collectors of the [...] "old guard", formed by bibliophiles—mostly aristocrats—who organised the Société des Bibliophiles François. Uzanne spent his last years in his apartment in Saint-Cloud, where he died on 21 October 1931. His remains were cremated at the crematorium and cemetery Père Lachaise.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Widmerpool is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Anthony Powell's novel sequence A Dance to the Music of Time, a 12-volume account of upper-class and bohemian [...] life in Britain between 1920 and 1970. Regarded by critics {{as one of}} the more memorable characters of 20th century fiction, Widmerpool is the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequence's narrator-hero Nicholas Jenkins. Initially presented as a comic, even pathetic figure, he becomes increasingly formidable, powerful and ultimately sinister as the novels progress. [...] He is successful in business, in the army and in politics, and is awarded a life peerage. His only sphere of failure is his relationships with women, exemplified by his disastrous marriage to Pamela Flitton. The sequence ends with Widmerpool's downfall and death, in circumstances arising from his involvement with a New Age-type cult.|$|E
40|$|Masterplanning {{is having}} a major effect on development, {{especially}} in Britain, Europe and the USA, though the theoretical base is ill-defined and process has received little research attention.

40|$|Despite recent {{recognition}} that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program acts in a dynamic manner (termed Epithelial to Mesenchymal Plasticity or EMP) during carcinoma metastasis, it has largely been ignored in the discovery and development of EMT-targeted therapies. In part, this has stemmed {{from a lack of}} preclinical models that can mimic the full dynamic nature <b>of</b> EMP and <b>the</b> perception that the EMT-reverting transition [or mesenchymal-epithelial reverting transition; (MErT) ] is a mere <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> EMT. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> this study was to develop the first PCa model capable <b>of</b> recapitulating <b>the</b> dynamic nature <b>of</b> EMP...|$|R
50|$|Benjie’s other {{influence}} is Mr. Cohen (David Groh) who {{is concerned that}} Nigeria’s over-emphasis on African history and desire to rid <b>the</b> school <b>of</b> white staff are wrong, a sort <b>of</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> racial harmony. <b>The</b> conflict between these two polar opposites in belief, a tug-of-war over education, history, and white privilege, plays a larger end-game role in the story {{as we see it}} unfold before Benji’s eyes.|$|R
500|$|Vogue {{stated in}} 2014 that [...] "Cobain pulled liberally from {{both ends of}} a woman’s and a man’s wardrobe, and his Seattle thrift-store look ran the gamut of {{masculine}} lumberjack workwear and 40s-by-way-of-70s feminine dresses. It was completely counter to the shellacked, flashy aesthetic of the 1980s in every way. In disheveled jeans and floral frocks, he softened the tough exterior of the archetypal rebel from the inside out, and set the ball in motion for a radical, millennial idea of androgyny." [...] Cobain's way of dressing [...] "was the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> macho American man", because he [...] "...made it cooler to look slouchy and loose, no matter {{if you were a}} boy or a girl." [...] Music and culture writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd wrote that with Cobain's style of dress “Not only did he make it okay to be a freak, he made it desirable." ...|$|E
500|$|The film is Spielberg's {{third on}} the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Producer and {{longtime}} collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. [...] "When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. [...] Now, he's telling that story." [...] Spielberg stated that he just {{thought it would be fun}} to make a [...] "really scary film with really scary aliens", something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.|$|E
500|$|Since its release, [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from journalists and music critics. Journalist Robert Christgau described the pairing of McCartney and Jackson as [...] "Michael's worst idea since [...] "Ben"".

Jackson's breakdown with [...] the [...] "irrepressibly silly Paul McCartney" [...] was [...] "disarmingly goofy", according to Stylus Magazine. Salon.com later described [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] as a [...] "sappy duet". They concluded that McCartney had become a [...] "wimpy old fart". The song garnered a favourable review from Jackson's biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli. The writer stated that the song was [...] "cute" [...] but lacked substance. He added that the track had a [...] "middle-of-the-road calm" [...] and was the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "rambunctious" [...] "Beat It".|$|E
2500|$|This {{collection}} is almost <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> Cántico. [...] <b>The</b> continued optimism and delight {{in life that}} the poet had shown despite the upheavals in his personal life and <b>the</b> turmoil <b>of</b> world events must have begun to seem an inadequate response.

500|$|The Daibutsu {{style and}} the Zen style emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century. The Daibutsu or Great Buddha style, {{introduced}} by the priest Chogen, was based on Song Dynasty architecture and represented the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wayō style. The Nandaimon at Tōdai-ji and the Amida Hall at Jōdo-ji are the only extant examples of this style. Characteristics of the Zen style are earthen floors, subtly curved pent roofs (mokoshi) and pronouncedly curved main roofs, [...] windows and panelled doors. Examples of this style include Butsuden at Kōzan-ji in Shimonoseki, Shakadō at Zenpuku-in and Octagonal Three-storied Pagoda at Anraku-ji. The three Japanese styles, wayō, Daibutsu and Zen were combined in the Muromachi period giving rise to a conglomerate eclectic style represented by the main hall at Kakurin-ji. By {{the end of the}} Muromachi period (late 16th century), Japanese Buddhist architecture had reached its apogee. Construction methods had been perfected and building types conventionalized. Early pre-modern temples were saved from monotony by elaborate structural details, the use of undulating karahafu gables and monumental size of the buildings. Representative examples for Momoyama (1568–1603) and Edo period (1603–1868) temple architecture are the Karamon at Hōgon-ji and the main hall of Kiyomizu-dera respectively.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Raymond Wilson {{published}} a book called Jenner of George Street: Sydney's Soul-Winning Sailor {{in an attempt to}} tell the story of Jenner's life accurately. Jenner's family had been finding it painful to have alternate accounts of Jenner's life circulating around the world, so they gave Wilson all the information he desired. Wilson wrote that Jenner was [...] "eccentric... the very <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'wise', 'mighty', and 'noble'," [...] but that his life was therefore a good demonstration of 2 Corinthians 12:9, which states that God's [...] "power is made perfect in weakness." [...] Wilson wrote that Jenner's question of [...] "heaven or hell" [...] was very similar to that of Arthur Stace, another Australian street evangelist who wrote the word [...] "Eternity" [...] on the sidewalks so people would consider where they would be in eternity. Wilson called Jenner a battler and did not recommend that his readers emulate Jenner's evangelistic activities [...] "unless Divinely fitted in a similar way." [...] Wilson wrote that he [...] "travelled and corresponded widely to ascertain the facts of the story" [...] and that he personally verified the accuracy of the information by retrieving first-hand accounts from all of the major figures in Jenner's life. The people Wilson interviewed included Nancy Dixon; Ann and Angus Carruthers, Jenner's daughter and son-in-law; Murray Wilkes; Ian Boyden; Tas McCarthy; Peter Culver; Noel Stanton; and Mary Stares.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{considered}} by critics {{to be an}} <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous Tintin ventures. Michael Farr, author of Tintin: The Complete Companion, stated that in The Castafiore Emerald, Hergé permits Haddock to remain at home in Marlinspike, an ideal that the [...] "increasingly travel weary" [...] character had long cherished, further stating that if Hergé had decided to end the Tintin series, The Castafiore Emerald would have been [...] "a suitable final volume". He compared the story to the detective novels by Agatha Christie, in that the narrative was [...] "littered {{from start to finish}} with clues, most of which are false", misleading both Tintin and the reader. He felt that in setting the story entirely at Marlinspike, Hergé [...] "deliberately broke the classic adventure mould he had created", and in doing so [...] "succeeded in creating a masterpiece {{in the manner of a}} well constructed stage comedy or farce". Farr viewed the volume as [...] "a tour de force", noting that it was quite dissimilar to any other instalment in The Adventures of Tintin. As such, he felt that it would have been a suitable story on which to end the series. As a result of its [...] "experimental, exceptional nature", Farr believed that The Castafiore Emerald [...] "never gained the public recognition it merits", stating that while attracting [...] "a loyal following" [...] it had not become one of the most popular Adventures of Tintin, something that he thought was [...] "unjust".|$|E
