5|$|In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials {{have been}} found on Arran, {{although}} not Bute and place name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. On the mainland coast there is cluster of Norse place names around Largs and <b>an</b> <b>ornate</b> silver brooch was found on a hillside near Hunterston that is of likely 7th-century Irish origin but with a 10th-century runic inscription. Five Hogback monuments found in Govan hint at Scandinavian enclaves inland.|$|E

5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended {{to be placed on}} the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated the need for <b>an</b> <b>ornate</b> external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} also {{continues to}} be honoured in the United States as an antecedent of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights. In 1976, the UK lent one of four surviving originals of the 1215 Magna Carta to the United States for their bicentennial celebrations and also donated <b>an</b> <b>ornate</b> display case for it.

5|$|Garrick {{commissioned}} Robert Adam and {{his brother}} James to renovate the theatre's interior, which they did in 1775. Their additions included <b>an</b> <b>ornate</b> ceiling and a stucco facade facing Bridges Street. This facade {{was the first time}} any structure that might be considered part of the theatre proper actually abutted the street: the building, like the 1663 original, had been built in the centre of the block, hemmed in by other structures. The narrow passage from Bridges street to the theatre now became an interior hallway; some theatre office space also went up behind the new facade.|$|E
5|$|In 1826 <b>an</b> <b>ornate</b> {{range was}} erected by St Mary Hall in the Gothic Revival style, {{incorporating}} the old gate of St Mary Hall, {{on the west}} side of the quad. Designed by Daniel Robertson, it contains two quite ornate oriels placed asymmetrically, one is of six lights, the other four. They are the best example of the pre-archaeological Gothic in Oxford. The large oriel on the first floor at the north end was once the drawing room window of the Principal of the Hall. Parts of the street wall incorporated into this range show traces of blocked windows dating from the same period of rebuilding in the 15th century as the present-day staircase ten.|$|E

5|$|Stela 2 is a {{monument}} {{in the early}} Maya style that is inscribed with a damaged Long Count date. Due to its only partial preservation, this date has at least three possible readings, the latest of which would place it in the 1st century BC. Flanking the text are two standing figures facing each other, the sculpture probably represents one ruler receiving power from his predecessor. Above the figures and the text is <b>an</b> <b>ornate</b> figure depicted in profile {{looking down at the}} left-hand figure below. Stela2 is located in front of the retaining wall of Terrace5.|$|E
5|$|The Ashford Green Corridor is {{a linear}} park {{alongside}} {{the two main}} rivers through the town, which is protected from development by lying on the main flood plain. Most of the area covered by the park {{has been marked by}} Ashford Borough Council as a nature reserve. This area includes Victoria Park, which lies to the immediate south of the town centre and the railway. It includes <b>an</b> <b>ornate</b> fountain first shown at the 2nd International Exhibition in London in 1862, and presented to the park by George Harper on 24 July 1912. The Coningbrook Lakes Country Park opened on a former quarry site to the northeast of town in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Charing Cross Hotel, {{designed}} by Edward Middleton Barry, opened on 15 May 1865 {{and gave the}} station <b>an</b> <b>ornate</b> frontage in the French Renaissance style. It had 250 bedrooms spread over seven floors and extended along Villiers Street {{as well as the}} front of the Strand. The public rooms had balconies overlooking the main station concourse. It quickly became popular and was profitable, leading to a 90-bedroom annexe {{on the other side of}} Villiers Street opening in 1878. A bridge over the street connected the two parts of the hotel together.|$|E
