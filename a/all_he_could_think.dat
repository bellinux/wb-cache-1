500|$|The {{majority}} of the episode—like the rest of seasons six, seven, eight and nine—was filmed {{in and around the}} Los Angeles, California area. Before shooting the episode, Chris Carter reminded Patrick various times that he had to be in [...] "good shape". On the audio commentary, Patrick remembers being [...] "nervous" [...] for the shooting of the episode, since he was a big fan of The X-Files before becoming a part of the acting crew. The scene in which Walter Skinner tells Doggett that he himself witnessed Mulder being taken away aboard a UFO was filmed {{in the second part of}} Patrick's first night of production on the series; this scene also marked the first time that Patrick got to work with Pileggi. The ending of the episode, as well as a {{majority of}} its follow-up [...] "Without" [...] were filmed at Split Mountain in Anza-Borrego State Park. According to producer Paul Rabwin, an [...] "incredible heat wave" [...] hit the area during the shooting, resulting in terrible filming conditions. In the desert, the cast and crew were informed that there was a [...] "one in twenty-five" [...] chance that someone would be bit by a rattlesnake. Pileggi later joked that during the filming of his scenes <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> about was stumbling upon a snake.|$|E
500|$|A comment he {{made during}} the debate became another {{campaign}} issue for Thompson. He again apologized for remarks, this time over an {{answer to a question}} in which he stated that he believed the decision to fire a gay worker based on the morals of the employer is something that should be [...] "left up to the individual business." [...] A few days following the debate, the candidate rescinded the comments, and blamed the gaffe on a malfunctioning hearing aid, stating that he [...] "didn't hear the question." [...] Thompson also said that he was sick during the debate, having been hospitalized three days earlier with the flu and bronchitis, and that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> about [...] "was getting off the stage." [...] Campaign adviser Steve Grubbs would later point to this episode as the moment Thompson's campaign became [...] "unrecoverable." [...] Thompson was harshly criticized for the remarks. Jason Stephany, the political director of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, rhetorically asked [...] "How many times is he going to say something that's completely offensive to the majority of Americans before people start to say, 'What's going on here?'" [...] Thompson tried to reassure the public that there was [...] "nothing discriminatory about [...] at all." [...] Afterwards, he finished second in a poll of state convention members from Wisconsin, with 84 of the 306 members polled, trailing Fred Thompson who received 95 votes. He stood at 16% in an average of statewide polls for the state in May, and stood at 4.3% in Iowa, where he based his campaign.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the leg, {{the band}} members were having trouble {{adjusting}} to their newfound fame as virtually every concert on the tour was sold out and Mother's Milk approached 500,000 units sold. Spin reported that following a show in Atlanta, Flea invited a woman to his hotel room for sexual intercourse, but locked himself in the bathroom upon arriving because <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of were his wife and daughter. Kiedis ended a two-year long relationship with actress Ione Skye, and Frusciante, looking back on the tour years later, admitted, [...] "I was totally abusing the situation [...] partying and screwing a bunch of girls. At 19, I might have looked like a stud but I was a weakling inside. I wasn't proud of who I was then." [...] Shortly before {{the end of the}} North American leg, the band filmed a performance at the Long Beach Arena, which was released as Psychedelic Sexfunk Live from Heaven in 1990. A concert at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium on New Year's Eve 1989 attracted over 10,000 attendees and was considered by band photographer Tony Woolliscroft to be [...] "the biggest [...] I had seen them play at that point. It gave me a handle on how hard the band had worked in the USA in the years prior to this." [...] The tour continued in the United Kingdom, where the band was receiving less attention; Kiedis complained after several shows there, [...] "We're huge in the States and it's sort of frustrating and confusing that no one knows who we are here." [...] It was not until after their return from the UK that [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] was released as a single and subsequently charted at number twenty-nine there. In March 1990, the band was asked to perform on MTV's coverage of Spring break in Florida. At the event, Flea and Smith attempted to engage the audience by jumping from the stage; the situation got out of hand, and the two were alleged to have sexually assaulted and verbally abused a female audience member. They were arrested several days later on charges of battery, disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit a lascivious act, but released on $2,000 bail. Smith and Flea's arrest worsened Kiedis' impending charge in Virginia from the [...] "Positive Mental Octopus" [...] tour, for which the vocalist was ultimately convicted of sexual battery and indecent exposure and sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000 per charge.|$|E

60|$|Her {{face was}} in shadow now, {{but there was}} a glow-worm light in her {{beautiful}} eyes that seemed faintly to illuminate her whole face. He sank down on the sofa at her side, no longer the brilliant and ambitious politician, but, it seemed to him, as hopelessly a dreaming, inexperienced boy as when he had given her the name that now was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, and the only word that rose to his feverish lips.|$|E
6000|$|March now became deeply {{anxious about}} the dying man, who seemed to him like one sinking in the sea, yet refusing to grasp the rope that was flung to him. He turned over the sacred pages hurriedly to find {{appropriate}} texts, and blamed himself again and again for not having made himself better acquainted with the Word of God. He also repeated <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of from memory; but still the dying {{man shook his head}} and muttered, [...] "Too late!" [...] Suddenly March bent over him and said-- ...|$|E
60|$|After {{that the}} three Rovers and Dick's wife talked the matter over for fully an hour. Dick gave Sam and Tom <b>all</b> the {{particulars}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, and answered innumerable questions. But try their best, {{not one of the}} party could venture a solution of the mystery.|$|R
60|$|The man flushed to {{the roots}} of his hair. <b>All</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of were the ugly words he had spoken a short time before--and now Theriere was dying! Byrne would have laughed had anyone {{suggested}} that he entertained any other sentiment than hatred toward the second officer of the Halfmoon--that is he would have twenty-four hours before; but now, quite unexpectedly, he realized that he didn't want Theriere to die, and then it dawned upon him that a new sentiment had been born within him--a sentiment to which he had been a stranger all his hard life--friendship.|$|R
60|$|This had seemed, though disagreeable, {{straightforward}} and easy enough before the meeting; {{and now that}} it was over <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> why <b>he</b> had not said exactly what he had come there to say. To give him his due, he blamed himself as much as he did his sister; he was very unhappy about it <b>all,</b> but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> how <b>he</b> had been so very stupid.|$|R
60|$|Duane {{returned}} to Fairdale and camped in the mesquite till the twenty-third of the month. The few days seemed endless. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of {{was that the}} hour in which he must disgrace Ray Longstreth was slowly but inexorably coming. In that waiting time he learned what love was and also duty. When the day at last dawned he rode like one possessed down the rough slope, hurdling the stones and crashing through the brush, with a sound in his ears that was not all the rush of the wind. Something dragged at him.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of; but {{he spoke}} without {{obtrusive}} assurance or pronounced embarrassment, and the girl, who shook out her crumpled skirt over one little foot with a swift movement, choked back a sob, and favoured {{him with a}} glance of keen scrutiny as she rose to a sitting posture. She was quick at reading character--the life she led had made that necessary--and his manner and appearance were reassuring. She, however, said nothing, and sitting down on a neighbouring boulder, {{he took out his}} pipe from force of habit.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the young}} woman rattled on she grew more and more glib; she was what they call whopper-jawed, and spoke a {{language}} almost purely consonantal, cutting and clipping her words with a rapid play of her whopper-jaw till {{there was nothing but}} the bare bones left of them. Statira was crying, and Lemuel could not bear to see her cry. He tried to say something to comfort her, but <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was, [...] "I hope you'll get your book back," [...] and 'Manda Grier answered for her---- ...|$|E
60|$|Ralph used <b>all</b> the {{arguments}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of to persuade Bob {{to look at}} the matter in a philosophical light, and it was not until he urged the satisfaction it would give George, when he recovered, to know that he was cleared of the charge, that Bob would even admit {{that he was willing to}} go, although he knew he must do so.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} his name. I've clean {{forgotten}} it; but don't you worry. He {{was anything but}} a friend of yours. <b>He</b> called you <b>all</b> the names <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of. <b>He</b> said you set a lot of scandal going about him once, somewhere--in Bangkok, I think. Yes, that's it. You were running a table d'hote in Bangkok at one time, weren't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{the maid}} {{was gone and}} he {{was alone in the}} tiny hall, where the light was dim from one pearly-shaded sconce, and walls, carpet, {{everything}} was silvery, making the walled-in space <b>all</b> ghostly, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>think</b> ridiculously: 'Shall I go in with my overcoat on, or take it off?' The music ceased; the maid said from the doorway: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then it {{was your}} sister I told--yes, it was. Well, you know I have not seen him for many years, and {{naturally}} I had quite forgotten his admiration of me in old times. But guess my surprise when the day before yesterday, I received a mysterious note bearing no address, and found on opening it that it came from him. The contents frightened {{me out of my}} wits. He had returned from Canada to his father's house, and conjured me by <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of to meet him at once. But I think I can repeat the exact words, though I will show it to you when we get indoors.|$|E
60|$|After {{leaving the}} Garth, Foster went to Carlisle, where he bought small {{articles}} at different shops {{and had them}} sent to his hotel, addressed to Featherstone. He also asked if any letters for his partner had come, and then, having done <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of to give his pursuers a hint, waited {{to see what would}} happen. He imagined that since Daly seemed to be well provided with money he would not undertake the search alone, and there were private inquiry agents who would help him. The services of these gentlemen would not be cheap, and Foster wondered if the fellow knew that there was not very much to be extorted from Featherstone. This, however, was Daly's business, and seeing no result from his experiment, he resolved to leave Carlisle.|$|E
60|$|He was now sadly {{exercised}} on {{the subject}} of his uncle's will. There had as yet been no pressing reasons for a full and candid reply to the solicitor who had communicated with him, owing {{to the fact that the}} payments were not to begin till Swithin was one-and-twenty; but time was going on, and something definite would have to be done soon. To own to his marriage and consequent disqualification for the bequest was easy in itself; but it involved telling at least one man what both Viviette and himself had great reluctance in telling anybody. Moreover he wished Viviette to know nothing of his loss in making her his wife. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of doing for the present was to write a postponing letter to his uncle's lawyer, and wait events.|$|E
50|$|In other words, he {{observed}} that, in <b>all</b> the cases <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, κ-categoricity {{at any one}} uncountable cardinal implied κ-categoricity at all other uncountable cardinals. This observation spurred {{a great amount of}} research into the 1960s, eventually culminating in Michael Morley's famous result that these are in fact the only possibilities. The theory was subsequently extended and refined by Saharon Shelah in the 1970s and beyond, leading to stability theory and Shelah's more general programme of classification theory.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} Reddy lay there licking his chops and saying <b>all</b> the things <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of to frighten poor Danny Meadow Mouse. At last he grew tired of this and {{made up his mind}} {{that it was time to}} end it and Danny Meadow Mouse at the same time. He thrust his sharp nose in at the opening in the end of the old can, but the opening was too small for him to get more than his nose in, and he only {{scratched}} it on the sharp edges without so much as touching Danny.|$|R
60|$|One time a knook became {{tired of}} his {{beautiful}} life and longed {{for something new}} to do. The knooks have more wonderful powers than any other immortal folk--except, perhaps, the fairies and ryls. So one would suppose that a knook who might gain anything he desired by a simple wish could not be otherwise than happy and contented. But such {{was not the case}} with Popopo, the knook we are speaking of. He had lived thousands of years, and had enjoyed <b>all</b> the wonders <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of. Yet life had become as tedious to him now as it might be to one who was unable to gratify a single wish.|$|R
6000|$|Reddy sneaked {{away without}} even a look at Farmer Brown's hen-house. He didn't see that the door had {{carelessly}} been left open, {{and even if he}} had, it would have made no difference. He hadn't a bit of appetite. No, Sir. Reddy Fox wouldn't have eaten the fattest chicken there if it had been right before him. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was that queer story told by Peter Rabbit and Unc' Billy Possum, and the scrape he had got himself into by his foolish boasting. He just wandered about restlessly, waiting for daybreak and hoping that something would turn up to prevent him from going to Prickly Porky's hill. He didn't dare to tell old Granny Fox about it. He knew just what she would say. It seemed as if he could hear her sharp voice and the very words: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had no time}} to think. He {{had no time to}} calculate. His wrath {{was still}} hot, though rapidly cooling down before this awful discovery. Hide it! Hide it! Hide it! That was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think.</b> He lifted the body in his arms, as easily as most men would lift a baby. Then he laid it down among the brambles close beside the stream. Something heavy fell out of the pocket as he carried it. The {{barrister}} took no heed. Little matter for that. He laid it down in fear and trembling. As soon as it was hidden, he fled for his life. By trackless ways, he walked over the Moor, and returned to Ivybridge unseen very late in the evening. Ten minutes after he left the spot, Guy Waring passed by and picked up the pocket-book.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, but {{he spoke}} without {{obtrusive}} assurance or pronounced embarrassment; and the girl, shaking out her crumpled skirt over one little foot, with a swift sinuous movement, choked back a sob and favored {{him with a}} glance of keen scrutiny as she rose to a sitting posture. She was quick at reading character--the life she led had made that necessary--and his manner and appearance were reassuring. He was on the whole a well-favored man--good-looking seemed the best word for it--though what impressed her most was his expression. It indicated that he regarded her with some pity, not as an attractive young woman, which she knew she was, but merely as a human being. The girl, however, said nothing; and, sitting down on a neighboring boulder, Vane took out his pipe from force of habit.|$|E
60|$|There {{was much}} {{more of the same}} kind, in which Frank said <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of to lessen his father's regrets. In their {{conversation}} not a word was spoken about Mary Thorne. Frank was not aware whether or no his father had been told of the great family danger which was dreaded in that quarter. That he had been told, we may surmise, as Lady Arabella was not wont to confine the family dangers to her own bosom. Moreover, Mary's presence had, of course, been missed. The truth was, that the squire had been told, with great bitterness, of what had come to pass, and all the evil had been laid at his door. He it had been who had encouraged Mary to be regarded almost as a daughter of the house of Greshamsbury; he it was who taught that odious doctor--odious in all but his aptitude for good doctoring--to think himself a fit match for the aristocracy of the county. It had been his fault, this great necessity that Frank should marry money; and now it was his fault that Frank was absolutely talking of marrying a pauper.|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{he hurried}} forward the perplexed clergyman, who in vain made <b>all</b> the excuses <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of {{in order to}} effect his escape {{from the scene of}} gaiety, in which he was so {{unexpectedly}} involved. He pleaded headache; and his friend assured him that a mouthful of food, and a glass of wine, would mend it. He stated he had business; and Touchwood replied that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have none but composing his next sermon, and reminded him that it was two days till Sunday. At length, Mr. Cargill confessed that he had some reluctance again to see the stranger, on whom he had endeavoured with such pertinacity to fix an acquaintance, which he was now well assured existed only in his own imagination. The traveller treated his scruples with scorn, and said, that guests meeting in this general manner, had no more to do with each other than if they were assembled in a caravansary.|$|R

60|$|After {{he heard}} that, Peter felt better. But he didn't lose {{interest}} in tails, and he {{spent a great deal}} of time in wondering why some of his neighbors had big, bushy tails and some had long, slim tails and why he himself had almost no tail at all. So when Paddy the Beaver came to live in the Green Forest, and made a pond there by building a wonderful dam across the Laughing Brook, the first thing Peter looked to see was what kind of a tail Paddy has, and the first time he got a good look at it, his eyes popped almost out of his head. He just stared and stared. He hardly noticed the wonderful dam or the equally wonderful canals which Paddy had made. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was that great, broad, flat, thick tail, which is so unlike any tail he had ever seen or heard of.|$|E
60|$|Withers led Shefford by {{the first}} stone house, which evidently was the trading-store, into the second. The room Shefford entered was large, with logs {{smoldering}} in a huge open fireplace, blankets covering every foot of floor space, and Indian baskets and silver ornaments everywhere, and strange Indian designs painted upon the whitewashed walls. Withers called his wife and made her acquainted with Shefford. She was a slight, comely little woman, with keen, earnest, dark eyes. She seemed to be serious and quiet, but she made Shefford feel at home immediately. He refused, however, to accept the room offered him, saying that he me meant to sleep out under the open sky. Withers laughed at this and said he understood. Shefford, remembering Presbrey's hunger for news of the outside world, told this trader and his wife <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of; and he was listened to with that close attention a traveler always gained in the remote places.|$|E
60|$|Mike was {{conscious}} of a feeling of acute depression. It did not make him in the least degree jubilant, or even thankful, {{to know that he}} himself was cleared of the charge. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was that Psmith was done for. This was bound to mean the sack. If Psmith had painted Sammy it meant that Psmith had broken out of his house at night; and it was not likely that the rules about nocturnal wandering were less strict at Sedleigh than at any other school in the kingdom. Mike felt, if possible, worse than he had felt when Wyatt had been caught on a similar occasion. It seemed as if Fate had a special grudge against his best friends. He did not make friends very quickly or easily, though he had always had scores of acquaintances--and with Wyatt and Psmith he had found himself at home from the first moment he had met them.|$|E

60|$|John Farmer sat at {{his door}} one September evening, after a hard day's work, his mind still running on his labor more or less. Having bathed, he sat down to re-create his {{intellectual}} man. It was a rather cool evening, {{and some of his}} neighbors were apprehending a frost. He had not attended to the train of his thoughts long when he heard some one playing on a flute, and that sound harmonized with his mood. Still he thought of his work; but the burden of his thought was, that though this kept running in his head, and he found himself planning and contriving it against his will, yet it concerned him very little. It was no more than the scurf of his skin, which was constantly shuffled off. But the notes of the flute came home to his ears out of a different sphere from that he worked in, and suggested work for certain faculties which slumbered in him. They gently did away with the street, and the village, and the state in which he lived. A voice said to him--Why do you stay here and live this mean moiling life, when a glorious existence is possible for you? Those same stars twinkle over other fields than these.--But how {{to come out of this}} condition and actually migrate thither? <b>All</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of was to practise some new austerity, to let his mind descend into his body and redeem it, and treat himself with ever increasing respect.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} Lord Rotherwood renewed his entreaties to Claude {{to join him}} on his travels. He was very much bent on taking him, for his own {{pleasure}} depended not a little on his cousin's company. Claude lay on the glassy slope of the terrace, while Lord Rotherwood paced rapidly up and down before him, persuading him with <b>all</b> the allurements <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, and looking the picture of impatience. Lily sat by, adding her weight to all his arguments. But Claude was almost contemptuous to all the beauties of Germany, and all the promised sights; he scarcely gave himself the trouble to answer his tormentors, only vouchsafing sometimes to open his lips {{to say that he}} never meant to go to a country where people spoke a language that sounded like cracking walnuts; that he hated steamers; had no fancy for tumble-down castles; that it was so common to travel; there was more distinction in staying at home; that the field of Waterloo had been spoilt, and was not worth seeing; his ideas of glaciers would be ruined by the reality; and he did not care to see Cologne Cathedral till it was finished.|$|R
