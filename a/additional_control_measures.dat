30|$|In Egypt, {{strawberry}} {{has become}} increasingly important crop in recent years due to its economic and social benefits. Yet, such an expansion in strawberry cultivation entails the danger of considerable yield losses caused by many pests and diseases. Leaf blight of strawberry, caused by the fungus Phomopsis obscurans, is an important summertime disease because so few varieties have adequate resistance to it. Despite all preventive control measures of the disease, there are many strawberry fields that have inevitable P. obscurans-infection annually with this disease, leading to considerable losses in the crop yield. So, <b>additional</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> are desperately needed. Our results revealed that all concentrations of silicate salts tested herein significantly reduced the leaf blight disease under field conditions.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the period}} from February 1995 to February 1998, the {{epidemiology}} of Shigella diarrhea was studied among children {{less than three years}} of age residing in Egypt’s Nile Delta. Children were visited twice a week and a stool sample was collected from any of them with diarrhea. The incidence of Shigella-associated diarrhea was 0. 2 episodes/ child-year, with S. flexneri being the most common serogroup isolated (55 % of Shigella episodes). Younger age and the warm months increased the risk of developing Shigella-associated diarrhea, while breastfeeding was protective. Children with Shigella were ill for a mean of four days and passed a mean of six stools per day. Common symptoms included fever (35 %), vomiting (19 %), and dehydration (16 %). Dysentery, however, was unusual, occurring in only 11 % of the cases. In conclusion, Shigella-associated diarrhea remains relatively common in Egyptian children and supports the need for <b>additional</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> including vaccine development...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the first 10 weeks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong. The epidemic to date has been characterized by two large clusters - initiated by two separate "super-spread" events (SSEs) - and by ongoing community transmission. By fitting a stochastic model to data on 1512 cases, including these clusters, we show that the etiological agent of SARS is moderately transmissible. Excluding SSES, we estimate that 2. 7 secondary infections were generated per case on average {{at the start of the}} epidemic, with a substantial contribution from hospital transmission. Transmission rates fell during the epidemic, primarily as a result of reductions in population contact rates and improved hospital infection control, but also because of more rapid hospital attendance by symptomatic individuals. As a result, the epidemic is now in decline, although continued vigilance is necessary for this to be maintained. Restrictions on longer range population movement are shown to be a potentially useful <b>additional</b> <b>control</b> <b>measure</b> in some contexts.

One transgenic chickpea and four cowpea lines expressing αAI- 1, their respective controls, as well as nine conventional chickpea cultivars were assessed for their resistance to the bruchids Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say), Callosobruchus chinensis L. and Callosobruchus maculatus F. All transgenic lines were highly resistant to both Callosobruchus species. A. obtectus, known to be tolerant to αAI- 1, was able to develop in all transgenic lines. While the cotyledons of all non-transgenic cultivars were highly susceptible to all bruchids, C. chinensis and C. maculatus larvae suffered from significantly increased mortality rates inside transgenic seeds. The main factor responsible for the partial resistance in the non-transgenic cultivars was deduced to reside in the seed coat. The αAI- 1 present in seeds of transgenic chickpea and cowpea lines significantly increases their resistance to two important bruchid pest species (C. chinensis and C. maculatus) essentially to immunity. To control αAI- 1 tolerant bruchid species such as A. obtectus and to avoid the development of resistance to αAI- 1, varieties carrying this transgene should be protected with <b>additional</b> <b>control</b> <b>measure...</b>|$|R

However, despite high acceptability, daily use was observed to be low (8 %) and did not correspond to the reported use in surveys (around 70 %). The levels of use aimed for by the trial were never reached as the population used it variably across place (forest, farms and villages) and time (seasons), or in alternative applications (spraying on insects, on bed nets, etc.).

Nevertheless, diseases still occur in these systems and the need for <b>additional</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> exist. Traditionally, control has relied on the use of chemical fungicides but environmental pressure to reduce chemical usage in the environment, and fewer active ingredients registered for use, has stimulated the development of biological methods of disease control.

Sufficient root colonization and activity are key issues for effective biocontrol. Another approach has been to create growing systems with improved suppressiveness towards plant diseases. The challenge is to combine the available strategies into environmentally and economically sound soilless plant production systems with low risks for pathogen outbreaks.
