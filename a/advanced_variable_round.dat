40|$|To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between the addition of <b>advanced</b> monitoring <b>variables</b> and changes in clinical decision-making. A 15 -questions survey was anonymously emailed to international experts and physician members of five anesthesia societies which focused on assessing treatment decisions of clinicians during three realistic clinical scenarios measured at two distinct time points. The first is when typical case information and basic monitoring (T 1) were provided, and then once again after the addition of <b>advanced</b> monitoring <b>variables</b> (T 2). We hypothesized that the addition of <b>advanced</b> <b>variables</b> would increase the incidence of an optimal therapeutic decision (a priori defined as the answer with the highest percentage of expert agreement) and decrease the variability among the physician's suggested treatments. The survey was completed by 18 experts and 839 physicians. Overall, adding advanced monitoring did not significantly increase physician response accuracy, with the least substantial changes noted on questions related to volume expansion or vasopressor administration. Moreover, advanced monitoring data did not significantly decrease the high level of initial practice variability in physician suggested treatments (P =  0. 13), in contrast to the low variability observed within the expert group (P =  0. 039). Additionally, 5 - 10  years of practice (P <  0. 0001) and a cardiovascular subspecialty (P =  0. 048) were both physician characteristics associated with a higher rate of optimal therapeutic decisions. The addition of <b>advanced</b> <b>variables</b> was of limited benefit for most physicians, further indicating the need for more in depth education on the clinical value and technical understanding of such variables...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{recognition}} that Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) leads to substantial increases in morbidity, mortality, {{and length of}} stay, accurate prognostication of these clinical events remains difficult. It remains unclear which approaches to variable selection and model building are most robust. We used data from a randomized trial of AKI alerting to develop time-updated prognostic models using stepwise regression compared to more <b>advanced</b> <b>variable</b> selection techniques. We randomly split data into training and validation cohorts. Outcomes of interest were death within 7 days, dialysis within 7 days, and length of stay. Data elements eligible for model-building included lab values, medications and dosages, procedures, and demographics. We assessed model discrimination using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve and r-squared values. 2241 individuals were available for analysis. Both modeling techniques created viable models with very good discrimination ability, with AUCs exceeding 0. 85 for dialysis and 0. 8 for death prediction. Model performance was similar across model building strategies, though the strategy employing more <b>advanced</b> <b>variable</b> selection was more parsimonious. Very good to excellent prediction of outcome events is feasible in patients with AKI. More advanced techniques may lead to more parsimonious models, which may facilitate adoption in other settings...|$|R

With infinite bandwidth, received images should have the same quality and frame rate as transmitted ones.

50|$|The hybrid Trefftz {{finite-element method}} has been {{considerably}} advanced since its introduction about 30 years ago.
