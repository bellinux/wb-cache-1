40|$|The {{compression}} of morbidity model posits a breakpoint {{in the adult}} lifespan that separates an initial period of relative health from a subsequent period of ever increasing morbidity. Researchers often assume that such a breakpoint exists; however, this assumption is hitherto untested. To test the assumption that a breakpoint exists [...] which we term <b>a</b> morbidity <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> [...] separating <b>a</b> period of relative health from a subsequent deterioration in health status. An analogous <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> for healthcare costs was also investigated. Four years of adults' (N = 55, 550) morbidity and costs data were retrospectively analyzed. Data were collected in Pittsburgh, PA between 2006 and 2009; analyses were performed in Rochester, NY and Ann Arbor, MI in 2012 and 2013. Cohort-sequential and hockey stick regression models were used to characterize long-term trajectories and <b>tipping</b> <b>points,</b> respectively, for both morbidity and costs. Morbidity increased exponentially with age (P<. 001). <b>A</b> morbidity <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> was observed at age 45. 5 (95 % CI, 41. 3 - 49. 7). An exponential trajectory was also observed for costs (P<. 001), with <b>a</b> costs <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> occurring at age 39. 5 (95 % CI, 32. 4 - 46. 6). Following their respective <b>tipping</b> <b>points,</b> both morbidity and costs increased substantially (Ps<. 001). Findings support the existence of <b>a</b> morbidity <b>tipping</b> <b>point,</b> confirming <b>an</b> important but untested assumption. This <b>tipping</b> <b>point,</b> however, may occur earlier in the lifespan than is widely assumed. An "avalanche of morbidity" occurred after the morbidity tipping point-an ever increasing rate of morbidity progression. For costs, <b>an</b> analogous <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> and "avalanche" were observed. The time point at which costs began to increase substantially occurred approximately 6 years before health status began to deteriorate...|$|R

Mbeki elected not to challenge this decision and resigned as President of South Africa. The ANC announced that the party's deputy president, Kgalema Motlanthe, would become president until 2009 general elections, after which it was intended that Zuma would become president. Zuma declared that he would prefer to only serve one term as president.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitutional}} crisis of 1993 {{was a political}} stand-off between the Russian president Boris Yeltsin and the Russian parliament that was resolved by using military force. The relations {{between the president and}} the parliament had been deteriorating for some time. The {{constitutional crisis}} reached <b>a</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> on September21, 1993, when President Yeltsin aimed to dissolve the country's legislature (the Congress of People's Deputies and its Supreme Soviet), although the president did not have the power to dissolve the parliament according to the constitution. Yeltsin used the results of the referendum of April 1993 to justify his actions. In response, the parliament declared that the president's decision was null and void, impeached Yeltsin and proclaimed vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy to be acting president.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. <b>A</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|E

25|$|Disputes {{between the}} {{administration}} and fraternities reached <b>a</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> on January 12, 1848 with the Snowball Rebellion. Numerous students, {{many of whom were}} fraternity members, rolled snowballs up to the entrance of Old Main and blocked it, which was discovered early the next morning by the janitor, who informed then President Erasmus D. MacMaster of the snowballs. President MacMaster informed the faculty and students later that day at a chapel meeting, which all students and faculty members were required to attend, that those involved in the incident with Old Main would be expelled. This ultimately backfired though, for the following night even more students broke into Old Main and packed the main floor with snow, along with chairs, tables, benches, and the entire wood fuel supply for the winter, which then froze overnight. MacMaster expelled all students involved over the next two weeks, and Miami’s enrollment fell to 68 students. However, not wanting to close the university, the Board of Trustees fired MacMaster and hired William Anderson as the next president, who allowed Phi Delta Theta fraternity to be formed in December 1848.|$|E

[...] Michael Passman of The Michigan Daily wrote in 2007 that [...] "in hindsight, the 10th season can now be seen as <b>a</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> of sorts for a number of the show's less attractive plot devices.

500|$|The remark {{is usually}} invoked {{to signal the}} {{conflicts}} that arose when bandleader and composer Brian Wilson began subverting the formula that brought the Beach Boys their initial success: songs with lyrics that embraced girls, cars, and surfing. The departure was represented by the band's 1966 album Pet Sounds and reached <b>a</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> one year later with Smile, which was abandoned and left unfinished. At the time, Anderle was a portrait artist and talent manager who Wilson recently befriended and employed {{as the head of}} the Beach Boys' new label, Brother Records.

On those albums, instead of collaborating with Love, Wilson sought lyrics from jingle writer Tony Asher and multi-instrumentalist Van Dyke Parks. According to various reports, some of which have been disputed, the band resisted the new direction and were worried that Wilson was going to break away as a solo artist. The band, including Wilson, were also anxious about whether their new [...] "arty" [...] approach would amount to record sales.|$|E
500|$|Mike Simpson, Creative Assembly's studio director, {{started a}} blog in October 2009, in a {{deliberate}} attempt {{to engage with}} the game's user community and counter some of the negative reaction which the game had received. He explained The Creative Assembly [...] "were not entirely happy {{with the state of}} Empire: Total War when it went out", but felt the Metacritic user rating of 67 percent was unfair, stating that his reason for blogging was a concern that the negative ratings could even damage the amount of money available for developing future games. In later posts he described the February 2009 release date as [...] "commercial reality", and explained why they had hit significant problems with the game's AI close to release. Simpson describes the campaign AI as [...] "by far the most complex code edifice I’ve ever seen in a game", and said that they had reached <b>a</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> where consideration of too many factors led to an AI which [...] "disagrees with itself chronically and often ends up paralysed by indecision". It was only after patch 1.5—six months after the original release—that Simpson felt comfortable sending it to friends of his, having previously been too embarrassed about the flaws. With regard to the battle AI, Simpson said that the lead battle AI programmer had left to return to his family just {{before the end of the}} project. The battle AI at that stage struggled to beat good players even with an obvious level of handicapping, and it had taken some time for other programmers to understand three years' worth of code; progress had been [...] "frustratingly slow" [...] as they strived for a game where real world tactics would work.|$|E
