5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} adenine. For example, peak <b>absorption</b> of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV <b>absorption</b> at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet <b>absorption</b> spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV <b>absorption</b> at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E

Methanol masers provide ideal sites {{to probe the}} earliest stages of massive star formation, while 4. 8 GHz formaldehyde <b>absorptions</b> are accurate probes of physical conditions in dense $(10 ^{ 3 } - 10 ^{ 5 } cm^{- 3 }) $ and low temperature molecular clouds towards massive star forming regions. The work is aimed at studying feature similarities between the formaldehyde <b>absorptions</b> and the methanol masers so as to expand knowledge of events and physical conditions in massive star forming regions. A total of 176 methanol maser sources were observed for formaldehyde <b>absorptions,</b> and formaldehyde <b>absorptions</b> were detected 138 of them. 53 of the formaldehyde <b>absorptions</b> were newly detected. We noted a poor correlation between the methanol and formaldehyde intensities, {{an indication that the}} signals (though arise from about the same regions) are enhanced by different mechanisms. Our results show higher detection rates of the formaldehyde lines for sources with stronger methanol signals. The strongest formaldehyde <b>absorptions</b> were associated with IRAS sources and IRDCs that have developed HII regions, and that do not have EGOs.

5|$|Optical <b>absorption</b> {{in carbon}} {{nanotubes}} differs from <b>absorption</b> in conventional 3D materials by presence of sharp peaks (1D nanotubes) {{instead of an}} <b>absorption</b> threshold followed by an <b>absorption</b> increase (most 3D solids). <b>Absorption</b> in nanotubes originates from electronic transitions from the v2 to c2 (energy E22) or v1 to c1 (E11) levels, etc. The transitions are relatively sharp {{and can be used}} to identify nanotube types. Note that the sharpness deteriorates with increasing energy, and that many nanotubes have very similar E22 or E11 energies, and thus significant overlap occurs in <b>absorption</b> spectra. This overlap is avoided in photoluminescence mapping measurements (see below), which instead of a combination of overlapped transitions identifies individual (E22,E11) pairs.|$|E

40|$|Several new {{infrared}} <b>absorptions</b> {{were found}} in carbon dioxide. All are normally forbidden, and were collision-induced in an absorbing cell whose combination of pressure and path length has a unique sensitivity for induced <b>absorptions.</b> The new <b>absorptions</b> in the 2. 3 micron region are attributed to transitions from ground to the 3 (1) 1 Fermi pair at 4248 and 4391 /cm. Other <b>absorptions</b> are attributed to simultaneous CO 2 -N 2 transitions and to the 00 (0) 0 - 00 (0) 2 transition in CO 2 polarizability derivatives and regular progressions in strength versus increasing quantum number. The spectra were used to predict the radiative transfer in a dry CO 2 model of the lower Venus atmosphere. The {{results indicate that the}} radiation balance in the lower atmosphere is adequately explained by a dry massive atmosphere of CO 2 with a layer of infrared-opaque clouds.

The <b>absorptions</b> due to H~O {{have been studied}} in montmorillonites exchanged with H, Na, Ca, Mg and Fe 3 + interlayer cations under variable moisture environments. Band assignments have been made for <b>absorptions</b> in the 3 ~tm region due to structural OH vibrations, symmetric and asymmetric 1 - 120 stretching vibrations and the H 20 bending overtone. Changes in the energies of the <b>absorptions</b> due to H 20 stretching vibrations were observed as the samples were dehydrated by reducing the atmospheric pressure. <b>Absorptions</b> near 3620 cm- 1 and 3550 cm- 1 have been assigned to water bound directly to cations (inner sphere) and surfacebonded H 20 and <b>absorptions</b> near 3450 cm- 1 and 3350 cm ~ have been assigned to additional adsorbed water molecules.

5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) <b>absorption</b> features of molecular oxygen. Such an <b>absorption</b> can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer <b>absorption</b> bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E
40|$|When {{penicillin}} and streptomycin solution were instillated to the renal pelvis of rabbits, {{they were}} good absorbed on the renal pelvis and were transferred into blood on the groups of the knotted ureter.

Penicillin is influenced stronger than streptomycin to hyaluronidase on the <b>absorptions</b> powers of the renal pelvis. When antibiotics were instillated to the renal pelvis with the degenerated renal tubules caused by knotting of the renal artery for 60 - 80 minutes, their <b>absorptions</b> were definitely inhibited.
