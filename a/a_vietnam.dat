5|$|Universal Pictures {{reported}} that it greenlit American Gangster with a budget of $80million, which escalated to $93million, with $10million for development costs and $3million for the delay of the production start date. Sources close to the director insist that the budget was $93million from the beginning. The studio also sought for American Gangster to be produced in Toronto rather than New York City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location. The studio's parent company General Electric received tax credits in New York City, so production {{was moved to the}} city. The move, however, inflated the budget to $98million. Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking ways to reduce the budget, but the studio contended several aspects of the project under him. The director had wanted to film <b>a</b> <b>Vietnam</b> sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as Ray Liotta and John C. Reilly in minor roles. To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was rewriting the script during the preproduction process. The director also did not have a shot-list, final locations, and supporting actors signed to initiate production.|$|E
