500|$|Nielsen {{himself was}} {{ambiguous}} about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He {{wrote to the}} Dutch composer Julius Röntgen in 1909 [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking that all this delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. What {{do you think about}} songs sung in unison? We must go back... to the pure and the clear." [...] On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 [...] "Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does... and it is impossible to deliver national music on request." ...|$|E
500|$|Georgia Tech next {{defeated}} coach Knute Rockne's Notre Dame Fighting Irish 13–0. Father Lumpkin intercepted two Irish passes, {{setting up}} the winning score by running the second interception down to the [...] line. After the game, coach Rockne said, [...] "I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Peter Pund... Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined". Rockne later also wrote of an attack on his coaching in the Atlanta Journal, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> that a paper of such fine, high standing [...] would allow a zipper to write in his particular vein... the article by Fuzzy Woodruff was not called for".|$|E

500|$|Biasini and Mitterrand {{liked the}} plans, but {{the scope of}} the {{renovation}} displeased Louvre director André Chabaud. He resigned from his post, complaining that the project was [...] "unfeasible" [...] and posed [...] "architectural risks". The public also reacted harshly to the design, mostly because of the proposed pyramid. One critic called it a [...] "gigantic, ruinous gadget"; another charged Mitterrand with [...] "despotism" [...] for inflicting Paris with the [...] "atrocity". Pei estimated that 90percent of Parisians opposed his design. [...] "I received many angry glances in the streets of Paris," [...] he said. Some condemnations carried nationalistic overtones. One opponent wrote: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> that one would go looking for a Chinese architect in America to deal with the historic heart of the capital of France." ...|$|E
500|$|The actor-manager Nigel Playfair, {{a friend}} of Gielgud's family, saw him in a student {{presentation}} of J.M. Barrie's The Admirable Crichton. Playfair was impressed and cast him as Felix, the poet-butterfly, in the British premiere of the Čapek brothers' The Insect Play. Gielgud later said {{that he made a}} poor impression in the part: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> that the audience did not throw things at me." [...] The critics were cautious but not hostile to the play; it did not attract the public and closed after a month. While still continuing his studies at RADA, Gielgud appeared again for Playfair in RobertE Lee by John Drinkwater. After leaving the academy at the end of 1923 Gielgud played a Christmas season as Charley in Charley's Aunt in the West End, and then joined Fagan's repertory company at the Oxford Playhouse.|$|E
500|$|Allemannische Gedichte {{was very}} successful, {{and a new}} edition was {{published}} a year later, this time crediting the author. When Hebel read the poems aloud to margrave Charles Frederick, the duke praised them, and Hebel noticed his exact local knowledge: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> how the margrave knew all the villages, every small place, every shrub and hedge from Utzenfeld to Lörrach, and could always say: this is this, and yes, that's how it is." [...] In the following decades, further editions were released in Aarau, Vienna and Reutlingen. Famous poets such as Jean Paul (1803) and Goethe (1804) wrote reviews of the poems. Hebel was elated at this success and wrote in a letter: [...] "In certain moments I feel all proud inside, and as if drunk with happiness, that I could make our otherwise despised and ridiculed language so classical and give it such artistic fame".|$|E

500|$|Returning to Britain {{to receive}} his medal from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 22 June 1915, O'Leary {{was given a}} grand {{reception}} attended by thousands of Londoners in Hyde Park on 10 July. He was also {{the subject of much}} patriotic writing, including a poem in the Daily Mail and the short play O'Flaherty V.C. by George Bernard Shaw. Tributes came from numerous prominent figures of the day, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who said that [...] "No writer in fiction would dare to fasten such an achievement on any of his characters, but the Irish have always had a reputation of being wonderful fighters, and Lance-Corporal Michael O’Leary is clearly one of them." [...] and Thomas Scanlan who said: [...] "I heard early this week of the great achievements of the Irish Guards. All Ireland is proud of O’Leary. He fully deserves the high honour that has been conferred upon him. Ireland is grateful to him." [...] His reception was repeated in Macroom when he visited Ireland, with crowds turning out to applaud him. Daniel O'Leary was interviewed in a local newspaper regarding his son's exploit but was reportedly unimpressed, commenting: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> he didn't do more. I often laid out twenty men myself with a stick coming from Macroom Fair, and it is a bad trial of Mick that he could kill only eight, and he having a rifle and bayonet." ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times Judy Berman {{praised the}} finale, stating [...] " [...] this year {{went out with}} a bang. I had my doubts and reservations, largely {{concerning}} Blair and Chuck, but I <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> and pleased to report that I found the end of [...] "Gossip Girl" [...] Season 4 both exciting and satisfying." [...] The return of Georgina Sparks was well-received as with Serena's development, with Berman citing Serena's confession with Charlie before she could plunge to her death. [...] "This debacle, along with the events of this season in general, seems to have given S some perspective. Friends, she apologizes to Nate and Dan for leading them on and confesses to Charlie that her decision-making skills leave something to be desired! Even if lazy writing results in Serena falling into old habits next season, it's a pretty gratifying moment." [...] Berman also questioned Vanessa's motive behind publishing Dan's novel [...] "it's impossible to know whether she's trying to do her old friend one last favor or profit from stirring up more drama in his life. Considering that Jessica Szohr won't be returning to the show in the fall, we may never find out." [...] Berman also complimented the casting of director David O Russell calling it [...] "one of the show's most delightfully random cameos ever". New York Magazine labeled Chuck and Blair's relationship as the [...] "Longest-Delayed Breakup" [...] of the season, adding that [...] "the big news was that Blair and Prince Louis are somehow still together and engaged, with the wedding scheduled for November sweeps. We feel comfortable assuming that by then, Chuck will have regrouped enough to break things up more definitively." ...|$|E

I should not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if the law were like that; because in modern England there is practically no law to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at. I should not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> even {{at the man who}} did it; for a certain kind of man, if he lived long under the English landlord system, might do anything. But I should <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at the people who consented to stand it. I should, in other words, think the world a little mad if the incident, were received in silence.|$|R

Although several newspapers reported that he had subsequently argued with BBC Two controller Janice Hadlow, who was present at the recording, the BBC denied that he had been given a [...] "dressing down". John Whittingdale, Conservative chair of the Culture Select Committee remarked: [...] "Many people will find that offensive, many people will find that word in particular very offensive [...] I <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> he felt it appropriate to use it." ...|$|E

I am excited {{to be a part of}} that fight." [...] Regarding most of Pine Valley being okay with Bianca being gay, Lind stated that she is [...] "a little curious" [...] to see some [...] "sort of real-life conflict arrive and see that some people in her small town do not accept her sexuality." [...] Lind clarified, [...] "In a sense, that is pretty relevant and controversial and true. Because Pine Valley is the exception, it’s a beautiful utopia right now.
