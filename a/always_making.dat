Those who are not so careful and regularly surpass their credit limit or are late in making payments are exposed to multiple charges that were typically as high as £25–35 until a ruling from the Office of Fair Trading that they would presume charges over £12 to be unfair which led the majority of card providers to reduce their fees to £12.|$|E

500|$|In 1915, Grant won a {{scholarship}} to attend Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol, although his father could barely {{afford to pay for}} the uniform. With his good looks and acrobatic talents Grant became a popular figure among both girls and boys. Able at most academic subjects, he excelled at sports, particularly fives; he developed a reputation for mischief, and frequently refused to do his homework. A former classmate referred to him as a [...] "scruffy little boy", while an old teacher remembered [...] "the naughty little boy who was <b>always</b> <b>making</b> a noise in the back row and would never do his homework". His evenings were spent working backstage in Bristol theatres, and in 1917, at the age of 13, he was responsible for the lighting for the magician David Devant at the Hippodrome. Grant began hanging around backstage at the theatre at every opportunity. In the summer he volunteered for work as a messenger boy and guide at the military docks in Southampton, to escape the unhappiness of his home life. The time spent at Southampton strengthened his desire to travel; he was eager to leave Bristol and tried to sign on as a ship's cabin boy, but learned he was too young.|$|E
500|$|In the East, the {{persecution}} was officially discontinued on April 30, 311, although martyrdoms in Gaza continued until May 4. Galerius, now on his deathbed, issued a proclamation to end hostilities, and give Christians {{the rights to}} exist freely under the law, and to peaceable assembly. Persecution was everywhere at an end. Lactantius preserves the Latin text of this pronouncement, describing it as an edict. Eusebius provides a Greek translation of the pronouncement. His version includes imperial titles and an address to provincials, suggesting that the proclamation is, in fact, an imperial letter. The document seems only to have been promulgated in Galerius's provinces.Among all the other arrangements that we are <b>always</b> <b>making</b> for the benefit and utility of the state, we have heretofore wished to repair all things {{in accordance with the}} laws and public discipline of the Romans, and to ensure that even the Christians, who abandoned the practice of their ancestors, should return to good sense. Indeed, for some reason or other, such self-indulgence assailed and idiocy possessed those Christians, that they did not follow the practices of the ancients, which their own ancestors had, perhaps, instituted, but according to their own will and as it pleased them, they made laws for themselves that they observed, and gathered various peoples in diverse areas. Then when our order was issued stating that they should return themselves to the practices of the ancients, many were subjected to peril, and many were even killed. Many more persevered in their way of life, and we saw that they neither offered proper worship and cult to the gods, or to the god of the Christians. Considering the observation of our own mild clemency and eternal custom, by which we are accustomed to grant clemency to all people, we have decided to extend our most speedy indulgence to these people as well, so that Christians may once more establish their own meeting places, so long as they do not act in a disorderly way. We are about to send another letter to our officials detailing the conditions they ought to observe. Consequently, in accord with our indulgence, they ought to pray to their god for our health and the safety of the state, so that the state may be kept safe on all sides, and {{they may be able to}} live safely and securely in their own homes. Galerius's words reinforce the Tetrarchy's theological basis for {{the persecution}}; the acts did nothing more than attempt to enforce traditional civic and religious practices, even if the edicts themselves were thoroughly nontraditional. Galerius does nothing to violate the spirit of the persecutionChristians are still admonished for their nonconformity and foolish practicesGalerius never admits that he did anything wrong. The admission that the Christians' god might exist is made only grudgingly. Certain early 20th-century historians have declared that Galerius's edict definitively nullified the old [...] "legal formula" [...] non licet esse Christianos, made Christianity a religio licita, [...] "on a par with Judaism", and secured Christians' property, among other things.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{many writers}} looked to photography, film, and {{audiotape}} recordings {{in order to}} discover new ideas about composing. [...] This led to a resurgence of {{a focus on the}} sensory, self-illustration known as expressionism. Expressionist ways of thinking encouraged writers to find their voice outside of language by placing it in a visual, oral, spatial, or temporal medium. Donald Murray, who is often linked to expressionist methods of teaching writing once said, “As writers {{it is important that we}} move out from that which is within us to what we see, feel, hear, smell, and taste of the world around us. A writer is <b>always</b> <b>making</b> use of experience.” Murray instructed his writing students to “see themselves as cameras” by writing down every single visual observation they made for one hour. [...] Expressionist thought emphasized personal growth, and linked the art of writing with all visual art by calling both a type of composition. Also, by making writing the result of a sensory experience, expressionists defined writing as a multisensory experience, and asked for it to have the freedom to be composed across all modes, tailored for all five senses.|$|E
