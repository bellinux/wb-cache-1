Acquirers were listed as of January 1 st, 1995, in the FTSE 350, HDAX 100 or SBF 120 indexes or were created through a merger of equals prior to 2008. By choosing this time period, our sample covers several M&A-cycles. The starting point of 1995 ensures that duties for <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>reporting</b> are in place for all three countries. Germany was the last to introduce this duty, on January 1, 1995, due to the implementation of the second capital market support law (Zweites Finanzmarkt-förderungsgesetz) and § 15 WpHG (the Securities Trading Act). To be included in the sample, acquirers must have been clearly identifiable in Worldscope, Datastream, and Thomson Financial SDC and not part of the financial services industry (SIC 6000 - 6999). Furthermore, accounting data in the fiscal year prior to the announcement date of an acquisition had to be available in Worldscope, and capital market data up to 10  days before as well as 10  days after the announcement date had to be available in Datastream.|$|E
40|$|What is a data warehouse? The {{definitions}} {{you find}} might emphasize such qualities as: • {{large volume of}} data requiring compression techniques for performance • comprehensive and homogenized data collected from several sources • operating on separate hardware from transaction databases • containing historical data to allow a long-term view • requiring a minimum of technical knowledge to use These suggested qualities of a data warehouse describe how the focus and direction of data warehousing {{differs from that of}} a traditional operations database. Ideally, an operations database contains data necessary to conduct the day’s business transactions accurately and efficiently. The ideal data warehouse is quite different. The fundamental objective of any data warehouse project is bring together available data related to a selected subject and organize it to make it easy to use — easy to retrieve, summarize, and analyze. It is this objective that defines a data warehouse. But the same objective could describe, at least in part, almost any project in business intelligence, decision support, or research. In short, the objectives of the typical SAS project have elements in common with the objectives of data warehousing.

40|$|Abstract: With {{the advent}} of social {{investment}} vehicles, stakeholders, particularly investors, are increasingly aware {{of the relationship between}} economic, social and environmental performance, and disclosure to external parties. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to revisit empirical research efforts spanning a period of three decades in order to delineate potential links that may assist in systematic, comparable reporting of these activities. Keywords: Social disclosure, social performance, environmental accounting systems. There are still no firm guidelines to integrate the financial aspects of management decisions relating to stewardship of environmental resources. The relationship between environmental and/or social risk and financial reports, in particular liabilities, contingent liabilities and capital expenditures, has implications for the sustainability of a firm’s financial 'health'. It is however, acknowledged that a continuing evolution, together with an increasing sophistication in stakeholder pressure, has achieved a considerable increase in reporting the outcomes to the natural environment resulting from firms’ business activities (Chan & Milne 1999). Business activities encompassing environmental and social resources are of increasing concern to concerned stakeholders who do not have the right to demand the relevant information to assist their current decision-making needs. The communication and disclosure of social and environmental information has made significant strides over the last decade, albeit in an arbitrary and somewhat <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>reporting</b> manner. A credible format to aid comparability and reliability, with precise definitions and categorisation, is the objective, that ideally links environmental and financial performance. Elkington (1997) supports a triple bottom line voluntary reporting approach which includes economic, environmental and social information. Current key ‘best practice ’ external reporting developments are...|$|E

Methodology. To promote, enhance and disseminate research results generated by the Hospital Research groups have been selected the usual channels of dissemination of Social Web platforms. It has also created a database for collecting and reporting publications. Data were extracted by consulting the databases PUBMED and ISI WEB KNOWLEDGE, within the time frame between 1975 and 2010. The conference papers, theses, patents and publications are not indexed manually entered, data gathering services to producers through research reports. Results. We have created an Internet portal for the collection and updating of scientific activity to report production and research activities, has developed a relational database specifically designed for <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>reporting</b> based on bibliometric parameters accessible through the hospital website.

40|$|Purpose Natural health {{products}} are {{promoted to the}} public as equally or more effective and less toxic than conventional drugs. However, some 'natural' medicines, and in particular some herbal medicines, are known to have adverse effects. The Italian Pharmacovigilance System, in charge of the Italian Medicines Agency, collects spontaneous reports only for registered drugs. The awareness of the need of surveillance of the safety of natural health products has stimulated the implementation of a suspected adverse reaction reporting system in Italy. The system has been set up by the Italian National Institute of Health. Methods An <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>reporting</b> form can be downloaded from different institutional web sites. Voluntary reports of suspected adverse reactions are sent to the National Institute of Health and are evaluated by a multidisciplinary group of experts. Results From April 2002 to March 2007, 233 spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions to natural health products were collected. A large proportion of suspected adverse reactions were serious: hospitalization was reported in 35 % of forms; 6 % reported life threatening clinical events and two fatal events were notified. About 50 % of suspected adverse reactions were related to gastrointestinal, skin, psychiatric and nervous system disorders. Mainly herbal products (66 %) were involved. Twenty-one cases of hepatitis of various seriousness were reported. Twenty-one reports were associated with 27 homeopathic preparations, mostly preparations containing mixtures of substances. Fourteen reports regarded suspected reactions to products containing propolis. Conclusion Safety and efficacy of 'natural' medicines have not been thoroughly investigated. It is important to improve communication with the public on safety issues. Encouraging spontaneous reporting can contribute to improve awareness among health personnel and patients about the benefit-harm profile of these remedies.

The RASFF-Database, maintained by the European Commission (EC), includes detailed information on food safety events notified {{by the members of}} the RASFF-network. EMRISK has developed a system that enables the provision of up-to-date statistics (e. g. frequency tables and graphs) from the RASFF-Database.

There {{is a need for}} prospective, systematic pharmacovigilance in hospice and palliative care. Method: Here we describe an international, Web-based, 128 -bit secure initiative to collect pharmacovigilance data documenting net clinical benefit and safety of common medications. The intention is for a diverse and large group of clinical units to record data prospectively on a small deidentified consecutive cohort of patients started on the medication of interest. A new medication would be studied every 3 months. Three key time points (different for each medication) will be assessed for each patient, collecting easily codefiable data at baseline, a point at which clinical benefit should be experienced, and a point at which short- to medium-term toxicities may occur. Toxicities can additionally be recorded at any time they occur. Data collection will take a maximum of 10 minutes per patient. Conclusion: The intention is to create an efficient, relevant system to improve hospice and palliative care with maximally generalizable results...|$|E
