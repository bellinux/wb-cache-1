It stands for the Latin phrase Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam which means For the Greater Glory of God. At the end of <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> they write L.D.S. in {{the centre of the}} page. It stands for Laus Deo Semper which means Praise to God Always.

5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). <b>A</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on family trees {{leads to the}} pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.|$|E

500|$|Hamlet {{reflects}} the contemporary scepticism {{promoted by the}} French Renaissance humanist Michel de Montaigne. Prior to Montaigne's time, humanists such as Pico della Mirandola had argued that man was God's greatest creation, made in God's image and able to choose his own nature, but this view was subsequently challenged in Montaigne's Essais of 1580. Hamlet's [...] "What <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is a man" [...] seems to echo many of Montaigne's ideas, and many scholars have discussed whether Shakespeare drew directly from Montaigne or whether both men were simply reacting similarly {{to the spirit of}} the times.|$|E

[...] In [...] "Flesh Failures/Let The Sun Shine In", the lyrics [...] "Eyes, look your last!/ Arms, take your last embrace! And lips, O you/ The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss" [...] are from Romeo and Juliet (V: iii, 111–14). [...] According to Miller, the Romeo suicide imagery makes the point that, with our complicity in war, we are killing ourselves.|$|E

500|$|After {{studying}} {{the music of}} the Bantu at Cape Town University, MacDermot incorporated African rhythms into the score of Hair. [...] He listened to [...] "what [...] called quaylas... very characteristic beat, very similar to rock. [...] Much deeper though.... Hair is very African – a lot of [...] rhythms, not the tunes so much." [...] Quaylas stress beats on unexpected syllables, and this influence can be heard in songs like [...] "What <b>a</b> <b>Piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>Work</b> Is Man" [...] and [...] "Ain't Got No Grass". [...] MacDermot said, [...] "My idea was to make a total funk show. They said they wanted rock & roll – but to me that translated to 'funk.'" [...] That funk is evident throughout the score, notably in songs like [...] "Colored Spade" [...] and [...] "Walking in Space".|$|E

500|$|Sheen {{played the}} title role in Hamlet at the Young Vic in late 2011 and early 2012, a role he first {{explored}} in a 1999 BBC Radio 3 production. While there had been tentative plans over the years for both Peter Hall and Michael Grandage to direct Sheen in the play, he eventually asked Ian Rickson. Rickson's production was set in the secure wing of a psychiatric hospital and featured original music by PJ Harvey. The Evening Standard declared Sheen's performance [...] "an audacious achievement" [...] that [...] "will live in the memory" [...] while The Independent praised [...] "a recklessly brilliant and bravura performance." [...] The Telegraph felt that Sheen [...] "could be right up there among the great Hamlets" [...] while The Times found him [...] "unbearably moving".

500|$|MacDermot {{has claimed}} that the songs [...] "can't all be the same. [...] You've got to get {{different}} styles.... I like to think they're all a little different." [...] As such, the music in Hair runs the gamut of rock: from the rockabilly sensibilities of [...] "Don't Put it Down" [...] to the folk rock rhythms of [...] "Frank Mills" [...] and [...] "What <b>a</b> <b>Piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>Work</b> is Man". [...] "Easy to Be Hard" [...] is pure rhythm and blues, and protest rock anthems abound: [...] "Ain't Got No" [...] and [...] "The Flesh Failures". [...] The acid rock of [...] "Walking in Space" [...] and [...] "Aquarius" [...] are balanced by the mainstream pop of [...] "Good Morning Starshine". [...] Scott Miller ties the music of Hair to the hippies' political themes: [...] "The hippies... were determined to create art {{of the people and}} their chosen art form, rock/folk music was by its definition, populist. ...he hippies' music was often very angry, its anger directed at those who would prostitute the Constitution, who would sell America out, who would betray what America stood for; in other words, directed at their parents and the government."

[...] Tim Karan of Alternative Press called The Black Parade [...] "MCR's whole raison d'etre rolled up into one mega-decibel calling card". Ed Thompson of IGN stated, [...] "The Black Parade is a rock and roll gem that celebrates everything that was over the top about the 1970s rock scene." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone praised the classic rock feel of the album. Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "On their third studio album, a musical H-bomb of an effort, the Jersey quintet combine the rock-opera pomp of Queen with the darker, dirtier tones of their screamo past: Call it a Bro-hemian Rhapsody. Even without its broad concept — a dying cancer patient seeks revenge and redemption — Parade stands {{as one of the most}} cohesive, engaging rock records of 2006."
