40|$|The {{power supply}} {{technology}} used in welding applications changed dramatically from manually tap-controlled 50 Hz bulky transformers which had large leakage inductance to provide stable <b>arc</b> <b>burn</b> to switch-mode fast controlled highfrequency power electronics. Nowadays, the typical converter configuration {{consist of a}} diode rectifier supplying via a large electrolytic capacitor a smooth DC-link voltage to a high switching frequency H-bridge inverter that steps down the voltage and provides isolation via a high frequency transformer whilst operating with adjustable dutycycle to maintain the output current constant. This topology allows for important size reduction since the size of magnetics decreases rapidly {{with the increase of}} the frequency. This paper proposes a more complex two-stage configuration with a buck DC/DC converter operating at a reduced switching frequency to feed adjustable voltage to an H-bridge inverter, which is operating always with the required voltage at 50 % dutycycle, enabling in addition the minimization of the output filter size and of the switching losses...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} a systematic direct approach {{to carry out}} effective optimization {{of a wide range}} of continuous-thrust Earth-orbit transfers with intermediate-level thrust acceleration, including minimum-time (with a single <b>burn</b> <b>arc)</b> and minimum-fuel (with multiple <b>burn</b> <b>arcs)</b> transfers. With direct control parameterization, in which the control steering programs of <b>burn</b> <b>arcs</b> are interpolated through a finite number of nodes, the optimal control problem is converted into the parameter optimization problem to be solved by nonlinear programming. An inertial coordinate transformation strategy is proposed to produce general simple terminal constraints for transfers to inclined and eccentric orbits. This strategy eliminates possible singularities when the spacecraft transfers to the retrograde equatorial orbit and also results in better convergence of optimization iterations. Multiple shooting is used in order to further improve the convergence robustness, and strategies to allocate multiple-shooting variables for certain types of transfers are presented. Numerical examples include single-burn minimum-time transfers, multiple-burn minimum-fuel transfers with up to 12 <b>burn</b> <b>arcs</b> as well as fixed-time transfers with variable specific impulses. All the converged solutions are obtained from simply defined initial guesses. The proposed direct approach is briefly compared with other methods. Finally, we discussed the potential onboard guidance scheme using model predictive control...|$|R

40|$|For many {{problems}} {{it is reasonable}} to expect that the minimum time solution is also the minimum fuel solution.

In general, high thrust transfers resemble the well-known impulsive transfers where the <b>burn</b> <b>arcs</b> are of very short duration. The low and medium thrust transfers differ in that their thrust acceleration levels yield longer <b>burn</b> <b>arcs</b> which will require more revolutions, thus making the low thrust transfer computational intensive. Here, we consider optimal low and medium thrust orbital transfers...|$|R

40|$|Fault arcs in {{electrical}} installations occur extremely seldom. However, {{they can not}} be avoided totally. Insulation failure, flashover, malfunction or maloperation by service personnel can lead to powerful fault arcs. As a result switchgear installations and even substation buildings may be endangered by thermal and mechanical stress. Metal enclosed switchgears can withstand some hundred mbar overpressure, substation buildings e. g. constructed of bricks may be damaged by overpressures exceeding 3 mbar. The goal of this work is the investigation of possibilities to reduce overpressure due to internal arcs especially in switchgear rooms or substation buildings. The following measures are analysed:- pressure relief openings,- intermediate volumes and relief ducts,- fault arc energy absorbers. Encapsulated (gas insulated) switchgears are provided with overpressure relief devices which lead to the switchgear room. After fault arc ignition pressure rises in the compartment where the <b>arc</b> <b>burns</b> (<b>arc</b> room), the relief devices open and the overpressure in the switchgear room rises. The level of overpressure depends significantly on fault arc duration and power, which can be about some 10 MW in distribution systems. The overpressure reduction in the switchgear room can be achieved e. g. by sufficiently dimensioned pressure relief openings. Another possibility is the use of intermediate rooms as buffer volumes or pressure relief ducts, which can be installed on switchgears draining hot gases. Fault arc energy absorbers are cooling grids, which withdraw energy from hot gases generated by the fault arc with the result of overpressure reduction. The overpressure development is analysed by using two available program packages. The first one leads to pressure results, which are averaged values in the volume under consideration. The second one is a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool with three dimensional results. To quantify the effect of fault arc energy absorbers, experiments with a high-current test set-up are performed. The results of these investigations shall contribute to a safe design of measures for overpressure reduction in the case of fault arcs {{in electrical}} installations...|$|R

50|$|The {{causes of}} the tunnel {{explosion}} were reported through witness testimonies and through the formal investigation of the accident. In the formal investigation of the accident there were three possibilities proposed for what could have caused the ignition of the blasting powder: electrical sparks or current, open lanterns, and lighted tobacco pipes. For the topic of electricity, the main focus was on a drill or crowbar touching the power cable, {{or one of the}} cans was brought into direct contact with a low hanging power cable. This theory was concluded to be improbable since there were no drills or crowbars found in the debris and there were no signs of arcing from electricity. It was also concluded that the probability of a crew member placing a powder can {{on the edge of a}} mine cart in just the right spot to touch the power cable was also extremely low, since it would almost have to be done on purpose. The report goes on to conclude that electricity was an improbable cause because of the lack of <b>arc</b> <b>burns</b> on the mine carts and powder cans. The theories of an open lamp or a lit pipe igniting the powder were much more probable, as stated in the report, as lamps were found in the debris and attached to places near where powder would be located. It was also noted that miners would trade blasting powder if they did not bring enough for the day’s job, allowing sparks from lit matches or tobacco pipes to contact the powder.|$|R
50|$|The {{plan was}} that the wire tail would be dragged for about 30 mi across the {{countryside}} and eventually encounter a high-voltage transmission line.

The <b>arc</b> would <b>burn</b> for some time before the transmission line protection operated; {{there was a good}} chance the circuit breaker itself would be damaged and the conductors might burn through due to arcing. This could cause a line to collapse and require repairs. German efforts to protect transmission lines from attack were unsuccessful: neither a new type of line conductor clamp nor different overcurrent protection settings had any useful effect.|$|R
