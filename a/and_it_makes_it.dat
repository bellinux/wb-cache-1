500|$|Regarding if {{they would}} break the fifth season into pods again as with season four, Bell said, [...] "A 22-episode arc is a lot for people to hold onto. By {{breaking}} it up into either smaller arcs or different pods, by introducing a set of antagonists and putting them down, or moving from space to space, our experience has been that it’s something the viewers enjoy, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> a little easier to digest when you’re telling some of these stories." [...] Whedon also noted it would depend on how the season would be [...] "broken up in terms of airing. If everything is running back-to-back, it feels weird to start calling it different things... We will try to have it in bite-sized chunks." [...] The season will begin airing its episodes on December 1, 2017, once Inhumans has aired its eight episodes, with the intent for all 22 episodes to air mostly uninterrupted.|$|E
500|$|Singer James Brown guest {{stars as}} himself. Brown makes an {{appearance}} at the [...] "Do What You Feel" [...] festival, during which he sings his 1965 song [...] "I Got You (I Feel Good)". After a bandstand collapses, he proclaims [...] "Hey, wait a minute, hold on here! This bandstand wasn't double-bolted!" [...] He described the experience as [...] "good, clean, and humorous. And we need more of that around." [...] According to Mirkin, the writers like to give guest stars awkward lines which then sound funny coming from them. They knew Brown would not be [...] "the greatest actor in the world" [...] but still [...] "gave him these incredibly hilarious, stiff lines that killed." [...] Mirkin described Brown's line as [...] "horrible" [...] but because of Brown's reading, [...] "you have something that just sounds perfectly wrong <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> funny." [...] In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes James Brown's performance as [...] "hilariously over-the-top" [...] and uses it {{as an example of}} how the early seasons of the show would include celebrity cameos and not point out the [...] "enormity of their fame".|$|E
2500|$|Wesley {{undergoes}} {{yet another}} drastic personality change in Angels fifth season {{following the death}} of his love, Fred. Denisof believes that the loss of Fred caused Wesley to become understandably [...] "unbalanced". [...] "By the time we get to the last few episodes, he's got a handle on the grief and is functioning in a more level-headed way," [...] says Denisof. [...] "But underlying it is a huge hole in his heart <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> possible for the decision that they make in the final episode. For him emotionally, the stage is set for a life or death battle, possibly for the last time, because at this point, there's nothing more for him to lose." [...] Denisof talked with Whedon about what storylines would have been in place had the television series received another season; Wesley would not have died, and he and Illyria would have featured in an arc in which the transformation of Illyria to Fred would have been extended over many episodes and taken to a [...] "much deeper, darker place" [...] than it briefly was in the late fifth-season episode, [...] "The Girl in Question". Denisof continues, They would have progressed the relationship between Wesley and Illyria in such a way it would conflict with his own feelings for Fred, in a much more profound way. And then we would have gone into the switching of Fred and Illyria and having these two people that he was having these strong feelings about. That {{was going to be a}} fairly long journey in the following season, all of which got abbreviated tremendously when [...] decided to cancel the show. The cancellation of the show was the inspiration for Wesley's death; Whedon gave Denisof the option of keeping the character alive, but Denisof believed killing the character was right for the story, [...] "It was very upsetting to read. It's too good a story because it hurts." ...|$|E

50|$|Indeed, {{some authors}} {{have noticed that}} many signs that people often think are idioms in ASL i.e. OUT-OF-SIGHT, ON-THE-FENCE, FUNNY NONE/FUNNY ZERO, are in fact either sign {{compounds}} with transparent meaning (FUNNY NONE means “not funny”) or single-sense lexical items that either cannot be translated into English by using a single lexical item, or whose translation requires an English idiom. According to Battison in Valli and Lucas 1998, “We can show that things that are often called sign ‘idioms’: are often just ordinary signs {{that are difficult to}} translate into English” (Battison, 1998, p. 225). When compared to the sign “SUCCEED” which is made with two movements, the sign “AT-LAST” is one sharp movement and has historically been called an ASL idiom for the very reason of its non-translatability. But Battison purports that because the “two signs are made differently (they) have different meanings…they are two separate signs.” By “misusing” the term idiom in application to American Sign Language, the result is an “obscure” understanding of how “the language really works <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>make(s)</b> <b>it</b> seem as if the language is unstructured and simple. Of course, {{nothing could be further from}} the truth” (Battison 1998, p. 225).|$|E
