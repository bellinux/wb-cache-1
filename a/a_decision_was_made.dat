5|$|After {{the death}} of George IV in 1830, <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock {{was moved to the}} London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, {{relocated}} to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until {{the death of}} Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning a}} clear victory, and as pursuit became too {{hazardous}} near Wake, American forces retired. Spruance once again withdrew {{to the east}} to refuel his destroyers and rendezvous with the carrier Saratoga, which was ferrying much-needed replacement aircraft. Fletcher transferred his flag to Saratoga {{on the afternoon of}} 8 June and resumed command of the carrier force. For the remainder of that day and then 9 June, Fletcher continued to launch search missions from the three carriers to ensure the Japanese were no longer advancing on Midway. Late on 10 June <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to leave the area and the American carriers eventually returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E

5|$|Before <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to {{establish}} a harbour (now the second largest in Denmark) at Esbjerg in 1868, the area consisted {{of only a few}} farms. Esbjerg developed quickly with the population rising to 13,000 by 1901 and 70,000 by 1970. In addition to its fishing and shipping activities, it also became an important centre for agricultural exports. Over the years, many of the city's visitors have arrived by ferry from Harwich, Essex, England, but this service closed in September 2014 having run since 1875. The harbour facilities are being expanded to answer the needs of the wind-turbine industry and container shipping traffic. Esbjerg is served by Esbjerg Airport with flights to Aberdeen, Scotland and Stavanger, Norway.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} Cold War, NATO's watch {{against the}} Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact did not {{actually}} lead to direct military action. On 1July 1968, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons opened for signature: NATO argued that its nuclear sharing arrangements did not breach the treaty as US forces controlled the weapons until <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to go to war, {{at which point the}} treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that time, and they were not challenged. In May 1978, NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance, to maintain security and pursue détente. This was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further arms race.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, {{as part of}} the {{changing}} Soviet policy towards its ethnic territories, <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to increase the proportion of ethnic Russians in the autonomous oblast. On April10, 1936, the predominantly Russian city of Maykop, as well as Giaginsky District and Khansky Selsoviet of Maykopsky District, became a part of the autonomous oblast (with the selsoviet having been incorporated into Giaginsky District). At the same time, the administrative center of the autonomous oblast was moved from Krasnodar to Maykop. Tuapse, a port on the Black Sea, was considered for the role of the administrative center, but the idea was rejected as it would give the native population access to the sea.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{reduction}} in traffic caused by Cromer's decline in popularity as a holiday destination after World War II, and the closure of many Norfolk railway lines in the 1950s, <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to concentrate all passenger traffic into a single station. Although Cromer High had far better facilities, it was inconveniently situated {{on the edge of}} the town. Therefore, all passenger services were diverted into Cromer Beach (renamed Cromer) and the other stations closed. Following growth of the town as a commuter town to Norwich, a new station called Roughton Road opened in 1985, near the site of the former Cromer High.|$|E
5|$|Idrottsplatsen {{fell into}} decline due to poor {{leadership}} and a troubled {{economy in the}} 1910s, and <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to completely renovate the arena {{with the help of}} outside sponsorship and funding. The construction of the new football ground was started in 1915 and used the site of Idrottsplatsen as foundation. The new stadium, originally named Ullervi, but later changed to Ullevi and finally Gamla Ullevi, was opened in 1916. It was the home ground of IFK Göteborg until 1958, when Nya Ullevi—built for the 1958 World Cup held in Sweden—was opened. Due to a number of seasons with low attendance in Swedish football in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a move back to Gamla Ullevi was made in 1992.|$|E

Amtrak estimated that $1 billion in funds would be necessary to relaunch the service, including over $300 million for new locomotives and rolling stock.

5|$|On Saturday, 5 October 1985, a {{week after}} the Brixton riot, police arrested Floyd Jarrett, a 24-year-old black man from Tottenham, on {{suspicion}} of being in a stolen car. It was a suspicion {{that turned out to be}} groundless, but <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> several hours later to search the home of his mother, Cynthia Jarrett, for stolen goods. In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure. Rose writes that the pathologist, Walter Somerville, told the inquest that Mrs Jarrett had a heart condition that meant she probably only had months to live.|$|E
5|$|Once {{it became}} clear that the {{locomotives}} would be used further afield than the West Country, <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to name the remainder after RAF squadrons, airfields, commanders and aircraft that had participated in the Battle of Britain over Kent, Surrey and Sussex. 'Battle of Britain' nameplates incorporated the name of the locomotive with the class name below, in a design that resembled the wings of an aircraft. This was painted Air Force blue, though other colours were sometimes substituted for the same reasons as above. An enamelled crest of the aircraft, personality or squadron was placed below the nameplate, in the same position as the West Country class equivalent.|$|E
5|$|The I-211 was {{a direct}} descendent of the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210 high-altitude fighter prototype, {{also known as the}} MiG-3-82 or MiG-9. Late in 1941, <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to phase out {{production}} of the Mikulin AM-35A engine used by the MiG-1 and MiG-3 in favor of the Mikulin AM-38 engine used in the Ilyushin Il-2. The MiG design team had already created a version of the MiG-3 called the I-210, using a Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engine instead of the inline, liquid-cooled engine. A number of changes were made in order to accommodate the larger circumference of the radial engine, but the redesign of the engine cowling was a failure and the I-210 proved to be slower than the Yak-1 or the LaGG-3 when it first flew on 23 July 1941.|$|E

5|$|The land {{upon which}} the site was {{developed}} was originally owned by Edward Hilliard. It was chosen in March 1915 by Wing Commander T. O. Lyons of the Air Ministry to house the Ordnance Aircraft Stores Depot from Farnborough, although <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> instead to establish the depot in Didcot, beside the existing buildings there. In 1917, the Ruislip site was revisited, and on 3 July was selected to house a depot for the Royal Flying Corps, under a military acquisition order. The {{close proximity to the}} Great Western and Metropolitan Railways made it ideal for the purpose.|$|E
5|$|When <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> {{to build}} a second hotel next to the Waldorf, truce {{provisions}} were developed between the Astors which reserved some proprietary rights. The plan design used corridors to join the two buildings and {{there was even a}} bond provision for bricking up the corridors should the need arise. On November 1, 1897, Waldorf's cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, opened the 16 story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site. The Astoria, named after Astoria, Oregon which was founded by John Jacob Astor in 1811, stood on the site of William B. Astor’s house, and was leased to Boldt.|$|E
5|$|After {{a request}} from Army Group F to Himmler, <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to move IX SS Mountain Corps and the {{division}} to perform road and railway security duties near Zagreb. This would relieve LXIX Army Corps from those duties {{so that it could}} reinforce a defensive line along the Drina facing the advancing Red Army. The 28th Regiment, I/27 and III/AR 13 were to remain behind at the Brčko bridgehead to keep the Sava river bridge open. The heavy desertions from the division were the main reason for the move from north-east Bosnia to northern Croatia, but it made matters worse: the Bosnians were very reluctant to leave Bosnia and the already serious desertion rate became a flood when the move began on 16 October 1944. Many took their weapons with them and hundreds joined the Partisans. In mid-October, 700 members of the division stationed at Orašje joined the Partisans, and were distributed between the 17th Majevica Brigade and 21st East Bosnian Brigade.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{the outcome}} of the Holbrooke–Tuđman meeting and the {{assessment}} of the HV General Staff that the VRS 2nd Corps was completely destroyed, <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to deploy the HV to the area with virtually no preparation and planning. The assessment of the HV General Staff was based on ARBiH gains in western Bosnia and Herzegovina over the previous four days. The order to attack was drawn up on 17 September and signed by Major General Vinko Vrbanac on behalf of the Chief of the General Staff, General Zvonimir Červenko. The attack, codenamed Operation Una, was to commence with crossings of the Una River at Novi Grad and Bosanska Dubica, and the Sava River at Jasenovac, followed by the seizing of Mount Prosara to allow for further advances towards Prijedor. The operation was intended to be coordinated with the ARBiH 5th Corps, which would continue its rapid advance towards Prijedor and Novi Grad.|$|E
5|$|By February 1945 the {{seventeen}} aircraft of {{the second}} increment were themselves in need of upgrades, particularly those of the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit. Four of the planes assigned to the 393d Bombardment Squadron (now part of the 509th Composite Group) were transferred to the 216th to meet an increase in its testing tempo. Rather than attempt to modify the existing aircraft a few at a time, <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> {{to start a new}} production series. The first five of this third increment, known as Project 98228-S, also went to the test unit. The order totaled an additional 28 aircraft, with delivery of 15 designated combat models for the 393d beginning in April. The final eight were not delivered until after the two atomic bomb missions in August. Two were given to the 216th while the remaining six were assigned to the 509th at Wendover as replacements for any bombers lost while operating from Tinian. Ironically, no bombers were lost during operations from Tinian, but five of these six were lost in crashes over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though as}} many as {{fourteen}} claimants put forward their claims to the title, the real contest was between John Balliol and Robert de Brus. The Scottish magnates made a request to Edward to conduct the proceedings and administer the outcome, but not to arbitrate in the dispute. The actual decision would be made by 104 auditors - 40 appointed by Balliol, 40 by Bruce and the remaining 24 selected by Edward I from {{senior members of the}} Scottish political community. At Birgham, with the prospect of a personal union between the two realms, the question of suzerainty had not been of great importance to Edward. Now he insisted that, if he were to settle the contest, he had to be fully recognised as Scotland's feudal overlord. The Scots were reluctant to make such a concession, and replied that since the country had no king, no one had the authority to make this decision. This problem was circumvented when the competitors agreed that the realm would be handed over to Edward until a rightful heir had been found. After a lengthy hearing, <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> in favour of John Balliol on 17November 1292.|$|E
