Several companies have developed a firing pin block safety. Colt's 80 series uses a trigger operated one and several other manufacturers, including Kimber and Smith & Wesson, use <b>a</b> Swartz firing-pin <b>safety,</b> which is operated by the grip safety. Language cautioning against pulling the trigger with the second finger {{was included in the}} initial M1911 manual, and later manuals up to the 1940s.|$|R
5|$|It is {{strongly}} recommended by diver training organisations and {{codes of practice}} that {{a portion of the}} usable gas of the cylinder be held aside as <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> reserve. The reserve is designed to provide gas for longer than planned decompression stops or to provide time to resolve underwater emergencies.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} readily evaporates to form gaseous nitrogen, {{and hence}} the precautions associated with gaseous nitrogen also apply to liquid nitrogen.

50|$|<b>A</b> grip <b>safety</b> is <b>a</b> lever {{or other}} device {{situated}} on {{the grip of a}} firearm which must be actuated by the operator's hand, as a natural consequence of holding the firearm in a firing position, in order for the firearm to fire. It is usually similar to <b>a</b> manual <b>safety</b> in its function, but is momentary; the safety is deactivated only while the shooter maintains their hold on the grip, and is reactivated immediately once the shooter releases it. The M1911 design is a popular example of a handgun with <b>a</b> grip <b>safety.</b> The Uzi submachine gun is another example of a firearm with <b>a</b> grip <b>safety.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{concrete}} wall was {{built at the}} Grosvenor Road End for over £3,000 in 1956, as <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing. These improvements saw capacity extended to 23,600. Two FA Cup ties against First Division opposition were held at the ground in 1957–58: Birmingham City were beaten 3–0, followed by a 0–0 draw with Bolton Wanderers, which drew a capacity crowd of 23,600. Floodlights were installed at {{the ground in the}} summer of 1959, costing £14,500, a substantial part of which was raised by a supporters' club. They were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United on 28 October 1959, which Newcastle won 8–2 before a crowd of 9,414.|$|E
5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E

5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> is scored, {{the ball}} is put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Jones got a {{scholarship}} to attend Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge, where one of his brothers played football. He stayed there for a year before joining the U.S. Navy as American involvement in World War II intensified. The Navy transferred him to a V-12 training program at Tulane University in New Orleans, where he played as a halfback and <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> in 1943 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|After scoring <b>a</b> <b>safety</b> touch, {{the scoring}} team has {{the option of}} {{taking control of the}} ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick.
