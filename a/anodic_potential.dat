40|$|Microbial {{fuel cell}} (MFC) anodes are {{insoluble}} conductive media serving {{as both the}} terminal electron acceptor and the physical support for the anodophilic biofilm. Bacterial activity and the power output of a MFC are therefore largely depending on {{the capacity of the}} anode to accept electrons from the biofilm. However, our understanding on the bacterial electron transfers in MFC anode is still unclear. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the dependency of the activity of an anodophilic biofilm on the <b>anodic</b> <b>potential</b> in a fed-batch two-chamber computer-controlled MFC. The MFC was operated for over 200 days with acetate as the sole electron donor and ferricyanide as the terminal electron acceptor to establish a highly effective anodophilic biofilm. By controlling the external resistance, steady state microbial activities at various anodic potentials were established at different conditions (e. g. substrate saturating/ starving). Our results suggest the existence of: 1) a critical <b>anodic</b> <b>potential</b> (APcrit.) of ~ - 420 mV/AgAgCl, beyond which a more positive <b>anodic</b> <b>potential</b> no longer stimulates bacterial activity and electricity flow; and 2) a half saturation value of <b>anodic</b> <b>potential</b> (~ - 455 mV/AgAgCl) at which the anodophilic bacteria produce current at half maximum rate.
