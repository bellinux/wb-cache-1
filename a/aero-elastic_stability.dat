40|$|The report {{presents}} {{experimental results}} regarding the <b>aero-elastic</b> <b>stability</b> of a U-shaped profile withan aspect-ratio (along wind length B, frontal height H) of B/H = 4. 65. In the literature {{it can be}} found that a square prism (B/H = 1) can perform galloping oscillations. However, {{this is not the case}} for a flat rectangular prism (B/H = 10). The aspect ratio of the U-beam under consideration here lies between these two values. Additionally, the asymetry of the profile possibly introduces interesting effects.

40|$|Summary. Hydrofoil struts, such {{as might}} be used for {{supporting}} a model in hydrodynamic experiments, are liable to failure through divergence or flutter. This makes the problem of designing a satisfactory strut particularly difficult if high speeds are required and if the struts must be kept thin to avoid cavitation. In the present report the theory developed to describe the <b>aero-elastic</b> <b>stability</b> of aircraft wings is applied to provide predictions of the speeds of onset of the two kinds of instability; in particular a simplified analysis of how the divergence speed depends on strut length and rake is included. The results {{of a series of}} experiments on the variation of divergence speed with strut length and on the variations of divergence speed and flutter speed with rake are presented. The agreement between theory and experiment is satisfactory. 1. Introduction. Thi...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-agent search technique to design an optimal com-posite box-beam helicopter rotor blade. The search technique is called {{particle swarm optimization}} (‘inspired by the choreography of a bird flock’). The contin-uous geometry parameters (cross-sectional dimensions) and discrete ply angles of the box-beams are considered as design variables. The objective of the design prob-lem is to achieve a) specified stiffness value and b) maximum elastic coupling. The presence of maximum elastic coupling in the composite box-beam increases the <b>aero-elastic</b> <b>stability</b> of the helicopter rotor blade. The multi-objective design problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved collectively using particle swarm optimization technique. The optimal geometry and ply angles are ob-tained for a composite box-beam design with ply angle discretizations of 10 ◦, 15 ◦ and 45 ◦. The performance and computational efficiency of the proposed particle swarm optimization approach is compared with various genetic algorithm based design ap-proaches. The simulation results clearly show that the particle swarm optimization algorithm provides better solutions in terms of performance and computational time than the genetic algorithm based approaches.

40|$|Nowadays, {{many modern}} {{countries}} are relying heavily on non-renewable resources. One common example of non-renewable resources is fossil fuel. Non-renewable resources are ?nite resources {{that will eventually}} dwindle, becoming too expensive or too environmentally damaging to retrieve. In contrast, renewable energy resources, like wind energy, are constantly replenished and are important because of the bene?ts it provides for us {{as well as for}} our environment. However, getting the energy from wind must be further investigated {{in order to make the}} usage of wind energy more economically. During the past thirty years, the trend in wind energy is to increase the size of wind turbines for producing more electricity power with lower cost. The increase in size is bene?cial in terms of reduction of manufacturing costs per kW hours and reduction of the ground surface occupied by the wind farms. Further increases in size are not easily achievable because designers are expected to face more unknown technical problems such as <b>aero-elastic</b> <b>stability</b> problems. Therefore, it is important to investigate the <b>aero-elastic</b> <b>stability</b> problem of each new design concept in order to prevent the damage happen. In practice the larger blades have a lower edge-wise frequency that is closer to the ?ap-wise frequency than the case for the smaller blades. This could result in bigger edge-wise vibrations and unexpected aero-elastic problems. Larger blades will also result in large deformations even when the wind turbines are running at the design condition. Furthermore, designing pitch-regulated wind turbines will often result in lightweight and very ?exible blades. The effects of large and ?exible blade are mainly reducing diameter of the rotor during operation and coupling between edge-wise and torsional forces and motion. Most aero-elastic codes for wind turbines do not consider the e?ects of large de?ections in their simulation of the loads and responses. The reduced effective rotor area leads to lower power production than predicted by linear calculations and the coupling between edge-wise and torsional forces and motion will increases pitch moment at the blade pitch system. The problems mentioned above are the current research problems needed to be investigated and solved due to upscaling of the wind turbines. In this research work, nonlinear ?exible multi-body dynamics has been chosen to couple with nonlinear aerodynamics to investigate the current research problems mentioned before. An aero-elastic simulation tool called MBDyn-AeroDyn is developed by integration of two existing code named MBDyn [1] and AeroDyn [2]. MBDyn is a nonlinear ?exible multi-body dynamic code, which can simulate the effect of large de?ections and large rotations. The aerodynamic forces acting on wind turbine blades are calculated using AeroDyn which is based on the blade element-momentum theory. Improvement of aerodynamic calculation has been made by adding a modi?ed Pitt-Peters dynamic in?ow model in AeroDyn. Afterwards, both a linear time invariant system identi?cation method and a linear time periodic system identi?cation method have been used and implemented to investigate the <b>aero-elastic</b> <b>stability</b> of multi-MW wind turbine blades. Finally wind tunnel measurements have been performed in order to validate the aero-elastic simulation tool developed in this work. The validation of this aero-elastic simulation code has been carried out in this thesis. The time domain simulation results show that this aero-elastic simulation tool has good agreement with wind tunnel experiment results at the design operation condition. For the offdesign cases, the differences become larger gradually. Further more, an aero-elastic simulation has been applied on a 5 MW wind turbine. Comparison has been made between FAST and BLADMODE in time domain. The results show that MBDyn-AeroDyn and FAST have a good agreement for an uniform wind ?eld. Finally, ?ap-torsion ?utter analysis on the 5 MW wind turbine has been performed. The main feature of this aero-elastic simulation tool for multi-MW large horizontal axis wind turbines developed in this work is that kinematically large displacements and rotations are included, and that loads are applied on the deformed geometry. This allows the designers to simulate large wind turbines with more ?exible blades to capture the effect of large displacements and rotations more accurately. Another feature is that both a linear time invariant system identi?cation method and a linear time periodic system identi?cation method have been implemented. It allows the designers to analyse stability from the time domain simulation data. From the result of ?ap-torsion ?utter analysis on the 5 MW wind turbine, it is shown that ?ap-torsion ?utter is not likely to occur on this 5 MW wind turbine with the current blade structural properties and intended operating conditions. Considering with the current Ph. D works which have been done so far, ?rstly, another wind tunnel experiment maybe necessary by using the same blades. Future measurement should be made at a higher rotation speed and combined with higher wind speed in order to ?nd the stability boundary of this model wind turbine. Secondly, this aero-elastic simulation tool should be integrated into a knowledge based engineering(KBE) wind turbine blades design environment in order to take advantage of this aero-elastic simulation tool. Further research work should be carried out to simulate wind turbine blades with smart control devices, for example, ?aps on the blades. Last but not the least, an user friendly graphical interface for this tool should be made in order to make it more convenient to use for a wider group of users.

40|$|To {{meet the}} growing demand for {{sustainable}} energy, existing wind turbines {{have to be made}} more powerful and efficient. One of the research topics to achieve this, is the <b>aero-elastic</b> <b>stability</b> limit of the blades. This can be analyzed by the vibrations that occur on the blades during normal operational conditions. In this study high speed photogrammetry is used to measure blade vibrations of a model wind turbine. By placing targets on the blades of the wind turbine and taking images with two synchronized high speed cameras, the motion of the blades is captured. High speed cameras produce a large number of images, making manual target measurements impractical. In this study, it is investigated how target measurements in high speed images can be automated and what accuracy can be obtained for the reconstructed object coordinates. To automate the target measurements, a method is developed based on target detection and tracking. The targets in the images are detected using a threshold histogram segmentation. Since the targets describe a circular motion a circle is used as model to track its position in the sequence of frames. To measure the targets with subpixel precision, the edges of the targets are detected and a circle is fitted to the edges. To reconstruct the object coordinates a Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) is used. The DLT equations are linear and can easily be solved with standard Least Squares Estimation. The developed methods were used for an experiment in a wind tunnel, whereby images of a model wind turbine were made with an acquisition frequency of 500 Hz and a rotational speed of 260 rpm. Retro-reflective targets were put on the blades to identify the measuring points. Using the developed methods, the targets were successfully measured and tracked in the images of the experiment. Using the targets measured in the images, 3 D object coordinates were calculated with an accuracy of 1. 32 millimeter. The vibrations of a target were obtained by means of Principal Component Analyses (PCA). Using PCA, the track of coordinates of a target was transformed to a new coordinate system. The xy plane of this new coordinate system coincided with the rotation plane of the target and the z axis is perpendicular to it, containing the vibrations. The measured vibration had a maximum amplitude of 6 mm, with an accuracy of 0. 56 mm in the vibration component. From the performed experiment with the model wind turbine, it can be concluded that the blade vibrations can be measured using high speed photogrammetry.

40|$|Nowadays modern {{high-rise}} {{buildings have}} unique facades which partly {{rely on the}} incorporation of curtain walls. A curtain-wall system encloses the building to separate {{the internal and external}} environments. It can reduce building weight and it also transfers the wind load to the floor structure of the building. Wind-load codes govern the design of safe curtain wall systems against natural wind forces, considering direct static and dynamic pressure. In this paper aero-elastic considerations are investigated as a potential failure mode of curtain walls. Curtain-wall panels are regarded as comprising a flexible material such as glass and aluminium cladding subjected to an airflow that is parallel to their surface. It is well-known that a flexible panel exposed to increasingly high flow speed will succumb to a divergence, or static buckling-type, instability at a particular critical flow speed. At a higher flow speed the panel will experience violent oscillatory flutter-type instability. Accordingly, we investigate the susceptibility of curtain-wall panels to aero-elastic effects. A state-space model, based upon computational modelling, is used to investigate the <b>aero-elastic</b> <b>stability</b> of each flexible panel in isolation. We briefly present a recently developed approach and its new extension to theoretical modelling of the fully-coupled interaction between a simply-supported flexible panel and a fluid flow. We solve the boundary-value problem to determine the long-time response and investigate the effects on stability of adding localised structural inhomogeneity. Localised structural inhomogeneity is incorporated as an additional single spring type support to the panel. The dependence of instability onset-flow speeds, and the forms of divergence and flutter instabilities, upon the added spring stiffness and its location are then investigated. Results show that the morphology of the unstable solution space significantly differs from that of the oft-studied corresponding hydro-elasticity problem because of the different density ratio between fluid and solid media. Of particular interest is that in the present aero-elastic system flutter occurs through the coalescence of two non-oscillatory unstable divergence modes. The inclusion of a localised spring support to an otherwise unsupported panel is shown to be stabilising with respect to the critical divergence-onset flow speed and the limits to this strategy are identified. This strategy is marginally destabilising with respect to the more damaging flutter instability that occurs at higher wind speeds. However, at a sufficiently high spring-stiffness a sudden change to the solution morphology occurs that yields two unstable non-oscillatory divergence modes and flutter is postponed to much higher wind speeds. We close the paper with an assessment of what these results mean in dimensional terms as applied to different cladding panels. Overall, our results suggest a means to ameliorate adverse aero-elastic effects in potentially disastrous extreme wind-force situations such as those encountered in typhoons and tropical cyclones...|$|E

40|$|Fatigue damage {{calculations}} {{are conducted}} as state-of-art design process for wind turbines. Fatigue analysis is performed on spar caps and trailing edge tape (UD material) considering uni-axial stress state. The main {{objective of the}} research project is to analyze the effect of various parameters like yaw errors, wind turbine design load cases and blade mass imbalances on fatigue damage of blade. Also, an overall structural study of the blade has been performed based on the guidelines of International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) 61400 - 1 Ed. 3 to understand the structural robustness of blade in terms of stiffness and strength. Loads based on an onshore site have been generated using aero-(servo) -elastic code, Fatigue Aerodynamics Structural and Turbulence (FAST). Based on these loads and predominantly linear Finite Element Model (FEM) calculations on a blade model in ANSYS (except for flapwise loading on spar caps), stress time series are calculated. Finally, using these stress time series, the fatigue damage at different blade sections are calculated in ’Octave’ environment using rain-flow cycle counting method and Miner’s rule. Results show that blade is stiff enough from blade-tower interference and resonance per- spective, but buckling is observed in the trailing edge close to the tip, with flapwise buckling mode coming out as the most critical one. Fatigue is not a structural issue based on state-of- art calculations and design load cases, even in the critical transition region (from circular to DU airfoil along the span of the blade). It was found that positive yaw errors are more detri- mental to fatigue life than negative ones for an anti-clockwise rotating turbine. Trailing edge tape is more affected by blade mass imbalance while spar caps are sensitive to changes in yaw errors in terms of fatigue life. Power production design load case is completely dominating fatigue life when compared to start up and shutdown load cases. All the results that have been presented here {{are based on a}} particular wind site conditions, a specific blade and a wind turbine model. The idea has been to give a qualitative and relative overview of different trends in the structural analysis, rather than coming to a conclusion in an absolute sense. Due to the presence of considerable cone angle, shaft tilt and rotor overhang, blade-tower interference is not an issue for the analyzed blade design. It should be, however, considered to increase the trailing edge tape length towards the tip region to prevent buckling issues. Also, extra core materials could be provided (thus increasing bending stiffness and thickness) to prevent buckling problems. Operation of turbine under other significant loading conditions like icing and heavy leading edge erosion should be incorporated to study fatigue in more detail. Fatigue life should be evaluated and validated with models other than Miner’s sum (for example, residual strength degradation model) along with full blade test (for an existent blade) for precise results. An <b>aero-elastic</b> <b>stability</b> analysis of full wind turbine model should be performed to understand the dynamics of whole system on blades. Finally, fatigue damage in bond lines between different components of blade is also a critical consideration for future work.

Aerodynamic computations are carried out by finite difference methods with the use of transonic computer code LTRAN 2. Both indicial and time integration methods are employed for obtaining unsteady coefficients. ^ Aeroelastic equations of motion for the flutter and response analysis are formulated by using the strip theory. Equations are derived for two degrees of freedom system of airfoil, plunging and pitching. Four aeroelastic parameters considered are: airfoil-air mass ratio; plunge to pitch frequency ratio; position of mass center; and position of elastic axis. The flutter solution is obtained by U-g method by solving an eigen value equation. Time response solution is obtained by simultaneously integrating aerodynamic and structural equations of motion by time marching direct integration method. ^ Flutter results are presented in the form of plots of flutter speed and corresponding reduced frequency versus aeroelastic parameters and Mach number. Response results are presented in the form of plots of aerodynamic force and the corresponding structural displacement versus time for various values of airfoil-air mass ratios. ^ For a NACA 64 A 006 conventional airfoil, pitching and plunging aerodynamic and flutter results are obtained at zero angle of attack for various Mach numbers ranging from 0. 7 to 0. 87. Effects of four aeroelastic parameters on flutter speeds are studied. Effect of Mach number on flutter speed is also studied.

Effects of aeroelastic parameters on flutter speed are studied. At design conditions, effects of camber and supercritical thickness distribution on flutter speed are also studied. At zero angle of attack, the effect of Mach number on flutter speed is studied for various values of aeroelastic parameters. Thus, the 2 ̆ 7 transonic dip 2 ̆ 7 phenomenon is investigated. At design Mach number 0. 765, effect of angle of attack on flutter speed is also studied. ^ For a CAST- 7 supercritical airfoil, pitching and plunging, aerodynamic and flutter results are obtained at zero angle of attack for various Mach numbers ranging from 0. 6 to 0. 72. Effect of Mach number on flutter speed for various values of four aeroelastic parameters are studied. Thus the 2 ̆ 7 transonic dip 2 ̆ 7 phenomenon is investigated. ^ In response analysis, force and displacement time responses are obtained for both single- and two-degree of freedom systems. At subsonic Mach number 0. 7, the response results obtained by LTRAN 2 are compared with those obtained by subsonic method based on quasi-steady state theory. The comparison is good. At M = 0. 88, the present results obtained for a single pitching degree of freedom NACA 64 A 006 airfoil compare well with the corresponding results available in literature. For the NACA 64 A 006 airfoil, pitching and plunging at M = 0. 85, converging, diverging and neutrally stable response results are obtained by varying the airfoil-air mass density ratio. These response results are compared with those obtained by U-g method based on time integration, indicial and harmonic methods.
