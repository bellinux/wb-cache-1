We look at general {{characteristics of the}} countries involved such as {{the size of its}} economy and its financial market. We also look at readily available indicators that categorize the prevailing legal environment and the corporate governance structure of firms in the country. Following previous studies we use the geographic distance that should be inversely related to flow of information between the countries, and trading frequency between the countries, a variable that captures commercial interaction in other areas than in securities markets. Using comprehensive data on the aggregate country <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>portfolio</b> investments, we find that the measures {{of the size of the}} financial market dominate all other variables.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how David Cameron has utilised the Prime Ministerial power of ministerial selection and portfolio allocation {{within the context}} of the relationship between party expectations and coalition constraints. Specifically, the paper considers the significance to the Parliamentary Conservative Party of Cameron's use of patronage in terms of proportionality (numbers); portfolio distribution (prestige) and reshuffles (renegotiation of numbers and prestige). It argues that Cameron has been relatively astute in terms of his <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>portfolios</b> to the Liberal Democrats. However, it notes that the constraining impact of coalition has been detrimental to three groups within the PCP: first, those made ministers at a lower level than expected; secondly, those who held shadow ministerial posts in opposition but were overlooked when fewer ministerial roles were available; and, finally, the new intake of 2010 whose career progression has been slower than in previous administrations as fewer reshuffles have occurred...|$|E
40|$|Many {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the mean-variance criterion, conceived by Markowitz (1952), is not optimal for asset allocation, because the investor expected utility function is better proxied by a function that uses higher moments and because returns are distributed in a non-Normal way, being asymmetric and/or leptokurtic, so the mean-variance criterion can not correctly proxy the expected utility with non-Normal returns. In Riccetti (2010) I apply a simple GARCH-copula model and I find that copulas are not useful for choosing among stock indices, but they can be useful in a macro asset allocation model, that is, for choosing the stock and the bond composition of portfolios. In this paper I apply that GARCH-copula model for the macro asset <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>portfolios</b> containing a commodity component. I find that the copula model appears useful and better than the mean-variance one for the macro asset allocation also in presence of a commodity index, even if it is not better than GARCH models on independent univariate series, probably because of the low correlation of the commodity index returns to the stock, the bond and the exchange rate returns.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{intends to}} {{contribute}} to the literature on investment funds in emerging markets by looking at the performance of multimarket funds in Brazil from a manager perspective. The aim of the paper was to analyze whether some characteristics of investment fund managers, as well as their portfolio holdings, can affect fund performance. In emerging countries both portfolio asset allocation and manager characteristics can help explain differences in the fund performance, which increases the relevance of this study. Therefore, the impact of this research lies in its revealing a significant relationship between risk-adjusted return and the portion of portfolios allocated to fixed or variable income, which seems that have not been explored in the context of emerging economies yet. A total of 6, 002 multimarket funds were analyzed, covering the period between September 2009 and December 2015, using panel data with robust standard errors clustered by funds. We also employed robust statistics in order to assess some potential biases due to outliers, by analyzing the breakdown point in the estimated models. It should be noted that portfolio composition (<b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>portfolios</b> into variable income and fixed income) was {{the most important factor in}} explaining a potential change in the performance of Brazilian multimarket funds. Also important were the effectiveness of the management of these funds, that is, the best risk-adjusted returns were delivered by less experienced managers, funds investing more in fixed income, managers with more funds under management, and larger funds...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{seeks to}} add an {{important}} empirical dimension {{to the study of}} coalition and executive politics. In particular, it deals with the value of executive offices in coalition formation and governance and thus contributes to the evaluation of theories of portfolio allocation (Laver and Shepsle 1996) and governing in coalitions (Martin and Vanberg 2011). The key contribution of this article is the following: Empirical and formal scholarship dealing with the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>portfolios</b> has made invaluable contributions {{to our understanding of the}} motivations for parties to join governments, but it has generally not considered ministerial organization below the cabinet level. Due to the limited cross-fertilization between formal coalition theories and academic scholarship on ministerial organization, coalition theories have remained unspecific about the precise nature of the ‚Äòprize‚Äô parties are believed to pursue when entering government. At the same time, students of public administration have done little to build on recent advances in formal coalition theories to study the strategic context of administrative change. Our contribution builds on such work but ultimately seeks to constitute a first step towards a closer marriage of these distinctive traditions of research. The focus of the present piece is empirical. We will go beyond previous work on portfolio allocation by studying variations in the organization of government departments across a sample of German regional state governments during the past two decades and demonstrate that these variations below the cabinet level are too significant to be ignored in empirical studies of portfolio allocation. While we do not wish to generalize too strongly from our sample, our main conclusion ‚Äì namely that meaningful assessments of the ‚Äòvalue‚Äô of ministries in bargaining over government formation require more accurate empirical information on the actual jurisdictions behind the names of ministries than has been used by scholars of coalition politics in the past ‚Äì is clearly in line with empirical work on ministerial organization in other countries (e. g., Pollitt 1983; Rose 1987) ...|$|E
40|$|This book chapter {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} cabinet formation after the German election of 22 September 2013. It starts with the observation that the election of 2013 brought a radical change to the German postwar party system as the FDP disappeared from the Bundestag. Given the likely need for more coalitions across the traditional divide between centre-left and centre-right (for example, grand coalitions of CDU/CSU and SPD or new coalitions between CDU/CSU and Greens), the chapter focuses on mechanisms of conflict management. Based on the comparative literature on the issue, he analyses coalition governance in the new grand coalition under Merkel. After the traditional bargaining between party elites, the SPD conducted a vote of all party members for the ratification of the bargaining result. This was an insurance policy for the party leadership vis-√†-vis its rank and file, a reassurance for the CDU/CSU that the SPD was really committed to the new coalition, and a relatively successful bargaining tactic {{on the part of}} the SPD as it lent credibility to the various 'red lines' formulated by the SPD prior to the negotiations. One key aspect of coalition governance was the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>portfolios.</b> Both parties secured control of those ministries whose jurisdictions were crucial to their attempts to claim issue ownership vis-√†-vis core voters. After some initial support for the grand coalition, the negotiations were accompanied by growing public scepticism. One key point was that the legislative strength of the new coalition would be overwhelming (with around 80 per cent of the seats in the Bundestag), and that the two opposition parties, the Greens and the Left Party, would be too weak to mount a sustained and effective parliamentary opposition. In addition, media commentators missed the ‚Äòbig projects‚Äô which the new government, Merkel III, would tackle. However, the deal the parties agreed on in 2013 seemed more like a package of small, if socially costly, policy measures reminiscent of the collective result of log-rolling. It is also argued that the new coalition is in a precarious situation. Whether it will last its entire term (until 2017) will depend on a number of factors, especially any 'exogenous shocks' that it may be subjected to. In particular, however, it will depend on the parties' constant evaluation of the electoral risks arising from the coalition...|$|E
