40|$|An {{improved}} tensile adhesion button {{has been}} designed and tested that results in higher measured tensile adhesion strength while providing increased capability for testing high strength epoxy adhesive systems. The best attributes of two well-established tensile button designs were combined and refined into an optimized tensile button. The most significant design change to the tensile button was to improve alignment of the bonded tensile button specimens during tensile testing by changing the interface between the tensile button and the tensile test machine. The established or old button design uses a test fixture that pulls from a grooved annulus or <b>anvil</b> <b>head</b> while the new button design pulls from a threaded hole in the centerline of the button. Finite element (FE) analysis showed that asymmetric loading of the established <b>anvil</b> <b>head</b> tensile button significantly increases the stress concentration in the adhesive, causing failure at lower tensile test loads. The new tensile button was designed to eliminate asymmetric loading and eliminate misalignment sensitivity. Enhanced alignment resulted in improved tensile adhesion strength measurement up to 13. 8 MPa (2000 psi) over the established button design. Another design change increased the capability of the button by increasing the threaded hole diameter allowing it to test high strength epoxy systems up to 85 MPa(less than 12, 000 psi). The improved tensile button {{can be used in}} button- to-button or button-to-panel configurations...|$|E
30|$|The {{alternative}} method is intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy. It {{can be performed}} by using either a circular or an endoscopic linear stapler. In total laparoscopic procedures using a conventional circular stapling device, the insertion of the <b>anvil</b> <b>head</b> into the distal esophagus is the most technically challenging and stressful step. To facilitate this step, various “purse-string” procedures have been proposed: Takiguchi et al. (2005) developed a laparoscopic purse-string suture technique using a semiautomatic suturing device, namely the Endostitch (Covidien), while Usui et al. (2008) developed an endoscopic purse-string instrument, called the Endo-PSI (Hope Electronics, Chiba, Japan). Inaba et al. (2010) introduced the “overlapped” esophagojejunostomy, especially designed to reduce the complexity of anastomosis with a circular stapler. Altogether these techniques appear to be technically demanding and time consuming (Shim et al. 2013) and carry a potential risk of increasing the incidence of postoperative complications.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} anvil grasper may {{be difficult}} to use for connecting the stem of an anvil with the centre rod of a circular stapler because the grasper holds the anvil completely still. In addition, the head angle is fixed and cannot handle the <b>anvil</b> <b>head</b> delicately in a tight pelvic space. Many surgeons use a grasper designed for holding the bowel or a dissector for holding the anvil during intra-corporeal circular stapled anastomosis during low anterior resection, sigmoidectomy, left hemi colectomy and know {{that it is difficult to}} connect segments with these instruments due to slipping. A new modified anvil grasper was developed with curved blades that can easily grasp the stem of an anvil and smoothly connect it with the centre rod of the circular stapler. This grasper should be useful for surgeons performing laparoscopic intra-corporeal circular stapled anastomoses, which are the most challenging part of laparoscopic colorectal surgery...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Here {{we report}} {{the method of}} {{anastomosis}} based on double stapling technique (hereinafter, DST) using a trans-oral anvil delivery system (EEATM OrVilTM) for reconstructing the esophagus and lifted jejunum following laparoscopic total gastrectomy or proximal gastric resection. As a basic technique, laparoscopic total gastrectomy employed Roux-en-Y reconstruction, laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy employed double tract reconstruction, and end-to-side anastomosis {{was used for the}} cut-off stump of the esophagus and lifted jejunum. We used EEATM OrVilTM as a device that permitted mechanical purse-string suture similarly to conventional EEA, and endo-Surgitie. After the gastric lymph node dissection, the esophagus was cut off using an automated stapler. EEATM OrVilTM was orally and slowly inserted from the valve tip, and a small hole was created {{at the tip of the}} obliquely cut-off stump with scissors to let the valve tip pass through. Yarn was cut to disconnect the anvil from a tube and the <b>anvil</b> <b>head</b> was retained in the esophagus. The end-Surgitie was inserted at the right subcostal margin, and after the looped-shaped thread was wrapped around the esophageal stump opening, assisting Maryland forceps inserted at the left subcostal and left abdomen were used to grasp the left and right esophageal stump. The surgeon inserted anvil grasping forceps into the right abdomen, and after grasping the esophagus with the forceps, tightened the end Surgitie, thereby completing the purse-string suture on the esophageal stump. The main unit of the automated stapler was inserted from the cut-off stump of the lifted jejunum, and a trocar was made to pass through. To prevent dropout of the small intestines from the automated stapler, the automated stapler and the lifted jejunum were fastened with silk thread, the abdomen was again inflated, and the lifted jejunum was led into the abdominal cavity. When it was confirmed that the automated stapler and center rod were made completely linear, the anvil and the main unit were connected with each other and firing was carried out. Then, DST-based anastomosis was completed with no dog-ear. The method may facilitate safe laparoscopic anastomosis between the esophagus and reconstructed intestine. This is also considered to serve as a useful anastomosis technique for upper levels of the esophagus in laparotomy. </p...|$|E

50|$|In {{the swing}} that precedes each blow, the hammer head stores {{a certain amount}} of kinetic energy—equal to the length D of the swing times the force f {{produced}} by the muscles of the arm and by gravity. When the hammer strikes, the head is stopped by an opposite force coming from the target, equal and opposite to the force applied by the head to the target. If the target is a hard and heavy object, or if it is resting on some sort of <b>anvil,</b> the <b>head</b> can travel only a very short distance d before stopping. Since the stopping force F times that distance must be equal to the head's kinetic energy, it follows that F is much greater than the original driving force f—roughly, by a factor D/d. In this way, great strength is not needed to produce a force strong enough to bend steel, or crack the hardest stone.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, 1955, and 2005, {{excavations}} {{took place}} on the terrain. These established that in the embankment was a dry stone wall about 3 metres wide and up to 2.5 metres high.

About 300 artefacts, including tools, iron wagon parts and tyres are assigned to the La Tène period. The advance rampart is dated to the 8th century. Finds from the Saxon period include two fibulae, spurs, an axe, a knife and a lance <b>head.</b> <b>Anvils,</b> hammers and bronze shavings are evidence of metalworkers.|$|R

5000|$|Meann Ortiz of GMA Network {{gave the}} book a mixed review, {{saying that it}} was {{interesting}} to watch the characters grow up in another installment of the series and praised the cliffhanger ending but that the romantic subplots felt forced: [...] "'Girlfriend' and 'boyfriend' are bandied around more times than necessary to establish who is with whom, that I feel like Riordan drops a Relationship <b>Anvil</b> on my <b>head</b> every time I see those words." [...] Overall, Ortiz found the multiple perspective format tiresome and noted that the plot was very similar to that of previous books, saying it was a [...] "testament to Riordan’s skills that the books never end up being too boring and predictable." [...] A reviewer from The Guardian was less troubled, calling this [...] "the best in the series so far" [...] and praising its [...] "funny bits" [...] while noting that the perspective format was lopsided in favor of Annabeth, Percy and Jason.|$|R
