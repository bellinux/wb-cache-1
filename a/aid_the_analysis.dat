Irving explained that Stern had shown him a diary from April 1945 in which the writing sloped downwards from left to right, and the script of which got smaller along the line.

5000|$|Soundstream’s digital editing {{system was}} the first {{instance}} of a computer used to edit commercial recordings. It consisted of a Digital Equipment PDP 11/60 computer running the DAP (Digital Audio Processor) editing software (written by Soundstream employee Robert Ingebretsen), Soundstream’s interface (the Digital Audio Interface) to transfer data between its recorder and the computer’s disks (a pair of Braegen 14" [...] disk drives), digital-to-analog playback hardware, a text-based video display terminal for entering commands to operate and control the DAP software, and a storage oscilloscope to display the waveforms of the audio being edited or processed. For all intents and purposes, this system was the very first digital audio workstation. In addition to its own facility, Soundstream installed editing systems at Paramount Pictures (Hollywood), RCA (New York), and Bertelsmann (Germany). A system was delivered to the U.S. Department of Justice to <b>aid</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> of bootleg recordings.|$|E

San Antonio Express-News discussed the role of grass-roots photojournalism, the September 11 Photo Project and other exhibits that showcase them and how they fill “an important human need.” Karal Ann Marling, a professor of art history and a cultural historian at the University of Michigan, was quoted as saying, “among other things, it’s a bearing of witness. It’s kind of like the Jewish custom of leaving a pebble on a grave. Taking those pictures, going to the place to see with one’s own eye as opposed to seeing it mediated through television or newspapers, is very important.” [...] The Photo Project became so comprehensive that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) asked for access to <b>aid</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> of how the events progressed.|$|E

5000|$|Brinkman's current {{research}} interests center around improving {{understanding of how}} microbes evolve and improving computational methods that <b>aid</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> of microbes {{and the development of}} new vaccines, drugs and diagnostics for infectious diseases. Increasingly her methods have been applied for more environmental applications. She is noted for developing PSORTb, the most precise method available for computational protein subcellular localization prediction and the first computational method that exceeded the accuracy of some common high-throughput laboratory methods for such subcellular localization analysis. This method aids the prediction of cell surface and secreted proteins in a bacterial cell that may be suitable drug targets, vaccine components or diagnostics. She has also developed bioinformatics methods that aid the more accurate identification of genomic islands (i.e. IslandViewer) and orthologs (i.e. OrtholugeDB) [...] Her research has provided new insights into the evolution of pathogens and the role that horizontal gene transfer and genomic islands play. She confirmed the anecdotal assumption that virulence factors (disease-causing genes in pathogens) are disproportionately associated with genomic islands. She was among the first researchers to use whole genome sequencing to aid infectious disease outbreak investigations ("genomic epidemiology"), integrating genome sequence data with social network analysis. She was involved in the Pseudomonas Genome Project and is the coordinator of the Pseudomonas Genome Database, a database of Pseudomonas species genomic data and associated annotations that is continually updated. She has also developed databases (i.e. InnateDB and the Allergy and Asthma Portal) to aid more systems-based analysis of immune disorders and the immune response to infections in humans and other animals - databases that have aided the identification of new immune-modulating therapeutics. She has a long-standing interest in bioinformatics training, improving the curation of biological/bioinformatics data, and developing effective bioinformatics data standards and databases. She is a Thomson Reuter's Highly Cited Researcher, a member of national committees and Boards such as the Genome Canada Board of Directors, and has been Research Director for several Genomics projects. She has a growing interest in applying her methods to environmental applications {{as part of a broader}} interest in developing approaches for more holistic, sustainable infectious disease control and microbiome conservation - developing approaches that may select less for antimicrobial resistance, improve the tracking of pathogens and their origins, and better factor in the important role of societal changes and the environment in shaping microbiomes ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{computational}} {{model of a}} multilayered amperometric biosensor is presented in this paper. Models of biosensors usually simplifies the electrochemistry of biosensors considering that all electrochemical reactions have infinite rates. While in most cases such approximations are tolerable, at lower electrode potentials these models would not be accurate enough. The model proposed in this paper models the electrochemistry occurring during the biosensor operation more accurately, using the Butler-Volmer equation. Computational experiments showed that models with the Butler-Volmer equation may be valuable tools <b>aiding</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> of <b>the</b> electrochemistry of amperometric biosensors.

40|$|Abstract. Monitoring human-computer {{interaction}} <b>aids</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> for understanding how well software meets its purpose. In particular, monitoring {{human-computer interaction}}s {{with respect to}} a user’s goal model helps to determine user satisfaction. By formalizing a goal model, runtime monitors can be automatically derived. The REQMON system monitors the satisfaction of goal models. Recently, an OCL compiler was developed for REQMON. The OCL was extended slightly to address temporal and real-time constraints. Now, goal models can be represented in the extended OCL, from which runtime monitors can be compiled. The resulting REQMON system appears to be easier to use. ...|$|R
