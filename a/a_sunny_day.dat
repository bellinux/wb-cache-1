5|$|While {{the root}} of the parsnip is edible, {{handling}} the shoots and leaves of the plant requires caution as the sap is toxic. Like many other members of the family Apiaceae, the parsnip contains furanocoumarins as a defense against herbivory, photosensitive chemicals that causes a condition known as phytophotodermatitis. The condition is a type of chemical burn rather than an allergic reaction, and is similar to the rash caused by poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Symptoms include redness, burning, and blisters; afflicted areas can remain discolored for up to two years. Reports of gardeners experiencing toxic symptoms after coming into contact with foliage have been made but these have been small in number compared to {{the number of people who}} grow the crop. The problem is most likely to occur on <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>day</b> when gathering foliage or pulling up old plants that have gone to seed. The symptoms have mostly been mild to moderate.|$|E

25|$|Ellis {{started out}} in {{department}} store retailing in the Richmond, Virginia, area to gain experience in the fashion industry as a buyer and merchandiser at the department store Miller & Rhoads. While there, he was co-founder of Richmond retail shop <b>A</b> <b>Sunny</b> <b>Day.</b> He later joined the sportswear company John Meyer of Norwich in New York City. Eventually, in the mid-1970s, he was approached by his then employer, The Vera Companies, famous for their polyester double-knit pantsuits, to design a fashion collection for them. Soon after that, Ellis presented his first women's sportswear line, called Portfolio, in November 1976. Although he could not sketch, he knew exactly how the industry worked and proved a master of innovative ideas who created 'new classics' that American women longed for at the time.|$|E
25|$|Spirit-Eater (Grim Tuesday, Drowned Wednesday, Sir Thursday) — a {{creature}} made by sorceries and a seed item {{belonging to the}} person whose physical form it assumes, being designed to imitate them. It requires a year of House Time to grow from Nothing. It can grow mentally conducive mold on people and can only be destroyed if its seed item is plunged into Nothing. The mold originates from the (fictional) planet called Avraxyn; its mutant form, present in Spirit-Eaters, is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact between and only between the Spirit-Eater and natural beings, wherein after it communicates knowledge of its model to the former. A Spirit-Eater's true form varies and can only be seen through a veil of raindrops on <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>day.</b> At all other times, it resembles its model. Its technical name is 'Cocigrue', which it shares with a legendary monster called Cocquigrue or Coquecigrue.|$|E

25|$|The {{required}} {{exposure time}} {{depended on the}} lighting conditions, {{the sensitivity of the}} photographic plate, and the camera lens aperture used. In a letter to Leo Tolstoy requesting a portrait sitting, Prokudin-Gorsky described the exposure as taking one to three seconds, but later, when recollecting his time with Tolstoy, he described a six-second exposure on <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>day.</b> Blaise Agüera y Arcas studied one landscape view, photographed in broad daylight but showing a clear, well-defined moon, and used the moon's movement to estimate that the whole procedure of three filtered exposures and two repositionings of the camera's plate holder had taken over a minute. The lens aperture Prokudin-Gorsky chose to use greatly affected the exposure time required. A small aperture is often used for landscape photography because it allows objects at various distances to all be sharply imaged at the same time, while the use of a large aperture is common for portraiture and plainly evident in the Tolstoy portrait. All other factors being equal, if for example a 16-second exposure was required when using a 1/4-inch-diameter aperture, an exposure of only 1 second would suffice with a 1-inch aperture.|$|E

[...] The sundial, another early clock, relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of the hour on <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>day.</b> [...] It is not so useful in cloudy weather or at night and requires recalibration as the seasons change (if the gnomon was not aligned with the Earth's axis).|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from its}} {{commercial}} performance, the album's composition {{has continued to}} receive acclaim for its sonic innovation. Upon its 25th anniversary, music critic and scholar Joseph Vogel observed that when viewed [...] "as a complete artistic statement, Rhythm Nation 1814 was a stunning achievement. It married the pleasures of pop with the street energy and edge of hip-hop." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly asserted the record [...] "has barely aged—it sounds as rich and vital as it did {{when it was first}} released, and stylistically as contemporary as anything on the Billboard charts." [...] Anderson also underscores that it pioneered several musical trends, citing records by pop and R artists including Rihanna, Pink, Beyoncé, Frank Ocean, Gwen Stefani, The Weeknd, Lady Gaga, Jhené Aiko, Miguel, Christina Aguilera, FKA Twigs, and Tinashe that have exhibited similarities to the [...] "landmark" [...] album. Its single for [...] "Alright" [...] featuring Heavy D made Jackson the first pop artist to team with a rapper, [...] "setting the trend for future pop and hip-hop collaborations." [...] Additionally, [...] "Black Cat" [...] set a precedent for female pop stars segueing into glam metal. The album notably influenced Michael Jackson's Dangerous (1991) and [...] (1995), the latter of which features the sibling's duet [...] "Scream", produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Its impact also extends to indie and alternative rock music, with School of Seven Bells, <b>A</b> <b>Sunny</b> <b>Day</b> in Glasgow, and Alexis Krauss of Sleigh Bells citing the album as an influence in their work. MTV's Brenna Ehrlich remarked: [...] "From Beyoncé... to Britney Spears to Robyn to Sleigh Bells, the influence of Jackson's game-changer of a record is still rippling through the radio waves (or SoundCloud waves) today." ...|$|E
