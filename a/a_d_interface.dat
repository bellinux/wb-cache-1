The motivation {{for this work}} {{is to provide a}} parallel numerical algorithm for a system of PDEs that are the basic model equations for the simulation of semiconductor devices such as transistors and sensors. Moreover, discontinuities or jumps in the potential and its normal derivative at <b>a</b> 2 <b>d</b> surface are included for the simulation of nanowire sensors based on a homogenized model. Using the feti method, these jump conditions can be included with the usual numerical properties and the original Farhat-Roux feti method is extended to the drift-diffusion-Poisson equations including discontinuities. We show two numerical examples. The first example verifies the correct implementation including the discontinuities on <b>a</b> 2 <b>d</b> grid divided into eight subdomains.

40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly easy to bring the body directly to digital form via stereoscopic immmersive displays and tracked input devices. Is this space a viable one in which to construct 3 <b>d</b> objects? <b>Interfaces</b> built upon two-dimensional displays and 2 d input devices are the current standard for spatial construction, yet 3 <b>d</b> <b>interfaces,</b> where the dimensionality of the interactive space matches that of the design space, have something unique to offer. This work increases the richness of 3 <b>d</b> <b>interfaces</b> by bringing several new tools into the picture: the hand is used directly to trace surfaces; tangible tongs grab, stretch, and rotate shapes; a handle becomes a lightsaber and a tool for dropping simple objects; and a raygun, analagous to the mouse, is used to select distant things. With these tools, <b>a</b> richer 3 <b>d</b> <b>interface</b> is constructed in which a variety of objects are created by novice users with relative ease. What we see is a space, not exactly like the traditional 2 d computer, but rather one in which a distinct and different set of operations is easy and natural. Design studies, complemented by user studies, explore the larger space of three-dimensional input possibilities. The target applications are spatial arrangment, freeform shape construction, and molecular design. New possibilities for spatial construction develop alongside particular nuances of input devices and the interactions they support. Task-specific tangible controllers provide a cultural affordance which links input devices to deep histories of tool use, enhancing intuition and affective connection within an interface. On a more practical, but still emotional level, these input devices frame kinesthetic space, resulting in high-bandwidth interactions where large amounts of data can be comfortably and quickly communicated. A crucial issue with this interface approach is the tension between specific and generic input devices. Generic devices are the tradition in computing [...] versatile, remappable, frequently bereft of culture or relevance to the task at hand. Specific interfaces are an emerging trend [...] customized, culturally rich, to date these systems have been tightly linked to a single application, limiting their widespread use. The theoretical heart of this thesis, and its chief contribution to interface research at large is an approach to customization. Instead of matching an application domain's data, each new input device supports a functional class. The spatial construction task is split into four types of manipulation: grabbing, pointing, holding, and rubbing. Each of these action classes spans the space of spatial construction, allowing a single tool {{to be used in}} many settings without losing the unique strengths of its specific form. Outside of 3 <b>d</b> <b>interface,</b> outside of spatial construction, this approach strikes a balance between generic and specific suitable for many interface scenarios. In practice, these specific function groups are given versatility via a quick remapping technique which allows one physical tool to perform many digital tasks. For example, the handle can be quickly remapped from a lightsaber that cuts shapes to tools that place simple platonic solids, erase portions of objects, and draw double-helices in space. The contributions of this work lie both in a theoretical model of spatial interaction, and input devices (combined with new interactions) which illustrate the efficacy of this philosophy. This research brings the new results of Tangible User Interface to the field of Virtual Reality. We find a space, in and around the hand, where full-fledged haptics are not necessary for users physically connect with digital form. ...|$|R

Whereas spacecraft tanks are traditionally designed primarily to store fluids and only secondarily to provide other benefits, multifunctional tanks {{are designed to}} simultaneously provide multiple primary benefits. In addition {{to one or more}} chamber(s) for storage of fluids, a multifunctional tank could provide any or all of the following: a) Passageways for transferring the fluids; b) Part or all of the primary structure of a spacecraft; c) All or part of <b>an</b> enclosure; <b>d)</b> Mechanical <b>interfaces</b> to components, subsystems, and/or systems; e) Paths and surfaces for transferring heat; f) Shielding against space radiation; j) Shielding against electromagnetic interference; h) Electrically conductive paths and surfaces; and i) Shades and baffles to protect against sunlight and/or other undesired light. Many different multifunctional-tank designs are conceivable. The design of a particular tank can be tailored to the requirements for the spacecraft in which the tank is to be installed.

Aiming at overcoming {{the limitations of}} the existing channel assignment and routing algorithms, J-CAR negotiates a channel at each active link during the route setup process. It has the following major features: a) a pre-determined common control channel is used by every node for routing and channel negotiation; b) control packets for data transmission (RTS, CTS & ACK) are carried by the associated data channels; c) the spare capacity on the control channel can be used for data transmission; <b>d)</b> <b>an</b> <b>interface</b> is free to change its working modes between send and receive; and e) an interface can tune to any data channels for data sending or receiving at the cost of switching overhead.

40|$|For a fixed {{rational}} number g {{is not an}} element of {- 1, 0, 1 } and integers <b>a</b> and <b>d</b> we consider the set N-g (<b>a,</b> <b>d)</b> of primes p for which the order of g(mod p) is congruent to a(mod d). It is shown, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH), that this set has a natural density delta(g) (<b>a,</b> <b>d).</b> Moreover, delta(g) (<b>a,</b> <b>d)</b> is computed in terms of degrees of certain Kummer extensions. Several properties of delta(g) (<b>a,</b> <b>d)</b> are established in case <b>d</b> is <b>a</b> power of an odd prime. The result for a = 0 sheds some {{new light on the}} well-researched case where one requires the order to be divisible by d (with d arbitrary) ...|$|R

40|$|Let G = (V, E) be a graph {{of order}} n. Let f : V → { 1, 2, [...] .,n} be a bijection. For any vertex v ∈ V, the {{neighbor}} sum u∈N(v) f(u) {{is called the}} weight of the vertex v and is denoted by w(v). If w(v) = k, (a constant) for all v ∈ V, then f is called a distance magic labeling with magic constant k. If the set of vertex weights forms an arithmetic progression {a, <b>a</b> + <b>d,</b> <b>a</b> + 2 <b>d,...,</b> <b>a</b> + (n − 1) d}, then f is called <b>an</b> (<b>a,</b> <b>d)</b> -distance antimagic labeling and a graph which admits such a labeling is called <b>an</b> (<b>a,</b> <b>d)</b> -distance antimagic graph.

40|$|We {{present the}} ﬁrst {{computational}} study employing a full quantum transport model {{to investigate the}} effect of interface traps in nanowire InAs Tunnel FETs and MOSFETs. To this purpose, we introduced a description of interface traps in a simulator based on the NEGF formalism and on a 8 × 8 k·p Hamiltonian and accounting for phonon scattering. Our results show that: (a) even a single trap can detereorate the inverse sub-threshold slope (SS) of a nanowire InAs Tunnel FET; (b) the inelastic phonon assisted tunneling (PAT) through interface traps results in a temperature dependence of the Tunnel FETs IV characteristics; (c) the impact of interface traps on Iof f is larger in Tunnel FETs than in MOSFETs; (<b>d)</b> <b>interface</b> traps represent <b>a</b> sizable source of device variability...|$|R
40|$|Strong Coulomb {{repulsion}} and spin-orbit coupling {{are known}} to give rise to exotic physical phenomena in transition metal oxides. Initial attempts to investigate systems where both of these fundamental interactions are comparably strong, such as 3 d and 5 d complex oxide superlattices, have revealed properties that only slightly differ from the bulk ones of the constituent materials. Here, we observe that the interfacial coupling between the 3 d antiferromagnetic insulator SrMnO 3 and the 5 d paramagnetic metal SrIrO 3 is enormously strong, yielding an anomalous Hall response {{as the result of}} charge transfer driven interfacial ferromagnetism. These findings show that low dimensional spin-orbit entangled 3 d- 5 <b>d</b> <b>interfaces</b> provide <b>an</b> avenue to uncover technologically relevant physical phenomena unattainable in bulk materials...|$|R
