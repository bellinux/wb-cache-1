Primary emissions of total (TFe) and dissolved (DFe) Fe associated with dust and combustion processes are also taken into account, with TFe mineral emissions calculated to amount to ~ 35 Tg-Fe yr − 1 and TFe emissions from combustion sources of ~ 2 Tg-Fe yr − 1. The model reasonably simulates the available Fe observations, supporting the reliability of the results of this study. Proton- and organic ligand-promoted Fe dissolution in present-day TM 4 -ECPL simulations is calculated to be ~ 0. 175 Tg-Fe yr − 1, approximately half of the calculated total primary DFe emissions from mineral and combustion sources in the model (~ 0. 322 Tg-Fe yr − 1). The atmospheric burden of DFe is calculated to be ~ 0. 024 Tg-Fe. DFe deposition presents strong spatial and temporal variability with an annual flux of ~ 0. 496 Tg-Fe yr − 1, from which about 40 % (~ 0. 191 Tg-Fe yr − 1) is deposited over the ocean. The impact of air quality on Fe deposition is studied by performing sensitivity simulations using preindustrial (year 1850), present (year 2008) and future (year 2100) emission scenarios. These simulations indicate that about a 3 times increase in Fe dissolution may have occurred in the past 150 years due to increasing anthropogenic emissions and thus <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acidity.</b> Air-quality regulations of anthropogenic emissions are projected to decrease <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acidity</b> in the near future, reducing to about half the dust-Fe dissolution relative to the present day. The organic ligand contribution to Fe dissolution shows an inverse relationship to the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acidity,</b> thus its importance has decreased since the preindustrial period but is projected to increase in the future. The calculated changes also show that the atmospheric DFe supply to the globe has more than doubled since the preindustrial period due to 8 -fold increases in the primary non-dust emissions and about a 3 -fold increase in the dust-Fe dissolution flux. However, in the future the DFe deposition flux is expected to decrease (by about 25 %) due to reductions in the primary non-dust emissions (about 15 %) and in the dust-Fe dissolution flux (about 55 %). The present level of atmospheric deposition of DFe over the global ocean is calculated to be about 3 times higher than for 1850 emissions, and about a 30 % decrease is projected for 2100 emissions. These changes are expected to impact most on the high-nutrient–low-chlorophyll oceanic regions...|$|E

This research has focused on vulnerable base-poor systems; catchments on alkaline lithologies have received little attention. In regions of high acid loadings, however, even well-buffered catchments are susceptible to forest decline and episodes of low alkalinity in streamwater. As part of a collaboration between the Czech and U. S. Geological Surveys, we compared biogeochemical patterns in two well-studied, well-buffered catchments: Pluhuv Bor in the western Czech Republic, which has received high loading of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acidity,</b> and Sleepers River Research Watershed in Vermont, U.

Despite differences in lithology, wetness, forest type, and glacial history, the catchments displayed similar patterns of solute concentrations and flow.

Sulfate diluted with increasing flow at Sleepers River, while at Pluhuv Bor the sulfate-flow relation shifted from positive to negative as atmospheric sulfur (S) loadings decreased and soil S pools were depleted during the 1990 s.

Rainfall pH measurements and chemical compositions monitored {{on the island of}} Bermuda since 1980, and a long-term seawater CO 2 time-series (1983 – 2005) in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda were used to evaluate the influence of acidic deposition on the acidification of oligotrophic waters of the North Atlantic Ocean and coastal waters of the coral reef ecosystem of Bermuda. Since the early 1980 's, the average annual wet deposition of acidity at Bermuda was 15 ± 14 mmol m? 2 year? 1, while surface seawater pH decreased by 0. 0017 ± 0. 0001 pH units each year. The gradual acidification of subtropical gyre waters was primarily due to uptake of anthropogenic CO 2.

The geochemical model MAGIC {{was applied to}} estimate streamwater and soil chemistry between 1851 and 2030 at the Lysina catchment, an acid-sensitive granitic catchment covered by planted Norway spruce monoculture in the western Czech Republic. The total deposition of sulfur to the catchment was 164 meq m 2 in 1991, but had declined to 52 meq m 2 by 2000. Although SO 2 emissions in the region declined by 90 % compared to the 1980 s, acidification recovery was small within the period 1990 – 2000. Stream pH increased only slightly (from 3. 92 to 4. 07), although SO 4 concentration declined sharply from 568 meq l 1 (1990) to 232 meq l 1 (2000). Organic acids {{played an important role}} in streamwater buffering. According to the MAGIC prediction using deposition measured in 1999 – 2000, streamwater pH will increase to 4. 3 and soil base saturation will increase to 6. 2 % by 2030 (from 5. 7 % in 2002). Pre-industrial pH was estimated to be 5. 5 and soil base saturation 24. 7 %.

40|$|The acidity of rain is {{coupled to}} redox {{reactions}} in air and in atmospheric water. The pH, an intensive quantity, {{needs to be}} distinguished from the base neutralizing capacity. For acidic rain observed at most locations, H_ 2 SO_ 4, HNO_ 3, NH_ 3, and CaCO_ 3 are dominant components. Their local availability or production rates govern net acidity. pH is thus almost entirely determined by these major "strong" components imposed on a CO_ 2 background, with some influence by SO_ 2 (aq), smaller concentrations of HNO_ 2 and weak organic acids and minor bases, e. g., Fe_ 2 O_ 3, yielding acid aquo metal ions. Total global emissions to tfie atmosphere of H_ 2 SO_ 4 precursors outweigh those of HNO_ 3 {{by a factor of}} 2 - 3 on an equivalent basis.

40|$|Compared to conifers, {{broadleaf}} {{forests are}} {{less prone to}} soil and water acidification, because (1) they often have soils with larger exchangeable base cation pools, (2) the pollution scavenging capacity of deciduous trees is lower, and (3) they grow more slowly and are often less intensively managed. Since the 1980 s, <b>atmospheric</b> deposition <b>acidity</b> has strongly decreased in forest ecosystems, so that the present acidification status of broadleaf forests should be improving. We used a 35 year-old beech plot in the Morvan Mountains (Burgundy, France) to question past and present acidification processes in broadleaf ecosystems. Soil exchangeable Mg, Ca and K pools measured from samples collected in 1974 and 2001 were compared and input-output budgets were computed over the 2003 - 2008 period. The objectives were (i) to assess Mg and Ca pool size changes over 1974 - 2008, (ii) to discuss the potential causes of these changes and, (iii) discuss the limits of conventional methods to study nutrient pool size changes (soil data comparison and nutrient budgets). Soil exchangeable Mg pools decreased during the 1974 - 2001 period while Ca and K pools remained constant, and very small. Soil solution monitoring and input-output budgets over the 2003 - 2008 period suggested an ongoing loss of exchangeable Ca and Mg, {{partly due to the}} desorption of sulphate from the soil which induced Mg, Ca and K depletion. Given the very low concentration in exchangeable base cations, and assuming no change in soil spatial variability, we computed that resampling soils at 10 years intervals may not unequivocally demonstrate a gain/loss of exchangeable base cations. Foliar Mg concentrations were continuously below the deficiency level, K and N concentrations decreased but Ca did not. From this, we discuss the validity/limits of the different approaches used, how the ecosystem can cope with such low levels of nutrients, and the fluxes and processes within the ecosystem that should be investigated in this perspective.

40|$|<b>Atmospheric</b> <b>acidity</b> as HNO 3 (g), SO 2 (g), and aerosol H+ was {{measured}} on Allegheny Mountain and Laurel Hill in southwest Pennsylvania in August 1983. The aerosol H+ appeared {{to represent the}} net after H 2 SO 4 reaction with NH 3 (g). The resulting H+/SO 42 - ratio depended on SO 42 - concentration, approaching that of H 2 SO 4 at the highest SO 42 - concentrations. The atmosphere was acidic; the average concentrations of HNO 3 (78 nmole m- 3) and aerosol H+ (205 nmole m- 3), NH 4 + (172 nmole m- 3) and SO 42 - (201 nmole m- 3), and the dearth of NH 3 (- 3), show that the proton acidity (HNO 3, H 2 SO 4) of the air exceeded the acid-neutralizing capacity of the air {{by a factor of}} > 2, with one 10 -h period averaging 263 and 844 nmolem- 3 for HNO 3 and aerosol H+, respectively. SO 2 added another 900 nmole m- 3 (average) of potential H+ acidity. HNO 3 and aerosol H+ episodes were concurrent, on 7 - 8 day cycles, unrelated to SO 2 which existed more in short-lived bursts of apparently more local origin. NOx was sporadic like SO 2. Laurel and Allegheny, separated by 35. 5 km, were essentially identical in aerosol SO 42 -, and in aerosol H+, less so in HNO 3 and especially less so in SO 2; apparently, chemistry involving HNO 3 and aerosol H+ or SO 42 - was slow compared to inter-site transport times (1 - 2 h). From growth of bscat and decline of SO 2 during one instance of inter-site transport, daytime rate coefficients for SO 2 oxidation and SO 2 dry deposition were inferred to have been, respectively, ~ 0. 05 and [les] 0. 1 h- 1. HNO 3 declined at night. Aerosol H+ and SO 42 - showed no significant diurnal variation, and O 3 showed very little; these observations, together with high PAN/NOx ratios, indicate that regional transport rather than local chemistry is governing. The O 3 concentration (average 56 ppb or 2178 nmolem- 3) connotes an oxidizing atmosphere conducive to acid formation. Highest <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acidity</b> was associated with (1) slow westerly winds traversing westward SO 2 source areas, (2) local stagnation, or (3) regional transport around to the back side of a high pressure system. Low acidity was associated with fast-moving air masses and with winds from the northerly directions; upwind precipitation also played a moderating role in air parcel acidity. Much of the SO 2 and NOx, and ultimately of the HNO 3 and aerosol H+, appeared to originate from coal-fired power plants. An automotive contribution to the NOx and HNO 3 could not be discerned. Size distributions of aerosol H+ and SO 42 - were alike, with MMED ~ 0. 7 [mu]m, in the optimum range for efficient light scattering and inefficient wet/dry removal. Thus, light scattering and visual range degradation were attributable to the acidic SO 42 - aerosol, linking the issues of acid deposition and visual air quality in the Northeast. With inefficient removal of aerosol H+, and inefficient night-time removal of HNO 3, strong acids may be capable of long-distance transport in the lower troposphere. We obtained an accounting of aerosol mass in terms of composition, including aerosol H 2 O which was shown to account for much of the light scattering...|$|E

Oxalic acid is globally {{the most abundant}} dicarboxylic acid, formed via chemical oxidation of gas-phase precursors in the aqueous phase of aerosols and droplets. Its lifecycle and atmospheric global distribution remain highly uncertain and {{are the focus of}} this study. The first global spatial and temporal distribution of oxalate, simulated using a state-of-the-art aqueous phase chemical scheme embedded within the global 3 -dimensional chemistry/transport model TM 4 -ECPL, is here presented. The model accounts for comprehensive gas-phase chemistry and its coupling with major aerosol constituents (including secondary organic aerosol). Model results are consistent with ambient observations of oxalate at rural and remote locations (slope = 0. 83 ± 0. 06, r 2 = 0. 67, N = 106) and suggest that aqueous phase chemistry contributes significantly to the global atmospheric burden of secondary organic aerosol. In TM 4 -ECPL most oxalate is formed in-clouds and less than 10 % is produced in aerosol water. About 61 % of the oxalate is removed via wet deposition, 35 % by in-cloud reaction with hydroxyl radical and 4 % by dry deposition. The global oxalate net chemical production is calculated to be about 17 – 27 Tg yr− 1 with almost 91 % originating from biogenic hydrocarbons, mainly isoprene. This condensed phase net source of oxalate in conjunction with a global mean turnover time against deposition of about 5 days, maintain oxalate's global tropospheric burden of 0. 24 – 0. 39 Tg that is about 13 – 19 % of calculated total organic aerosol burden...|$|E

Although {{the importance of this}} reaction for the global sulphur cycle, the influence of DMS on <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acidity</b> and the possible effect on climate regulation have been widely recognised, our knowledge of DMSP lyases is limited to just a few studies. Activity measurements of DMSP lyases offer an important step towards {{a better understanding of the}} conditions under which DMS is produced. In the available published data somewhat similar methods have been used before, but a critical examination of the method limitations has not been reported. To encourage further research on this enzyme, we suggest and detail two protocols for measurements of DMSP lyase activity: An in vitro assay for crude cell extracts or purified enzyme and an in vivo method for whole cells, which we recently Started to use. After addition of DMSP, samples incubated in a gas tight vial may produce DMS from enzymatic cleavage under suitable conditions, and a DMS production rate can be estimated from time-series measurements of DMS in the headspace of the vial. Headspace analysis of DMS is a useful and rapid technique to estimate and compare DMSP lyase activities from different sources. The relative rates of DMS production in the liquid and of the gas transfer between liquid and headspace, determine the rate of DMS production measured via headspace analysis. If DMS production in the liquid is higher than the rate of transfer, headspace measurements will not reflect the actual amount of DMS produced in the liquid. In this case, extracts have to be diluted to a level thai ensures linearity between dilution factor and reduction of enzyme activity. Additionally, incubation volumes and vials should be selected to provide a high surface-to-volume ratio to ensure maximum flux of DMS from the aqueous phase into the headspace. The methods can be adapted to further investigate species- and strain-specific activities, biogeographical distribution, cellular location and biochemical properties of various DMSP lyases.

The PM 10 (PM 10 ? 2. 5 +PM 2. 5) mass concentrations at 1. 5 m above ground {{were found to be}} approximately 20 % higher compared to the respective PM 10 measured at 5 m.

Such data are presented for the first time for the centre of Athens. In both campaigns, calcium was found to be the predominant component of the coarse fraction while crust-related aluminosilicates and iron were found to be the other major components of the same fraction. The above elements constitute the most important components of the fine fraction, together with the predominant sulphur. Toxic metals were found to be below the air quality limits and in lower concentrations compared to older studies, with the exception of Cu and V for which some increase was observed.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{cycle of}} phosphorus (P) is parameterized {{here in a}} state-of-the-art global 3 -D chemistry transport model, taking into account primary emissions of total P (TP) and soluble P (DP) associated with mineral dust, combustion particles from natural and anthropogenic sources, bioaerosols, sea spray and volcanic aerosols. For the present day, global TP emissions are calculated to be roughly 1. 33  Tg-P yr − 1, with the mineral sources contributing more than 80  % to these emissions. The P solubilization from mineral dust under acidic atmospheric conditions is also parameterized in the model and is calculated to contribute about one-third (0. 14  Tg-P yr − 1) of the global DP atmospheric source. To our knowledge, a unique aspect of our global study is the explicit modeling {{of the evolution of}} phosphorus speciation in the atmosphere. The simulated present-day global annual DP deposition flux is 0. 45  Tg-P yr − 1 (about 40  % over oceans), showing a strong spatial and temporal variability. Present-day simulations of atmospheric P aerosol concentrations and deposition fluxes are satisfactory compared with available observations, indicating however an underestimate of about 70  % on current knowledge of the sources that drive the P atmospheric cycle. Sensitivity simulations using preindustrial (year 1850) anthropogenic and biomass burning emission scenarios showed a present-day increase of 75  % in the P solubilization flux from mineral dust, i. e., the rate at which P is converted into soluble forms, compared to preindustrial times, due to increasing <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acidity</b> over the last 150  years. Future reductions in air pollutants due to the implementation of air-quality regulations are expected to decrease the P solubilization flux from mineral dust by about 30  % in the year 2100 compared to the present day. Considering, however, that all the P contained in bioaerosols is readily available for uptake by marine organisms, and also accounting for all other DP sources, a total bioavailable P flux of about 0. 17  Tg-P yr − 1 to the oceans is derived. Our calculations further show that in some regions {{more than half of the}} bioavailable P deposition flux to the ocean can originate from biological particles, while this contribution is found to maximize in summer when atmospheric deposition impact on the marine ecosystem is the highest due to ocean stratification. Thus, according to this global study, a largely unknown but potentially important role of terrestrial bioaerosols as suppliers of bioavailable P to the global ocean is also revealed. Overall, this work provides new insights to the atmospheric P cycle by demonstrating that biological materials are important carriers of bioavailable P, with very important implications for past and future responses of marine ecosystems to global change...|$|E

August 2003 monthly mean PM 10 mass concentration, at 5 m above ground, was 56 &mu;g/m 3 and the EU imposed daily limit of 50 &mu;g/m 3 was exceeded on 16 occasions. The corresponding monthly mean for March 2004 was 92 &mu;g/m 3 and the aforementioned daily limit was exceeded on 23 occasions. The PM 10 (PM 10 &minus; 2. 5 +PM 2. 5 ) mass concentrations at 1. 5 m above ground {{were found to be}} approximately 20 % higher compared to the respective PM 10 measured at 5 m. Consequently, for a realistic estimation of the exposure of citizens to particulate matter, PM 10 sampling at a height of 1. 5 &ndash; 3 m above ground, in the "breathing zone" is necessary. Such data are presented for the first time for the centre of Athens. In both campaigns, calcium was found to be the predominant component of the coarse fraction while crust-related aluminosilicates and iron were found to be the other major components of the same fraction. The above elements constitute the most important components of the fine fraction, together with the predominant sulphur. Toxic metals were found to be below the air quality limits and in lower concentrations compared to older studies, with the exception of Cu and V for which some increase was observed. Pb, in particular, appeared mostly in the fine fraction and in very low concentrations compared to studies dating more than a decade back. The major ions of the coarse fraction {{have been found to be}} Ca 2 +, NO 3 &minus; and Cl&minus;, while SO 4 &minus; 2 , Ca 2 + and NH 4 + were the major ionic components of the fine fraction. The low molar ratio of NH 4 +/SO 4 &minus; 2 indicated an ammonium-poor ambient air, where atmospheric ammonia is not sufficient to neutralize all acidity and the formation of NH 4 NO 3 does not occur to a significant extend. Calcium predominated the coarse fraction and its good correlations with NO 3 &minus; and SO 4 &minus; 2 indicated its role as an important neutralizing agent of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acidity</b> in this particle size range. In the fine fraction, both Ca 2 + and NH 4 + participate in the neutralizing processes with NH 4 + being the major neutralizing agent of SO 4 &minus; 2 . Chloride depletion from NaCl or MgCl 2 was not found to occur to a significant extend. Total analyzed inorganic mass (elemental+ionic) was found to be ranging between approximately 25 &ndash; 33 % of the total coarse particle mass and 35 &ndash; 42 % of the total fine particle mass...|$|E

The production and subsequent emission of volatile compounds is one of the numerous ways by which they participate in the cycling of elements and in uence the Earth's climate. Dimethylsulde (DMS), produced by enzymatic decomposition of the algal intracellular compound dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), is the more abundant organic volatile in the upper ocean. Its global emission amounts ca. 28 Tg S per year, and represents the main biogenic source of sulfur to the troposphere and about 30 % of the total S emission (anthropogenic, biogenic and volcanic). Atmospheric oxidation of DMS contributes to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acidity,</b> and is believed to promote the formation and growth of aerosols. Furthermore, DMS-derived sulfate aerosols have been suggested to cool the climate by reducing the amount of shortwave solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface by scattering solar radiation and, more important, by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. The `CLAW' hypothesis postulates that, if oceanic DMS emission was in turn stimulated by solar radiation, a regulatory feedback mechanism could operate between marine plankton and the radiative budget over the oceans. However, the relationship between DMS emission and solar radiation is not straightforward, since a number of biochemical and photochemical transformations come into action from the moment DMSP is synthesized by phytoplankton until DMS is emitted. These transformations are intimately linked to the physical environment, the ecological setting and the microbial interactions, rendering the picture of dimethylated sulfur cycling a lot more complicated. Surprisingly, though, the seasonal cycle of seawater DMS concentration seems to follow that of solar radiation in the majority of oceanic regions, regardless their productivity regimes. This characteristic feature of oceanic DMS, while broadly accepted, is not yet well understood. The premise of this thesis is that, to understand this emerging pattern, we need to understand what regulates the DMS production and consumption processes and their balance (that is, DMS budgets). To this end, we have studied the response of biotic and abiotic DMS cycling to solar radiation by means of incubation experiments. At another level, we have studied the response of ecosystem DMS budgets to dierent radiation climates, and from polar to subtropical areas. Since the depth of the upper mixed layer regulates the amount and spectral composition of the `light' seen by the cells and molecules, our studies have been backed by a careful characterization of underwater radiation elds and vertical mixing dynamicsPeer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} temporal {{perspectives of}} lake acidification in Sweden. Sediment records {{have been used}} to study timing, trends and causes of acidification, and two different techniques for assessing past lake-water acidity are presented. A new technique for pH prediction, based on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of surface sediments, is developed. This study shows that there is a pH related fraction of lake sediments that can be recorded by NIR analysis. Relationships between NIR spectra of surface sediment samples and measured lake-water pH values, and between NIR spectra of sediment cores and historical pH values inferred by diatom analysis, are modelled by partial least squares regression. The prediction errors of the models are comparable to those obtained by modelling of diatom and lake-water pH data. By further development NIR spectroscopy can become useful for inferring past pH, as well as several other lake-water parameters, from sediment cores. Diatom-based predictive models, using multivariate calibration methods, are developed for inferences of lake-water pH, alkalinity and colour. These models are used to provide a regional assessment of recent lake acidification in the provinces of Västerbotten and Norrbotten, northern Sweden. The study shows that a pH decline has occurred in some southeastern lakes, but that most of the lakes have not faced significant changes in lake-water pH, alkalinity and colour. The inferred water chemistiy changes are discussed in relation to atmospheric deposition and land-use. In a study of eight acid-sensitive Swedish boreal-forest lakes a past-analogue approach is used to test whether contemporary expansion of conifers could cause lake acidification. Water chemistry changes associated with the natural pre-historic colonization and expansion of spruce in Sweden (≈ 3000 years B. P.), at times of background <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acidity,</b> are inferred to evaluate the acidification ability of spruce per se on surface waters. This study shows that under natural, unpolluted conditions spruce colonization and expansion did not cause lake acidification. In a synthesis of palaeolimnological acidification research in Sweden a general model for pH- development for acid clear-water lakes in southern Sweden is presented. The pH-development from the last deglaciation to present time can be divided into four different periods; (i) a natural long-term acidification period (12000 B. P. - 2300 B. P., or later), with a gradual decrease in pH resulting from declining fluxes of base cations from catchment soils; (ii) a human induced alkalization period (2300 B. P. - 1900 A. D.), with a pH increase due to human activities in the catchments; (iii) the recent acidification period (about 1900 A. D. - present), when pH decreased towards 4. 5 due to acid deposition and possibly ceased land-use; and (iv) the liming period (1970 s - present), when pH often increases to values above 7 following lime treatment to counteract acidification. The implications of these past pH changes for the concept of contemporary lake acidification and for liming policy are outlined. digitalisering@um...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the presence of acidic and alkaline constituents in the gas and particulate phase of the atmosphere at an urban environment, Thessaloniki (Greece), and their removal mechanisms, in the prevailing weather conditions, by wet and dry deposition. More precisely, the concentrations of 8 ionic constituents (Cl-, NO 3 -, SO 4 2 -, NH 4 +, Na+, K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +) were determined in every phase (gases, particles, rainwater and dust). In addition, the concentrations of 8 trace metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) were also determined in the case of rain and dust samples. The gas phase compounds (HCl, HNO 3, SO 2 and NH 3) were measured (24 hrs samples) by an annular denuder system equipped with a back up filter for the collection of particles with diameter # 5 μm (PM 5), while the sampling of wet and dry deposits was performed by using a conventional wet/dry collector. The gas phase compounds and the particles were collected for a period of 16 months, the rainwater and the dust deposits were sampled for 27 and 24 months respectively. The distribution of the common constituents’ concentration of the gaseous and particulate phase and their seasonal variation was evaluated. Furthermore, the presence of several volatile or non-volatile compounds (for example: NH 4 NO 3, NH 4 Cl and (NH 4) 2 SO 4 /NH 4 HSO 4) in the particulate phase was investigated. This investigation revealed the formation of NH 4 NO 3 under cold conditions (T < 15 ° C), while NH 4 Cl is not expected to be formed neither in the warm nor in the cold period. On the other hand, both forms of ammonium sulfate ((NH 4) 2 SO 4 /NH 4 HSO 4) are probably present in the atmosphere, depending on the atmospheric concentration levels of ammonia. Possible emissions sources were evaluated using statistical methods for particles, rain and dust data. ## 3 and CaCO 3 were found to be the main neutralizing agents of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>acidity,</b> by calculating the Neutralization Factors (NF) and applying the Multiple Linear Regression Analysis (MLR). The study of the air masses’ origin, by using the HYSPLIT model, in the case of rainwater and particle samples, showed a possible contribution of long range transported pollutants. In order to investigate the atmospheric scavenging mechanisms of ionic constituents and trace elements we determined the wet and dry deposition fluxes (dry deposition represents the sum of gaseous and particle fluxes), their relative contribution to the total atmospheric deposition, as well as the influence of the precipitation amount to the prevailing mechanism. The contribution of gases to the total dry deposition was significant, while the prevailing removal process {{for the majority of the}} constituents was found to be wet deposition. Finally, it was feasible to calculate the dry deposition velocities of major particles (NO 3 -, SO 4 2 -, NH 4 + and Cl-) by using the dust fluxes. Their seasonal variation was evaluated, while the comparison of these results with literature data (obtained by models or using direct measurement of dry deposition with several surrogate techniques) showed a good agreement with values estimated by models. ...|$|E

To this end, we have studied the response of biotic and abiotic DMS cycling to solar radiation by means of incubation experiments.

Since the depth of the upper mixed layer regulates the amount and spectral composition of the `light' seen by the cells and molecules, our studies have been backed by a careful characterization of underwater radiation fields and vertical mixing dynamics. Our results show that solar radiation has a stimulating effect on gross DMS production. Moreover, the stimulation is more effective at shorter and more energetic wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV) region. Direct DMS production and/or increased DMSP release by UVstressed phytoplankton is the most plausible explanation for this observation, leaving a secondary role for DMS production mechanisms related to bacterial metabolism and microzooplankton grazing. At the ecosystem level, we have shown that vertical mixingmediated solar exposure regulates whether DMS is preferentially oxidized by bacteria or by photochemical reactions. The outcome of this competition between DMS sinks is that total DMS loss rate constants vary little across oceanic biomes. As a result, the seasonal and also the shortterm variability in DMS concentrations respond mainly to gross DMS production. The stress response occurs at different temporal scales: seasonally, through the succession of microbial communities towards stronger DMSP producers and higher DMS yields in summer stratified waters; and across daynight cycles, where shortterm radiative stress modulates DMSP to DMS conversion yields. By means of a literature metaanalysis, we have improved the current understanding of the different DMS(P) cycling regimes and their links with the ecological geography of the sea...|$|E
