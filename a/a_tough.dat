40|$|The {{emergence}} of anti-immigrant parties in Western Europe has provoked very different responses from mainstream parties. Some {{have tried to}} counter the antiimmigrant parties, while others have tried to recapture lost voters by taking <b>a</b> <b>tougher</b> stance on immigration. Country comparative studies have tried to determine the effectiveness of different strategies, but systematic testing has been impaired by small-n problems. Therefore this paper exploits sub-national variation in 290 Swedish municipalities to investigate the effect of mainstream party strategy on anti-immigrant electoral success. The paper finds that <b>a</b> <b>tougher</b> stance on immigration of mainstream parties is correlated with more anti-immigrant party support, even when controlling for {{a large number of}} socio-economic, historical and regional factors. This result indicates that mainstream parties legitimize anti-immigrant parties by taking <b>a</b> <b>tougher</b> position on immigration. However, the results presented in the paper show that it is not enough that one mainstream party takes <b>a</b> <b>tougher</b> position, it is only when the entire political mainstream are tougher on immigration that the anti-immigrant party benefits. What is more, toughness of the parties on the left seem to be more legitimizing than the toughness of the parties on the right...|$|R

5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E
