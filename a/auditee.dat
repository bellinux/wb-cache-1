For example, an auditor may judge a recipient to be a high-risk <b>auditee</b> because the audit reports {{of the past few years}} have numerous audit findings (e.g. specific situations of non-compliance with laws and regulations, serious deficiencies in internal controls and/or acts of fraud), or because the auditor receives news from various sources that the recipient is engaged in illegal activities, such as money laundering. On the other hand, the auditor may determine that a recipient is low-risk because its management personnel have a good work ethic, the auditor has received good references from external sources, or because the recipient has never received any audit findings.

Auditors are required to consider the going concern of an <b>auditee</b> before issuing a report. If the <b>auditee</b> is a going concern, the auditor does not modify his/her report in any way. However, if the auditor considers that the <b>auditee</b> is not a going concern, or will not be a going concern in the near future, then the auditor is required to include an explanatory paragraph before the opinion paragraph or following the opinion papragraph, in the audit report explaining the situation, which is commonly referred to as the going concern disclosure.

Different analytical and statistical techniques (e. g. rating and ranking, validity as correlations and factor analysis) were utilized. The research found that <b>Auditees</b> perceive 'continuous improvement' of the whole organization as an essential quality factor of the internal audit.

30|$|Taiwan’s {{auditing}} standards bulletin No. 16 stipulates that the compilation of financial statements is {{often based on}} an assumption of going concern. It further requires that auditors shall comply with the stipulations as specified in the bulletin when they evaluate reasonable assumptions of going concern. CPAs are able to issue unqualified opinion audit reports if they eliminate their doubt {{about the ability of}} going concern after evaluating the rationality of the assumption of going concern. If CPAs consider the <b>auditee’s</b> future measures are reasonable and necessary to be disclosed in the financial report, then a qualified opinion audit report or an adverse opinion audit report is needed. If the CPA cannot eliminate doubts about the <b>auditee’s</b> ability of going concern, but the <b>auditee’s</b> financial statements have been disclosed, then the CPA shall issue an unqualified-modified opinion audit report. If the <b>auditee’s</b> financial statements have not been properly disclosed, then the CPA shall issue a qualified opinion audit report or an adverse opinion audit report depending on the significance. If a CPA has confirmed that the assumption of going concern for the compilation of financial statements is not consistent with the actual situation and would have serious consequences, then the CPA shall issue an adverse audit opinion report. If the CPA cannot eliminate doubt, or the assumption is not consistent with the actual situation, then explanatory notes {{should be included in the}} audit report, and these notes should form the audit report (Auditing Standards Board of the Republic of China Accounting Research Development Foundation, Auditing standard bulletin and auditing practice, 2013).|$|R
50|$|Many {{providers}} also {{obtain a}} SAS 70 Type II audit, {{but this has}} been criticised {{on the grounds that}} the hand-picked set of goals and standards determined by the auditor and the <b>auditee</b> are often not disclosed and can vary widely.

5000|$|Unfortunately, many {{auditors}} {{are increasingly}} reluctant to include this disclosure in their opinions, {{since it is}} considered a [...] "self-fulfilling prophecy" [...] by some. This is because a disclosure {{for a lack of}} going concern is viewed negatively by investors, lending institutions, and credit agencies, and therefore reduces the chance that the <b>auditee</b> may obtain the capital or borrowing it needs to survive once the disclosure is made. If this situation occurs, the <b>auditee</b> is more likely to stop being a going concern while the auditor loses potential future audit engagements, and so the auditor may be pressured to avoid including a going concern disclosure. In a study performed on 2001 bankruptcies, nearly half (48%) of selected public companies who faced bankruptcy in 2001 did not have a [...] "going concern disclosure" [...] in the previous auditor's reports.

Since the auditor must provide an opinion {{to the federal}} government on whether the recipient and its programs complied with laws and regulations, the auditor performs sufficient tests and audit procedures (also known as audit work) to confirm the opinion is correct. Normally, the auditor greatly increases the amount of auditing for high-risk <b>auditees,</b> to ensure their opinion is correct. For low-risk <b>auditees,</b> the auditor is not as rigorous; but still recognizes that a low-risk recipient may still have compliance issues.

50|$|A {{joint audit}} is an audit on a legal entity (the <b>auditee)</b> {{by two or}} more {{auditors}} to produce a single audit report, thereby sharing responsibility for the audit. A typical joint audit has audit planning performed jointly and fieldwork allocated to the auditors. The auditors are typically not individuals, but auditing firms. This work allocation may be rotated after a set number of years to mitigate the risk of over-familiarity. Work performed by each auditor is reviewed by the other, in most cases by exchanging audit summary reports. The critical issues at group level, including group consolidation, are reviewed jointly and there is joint reporting to the legal entity's management, its audit committee, a government entity, or the general public.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{literature}} {{on the market for}} audit services, to date no study has examined the determinants of audit fees for the smallest <b>auditees</b> in the market. This study therefore provides some new theory and evidence on the determinants of the audit fees of micro-firms operating in the UK manufacturing sector. A key finding of the study is that in the highly competitive market under consideration, independent small <b>auditees</b> willingly paid a premium to be audited by a mid-tier or a (then) Big Six auditor, with the latter commanding the higher premium. It is concluded that {{these findings are consistent with}} Big Six (and, to a lesser extent, mid-tier) auditors commanding a brand premium stemming from the (perceived) higher quality audit conducted by large auditors, for which small firms are willing to pay a premium in order to benefit from associated 'reputational' and 'signalling' effects. The common finding that the explanatory power of audit fee models declines as a function of firm size is also examined. The empirical analysis confirms this effect, but evidence is offered that, rather than resulting from model misspecification, it is likely that audit prices of the smallest <b>auditees</b> are relatively insensitive to variations in corporate size, which may result from lower incremental economies of scale and minimum pricing...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} example is an <b>auditee</b> that {{knows that the}} current auditor is going to issue a qualified, adverse, or {{disclaimer}} of opinion report, who then rescinds the audit engagement before the opinion is issued, and subsequently [...] "shops" [...] for another auditor {{who is willing to}} issue an [...] "unqualified" [...] opinion, regardless of any qualifying situations mentioned in the previous sections. However, opinion shopping is not limited to auditees contracting auditors based on issuing opinions. It also includes auditors who are over-pleasing to auditees by issuing unqualified reports without properly auditing, or by simply overlooking material issues affecting the audit. These auditors' objective is to appear much more attractive and easy-going than other auditors in order to secure future audit engagements and fees.|$|E
5000|$|Opinion {{shopping}} {{is a term}} used by external auditors and, after the Enron and Arthur Andersen accounting scandals, the media and general public refer to auditees who contract or reject auditors based {{on the type of}} opinion report they will issue on the <b>auditee.</b> The underlying principles of this concept are that auditees determine the compensation to auditors for their work (called [...] "audit fees") as well as awarding future audit engagements; that such fees are the auditor's main source of income; that certain auditees may try to contract auditors that will issue audit opinions based on the auditees' needs; and that certain auditors are willing to comply with such demands so long as they are assured future audit engagements.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{introductory}} paragraph, the first phrase changes from [...] "We have audited" [...] to [...] "We were engaged to audit" [...] {{in order to}} let the user know that the <b>auditee</b> commissioned an audit, but does not mention that the auditor necessarily completed the audit. Additionally, since the audit was not completely and/or adequately performed, the auditor refuses to accept any responsibility by omitting the last sentence of the paragraph. The scope paragraph is omitted in its entirety since, effectively, no audit was performed. Similar to the qualified and the adverse opinions, the auditor must briefly discuss the situations for the disclaimer in an explanatory paragraph. Finally, the opinion paragraph changes completely, stating that an opinion could not be formed and is not expressed because of the situations mentioned in the previous paragraphs.|$|E
50|$|As for {{the actual}} wording of the auditor's report, when a lack of going concern is {{determined}} by the auditor, the disclosure paragraph should state the situation, state the auditor's determination, and state the <b>auditee's</b> plan to correct the situation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence on}} audit market concentration and auditor fee {{levels in the}} UK market in the crucial period of structural change following the PricewaterhouseCoopers' (PwC) merger and encompassing Andersen's demise (1998 - 2003). Given the current interest in auditor choice, analysis is also undertaken at the individual audit firm level and by industry sector. There is evidence of significant upward pressure on audit fees since 2001 but only for smaller <b>auditees.</b> Audit fee income for top tier auditors (Big 5 / 4) did not change significantly {{while the number of}} <b>auditees</b> fell significantly, consistent with a move towards larger, less risky, clients. Andersen's demise markedly reduced the level of inequality among the top tier firms but PwC retained its position as a 'dominant firm'. On switching to the new auditor, former Andersen clients experienced audit fee rises broadly in line with inflation, with no evidence of fee premia or discounting. They also reported significantly lower NAS fees, consistent with audit firms and <b>auditees</b> responding to public concerns about perceptions of auditor independence. There is no general evidence of knowledge spillover effects or cross-subsidisation of the audit fee by NAS. The combined findings provide no evidence to indicate that recent structural changes have resulted in anticompetitive pricing; the key concern remains the lack of audit firm choice...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} the study is to examine the nature of {{competition}} in the audit service market, emphasizing the motives and consequences of auditor switching. We examine empirically the role of engagement profitability on client retention and the consequence of auditor switching on auditor labor utilization. We find (1) the likelihood of client retention increases with engagement profitability, (2) <b>auditees,</b> over time, should expect to pay roughly the same audit fee and be subject to the same mix of auditor labor resources when switching among Big 6 firms, and (3) <b>auditees,</b> over time, should expect to pay a lower audit fee and be subject to a very different mix of auditor labor when switching from a Big 6 firm to a non-Big 6 firm. The emerging view is an audit service market characterized by multiple service levels, with audit firms managing their client portfolios with profitability in mind...|$|R
