Denise was not very interesting, and {{we were asked to}} make her into Mary Tyler Moore or Tinkerbell, always bringing everyone together. We couldn’t." [...] After Bonets departure, the character Whitley Gilbert, portrayed by actress Jasmine Guy, replaced Denise as <b>A</b> <b>Different</b> <b>Worlds</b> main character, and the series underwent massive restructuring in order to focus on her and other supporting characters. Although the producers expected viewers to miss Denise, the general consensus was that Whitley, in whom audiences had always appeared to be more interested, provided better television than Denise. Linda Hobbs of Vibe wrote that <b>A</b> <b>Different</b> <b>Worlds</b> [...] "success only grew after Bonet left".|$|R

Using these patterns as instructions, people can reconstruct mental content resembling that of those long gone. Since {{people in the past}} experienced <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>world</b> and used slightly different language instructions, a person unschooled in the language and lacking a full reservoir of mental content from which to draw, is unlikely to reconstruct a cultural heritage.|$|E

Restless to the point of hyperactivity, naturally introverted, and emotionally distant from her husband, she fled him as well as her duties of life at court, avoiding them both as much as she could. He indulged her wanderings, but constantly and unsuccessfully tried to tempt her into a more domestic life with him.|$|E
