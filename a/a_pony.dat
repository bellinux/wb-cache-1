5|$|Meanwhile, a raiding party {{attacked}} Williams Station, <b>a</b> <b>Pony</b> Express station {{located on}} the Carson River near present-day Lake Lahontan. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out {{when they went to}} investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.|$|E
5|$|When Homer's {{attempts}} to mend {{his relationship with}} Lisa fail, he buys her <b>a</b> <b>pony</b> with help from a loan through the Power Plant Credit Union. When Lisa wakes up one morning to find the pony (named Princess) lying next to her, she gallops into her parents' bedroom telling Homer she loves him. While Homer is happy, Marge is upset he ignored her warning {{that they could not}} afford the pony.|$|E
5|$|Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, {{and overall}} coat. They also have {{proportionally}} shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses {{and also a}} high level of intelligence {{that may or may not}} be used to cooperate with human handlers. Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages , is considered <b>a</b> <b>pony.</b> Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than , are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.|$|E

5|$|The Pony of the Americas (POA) is <b>a</b> <b>pony</b> breed {{developed}} {{in the state of}} Iowa in the United States. The foundation stallion was an Arabian/Appaloosa/Shetland pony cross. A breed registry was founded in 1954, and within 15 years had registered 12,500 ponies. Today, the Pony of the Americas Club {{is one of the largest}} and most active youth-oriented horse breed registries in the US. Although called ponies, POAs have the phenotype of a small horse, combining mainly Arabian and American Quarter Horse attributes. The registry is open, allowing blood from many other breeds, but has strict criteria for entry, including Appaloosa coloration, specified height and other physical characteristics. Although mainly bred for Western riding, the breed has been used for many other disciplines, including driving, endurance riding and some English disciplines.|$|E
5|$|William Russell, {{senior partner}} of 'Russell, Majors, and Waddell' {{and one of}} the biggest investors in the Pony Express, used the 1860 presidential {{election}} as a way to promote the Pony Express and how fast it could deliver the U.S. Mail. Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, <b>a</b> <b>Pony</b> Express rider departed Fort Kearny, Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an unrivaled feat at the time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the church}} council, Reverend Lovejoy tells Marge to use Christmas to bribe her back. Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as <b>a</b> <b>pony</b> in {{wrapping}} paper to tempt her, but Lisa {{runs from the}} home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion - thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone {{that she will be}} celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism {{for the rest of her}} life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift.|$|E
50|$|In 1889, two British {{music hall}} performers, Joe Elvin and Jack Lotto, owned <b>a</b> {{trotting}} <b>pony</b> called the Magpie. <b>As</b> the <b>pony</b> was <b>a</b> regular race winner, its owners {{decided that they}} would use the profits to help performers who were less fortunate than themselves.|$|R

5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like <b>a</b> <b>pony,</b> citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>pony</b> bottle {{is a small}} {{independently}} filled diving cylinder, {{often of}} only a few litres capacity, which forms part of an extended scuba set and which is fitted with its own independent regulator. In an emergency, such as exhaustion of the diver's main air supply, it can be used as an alternate air source in place of a controlled emergency swimming ascent. The key attribute of <b>a</b> <b>pony</b> bottle is that it provides a totally independent and redundant source of breathing gas for the diver. <b>A</b> <b>pony</b> bottle is a specific configuration of bailout cylinder.|$|E

25|$|A fully {{independent}} supply of breathing gas is provided for emergencies where the primary gas supply is interrupted.

25|$|In December, 1861, Francis Jones Barnard {{established}} <b>a</b> <b>pony</b> express from Yale to Barkerville. The {{company had}} originally been owned by William Jeffray and W.H.

In the summer of 1862, Barnard merged his company into the British Columbia and Victoria Express Company and won the government contract to deliver the mail.|$|E
25|$|Although solo diving {{is practiced}} by some {{recreational}} divers, {{it is only}} considered safe if the diver is totally self-sufficient. This usually entails a completely redundant gas supply, such as <b>a</b> <b>pony</b> bottle or an isolation manifold. Self-rescue is not possible in some cases, such as severe cases of entrapment in ropes and nets and during medical emergencies where the diver loses consciousness or is otherwise severely impaired {{in their ability to}} respond appropriately.|$|E

25|$|Bailout gas for a {{back-mounted}} configuration may {{be carried}} {{in a variety of}} ways in a bailout cylinder.

When more than one cylinder of the same mix are side-mounted, the cylinders not in use function as bailout sets, provided they contain enough gas to get the diver safely to the surface.|$|E

Their music and their act were part of a tradition in jazz and rhythm and blues, but it all came like a thunderclap to most of their audience.
