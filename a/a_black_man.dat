5|$|In Romain Gary's {{original}} novel, {{this was}} not the story that was told--the dog started to attack white people because <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> embittered by white racism deliberately retrained him to do so.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) enlists a rap producer, Ridikolous (LL Cool J), {{to unload}} {{his line of}} {{inferior}} champagne while Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) reluctantly hosts the Source Awards. At the same time, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) tries to sever ties with <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> (Brady) she dislikes without looking racist.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} time, {{it seems as}} if the dog is cured, in that he is now {{friendly}} towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him, and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him in front of his grandchildren, who only know the dog as a loving family pet, that the dog has been cured by <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E

5|$|Anderson and Ward {{devise a}} plan to indict members of the Klan for the murders. They arrange a {{kidnapping}} of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack. There, he is left with <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> who threatens to castrate him unless he talks. The abductor is an FBI operative assigned to intimidate Tilman, who gives him a full description of the killings, including {{the names of those}} involved. Although his statement is not admissible in court due to coercion, Tilman's information proves valuable to the investigators.|$|E
5|$|Jason Wilkes (portrayed by Reggie Austin) is a {{scientist}} for Isodyne, {{the only company}} willing to hire him as <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> who informs Carter of the company's Zero Matter discovery. He is rendered invisible and intangible following exposure to the substance, and under its influence he attempts to take drastic steps to gain power. He expresses remorse for his actions after the Zero Matter is eventually purged from his body and he regains tangibility.|$|E
5|$|Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, Trooper Harper, and a New Jersey Turnpike {{driver who}} saw {{part of the}} {{incident}} were the only surviving witnesses. Acoli did not testify or make any pre-trial statements, nor did he testify in his own trial or give {{a statement to the}} police. The driver traveling north on the turnpike testified that he had seen a State Trooper struggling with <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> <b>man</b> between a white vehicle and a State Trooper car, whose revolving lights illuminated the area.|$|E

5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{painting}} on millboard by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It depicts a wrestling match between <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> and a white man, both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, {{it is likely that}} it was painted over a period of three evenings at the life class of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Dave Meyers, {{was set in}} the late 1960s. It features a past and present story-line based on Carey's childhood, and stars J. D. Williams and Jamie-Lynn Sigler as the singer's parents. The video begins with past scenes of Carey's mother being disowned by her family after becoming romantically involved with <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> and finds the singer in the present walking through a heavy rainstorm in New York. The song was covered on live television by Filipino singers Regine Velasquez and Charice Pempengco.|$|E

If it is against the law, this is one time when the law should be broken.|$|E

5|$|After {{rendering}} non-combat {{service in}} the Spanish–American War, Morrow graduated from the University of Cincinnati Law School in 1902 and opened his practice in Lexington, Kentucky. He {{made a name for}} himself almost immediately by securing the acquittal of <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> who had been charged with murder based on an extorted confession and perjured testimony. He was appointed U.S. District Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky by President William Howard Taft in 1910 and served until he was removed from office in 1913 by President Woodrow Wilson. In 1915, he ran for governor against his good friend, Augustus O. Stanley. Stanley won the election by 471 votes, making the 1915 contest the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history.|$|E
5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Aguilera is chatting {{with a group}} of women. When Aguilera leaves the conversation, <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> {{suddenly}} grabs her buttocks, making Aguilera stop and causing an argument between them. As she continues to sing, the nearby women in the neighborhood join her, while the male residents join the man and form their respective sides in the street. They perform their own hip hop dance skills against each other. At the bridge, Lil' Kim appears in a bikini and a sheer black blouse, and dances in her high heels. The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the men with a water hose, which she holds between her legs and parodies the penis.|$|E
5|$|Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking. After {{his closing}} {{speech at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners, he began to see Lionel Logue, an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised {{breathing}} exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently. Subsequently, {{he was able to}} speak with less hesitation. With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during a tour of the empire in 1927. His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland, like {{a growing}} number of Northerners (and nearly all white Southerners) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was {{reluctant}} to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.|$|E
5|$|Columbia's {{infrastructure}} {{was relatively}} {{untouched by the}} Civil War. Missouri, as a slave state, had Southern sympathies, but remained in the Union. The majority {{of the city was}} pro-Union, however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-Confederate. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which Union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred at nearby Boonville and Centralia. After the Civil War, race relations in Columbia followed the Southern pattern; George Burke, <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> was lynched in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on a segregated Chicago beach, a white man was throwing rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E

5|$|Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American {{singer who}} spent over four {{decades in the}} public eye, first as a child star with The Jackson 5, and later as a solo artist, during which time he went through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s, {{it became clear that}} Jackson's {{appearance}} was changing dramatically. The shape of his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery. His skin tone became much lighter. Although Jackson, <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone, it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin bleaching.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E
5|$|One night, {{a pair of}} LAPD {{officers}} come in {{to speak}} to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). <b>A</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community {{to bring in a}} suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence, in order to appease the black community. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat the officers into unconsciousness.|$|E
