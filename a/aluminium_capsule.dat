50|$|In a {{differential}} scanning calorimeter (DSC), {{heat flow}} into a sample—usually contained in a small <b>aluminium</b> <b>capsule</b> or 'pan'—is measured differentially, i.e., by comparing it to the flow into an empty reference pan.|$|E
50|$|The 2002 Baton {{itself was}} {{designed}} by a company called IDEO, and was constructed of machined aluminium with the handle plated for conductivity. It weighed 1.69 kg, reached over 710 mm, and was 42.5 mm to 85 mm in diameter. The Queen's message itself was held in an <b>aluminium</b> <b>capsule</b> inserted {{into the top of}} the Baton. On either side of the Baton were two sterling silver coins, designed by Mappin and Webb, which celebrated the City of Manchester as host of the XVII Commonwealth Games.|$|E
30|$|The biosurfactants was {{analyzed}} for their elemental composition (% C, H, N, O, S) using a Vario EL III (Elementar, Germany) elemental analyzer. Approximately 3  mg of biosurfactant was encapsulated in a tin <b>aluminium</b> <b>capsule</b> and pyrolyzed in a furnace at 1100  °C with pure oxygen under static condition. The oxidized products were reduced, and {{the percentages of}} C, H, N and S were registered by the integrator connected to the analyzer. The oxygen percentage of samples was calculated from the difference of C, H, N and S, and sulphanilic acid was used as internal standard (Telmo et al. 2010).|$|E
50|$|The {{system uses}} <b>aluminium</b> <b>capsules</b> {{measuring}} 48 mm in outer-diameter and 200 mm in length. On {{the rear end}} they are fitted with a plastic circlet, preventing friction against walls of the pipe and a soft plastic skirt, sealing air behind the capsule. The diameter of the rear circlet is 57 mm. The remaining 8 millimeters of the bore are sealed just by the skirt, allowing for excellent airtightness and low friction at the same time.|$|R
30|$|The calorimetric {{curves of}} {{polymeric}} nanoparticles containing red propolis extract were obtained in a differential scanning calorimeter, model DSC 50 from Shimadzu (Tokyo, Japan), using {{a mass of}} (5.0 [*]±[*] 10  % mg), which were packed in <b>aluminium</b> <b>capsules</b> hermetically sealed. The heating rate was 10  °C min− 1 in the temperature range 30 – 400  °C under an atmosphere of nitrogen and flow rate of 50  mL min− 1. The DSC was calibrated using indium and zinc standards according to the Shimadzu suggested procedures.|$|R
50|$|It {{is used in}} many {{consumer}} products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable, and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60 bar (870 psi, 59 atm), allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would. Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>capsules</b> of CO2 are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for airguns, paintball markers, inflating bicycle tires, and for making carbonated water. Rapid vaporization of liquid carbon dioxide is used for blasting in coal mines. High concentrations of carbon dioxide {{can also be used}} to kill pests. Liquid carbon dioxide is used in supercritical drying of some food products and technological materials, in the preparation of specimens for scanning electron microscopy and in the decaffeination of coffee beans.|$|R
40|$|Embryos excised from mature Pinus radiata D. Don seeds were cultured {{in a small}} {{volume of}} a {{nutrient}} medium contained in a small <b>aluminium</b> <b>capsule</b> to form an artificial seed. The embryos developed with normal morphology, although not as large as those from natural seeds. All plants from artificial seeds formed roots in sterile soil. The growth of embryos placed radicle-down into the same agarified-medium was inferior in that the lengths of cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots of the resulting plants were all markedly reduced. When embryos were cultured in liquid medium, development was aberrant, with virtually no root growth. Nutrient supply through the (natural) cotyledonary route appeared to be superior to entry through roots or hypocotyl...|$|E
40|$|Latent {{heat storage}} systems provide large thermal storage densities for solar energy storage for various {{domestic}} and industrial applications. In– 48 Sn, an alloy of indium and tin a lead-free solder is investigated as a phase change material (PCM) in {{latent heat storage}} systems for heating applications. Results obtained from differential scanning calorimetry indicate that the alloy is useful in storing sensible heat beyond its melting temperature as it exhibits very little decomposition up to 400 [*]°C. Though In– 48 Sn possesses a low latent heat of fusion, its high density allows for a larger thermal storage mass. The behaviour of In– 48 Sn in a 50 [*]mm aluminium spherical capsule during charging and discharging cycles is investigated using sunflower oil as the heat transfer fluid (HTF) at flow rates of 3, 6, 9 and 12 [*]ml/s. The influence of the charging temperature on the charging characteristics of the encapsulated PCM is also investigated. The average charging and discharging rates of the encapsulated PCM show an increase {{with an increase in}} the HTF flow rate. The HTF temperature determines the maximum temperature attained by the PCM and thus the total energy stored by the encapsulated PCM. In– 48 Sn shows good potential as a PCM in a spherical <b>aluminium</b> <b>capsule</b> for packed bed domestic heat storage systems...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAimTo {{examine the}} {{characteristics}} of MOSFET (Metal – Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) detectors {{for the purpose of}} electron beam dose determination in in vivo radiotherapy. Materials/MethodsIndications of MOSFET detectors were recorded from phantom measurements, including: dose values of electron beams, the environmental temperature of the detectors, the incidence direction of an electron beam on the detector, the size of the irradiated field. The change in sensitivity of the detectors when under the effects of accumulated doses was also tested. Because of the very small dimensions of the detectors, they were placed in specially designed <b>aluminium</b> <b>capsules</b> – to ensure electron equilibrium (δ electrons) during the dose measurement. The detector indications were compared to those seen in a Markus type ionization chamber with a calibration certificate. The measurements were made for electron beams with energies of 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 MeV. ResultsThe following were established experimentally: There is a linear relationship between detector indications and the dose value. A drop in detector sensitivity is associated with increased environmental temperature (as much as 6 % as temperatures rise from 22 °C to 42 °C). There is a non-linear drop in detector sensitivity with accumulated dose. Detector indications are not affected by changes in incident beam angles within the range of – 70 ° to + 70 °. The dependency of detector indications {{on the size of the}} irradiated field conform with those recorded in the ionization chamber, with variations of up to 1. 5 %. The dependencies and correction coefficients determined in this study allow measurement of electron beam doses with an accuracy of 2. 2 %. ConclusionsMOSFET detectors are a useful tool for verification of the entrance doses in electron beam radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|As {{volumes of}} {{packaging}} waste are increasing worldwide, {{the urge to}} reduce environmental and health impacts caused by this waste stream is leading to rising concern over how it is managed and disposed of. At the same time, resource scarcity and linear consumption patterns have regained attention among business leaders, policy makers {{and people who have}} become increasingly {{aware of the importance of}} reversing this trend using a sustainable model of growth, also known as ‘sustainable development’. The circular economy is a new paradigm within sustainability that focusses on resource efficiency, waste minimisation and low-carbon economy supporting the shift towards sustainable growth and enabling new business opportunities. Using a set of complementary analytical methods, this research evaluates the performance of the Italian system, making use of intervention theory combined with an analysis of the barriers to the circular economy within three areas: regulatory framework, recycling awareness, eco-innovation and prevention. It also describes the functions of CONAI and the results achieved with respect to national and European objectives. In addition, this paper approaches some of the barriers to the circular economy in Italian packaging and packaging waste systems through a case study on a fictitious company selling <b>aluminium</b> coffee <b>capsules</b> whose features are in the context of real world companies dealing with packaging. The findings of this thesis highlight the areas in which Italian packaging and packaging waste management is facing barriers to the circular economy. The findings also highlight how circular economy in Italy is either failing or succeeding, and the potential initiatives and strategies which could overcome barriers to its successful implementation. Moreover, the findings of the case study reveal ways in which to implement circular economy strategies on a specific packaging value chain in Italy while complying with national regulations...|$|R
40|$|The coffee sector’s active {{engagement}} with sustainability issues {{appears to be}} a relatively new phenomenon. Even newer is the necessity to deal with recycling and waste. Next to the waste produced by the “coffee to go” mobile drinking culture and coffee bars, the popularity of coffee capsules – i. e. single-use containers made of metal or plastics – is creating mountains of waste unknown to the traditional method of brewing coffee. The pioneer in this premium coffee sector has been Nespresso, a subsidiary and brand of the Swiss company Nestlé. Many other companies – from discount retailers to big-brand coffee shop chains like Starbucks – have copied Nespresso’s machine-and-capsule concept, adding to both the popularity and the waste problem. Next to the problem of waste production, coffee companies are addressing the problem of ethical sourcing. A key but {{by no means the only}} element is sourcing via “fair trade” schemes. Assuming that finding answers to these sustainability challenges can have a crucial impact on future sales, this article sets out to explore coffee companies’ sustainability programmes, using the examples of Nespresso and Starbucks. It finds that both firms engage in rather similar activities, but some critical differences can be identified. Both firms have a successful record in ethical sourcing. But neither has yet developed convincing waste solutions. Nespresso’s insistence on using <b>aluminium</b> for its <b>capsules</b> remains a critical issue...|$|R
