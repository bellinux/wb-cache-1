She appeared in the 1941 horror film Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and her reputation as a glamorous femme fatale was enhanced by her performance in the film noir The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946). Her popularity continued through the 1950s in such films as The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) and Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.|$|E
5|$|Jack Bros. was {{developed}} and published by Atlus for the Virtual Boy, and was released on September 29, 1995 in Japan, <b>and</b> <b>somewhere</b> between late October and November 1995 in North America. According to Nintendo Power, Atlus did not reveal any details about the game's development, although {{it is known that}} it initially was planned to be titled Devil Busters. It is a spin-off from Atlus' Megami Tensei series, and the first entry to be released outside Japan. Being a Virtual Boy title, it made use of the system's stereoscopic 3D to display conventional 2D graphics in monochrome red and black visuals, and a graphics technique called parallax scrolling, to create a 3D effect.|$|E
5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to <b>and</b> <b>somewhere</b> reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E

25|$|The date of {{the battle}} is uncertain, with most {{scholars}} accepting a date around 500.

Some believe Badon Hill was fought between the British and the invading South Saxons under their Bretanwealda Aelle.

25|$|Through his solo work as Death In June {{and central}} musical role in Current 93 through the mid 80's - early 90's, Pearce's {{influence}} was also instrumental {{in creating the}} neofolk genre. As Death In June has become more based around acoustic guitars (But What Ends When The Symbols Shatter onwards), he has actively encouraged other acts playing this style of music whether it be releasing material on his NER record label {{in the case of}} Strength Through Joy <b>and</b> <b>Somewhere</b> In Europe or guesting with them as he has done with Forseti. He also, on Death In June's Brown Book, gave Fire + Ice's Ian Read his first exposure: through work with former Death In June member Tony Wakeford's Sol Invictus and solo work in Fire + Ice Ian Read has also become a significant figure in this field, as documented in Diesel and Gerich's Looking For Europe.|$|E
25|$|It was Offa who {{introduced}} the broad penny to southumbrian England on a substantial scale, {{and made the}} employment of king’s and moneyer’s names standard at least three mints: Canterbury, London <b>and</b> <b>somewhere</b> in East Anglia. His earliest coins bear an abbreviated version of the royal title influenced by that on the coinage of Pippin III, and on the reverse the moneyer’s name. Early {{in the course of}} his coinage (probably in the 760s or 770s) there were also smaller issues at Canterbury in the names of two local Kentish kings, Heaberht (of whom only one coin survives) and Ecgberht II. Production of broad silver pennies also persisted in East Anglia, commencing in Offa's name but later interrupted by a small coinage struck in the name of King Æthelberht II of East Anglia, who was executed by Offa in 794: only three specimens of his coinage survive today, probably produced in the 780s or 90s.|$|E
25|$|Fragmentary {{evidence}} indicates that some provincial madhouses existed in Britain from at least the 17th century and possibly earlier. A madhouse at Box, Wiltshire was opened during the 17th century. Further locales of early businesses include one at Guildford in Surrey which was accepting patients by 1700, one at Fonthill Gifford in Wiltshire from 1718, another at Hook Norton in Oxfordshire from about 1725, one at St Albans dating from around 1740 and a madhouse at Fishponds in Bristol from 1766. It is likely {{that many of these}} provincial madhouses, {{as was the case with}} the exclusive Ticehurst House, may have evolved from householders who were boarding lunatics on behalf of parochial authorities and later formalised this practice into a business venture. The vast majority were small in scale with only seven asylums outside London with in excess of thirty patients by 1800 <b>and</b> <b>somewhere</b> between ten and twenty institutions had fewer patients than this.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the Twins {{came from}} 12 games {{back in the}} {{division}} at the All-Star break to tie the Detroit Tigers for {{the lead in the}} 159th game of the season. With the Tigers having won the season head-to-head by 11 games to 8, the Twins needed a Tiger loss and a Twins win in order to take sole possession of first place and win the division outright, and got both {{on the last day of}} the season, when the Tigers lost their third straight game at home to the last place Kansas City Royals in a 10–8 game in 12 innings. After their win against the Chicago White Sox, the Minnesota Twins <b>and</b> <b>somewhere</b> between 30,000 and 40,000 fans watched the Tigers-Royals game on Metrodome's jumbotrons. This was the first time in major league history that a team has won a division or league outright on the last day of the regular season without ever having had sole possession of first place earlier. The magical season came to a sudden end, however, as the Twins were swept 3–0 by Oakland in the divisional championship series, while Detroit went on as a wild card entry, beat the Yankees 3–1 in their divisional series, and went on to play the A's. The Tigers would sweep the A's 4–0 in the ALCS and lose the 2006 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals, who coincidentally broke the record held by the Twins for the worst regular season record by a World Series champion (having gone 83–79).|$|E
500|$|The Noongar {{people have}} strong {{cultural}} links with Dryandra which {{was known as}} Wilgadjny. Within the complex, five important archaeological sites have been identified to date, including an ochre pit which was used for body decoration and rock art. One Noongar born in 1910 described the ochre pit as being [...] "a very spirity place" [...] <b>and</b> <b>somewhere</b> to be avoided at night. Other known sites include artefact scatters, stone arrangements and a scarred tree, however the woodland {{has not yet been}} fully surveyed for significant Aboriginal sites.|$|E
500|$|The Fame Ball Tour {{received}} acclaim from critics.

For all her cocky bluster, perhaps the most undeniable aspect of Gaga's talent is this: The girl can, and does, sing."

500|$|By 1994 the {{organization}} had over 68,000 [...] branches <b>and</b> <b>somewhere</b> between 80,000 and 90,000 cadres. By 1995 the party declared [...] the ACWF, at least nominally, a non-governmental organization {{in response to}} criticism from women's groups abroad. However, the international women's movement questioned the validity of that declaration. While the federation expanded in size, it became increasingly difficult to continue to reach all Chinese women through traditional channels. [...] Other NGOs appeared to fill some of the void, but many of those became incorporated within the federation to gain legitimacy. By {{the end of the}} 1990s there were 6,386 women’s associations and recreational clubs under the ACWF umbrella. [...] The ACWF continues to struggle to reach an increasingly diverse female population in China, to incorporate groups outside the ACWF umbrella, and to defend its NGO status.|$|E
500|$|Colleen McCullough {{is another}} author who {{incorporates}} both the medieval Achilles' seeking Troilus out in battle {{and the ancient}} butchery at the altar. Her The Song of Troy includes two characters, Troilos and Ilios, who are Priam's youngest children – both with prophecies attached and both specifically named for the city's founders. They are eight and seven respectively when Paris leaves for Greece <b>and</b> <b>somewhere</b> {{in their late teens}} when killed. Troilos is made Priam's heir after Hector's death, against the boy's will. Odysseus's spies learn of the prophecy that Troy will not fall if Troilos comes of age. Achilles therefore seeks him out in the next battle and kills him with a spear-cast to his throat. In a reference to the medieval concept of Troilus as the second Hector, Automedon observes that [...] "with a few more years added, he might have made another Hektor." [...] Ilios is the last son of Priam to die, killed at the altar in front of his parents by Neoptolemos.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit.

According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from music critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised it for capturing [...] "Pharrell Williams' flair for slim, sleek grooves" [...] and labelled it a highlight from Hard Candy. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone, {{noted that the}} [...] "creative tension between Madonna and the Neptunes' Pharrell Williams crackles on the innuendo-laden opener 'Candy Shop'". Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern criticized the lyrics but praised its catchiness, [...] "set to a nice, punchy beat, Madonna weaves her voice around a hypnotic groove that practically dares you not to sing along. [...] is all about letting loose {{and having a good}} time". He also opined that while it wouldn't work as a single [...] "it more than serves its purpose as an introduction to Hard Candy". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Pharrell makes his presence known a little too much [...] he manages to get Madonna to stretch vocally in ways she hasn't since Evita. That is, when she's not doing cheeky drag queen impersonations, with trannie-fierce moments sprinkled liberally throughout 'Candy Shop' (“My sugar is raw”) [...] The song is neither sexy nor campy, <b>and</b> <b>somewhere,</b> Dita is throwing her head back, laughing hysterically, and cracking her whip in disapproval", the last part being a reference to the alter ego Madonna incorporated for her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992).|$|E
500|$|A behind-the-scenes {{video was}} {{released}} on MTV on January 18, 2012, and premiered on Evanescence's Vevo account on YouTube on January 24. However, it was leaked several hours prior to its release on the Internet. During the pre-release of the video, James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the video was a [...] "labor of love, for both the band and their director". In a later-published article, he labelled the clip as [...] "dark, dreamlike thing that pushes Amy Lee's claustrophobic musings to the next level. <b>And</b> <b>somewhere</b> beyond that too", further describing it as [...] "both haunting and haunted". While Jason Lipshutz of Billboard saw the music video as [...] "mystical", a writer of Spin wrote, [...] " [...] features pretty lights and a field of wheat, {{in addition to the}} usual Evanescence fare — frontwoman Amy Lee in pale chiffon and corsets, a fantasy world involving lots of wind and unpleasant situations [...] and dreadlock-banging galore." [...] HitFixs Melinda Newman compared the lightning scenes of the video to the light displays of United States' Independence Day, further adding that [...] "it's all darkly lit and dramatic and Lee, as usual, looks absolutely stunning and haunted all at the same time. Her band mates get just enough screen time to prove to their parents they are in the band." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Moonraker was {{composed}} by John Barry and recorded in Paris, again, as with production, marking {{a turning point}} away from the English location at CTS Studios in London. The score also marked {{a turning point in}} John Barry's output, abandoning the Kentonesque brass of his earlier Bond scores and instead scoring the film with slow, rich string passages – a trend which Barry would continue in the 1980s with scores such as Out of Africa <b>and</b> <b>Somewhere</b> in Time. For Moonraker, Barry uses {{for the first time since}} Diamonds Are Forever (1971), a piece of music called [...] "007" [...] (on track 7), and Bond smells a rat; [...] the secondary Bond theme composed by Barry which was introduced in From Russia with Love during Bond's escape with the Lektor; some classical music pieces were also included in the film. For the scene where Bond visits Drax in his chateau, Drax plays Frédéric Chopin's Prelude no. 15 in D-flat major (op. 28), [...] "Raindrop" [...] on his grand piano (although he plays in the key of D major). Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka by Johann Strauss II was featured during the hovercraft scene on the Piazza San Marco in Venice, and Tchaikovsky's [...] "Romeo and Juliet Overture" [...] was used for the scenes in Brazil in which Jaws meets Dolly following his accident. Other passages pay homage to earlier films including Richard Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra (op. 30), associated with , with the hunting horn playing its distinctive first three notes, Elmer Bernstein's theme from The Magnificent Seven when Bond appears on horseback in gaucho clothing at MI6 headquarters in Brazil, and the alien-contacting theme from Close Encounters of the Third Kind as the key-code for a security door as mentioned previously.|$|E
