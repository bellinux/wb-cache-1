And it's not just because I went 3-for-4, or had a great game. It's just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the Jewish heritage, and the struggles that a lot of our people have had.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of new designs and backgrounds had to be created for the wilderness scenes. The backgrounds were designed by animator Debbie Silver. The design of the forest ranger was based on then-Vice President Al Gore. In the episode, Marge watches an old film which includes a comment from naturalist John Muir. The impression of Muir was done by Dan Castellaneta, who originally based the voice on an impersonator he met at Yosemite National Park. However, the producers asked {{him to make the}} voice older and crazier.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3.

Thousands of people had already been arrested <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money had been spent on a cause that seemed to be never ending. Union members knew that something had to be done to regain the spirit of the strike and make it clear to Pittston that they would not give up.|$|E

5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of material had to be reshot.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong Country {{is known}} for its {{atmospheric}} music, mixing natural environmental sounds with prominent melodic and percussive accompaniment. It features a wide variety of different musical styles that attempt to be evocative of the environments in which they appear. This varies with the differing areas of the game, and includes music from levels set in Africa-inspired jungles, caverns, oceanic reefs, frozen landscapes, and industrial factories. Wise cited Koji Kondo's music for the Mario and Zelda games, Tim and Geoff Follin's music for Plok, synthesiser-based film soundtracks released in the 1980s <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of rock and dance music released that same decade as influences in creating the music for Donkey Kong Country. He has stated that he wanted the music produced by the SNES's SPC700 chip for the game to sound similar to the Korg Wavestation synthesiser, but ended up composing most of the music himself.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, some major units were disbanded <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{equipment}} was phased out or scrapped {{due to a}} severe shortage of funds. The whole land forces structure was reorganized from armies into territorial corps, and from regiments into battalions. In the mid-1990s, {{the situation of the}} land forces was critical: the military budget was three times lower than in 1989 (636 million dollars), 50% of the equipment was older than 30 years, and 60% of the armoured vehicles and 85% of the missile units were non-operational. Due to lack of fuel and training, the level of combat readiness and military capability was extremely low (only about 30% of the entire land forces were operational). However, after 1996 the government took serious action; the military budget was increased greatly, and modernisation of equipment commenced. Officially, the program to modernize and restructure the armed forces began on 11 April 2000.|$|E

Chemical production includes everything from herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals of particular concern include: heavy metals, nuclear waste, chlorofluorocarbons, persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation. Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless {{there needs to be}} rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects.
