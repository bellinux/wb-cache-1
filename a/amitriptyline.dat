5|$|Various analgesics (painkillers) {{may be used}} in {{controlling}} the headaches of intracranial hypertension. In addition to conventional agents such as paracetamol, a low dose of the antidepressant <b>amitriptyline</b> or the anticonvulsant topiramate have shown some additional benefit for pain relief.|$|E
5|$|Drake {{suffered}} from major depression, {{and this was}} often reflected in his lyrics. On completion of his third album, 1972's Pink Moon, he withdrew from both live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, {{at the age of}} 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 <b>amitriptyline</b> pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined to be suicide.|$|E
5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or <b>amitriptyline.</b> Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
25|$|The Cochrane Collaboration {{recently}} {{performed a}} systematic review of clinical {{trials of the}} tricyclic antidepressant <b>amitriptyline.</b> The study concluded {{that in spite of}} moderate evidence for publication bias, there is strong evidence that the efficacy of <b>amitriptyline</b> is superior to placebo.|$|E
25|$|Dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine, venlafaxine, and milnacipran, {{as well as}} {{tricyclic}} antidepressants such as <b>amitriptyline,</b> nortriptyline, and desipramine {{are considered}} first-line medications for this condition. While <b>amitriptyline</b> and desipramine {{have been used as}} first-line treatments, the quality of evidence to support their use is poor.|$|E
25|$|Therapeutic {{levels of}} <b>amitriptyline</b> range from 75 to 175ng/mL (270–631nM).|$|E
25|$|Active {{metabolite}} of <b>amitriptyline.</b> Somewhat selective (4.2x) for norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.|$|E
25|$|It is TGA-labeled for {{migraine}} prevention, also {{in cases}} of neuropathic pain disorders, fibromyalgia and nocturnal enuresis. <b>Amitriptyline</b> is a popular off-label treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although it is most frequently reserved for severe cases of abdominal pain in patients with IBS because {{it needs to be}} taken regularly to work and has a generally poor tolerability profile, although a firm evidence base supports its efficacy in this indication. <b>Amitriptyline</b> can also be used as an anticholinergic drug in the treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease if depression also needs to be treated. <b>Amitriptyline</b> is the most widely researched agent for prevention of frequent tension headaches.|$|E
25|$|Major {{brand names}} of <b>amitriptyline</b> include Elavil, Endep, Lentizol, Saroten, Tryptanol, and Tryptizol.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{antidepressants}} such as sertraline, fluoxetine,citalopram, nortriptyline and <b>amitriptyline</b> {{have been}} prescribed with some efficacy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amitriptyline</b> is {{used for}} a number of medical {{conditions}} including major depressive disorder (MDD). Some evidence suggests <b>amitriptyline</b> may be more effective than other antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), although it is rarely used as a first-line antidepressant due to its higher toxicity in overdose and generally poorer tolerability. It is used in addition to other medications for pain.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>amitriptyline</b> is {{primarily}} metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, genetic variations within the genes coding for these enzymes can affect its metabolism, leading {{to changes in}} the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of <b>amitriptyline</b> may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Painful dysesthesias {{caused by}} {{alcoholic}} polyneuropathy {{can be treated}} by using gabapentin or <b>amitriptyline</b> in combination with over-the-counter pain medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. Tricyclic antidepressants such as <b>amitriptyline,</b> or carbamazepine may help stabbing pains and have central and peripheral anticholinergic and sedative effects. These agents have central effects on pain transmission and block the active reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.|$|E
25|$|Urinary incontinence. An {{accepted}} use for <b>amitriptyline</b> in Australia is {{the treatment}} of urinary urge incontinence.|$|E
25|$|Other topical agents such as <b>amitriptyline,</b> gabapentin, Citrullus colocynthis extract, nifedipine, and {{pentoxifylline}} {{are also}} under investigation.|$|E
25|$|The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium {{recommends}} avoiding <b>amitriptyline</b> {{in patients}} who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk {{for a lack of}} efficacy and side effects, respectively. The consortium also recommends considering an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19 {{in patients who}} are CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers. A reduction in starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. If use of <b>amitriptyline</b> is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of <b>amitriptyline</b> in patients who are CYP2D6 poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing initial dose in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers.|$|E
25|$|Tianeptine {{has been}} found to be {{effective}} in depression in Parkinson's disease and in post-traumatic stress disorder of which it was as safe and effective as fluoxetine and moclobemide. A clinical trial has been conducted to compare its efficacy and tolerability with <b>amitriptyline</b> in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. The results of this trial showed that tianeptine was at least as effective as <b>amitriptyline</b> and produced less prominent adverse effects such as dry mouth and constipation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amitriptyline</b> is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene TCAs include nortriptyline (noramitriptyline, N-desmethylamitriptyline), protriptyline, and butriptyline. <b>Amitriptyline</b> is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite nortriptyline being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include imipramine, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of <b>amitriptyline</b> is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzocycloheptene-5-ylidene)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C20H23N with a molecular weight of 277.403g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the free base form is used rarely and the embonate (pamoate) salt is used for intramuscular administration. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 50-48-6, of the hydrochloride is 549-18-8, and of the embonate is 17086-03-2.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amitriptyline,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Elavil among others, is a {{medicine}} used to treat a number of mental illnesses. These include major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder, and less commonly {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and bipolar disorder. Other uses include prevention of migraines, treatment of neuropathic pain such as fibromyalgia and postherpetic neuralgia, and less commonly insomnia. It is in the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) class and its exact mechanism of action is unclear. <b>Amitriptyline</b> is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Netherlands: In the Netherlands, paroxetine, {{marketed as}} Seroxat among generic preparations, {{is the most}} {{prescribed}} antidepressant, followed by <b>amitriptyline,</b> citalopram and venlafaxine.|$|E
25|$|Merck {{introduced}} the second {{member of the}} TCA family, <b>amitriptyline</b> (Elavil), in 1961. This compound has a different three-ring structure than imipramine.|$|E
25|$|While {{on its own}} {{citalopram}} is {{less effective}} than <b>amitriptyline</b> {{in the prevention of}} migraines, in refractory cases, combination therapy may be more effective.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amitriptyline</b> {{additionally}} {{acts as an}} antagonist or inverse agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, the α1-adrenergic receptor, the histamine H1 and H2 receptors, and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and as an agonist of the sigma σ1 receptor. It {{has also}} been shown to be a relatively weak NMDA receptor antagonist via the dizocilpine (MK-801)/phencyclidine (PCP) site. <b>Amitriptyline</b> inhibits sodium channels, L-type calcium channels, and Kv1.1, Kv7.2, and Kv7.3 voltage-gated potassium channels, and therefore acts as a sodium, calcium, and potassium channel blocker as well.|$|E
25|$|Tension-type {{headaches}} {{can usually}} be managed with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen), acetaminophen or aspirin. Triptans are not helpful in tension-type headaches unless the person also has migraines. For chronic tension type headaches, <b>amitriptyline</b> is the only medication proven to help. <b>Amitriptyline</b> is a medication which treats depression and also independently treats pain. It works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, and also reduces muscle tenderness by a separate mechanism. Studies evaluating acupuncture for tension-type headaches have been mixed. Overall, they show that acupuncture is probably not helpful for tension-type headaches.|$|E
25|$|Sigma receptor: {{activity}} on sigma receptors is present, {{but it is}} very weak (Ki = 520nM) and it is about half that of <b>amitriptyline</b> (Ki = 300nM).|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of overdose is mostly supportive as no specific antidote for <b>amitriptyline</b> overdose is available. Activated charcoal may reduce absorption if given within 1–2 hours of ingestion. If the affected person is unconscious or has an impaired gag reflex, a nasogastric tube {{may be used}} to deliver the activated charcoal into the stomach. ECG monitoring for cardiac conduction abnormalities is essential and if one is found close monitoring of cardiac function is advised. Body temperature should be regulated with measures such as heating blankets if necessary. Likewise, cardiac arrhythmias can be treated with propranolol and should heart failure occur, digitalis may be used. Cardiac monitoring is advised for at least five days after the overdose. <b>Amitriptyline</b> increases the CNS depressant action, but not the anticonvulsant action of barbiturates; therefore, an inhalation anaesthetic or diazepam is recommended for control of convulsions. Dialysis is of no use due to the high degree of protein binding with <b>amitriptyline.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dibenzazepine {{derivatives}} {{are described}} in U.S. patent 3,074,931 issued 1963-01-22 by assignment to Smith Kline & French Laboratories. The compounds described share a tricyclic backbone different from {{the backbone of the}} TCA <b>amitriptyline.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{meta-analysis}} {{from the}} Cochrane Collaboration found the antidepressant duloxetine {{to be effective}} {{for the treatment of}} pain resulting from diabetic neuropathy. The same group reviewed data for <b>amitriptyline</b> in the treatment of neuropathic pain and found limited useful randomized clinical trial data. They concluded that the long history of successful use in the community for the treatment of fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain justified its continued use. The group was concerned about the potential for overestimating the amount of pain relief provided by <b>amitriptyline,</b> and highlighted that {{only a small number of}} people will experience significant pain relief by taking this medication.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amitriptyline</b> is {{a highly}} {{lipophilic}} molecule having a log D (octanol/water, pH 7.4) of 3.0, while the log P of the free base was reported as 4.92. Solubility in water is 9.71mg/L at 24°C.|$|E
25|$|Clomipramine is {{a strong}} SRI. Its {{affinity}} for the SERT was reported in one study using human tissues to be 0.14nM, which is considerably {{higher than that of}} other TCAs. For example, the TCAs with the next highest affinities for the SERT in the study were imipramine, <b>amitriptyline,</b> and dosulepin (dothiepin), with Ki values of 1.4nM, 4.3nM, and 8.3nM, respectively. In addition, clomipramine has a terminal half-life that is around twice as long as that of <b>amitriptyline</b> and imipramine. In spite of these differences however, clomipramine is used clinically at the same usual dosages as other serotonergic TCAs (100–200mg/day). It achieves typical circulating concentrations that are similar in range to those of other TCAs but with an upper limit that is around twice that of <b>amitriptyline</b> and imipramine. For these reasons, clomipramine is the most potent SRI among the TCAs and is far stronger as an SRI than other TCAs at typical clinical dosages. In addition, clomipramine is similarly potent or even more potent as an SRI than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
25|$|A {{randomized}} controlled trial found that <b>amitriptyline</b> 25mg per night for 90 days starting {{within two days}} of onset of rash can {{reduce the incidence of}} postherpetic neuralgia from 35% to 16% (number needed to treat is 6).|$|E
25|$|Because {{insomnia}} is {{a common}} symptom of depression, antidepressants are effective for treating sleep problems {{whether or not they}} are associated with depression. While all antidepressants help regulate sleep, some antidepressants such as <b>amitriptyline,</b> doxepin, mirtazapine, and trazodone can have an immediate sedative effect, and are prescribed to treat insomnia. <b>Amitriptyline</b> and doxepin both have antihistaminergic, anticholinergic, and antiadrenergic properties, which contribute to both their therapeutic effects and side effect profiles, while mirtazapine's side effects are primarily antihistaminergic, and trazodone's side-effects are primarily antiadrenergic. Mirtazapine is known to decrease sleep latency (i.e., the time it takes to fall asleep), promoting sleep efficiency and increasing the total amount of sleeping time in people with both depression and insomnia.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary use}} of {{trazodone}} is {{the treatment of}} major depression. Data from open and double-blind trials suggest the antidepressant efficacy of trazodone is {{comparable to that of}} <b>amitriptyline,</b> doxepin, and mianserin. Also, trazodone showed anxiolytic properties, low cardiotoxicity, and relatively mild side effects.|$|E
25|$|Anti-depressants are {{traditionally}} administered {{for treatment of}} mood disorders, also linked to the thalamus, {{and can be used}} to treat Dejerine–Roussy symptoms. Specifically, tricyclic anti-depressants such as <b>amitriptyline</b> and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been used to treat this symptom and they are effective to some degree within a short time window.|$|E
25|$|It {{can take}} up to three months to derive benefit from the {{antidepressant}} <b>amitriptyline</b> and between three and six months to gain the maximal response from duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin. Some medications have the potential to cause withdrawal symptoms when stopping so gradual discontinuation may be warranted particularly for antidepressants and pregabalin.|$|E
25|$|The {{comparative}} {{efficacy of}} duloxetine and established pain-relief medications for DPN is unclear. A systematic review noted that tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine and <b>amitriptyline),</b> traditional anticonvulsants and opioids have better efficacy than duloxetine. Duloxetine, tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants have similar tolerability while the opioids caused more side effects. Another review in Prescrire International considered the moderate pain relief achieved with duloxetine to be clinically insignificant {{and the results}} of the clinical trials unconvincing. The reviewer saw no reason to prescribe duloxetine in practice. The comparative data collected by reviewers in BMC Neurology indicated that <b>amitriptyline,</b> other tricyclic antidepressants and venlafaxine may be more effective. However, the authors noted that the evidence in favor of duloxetine is much more solid. A Cochrane review concluded that the evidence in support of duloxetine's efficacy in treating painful diabetic neuropathy was adequate, and that further trials should focus on comparisons with other medications.|$|E
