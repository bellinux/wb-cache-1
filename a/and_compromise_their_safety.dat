30|$|Currently a {{wide range}} of {{techniques}} for the production of SLN is available. Solvent emulsification/evaporation, high-pressure homogenization, and hot and cold homogenization have been the most cited. The choice of these processes is favored by their feasibility for scaling up to industry production and relatively low overall costs of operation. On the other hand, these traditional methods are multi-step and generally involve high temperature and shear rates, and several cycles at high pressure. These extreme process conditions lead to an increase and heterogeneity of particle size and degradation of the drug. Further, the high kinetic energy content of the obtained particles promotes their coalescence and the presence of organic solvent residues <b>compromises</b> <b>their</b> <b>safety</b> for human use [57].|$|R

40|$|AbstractActinoporins are pore-forming toxins {{produced}} by different sea anemones that self-assemble within the membranes of <b>their</b> target cells <b>and</b> <b>compromise</b> <b>their</b> {{function as a}} permeability barrier. The recently published three-dimensional structures of two oligomeric complexes formed by fragaceatoxin C point to Val 60 as a key residue involved in the oligomerization of the functional pore. To gain insight into the mechanism of toxin oligomerization, different point mutations have been introduced at this position. Functional characterization of the muteins suggests that Val 60 represents a hot-spot where the introduction of mutations hinders protein assembly and reduces the overall affinity for membranes...|$|R

40|$|Dolphin calves often wander {{away from}} their mothers, which can <b>compromise</b> <b>their</b> <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> survival. Mothers can {{retrieve}} their calves by actively pursuing them or by signaling their wandering calves to return. However, {{little is known about}} the retrieval techniques employed by mothers in specific calf recall contexts. We experimentally investigated maternal calf retrieval methods by assessing behavioral and acoustic strategies employed by three Atlantic bottlenose dolphin mothers to elicit their calf’s return in a controlled, non-threatening setting. Three mothers were asked to retrieve their calves on cue in this setting, and could do so however they chose. Mothers were much more likely to use energetically less costly acoustic signals than physical retrievals. Each mother produced individually distinctive calls that incorporated the mother’s signature whistle but often also involved additional whistles and clicks. The dolphin mothers’ use of individually distinctive calls to request a calf’s return is consistent with the notion that other dolphins can distinguish such calls and provides additional support for the notion that dolphin communication is flexible rather than fixed...|$|R
40|$|The {{building}} {{sector is}} today {{more and more}} often represented by tall, complex, energy-efficient and multi-functional buildings, characterized by innovative façade systems. The recent history teaches that, although closely related with the building structure and required to possess adequate resistance to the acting loads too, the new cladding systems have shown not infrequently inconsistencies or mechanical deficiencies, such as to <b>compromise</b> <b>their</b> <b>safety.</b> This for a competency gap between structural engineers, inclined to consider the façades only as an additional mass carried by the structure, and building designers, interested to deepen the technological and detail aspects related to appearance, energy, acoustic and durability performance, but not related to behaviour and safety under the stresses and deformations point of view. Overlook or underestimate the structural aspects in the façade design can result in critical consequences, {{especially in the case of}} large buildings subject to seismic and wind actions.

40|$|Objective: Assessments of {{endothelial cell}} {{function}} with acetylcholine have typically used systemic, regional intra-arterial, or iontophoretic delivery of drug. Each {{of these techniques}} induces systemic and/or local changes that <b>compromise</b> <b>their</b> <b>safety</b> or effectiveness. Using translucent drug preparations applied under laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) † probes, we tested whether local vasodilation can be induced with non-iontophoretic transdermal delivery of acetylcholine and how such dilation would compare to the dilation achieved with topical nitroglycerin in healthy volunteers. Methods: Ten subjects without known vascular disease were recruited for LDF monitoring at sites of drug application for this preliminary investigation. Topical acetylcholine chloride, nitroglycerin, and placebo were applied via translucent patches to the forehead directly below LDF probes. Results: LDF readings increased by 406 percent (245 percent to 566 percent) and 36 percent (26 percent to 46 percent), respectively, at the acetylcholine and placebo sites (p =. 005 by Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test [WSRT] for acetylcholine vs. placebo); and they increased by 365 percent (179 percent to 550 percent) at the nitroglycerin site (p =. 005 by WSRT for nitroglycerin vs. placebo; p =. 6 vs. acetylcholine). Conclusion: Transdermal delivery of acetylcholine can induce significant local vasodilatory response...|$|R

Such errors potentially arise from the breakdown or failure of multiple cognitive processes. This study aimed to investigate cognitive deficits underlying error behavior on a home-based version of the Cooking Task (HBCT) following TBI. Participants included 45 adults (9 females, 36 males) with severe TBI aged 18 – 64 years (M = 37. 91, SD = 13. 43). Participants were administered the HBCT in their home kitchens, with audiovisual recordings taken to enable scoring of total errors and error subtypes (Omissions, Additions, Estimations, Substitutions, Commentary/Questions, Dangerous Behavior, Goal Achievement). Participants also completed a battery of neuropsychological tests, including the Trail Making Test, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Digit Span, Zoo Map test, Modified Stroop Test, and Hayling Sentence Completion Test. After controlling for cooking experience, greater Omissions and Estimation errors, lack of goal achievement, and longer completion time {{were significantly associated with}} poorer attention, memory, and executive functioning.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the diversity of Enterobacteriaceae present in soil and tomato fruits from three greenhouses with fertirigation system. These crop systems are an important alternative for production in protected agriculture; however, there is little information about the microbiological quality of the fruit and its relationship with chemical soil characteristics. Soil evaluations consisted of analyzing organic matter content and pH. In the microbiological analysis were isolated and identified enterobacterias organisms from composite samples of soil and fruits at different stages of maturity (0, 50 and 100 %). Culture media used was selective, differential and confirmatory testing with VITEK system. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were characterized genotypically, amplifying the lngA and bfpA genes by the technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Diversity index (Simpson (D), Shannon-Wiener (H') and Chao estimator (SChao 1) were calculated with the identified species. The species Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and C. brakii had a higher frequency of isolation, EPEC and ETEC were identified in soil samples and in fruits with 100 % maturity. In soil, H' indices were positively correlated with the highest organic matter percentages.

The effectiveness of this transfer method for few-layer graphene on a large area was evaluated and confirmed by microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and four-point probe measurements. Schottky-barrier solar cells with few-layer graphene were fabricated on silicon wafers by using the cyclododecane transfer method and outperformed reference cells made by standard methods...|$|R
40|$|Repatriation is {{currently}} considered the preferred durable solution for refugees; however, {{it is often}} a controversial concept that does not always serve refugees. Repatriation is promoted due to the political and self-interested motives of UNHCR, states of origin and host states. In addition to this, the standard of voluntary repatriation is frequently not upheld in practice, despite its importance for refugee protection. The case of Somali refugees in Kenya exemplifies this, as repatriation is being promoted even though the conditions in Somalia are not yet conducive for return. This paper shows that current repatriation efforts {{are the result of}} key stakeholders' motives (UNHCR, Governments of Kenya and Somalia) and refugees are returning prematurely due to multiple push factors in Kenya.
