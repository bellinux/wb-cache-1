5|$|A major dilemma {{faced by}} Morales' {{administration}} {{was between the}} desire to expand extractive industries in order to fund social programs and provide employment, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the country's environment from the pollution caused by those industries. Although his government professed an environmentalist ethos, expanding environmental monitoring and becoming {{a leader in the}} voluntary Forest Stewardship Council, Bolivia continued to witness rapid deforestation for agriculture and illegal logging.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the First Balkan War in May 1913, Giuseppe Garibaldi was {{deployed}} to the Albanian port of Scutari to ensure that it was returned by Montenegro to the Ottoman Empire <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> Italian interests in the city.

5|$|During the American Civil War, {{during which}} Texas seceded from the United States, the area served a limited {{role in the}} {{conflict}} as new fortifications like Fort Chambers, near Anahuac, were constructed to ward off a mainland invasion by Union forces <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> supply routes to and from Galveston. The Bay Area sat {{in the middle of}} the conflict as the most important battles in Texas occurred at Galveston with the conflict moving through the area on to Harrisburg and Houston after Galveston's fall.|$|E

5|$|During the American Civil War, {{in which}} Texas seceded from the United States, the area served a limited {{role in the}} {{conflict}} though no major battles were fought on the mainland shoreline. New fortifications, like Fort Chambers near Anahuac, were constructed to ward off a mainland invasion by Union forces <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> supply routes to and from Galveston. The GH Railroad {{was used in the}} recapture of Galveston by Confederate forces in 1863. Makeshift hospitals, such as the Nolan home in Dickinson, were established in the bayside communities.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{movements}} have campaigned {{and continue to}} campaign for women's rights, {{including the right to}} vote, to hold public office, to work, to earn fair wages or equal pay, to own property, to receive education, to enter contracts, to have equal rights within marriage, and to have maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to promote bodily autonomy and integrity, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{called the}} {{attention}} of the Nebraska State Historical Society (NSHS) to the site and, in 1924, joined representatives of the Society in conducting further excavations, showing that a village of considerable size had existed there. In 1925, to ensure archaeological access to the site <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> it from relic-hunting, he bought the two farms on whose land it lay. Between 1924 and 1930, he excavated two lodges and over fifty graves.|$|E

5|$|In most rodent species, such as brown {{rats and}} house mice, {{ovulation}} occurs {{on a regular}} cycle while in others, such as voles, it is induced by mating. During copulation, males of some rodent species deposit a mating plug in the female's genital opening, both to prevent sperm leakage <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> against other males inseminating the female. Females can remove the plug and may do so either immediately or after several hours.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} give the strike teeth <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> himself from harm, Verro {{became a member of}} a Mafia group in Corleone, the Fratuzzi (Little Brothers). However, during the great strike of the Fasci in September 1893, the Fratuzzi mobilized to boycott it, {{providing}} the necessary manpower to work on the lands that the peasants refused to cultivate. After that, Verro broke away from the mafiosi, and – according to police reports – became their most bitter enemy. He was killed by the Mafia in 1915 when he was the mayor of Corleone.|$|E

5|$|The Scandinavian {{trade routes}} were equally {{important}} for the Batavian Navy, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> their merchant shipping from attack by British frigates, the Batavian authorities also sent a frigate squadron to the region, consisting of the 36-gun frigates Alliantie and Argo and the 16-gun cutter Vlugheid. On the afternoon of 22 August 1795 the Batavian force was sailing southeast {{along the coast of}} Norway, then part of Danish Norway, tacking to port towards the land, when the British squadron was spotted approaching from the south.|$|E
5|$|The forts were {{positioned}} to defend harbours and anchorages, and designed both to focus artillery fire on enemy ships, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the gunnery teams from attack by those vessels. Some, including the major castles, including the castles of the Downs in Kent, {{were intended to}} be self-contained and able to defend themselves against attack from the land, while the smaller blockhouses were primarily focused on the maritime threat. Although there were extensive variations between the individual designs, they had common features and were often built in a consistent style.|$|E

They are safeguarded from traffic on North Carolina Highway 12. Island populations are limited by adoptions and by birth control. Bankers taken from the wild and trained {{have been used for}} trail riding, driving, and occasionally for mounted patrols.|$|E
5|$|With O'Sullivan, Hadley has {{conducted}} research on utilitarianism {{and the relationship}} between obligations to animals and obligations to needy humans. The scholars argue that there is a conflict in Singer's philosophy between the obligation to aid needy humans <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> animals, and that Westerners who own pets should, rather than spending large amounts of money extending the lives of their companions, euthanise severely ill animals and instead donate money to aiding those in the developing world.|$|E

5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} phases, British and Malaysian troops had {{attempted}} only {{to control the}} border, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> population centres. However, {{by the time the}} Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing borders to obtain information and forcing the Indonesians to remain on the defensive, under the codename Operation Claret. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle-clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross-border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine Indonesian movements and intentions.|$|E
5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits focused {{primarily}} on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E
