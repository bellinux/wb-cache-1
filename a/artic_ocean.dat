The experiments were carried out, first, at complete penetration of the specimens and then, at different energy values to investigate on the damage initiation and propagation. The indentation depths and the delaminated areas were measured and analyzed to validate existing semiempirical models for the prediction of the response of these materials in dynamic shock conditions, at the aim to help the navigation in the <b>Artic</b> <b>Ocean</b> in safety conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{study of the}} seasonal cycle of sea-ice cover and ocean circulation in the Arctic Ocean is presented. The investigation is carried out in four parts using the coupled sea ice-ocean model of Oberhuber (1993 a). The Oberhuber model is the first global ocean general circulation model to use Lagrangian isopycnal coordinates. First, a sensitivity study is given of the sea-ice model, which is both dynamic and thermodynamic. The robustness of the sea-ice component in an uncoupled mode is demonstrated. Secondly, {{the addition of a}} snow model to the coupled sea ice-ocean model of Oberhuber (1993 a) is described. The inclusion of snow is shown to be important for obtaining a good simulation of ice thickness in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Thirdly, the coupled ice-ocean model is used to investigate the general circulation of the <b>Artic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and its connection with the North Atlantic. The cyclonic motion of the Atlantic layer within the Arctic is correctly simulated. Fourthly, a sensitivity study of the Arctic mixed-layer circulation is presented...|$|E

40|$|Submarine {{groundwater}} discharge to oceans is an ever-increasing topic {{of study in}} theearth sciences due to the dynamic geochemical and biological effects it imposes onaquatic systems both by the chemical reactions it induces and the constituents ittransports. Studies indicate {{groundwater discharge}} can represent a major source ofnutrients, fecal indicator bacteria, caffeine, trace metals, and mercury to aquaticsystems. In some systems, groundwater discharge can rival rivers and upwelling, as asource of nutrients. The implications of groundwater discharge include harmful algalblooms caused by nutrient loading and poor water quality caused by pollutantstransported through groundwater discharge. Much research has been directed atquantifying the flux of groundwater and associated constituents through groundwaterdischarge using radium isotopes as geochemical tracers. Radium isotopes representsome {{of the most common}} geochemical proxies used to calculate groundwaterdischarge rates to lakes, oceans, and other water bodies. However well-establishedthese tracers are in the scientific community, they are often used as a single proxy forgroundwater discharge resulting in large errors due to natural variability anddependence on residence time, and these errors compound through the calculations. Large errors in the estimates of the volume flux of groundwater discharge lead to large errors in constituent fluxes through groundwater discharge, which diminishesthe usefulness of such efforts. Additionally most SGD-focused studies stop atcalculating the SGD and associated constituent fluxes, and pondering the impacts ofthe constituents on the marine ecosystem, with out directly measuring the impact onthe system through other methods. The focus of my thesis is to integrate methods ofcalculating SGD fluxes based on multi-radium isotope measurements with mixingmodels, bioassay incubation experiments, and water isotopes to better understand theimpacts of SGD on marine systems. First (Chapter 1) I will integrate a multi-radiumisotope method to calculate SGD fluxes with water isotopes to better understand thehydrology of the systems to understand the governing processes and importance ofSGD as a conduit of methane to the North Pacific and <b>Artic</b> <b>Oceans.</b> Then (Chapter 2) I will combine a single radium isotope SGD flux model with a bioassay incubationexperiment to determine the ability of SGD to impact phytoplankton ecology inMonterey Bay, California. Last (Chapter 3) I will combine a multi-radium isotopeand nutrient flux mixing model with a multi-radium isotope SGD flux model todetermine the importance of SGD as a nutrient source compared to sub-thermoclinewater and river water in Monterey Bay, California...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of seafloor hydrothermal systems in the late 1970 ´s, they {{have been found in}} different types of geological settings. Recent discoveries of active, inactive and inferred vent fields on the Arctic Mid Ocean Ridge reveals that hydrothermal activity might be more common than previously assumed. The <b>Artic</b> Mid <b>Ocean</b> ridge is a slow to ultra-slow spreading ridge, which can sustain long-lived hydrothermal activity with the potential to form large polymetallic mineral deposits. There is a growing interest in exploitation of seafloor hydrothermal deposits, as global demand for metal resources is growing. Exploration for these seafloor massive sulphide deposits is therefore an opportunity for academic research, and discovering metal resources of economic value. This thesis focuses on Perle and Bruse vent fields located on the southern segment of Mohn´s ridge and Aegir Vent Field located on central Mohns ridge. Perle and Bruse are part of the Jan Mayen Vent Fields, which also includes Troll wall and Soria Moria. Jan Mayen Vent Fields were discovered in 2005 during the BIODEEP- 05 cruise. Perle and Bruse were later discovered in 2013 during the CGB cruise, and explored and sampled during the 2014 CGB cruise. Aegir Vent Field was discovered during the 2013 CGB cruise, and explored and sampled during the 2015 NORMAR/CGB cruise, and 2016 CGB cruise. Polished thin sections from the sampled material, was studied in transmitted and reflective light followed by Scanning Elecron Microscope using EDS to understand the petrography and mineralogy. Samples were powdered for isotopic analyses of Strontium, sulphur, radiometric dating of barite and whole rock geochemistry. Active chimney material from Perle is dominated by anhydrite, while barite is found in sampled mound rubble. Active chimneys from Bruse are dominated by barite, and have relict crystals of anhydrite that are partly dissolved. Both Vent fields are dominated by the sulphides pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and minor amounts of galena. Bruse has higher amounts of silica and the sulphide covellite, which is reworked from chalcopyrite. Radiometric dating shows that samples from Perle (7, 4 ± 0, 4) is younger than Bruse (1400 ± 50). Aegir shows a range of mineralogical assemblages that seems to be caused by age differences. The material is dominated by anhydrite, which seems to dissolves as the chimneys grow older, getting more enriched in barite, silica and sulphides. The sulphide phases are dominated pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and galena. Sr isotopes shows a degree of mixing between the hydrothermal fluid and seawater endmembers, Perle and Bruse shows an isotopic ratio closer to the hydrothermal fluid end member than Aegir which is closer to seawater values. Perle and Bruse have sulphur isotopes with values close to seawater...|$|R
40|$|The {{landscape}} {{from which}} Earth and the Great Weather is drawn is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Located {{in the extreme}} northeastern corner of Alaska, the Arctic Refuge encompasses {{one of the last}} great wilderness regions of North America. It also embraces the homelands of both the Gwich’in Indians and the Inupiat Eskimos. The Inupiat are Eskimo (Inuit) people, related to the Yup’ik of western Alaska and other Inuit peoples in Siberia, Greenland and the Canadian Arctic. The Inupiat live on Alaska’s Arctic coast, from the Canadian border west to the Seward Peninsula and south into the Brooks Range. On the north slope, the traditional Inupiat culture and economy center on hunting and whaling on the <b>Artic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The Gwich’in (Kutchin) are the northernmost Indian people in North America. Their homeland is the boreal forest of the northern interior and the south slope of the Brooks Range. Their economy is still largely based on subsistence hunting, fishing and gathering. The Gwich’in are Athabascan people. In language and culture, they are more closely related to the Apache and other tribes of the lower 48 than to their Inupiat neighbors...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of the Arctic Ocean {{is marked}} by extreme pronounced seasonality and spatial heterogeneity associated with light conditions, ice cover, water masses and nutrient availability. Here we report the marine planktonic metabolic rates (Net Community Production, Gross Primary Production and Community Respiration) along three different seasons {{of the year for}} a total of eight cruises along the western sector of the European Arctic (Fram Strait – Svalbard region) in the Arctic Ocean margin: one at the end of 2006 (fall/winter), two in 2007 (early spring and summer), two in 2008 (early spring and summer), one in 2009 (late spring–early summer) and one in 2010 (spring). The results show that metabolisms of the western sector of the European Arctic varies throughout the year, depending mostly on the stage of bloom, which is mainly determined by availability of light and nutrients. Here we report metabolic rates for the different periods, including the spring bloom, summer and the dark period, increasing considerably the empirical basis on metabolic rates in the <b>Artic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> and especially in the European Arctic corridor. We also report a rough annual metabolic balance for this area of the Arctic Ocean, resulting in a Net Community Production of 108 g C m− 2 yr− 1 ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHalf-daily {{high volume}} aerosol {{particles}} samples {{have been collected}} onto cellulose and glass fiber filters at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, from April 14 th to May 7 th 2004, {{in the framework of}} CHIMERPOL II program. The filters have been analyzed for ^(210) Pb (22. 3 y) and ^ 7 Be (53 d) by semiconductor gamma spectrometry. The median concentration values were 70 μBq m^(- 3) STP (8 - 264 μBq m^(- 3) STP) for ^(210) Pb, and 404 μBq m^(- 3) STP (35 - 824 μBq m^(- 3) STP) for ^ 7 Be respectively. The ^ 7 Be and ^(210) Pb activity concentrations measured are relatively "low" compared to those measured in Svalbard and in other Arctic sites for the same period time (April-May) during previous studies. The ^(210) Pb atmospheric concentration and atmospheric pressure are positively correlated, which may indicate that the ^(210) Pb atmospheric concentration increase as a function of air mass exchange over the Svalbard region. The results of ^ 7 Be and ozone concentrations show also the absence of direct ^ 7 Be stratospheric injections during our sampling campaign, in the low troposheric air masses. The performed backward trajectory analysis showed that collected aerosols and associated radionuclides concentrations were associated to three different air masses, originating from Atlantic ocean, <b>Artic</b> <b>ocean</b> and Barents Sea, and continental areas (North Finland-Russia) respectively...|$|E
40|$|Aquatic {{invasive}} species (AIS) cause significant damage to their host ecosystems, altering habitats and native species dynamics. Initiatives {{to improve our}} understanding and management of leading stressors of ecosystems like AIS are being developed through collaborative research within the Canadian Aquatic Invasive Species Network (CAISN). This thesis {{was developed in the}} context of preventing or reducing dispersal of AIS, facilitating early detection tools to rapidly and effectively identify AIS. In fact, one of the priorities of CAISN aimed at comparing results of several different approaches using traditional and molecular taxonomy to support the development of a national surveillance program. The overarching objective of this thesis was to identify zooplankton species from 16 “high risk ports” based on shipping traffic and ballast water discharges across Canada, four {{in each of the four}} coastal regions (Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic, Great Lakes). Zooplankton collections were conducted by four different CAISN teams, one for each region. 250 μm mesh plankton net was used by means of oblique tows during summer periods of 2011 and 2012. The zooplankton was immediately preserved in 95 % ethanol and fractioned for parallel projects including traditional and molecular taxonomy. A target taxonomic group (crustaceans) with a global invasion history was studied using a dissecting microscopic. As a result, approximately 14, 400 specimens and 86 different taxa, 81 of which were crustaceans, have been identified to their lowest taxonomic level and reference list are provided. Among those, 13 NIS were identified, including Carcinus maenas, the green crab and Cercopagis pengoi, the fishhook waterflea. The number of NIS identified was fairly conservative considering the number of known NIS in each coastal region of Canada. Ordination tests were used to assess the similarities and dissimilarities among ports and regions, and regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between propagule pressure and NIS occurrence. Considerable variation was found among and within regions and significant relationships (albeit modest) between propagule pressure (measured as ship traffic) and the number of NIS were found. Overall, the <b>Artic</b> and Atlantic <b>Oceans</b> were the most different and the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans were the most similar in terms of zooplankton composition. No significant relationships existed when the relative abundance of zooplankton were analysed but significant relationships existed when the number of NIS were analyzed. A separate analysis focused on the comparison among samples and ports of the Atlantic region. A first inventory list of plankton communities associated to ports in this region was developed and ordination analyses were used to assess their level of similarity. Overall, Port Hawkesbury and Halifax Harbour were the most similar and Bayside and Sept-Iles were the most different in terms of zooplankton composition. The data from the 16 ports included in this thesis will be deposited in a National AIS database providing baseline information to support future policy development, and studies on vectors and environmental assessments...|$|R
40|$|Kirchman, David L. Ammonia oxidation, {{the first}} step in nitrification, is {{performed}} by certain Betaand Gammaproteobacteria and mesophilic Crenarchaea to generate metabolic energy. Ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes from both Bacteria and Crenarchaea have been found in a variety of marine ecosystems, but the relative importance of Bacteria versus Crenarchaea in ammonia oxidation is unresolved, and seasonal comparisons are rare. In this study, we compare the abundance of betaproteobacterial and crenarchaeal amoA genes in the coastal <b>Artic</b> <b>Ocean</b> during summer and winter seasons over two years. Betaproteobacterial and crenarchaeal amoA genes were present in both seasons, but were more abundant during the winter. Archaeal amoA genes were more abundant than betaproteobacterial amoA genes in the first year, but betaproteobacterial amoA was more abundant than archaeal amoA the following year. Summer and winter betaproteobacterial amoA clone libraries were significantly different. Gene sequences of amoA were similar to those found in temperate and polar environments. The ratio of archaeal amoA gene copies to Marine Group I crenarchaeal 16 S rRNA genes averaged 2. 9 over both seasons, implying that ammonia oxidation was common in Crenarchaea at this location. Nitrification rates were highest in the winter when ammonia oxidizer abundance was greatest, suggesting that ammonia oxidation {{plays an important role in}} coastal arctic waters during the winter when the ocean is ice covered and photosynthesis is at a minimum.

40|$|Mercury (Hg) is emitted in the {{atmosphere}} by anthropogenic and natural sources, these last accounting for {{one third of the}} total emissions. Since the pre-industrial age, the atmospheric deposition of mercury have increased notably, while ocean emissions have doubled owing to the re-emission of anthropogenic mercury. Exchange between {{the atmosphere}} and ocean {{plays an important role in}} cycling and transport of mercury. We present the preliminary results from a study on the distribution and evasion flux of mercury at the atmosphere/sea interface in the Augusta basin (SE Sicily, southern Italy), a semi-enclosed marine area affected by a high degree of contamination (heavy metals and PHA) due to the oil refineries placed inside its commercial harbor. It seems that the intense industrial activity of the past have lead to an high Hg pollution in the bottom sediments of the basin, whose concentrations are far from the background mercury value found in most of the Sicily Strait sediments. The release of mercury into the harbor seawater and its dispersion by diffusion from sediments to the surface, make the Augusta basin a potential supplier of mercury both to the Mediterranean Sea and the atmosphere. Based on these considerations, mercury concentration and flux at the air-sea interface of the Bay have been estimated using a real-time atomic adsorption spectrometer (LUMEX-RA 915 +) and an home-made accumulation chamber, respectively. Estimated Total Atmospheric Mercury ($TGM$) concentrations during the cruise on the bay were in the range of 1 - 3 ng∙m- 3, with a mean value of about 1. 4 ng∙m- 3. This data well fit with the background Hgatm concentration values detected on the land (1 - 2 ng∙m- 3, this work), and, more in general, with the background atmospheric TGM levels found in the North Hemisphere (1. 5 – 1. 7 ng∙m- 3) [a]. Besides, our measurements are in the range of those reported for other important polluted marine areas. The mercury evasion flux at the air-sea interface measured during the first cruise ranges from 110 to 1500 ng m- 2 day- 1. This range is 1 - 2 order of magnitude higher than most of marine environments (Pacific Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, <b>Artic</b> <b>Ocean)</b> and some important polluted marine areas, such as the Tokyo Bay (19 – 259 ng m- 2 day- 1) [b] and the Yellow Sea (156 – 722 ng m- 2 day- 1) [c]. Further estimates on Hg atmospheric deposition flux (wet and dry) and biomonitoring are required for finally assessing a mass balance of Hg in Augusta basin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Until recently, the Arctic {{including}} the Arctic Ocean was only {{mentioned in the}} context of global warming. However, global warming has led to a thawing of ice that unveiled great findings of natural resources. The Arctic is now {{in the middle of a}} rapid environmental, geopolitical and economic transformation. The planting of the Russian flag by Russian researchers in 2007 on the bottom of the <b>Artic</b> <b>Ocean</b> triggered an overwhelming attention from other actors and states outside the region. Within a short time, all the Arctic countries, the US, Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia, have all developed their own Artic strategy and outside actors have voiced their interest for influence in the region. One outside actor that has had a great presence in the Arctic region is China. China has signed bilateral agreements with several of the Arctic states and shown growing interest in the development of Arctic natural resources. Beijing does not have an official Arctic strategy, and the Arctic countries, as well as the global community, are curious about what China s intention is in the region. In this thesis, I analyse the Icelandic, Russian and, supposedly, Chinese Arctic strategy; what is China s role in these two Arctic countries strategy and what do the activities in the Arctic mean to China. The thesis shows that, for both Iceland and Russia, China appears like the partner that best suits their strategic priorities. In Iceland s case, China is the only country that has both the technology and the economic capacity to develop Icelandic resources. Chinese presence in the Arctic supports two of Iceland s primary Arctic priorities: the legitimisation of Iceland as a coastal Arctic state and preventing the region from becoming an exclusive region just for the Arctic littoral states, that are the US, Canada, Russia, Denmark (Greenland), Norway and Russia. Russia is undoubtedly the country that possesses the biggest share of the Arctic s riches. Early on, Russia was flirting with international companies with licenses in the Arctic region. However, in the light of the Crimea annexation in 2014, the Western sanctions that followed ignited a series of bilateral agreements with China that makes it seem like the beginning of Russia s pivot towards the East. Both Iceland and Russia are looking for a partner who can boost their economy and help them achieve their strategic goals; develop natural resources and, as a consequence, boost socio-economic developments. The findings in this thesis show that Chinese companies have a strong advantage in the Arctic compared to other companies. The Chinese companies are eager to make foreign investments and have deep enough pockets to support potential projects. Simultaneously, their investments receive great support from Beijing, and China s political leaders work actively at improving diplomatic relations and make use of China s strongest card, economic wealth and access to the world s biggest market...|$|E
