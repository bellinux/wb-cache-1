40|$|A {{concept of}} <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> sorts for logic {{programming}} is introduced, where <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> sorts {{are regarded as}} constraints. Instead of defining "well-sorted" terms <b>and</b> substitutions, <b>type</b> constraints <b>and</b> <b>type</b> sort constraints are defined. The approach is based on term models. A type is interpreted {{as a set of}} object terms <b>and</b> a <b>type</b> sort is interpreted as a set of types. Parameters of types can be object variables, object terms, <b>and</b> <b>type</b> variables. Types are defined by means of type rules which can be regarded as rules for the generation of the elements belonging to the corresponding type. The definitions of <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> sorts can be transformed into definite clauses and the least Herbrand model of these definite clauses are used for the semantics of the <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> sorts.

5|$|All {{members of}} a {{resident}} pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers <b>and</b> <b>types</b> of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently {{in the days following}} a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones <b>and</b> <b>types</b> of cat-specific body language.|$|E

After fitting-out, Burke was delivered to the US Maritime Commission on December 23, just 33 days after construction began.

5|$|Since many {{materials}} can form crystals—such as salts, metals, minerals, semiconductors, {{as well as}} various inorganic, organic, and biological molecules—X-ray crystallography has been fundamental {{in the development of}} many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the size of atoms, the lengths <b>and</b> <b>types</b> of chemical bonds, and the atomic-scale differences among various materials, especially minerals and alloys. The method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. X-ray crystallography is still the chief method for characterizing the atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments. X-ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, or {{serve as the basis for}} designing pharmaceuticals against diseases.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{investment}} in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but {{in large part by}} the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges. The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in {{the world in terms of}} the numbers <b>and</b> <b>types</b> of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their military–industrial base. However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West. For example, the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet's most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72's as the US deployed M1's.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons <b>and</b> <b>types</b> of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. In magic, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, and thunder is stronger than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes are stronger than axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken are stronger than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E
