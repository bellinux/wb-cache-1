It is operated by E.ON {{and is the}} largest biomass power station in the UK. It produces 44 MW of electricity, and burns 60% waste from timber production, 20% coppiced wood, and 20% recycled fibre. It claims to save 140,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year. It uses 480,000 tonnes of fuel per year to produce 126 MW of thermal energy, and the boiler is optimised to run at 537 °C and 137 bar of pressure. <b>Aqueous</b> <b>wastes</b> are dispersed using a wetland filtering system.|$|E

40|$|Present {{concepts}} of disposal of low-level <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes</b> (LLAW) that contain {{much of the}} fission-product tritium from light water reactors involve dispersal to the atmosphere or to surface streams at fuel reprocessing plants. These concepts have been challenged in recent years. Deep-well injection of low-level <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes,</b> an alternative to biospheric dispersal, {{is the subject of}} this presentation. Many factors must be considered in assessing its feasibility, including technology, costs, environmental impact, legal and regulatory constraints, and siting. Examination of these factors indicates that the technology of deep-well injection, extensively developed for other industrial wastes, would require little innovation before application to low-level <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes.</b> Costs would be low, of the order of magnitude of 10 ⁻⁴ mill/kWh. The environmental impact of normal deep-well disposal would be small, compared with dispersal to the atmosphere or to surface streams; abnormal operation would not be expected to produce catastrophic results. Geologically suitable sites are abundant in the U. S., but a well would best be co-located with the fuel-reprocessing plant where the LLAW is produced. Legal and regulatory constraints now being developed will be the most important determinants of the feasibility of applying the method...|$|E
40|$|For <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes</b> {{containing}} 1 to 20 wt% organics, supercritical water oxidation is {{less costly}} than controlled incineration or activated carbon treatment {{and far more}} efficient than wet oxidation. Above the critical temperature (374 C) and pressure (218 atm) of water, organic materials and gases are completely miscible with water. In supercritical water oxidation, organics, air and water are brought together in a mixture at 250 atm and temperatures above 400 C. Organic oxidation is initiated spontaneously at these conditions. The heat of combustion is released within the fluid and results in a rise in temperature 600 to 650 C. Under these conditions, organics are destroyed rapidly with efficiencies in excess of 99. 999 %. Heteroatoms are oxidized to acids, which can be precipitated out as salts by adding a base to the feed. Examples are given for process configurations to treat <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes</b> with 10 and 2 wt% organics...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the removal of}} {{refractory}} organic compounds (ROCs) in <b>Aqueous</b> <b>Wastes</b> (AW) employing a combination of biological and chemical treatment were investigated at Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Cagliari, Italy and Department of Engineering, Oxford University, UK. The main objectives were to stimulate and optimise the degradation of ROCs with efficient removal of them in AW. This project is divided in two sections, a theoretical section which included a brief literature overview and subsequently an experimental section which is divided in two parts. The first part deals with the solubilisation and biodegradation of polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbons. Phenanthrene was selected as model pollutant in this study which was solubilised in synthetic <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes</b> using the mobility agents like surfactants (Tween 80, Triton X 100), or organic solvents (Methanol, Acetone, n-Hexane) and aerobic bacteria mixed cultures. The second part deals with the degradation of Metal Working Fluids MWFs in real <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes</b> employing biological and chemical treatments. Chemical and/or biological treatments are usually used to destroy the refractory compounds. The MWFs aqueous waste were provided by Microbial Solution, Oxford (UK). The systems used for investigation consist of batch reactors using an aerobic mixed pure cultures for biological treatment and oxidants, potassium permanganate KMnO 4 and hydrogen peroxide H 2 O 2 for a chemical oxidation treatment.

Some chemicals are washed down with excess water.

40|$|<b>Aqueous</b> <b>waste</b> {{of various}} {{chemical}} compositions constitutes a significant {{fraction of the}} total waste produced by industry in the United States. A large quantity of the waste generated by the U. S. chemical process industry is waste water. In addition, the majority of the waste inventory at DoE sites previously used for nuclear weapons production is <b>aqueous</b> <b>waste.</b> Large quantities of additional <b>aqueous</b> <b>waste</b> are expected to be generated during the clean-up of those sites. In order to effectively treat, safely handle, and properly dispose of these wastes, accurate and comprehensive knowledge of basic thermophysical property information is paramount. This knowledge will lead to huge savings by aiding in the design and optimization of treatment and disposal processes. The main objectives of this project are: Develop and validate models that accurately predict the phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties of hazardous aqueous systems necessary for the safe handling and successful design of separation and treatment processes for hazardous chemical and mixed wastes. Accurately measure the phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties of a representative system (water + acetone + isopropyl alcohol + sodium nitrate) over the applicable ranges of temperature, pressure, and composition to provide the pure component, binary, ternary, and quaternary experimental data required for model development...|$|R
40|$|During proper {{operation}} of the Purex process for the recovery of uranium and plutonium from spent reactor fuel, there are only trace levels of uranium in the <b>aqueous</b> <b>waste.</b> In {{the event of an}} upset in the extraction columns the <b>aqueous</b> <b>waste</b> stream would give the first indication of breakthrough. From the standpoint of process control it would be desirable to have an in-line, real-time sensor for uranium in the <b>aqueous</b> <b>waste</b> stream. It was toward this end that this investigation was undertaken. The measurement technique that seems to provide the most sensitive method without addition of reagents appears to be the electrochemical reduction of UO{sub 2 }{sup 2 +} to U(IV) followed by spectral measurement. The electrochemical reduction to U(IV) increases the sensitivity by a factor of three to five and shifts the measurement wavelength to a spectral area (647 nm and 1075 nm) unaffected by fission products. Using the proposed analysis sequence it is possible to determine uranium at a level of 0. 2 g/L in the presence of relatively high spectral background. This report details the electrochemical reduction of U(VI) in nitric acid solutions (0. 5 M to 2. 0 M) with platinum-vitreous carbon electrodes and examines the spectral behavior of U(IV) as a function of nitric acid concentration...|$|R

40|$|Since 1963, {{calcination}} of <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes</b> from reprocessing of DOE-owned spent nuclear fuels {{has resulted}} in the accumulation of approximately 3800 m{sup 3 } of high-level waste (HLW) at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP). The waste {{is in the form of}} a granular solid called calcine and is stored on site in stainless steel bins which are encased in concrete. Due to the leachability of {sup 137 }Cs and {sup 90 }Sr and possibly other radioactive components, the calcine is not suitable for final disposal. Hence, a process to immobilize calcine in glass is being developed. Since radioactive components represent less than 1 wt % of the calcine, separation of actinides and fission products from inert components is being considered to reduce the volume of HLW requiring final disposal. Current estimates indicate that compared to direct vitrification, a volume reduction factor of 10 could result in significant cost savings. Aqueous processes, which involve calcine dissolution in nitric acid followed by separation of actinide and fission products by solvent extraction and ion exchange methods, are being developed. Pyrochemical separation methods, which generate small volumes of <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes</b> and do not require calcine dissolution, have been evaluated as alternatives to aqueous processes. This report describes three proposed pyrochemical flowsheets and presents the results of experimental studies conducted to evaluate their feasibility. The information presented is a consolidation of three reports, which should be consulted for experimental details...|$|E

40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) is a {{multidisciplinary}} laboratory operated by Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC) in Aiken, South Carolina. Research and development {{programs have been}} conducted at SRNL for {approx} 50 years generating non-radioactive (hazardous and non-hazardous) and radioactive <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes.</b> Typically the aqueous effluents from the R&D activities are disposed of from each laboratory module via the High Activity Drains (HAD) or the Low Activity Drains (LAD) depending on whether they are radioactive or not. The aqueous effluents are collected in holding tanks, analyzed and shipped to either H-Area (HAD waste) or the F/H Area Effluent Treatment Facility (ETF) (LAD waste) for volume reduction. Because collection, analysis, and transport of LAD and HAD waste is cumbersome and since future treatment of this waste may be curtailed as the F/H-Area evaporators and waste tanks are decommissioned, SRNL laboratory operations requested several proof of principle demonstrations of alternate technologies that would define an alternative disposal path for the <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes.</b> Proof of principle for the disposal of SRNL HAD waste using a technology known as Fluidized Bed Steam Reforming (FBSR) {{is the focus of}} the current study.

The authors propose to resolve those factors by taking the following research approaches: (1) isolation and identification of microorganisms originating from sewage sludge which are associated with denitrification; (2) define physiological factors required for denitrification in this process system; and (3) define toxic factors associated with the <b>aqueous</b> <b>waste</b> that may affect the process of denitrification...|$|R

40|$|Mixed solvent <b>aqueous</b> <b>waste</b> {{of various}} {{chemical}} compositions constitutes a significant {{fraction of the}} total waste produced by industry in the United States. Not only does the chemical process industry create large quantities of <b>aqueous</b> <b>waste,</b> but the majority of the waste inventory at the Department of Energy (DOE) sites previously used for nuclear weapons production is mixed solvent <b>aqueous</b> <b>waste.</b> In addition, large quantities of waste are expected to be generated in the clean-up of those sites. In order to effectively treat, safely handle, and properly dispose of these wastes, accurate and comprehensive knowledge of basic thermophysical properties is essential. The goal of this work is to develop a phase equilibrium model for mixed solvent aqueous solutions containing salts. An equation of state was sought for these mixtures that (a) would require a minimum of adjustable parameters and (b) could be obtained from a available data or data that were easily measured. A model was developed to predict vapor composition and pressure given the liquid composition and temperature. It is based on the Peng-Robinson equation of state, adapted to include non-volatile and salt components. The model itself is capable of predicting the vapor-liquid equilibria {{of a wide variety of}} systems composed of water, organic solvents, salts, nonvolatile solutes, and acids or bases.

40|$|This {{work was}} aimed at {{studying}} the applicability of H 2 O 2 -based oxidation processes (namely H 2 O 2 /UV, photo-Fenton, and Fenton) {{for the treatment of}} six real <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes.</b> These wastes derived from chemical, pharmaceutical, and detergent production, and were characterised by high COD (chemical oxygen demand) and, in four cases, surfactant concentrations: overall, about 100 tests were conducted. The H 2 O 2 /UV and photo-Fenton processes proved to be very effective in COD removal, the efficiency being greater than 70 %. The optimal treatment conditions for the H 2 O 2 /UV process were: 120 min reaction, H 2 O 2 /CODinitial dosage ratio = 1 / 2; the radiation intensity (up to 2000 W·L− 1) revealed to be a crucial factor, especially in the earlier stage of the process (about 40 min) : this aspect can be exploited to reduce the costs related to energy consumption. For the photo-Fenton process the following conditions were chosen: Fe 2 +/H 2 O 2 ratio = 1 / 30; specific power input = 125 W·L− 1; H 2 O 2 /CODinitial = 1 / 2; reaction time = 240 min. Photolytic reactions and the presence of dissolved oxygen revealed to be crucial factors for COD removal. The Fenton process, while showing a moderate efficiency (25 % COD removal) in the treatment of high loaded wastewaters, provided excellent results in the treatment of <b>aqueous</b> <b>wastes</b> with high content of surfactants. An average yield removal of 70 % for non-ionic surfactants (TAS) and 95 % for anionic surfactants (MBAS) was obtained, under the following optimal conditions: Fe 2 +/H 2 O 2 = 1 / 4, H 2 O 2 /CODinitial ratio = 1, and contact time = 30 min...|$|E
