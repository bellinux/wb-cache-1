5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high {{platform}} at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur {{to be closer to}} him. She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} season, 16-year-old Peyton Sawyer is girlfriend to popular jock/star {{basketball}} player Nathan, but they soon break up when Peyton reasons that their relationship {{is more about}} sexual benefits than love, and that she is tired of his cruelty. In addition, she realizes that she no longer {{wants to be the}} star basketball player's girlfriend. She has a romantic interest in her ex's brooding half brother, Lucas. Through various interactions with Lucas, she finds that he is kind and thoughtful towards her. However, when he confesses the depths of his need and want for her, she becomes scared and runs from him; Lucas is left heartbroken and desperate. Peyton later goes to visit Lucas and professes that she wants what he wants, but it is too late; Brooke, her best friend, has now become romantically involved with Lucas. Lucas and Peyton eventually cannot resist each other, romantic-wise, and become secret lovers (though no sex is involved). On the night that they decide to tell Brooke, Lucas gets into a car accident and subsequently goes into a coma, which brings back painful memories for Peyton because her mother died in a car crash. When Lucas finally comes home from the hospital, he breaks up with Brooke in order to be with Peyton. Peyton soon ends their affair, however, after it is clear that Brooke has found out about the romance <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> spare Brooke's pain. Peyton continues to avoid Lucas while Brooke continues to avoid Peyton. Brooke declares her friendship with Peyton to be over. Peyton begins spending more time with Luke's best friend, Haley James, and with Jake Jagielski, along with Jake's daughter, Jenny. Eventually, her friendship with Lucas is slowly reformed, and the two attend a party together at Nathan's apartment. However, at the party, Peyton and Nicki, Jake's ex and Jenny's mother, fight.

They clash constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with Dr. Dillamond. Dr. Dillamond is the only Animal {{professor}} at the university and is beginning to suffer from discrimination, even from the students, which is shown when someone writes [...] "Animals should be seen and not heard" [...] on the chalkboard. He tells Elphaba that there is a conspiracy to stop the Animals from speaking, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it ("Something Bad").|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} Anna's biggest charm, Bell said that [...] "her charm is caught somewhere between her sincerity and optimism. Anna is genuine, sincere and {{compounded}} with optimism, and eternally optimistic {{people are the}} most charismatic people, much more attractive than those with a bad mood." [...] She also expressed why the character seemed to loveable to her, [...] "To have Anna {{in a situation where}} she starts the movie without any friends, because her lifestyle hasn’t allowed her to have a full kingdom. She runs around, because she wants friends." [...] Bell called the film's story is [...] "another turning point" [...] for Disney animation because the love depicted in this story is the love between siblings, a non-romantic love. Anna wants the world <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> explore, but she also wants to nurture the relationships around her, particularly the family relationship. [...] "It's very non-traditional for a Disney movie," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> hear all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with a certain volume in my voice. I am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix as we go, {{so by the time}} we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If you touch a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|E
500|$|Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater: Cameron said Winslet [...] "had {{the thing}} that you look for" [...] and that there was [...] "a quality in her face, in her eyes," [...] that he [...] "just knew people would be ready to go the {{distance}} with her". Rose is a 17-year-old girl, originally from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards the RMS Titanic with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, [...] "She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> explore and adventure the world, but she [...] that's not going to happen." [...] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, and Gabrielle Anwar had been considered for the role. When they turned it down, 20-year-old Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as [...] "an Audrey Hepburn type" [...] and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him. After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, [...] "He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him." [...] Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, [...] "From Your Rose", and lobbied him by phone. [...] "You don't understand!" [...] she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. [...] "I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" [...] Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.|$|E

And with Snake Eyes, he’s such a strong inspiration for Jinx. We trained in the same dojo and he’s become an icon, he’s a role model. He’s Snake Eyes, he’s the coolest, he’s the best, and Jinx wants to compete with him, you know? In the test that they have in the beginning she wants to win <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> prove that she wants to be better, or at least as good as him.

But for serious fans of the fiercely private superstar, this remains a window into her life." [...] The Hollywood Reporters David Rooney said, [...] "this is less a documentary portrait than a micromanaged video diary exploring the R superstar's relationship with her laptop. The HBO film will be candy to her fan base; just don't expect startling insights into the woman behind the talent." [...] Tirdad Derakhshani of the Philadelphia Media Network wrote that Life Is But a Dream [...] "is a carefully filtered snapshot of an artist who has enough power to become maker of her own myth." [...] Writing for Zap2it, Geoff Berkshire called it a [...] "vanity project and calculated act of image control. The only thing revealed by the film -- co-directed, co-written and co-executive produced by Beyoncé herself -- is a narcissistic inability to give up that desire for control." [...] Television critic Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times gave a negative review for the film, writing, [...] " [...] is as contrived as , but probably for good reason it is neither daring nor entirely truthful. It's an infomercial, not just about Beyoncé's talent onstage but her authenticity behind the scenes. She is a people-pleasing diva <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> keep it that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although she {{canceled}} the bridge, Palin spent $25 {{million from the}} $223 million earmark to build the road on Gravina Island to an empty beach where the bridge would have gone. State officials said [...] "they were going ahead with the $25 million road because the money would otherwise have {{to be returned to}} the federal government." [...] The cancellation of the bridge did not lead Palin to return any of the remaining $197 million in the earmark to the Federal Government. Palin's Ketchikan campaign coordinator Mike Elerding, says, [...] "She said 'thanks but no thanks,' but they kept the money." [...] According to Palin’s communications director Bill McAlister, the bridge [...] "isn't necessarily dead"; it may still be built with [...] "a less costly design". Palin changed her mind on the bridge, he said, when [...] "she saw that Alaska was being perceived as taking from the country and not giving, and that impression bothered her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> change it. [...] I think that Sarah Palin is someone who has the courage to re-evaluate situations as they developed." [...] Palin said through her spokesperson that the road would open territory for development. A McCain-Palin spokesperson said that [...] "because the contract for the road was already signed before she got into office, the governor was left no viable alternative." [...] The Alaska Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration state that the contract could have been cancelled at minimal cost and that the federal money could have been returned to Congress for other uses, if the road had been cancelled when Palin took office in December 2006, but the bridge to the island was not cancelled until September 2007.|$|E

Hades informs Zelena of Ruby's presence, and Zelena decides to use the silver slippers to leave in order to avoid further damning herself in Regina's eyes. But Regina and the others arrive before she can leave. Zelena reveals that she put Dorothy under a sleeping curse, and that it can't be broken as Dorothy has no loved ones to provide a [...] "true love's kiss." [...] At Regina's urging, Zelena hands over the silver slippers. Ruby realizes that Dorothy's late Auntie Em might be in the Underworld, and they find her at a diner she runs. She agrees to blow a kiss into a bottle for Ruby to bring to Dorothy, but Hades appears and turns Em into a liquid, by contaminating her soup with liquid from the River of Lost Souls, and bottles her up. He declares the Storybrooke visitors anathema, and that anyone who works with them would be under penalty of the same punishment. Ruby is distraught, and Snow asks her if she loves Dorothy; Ruby admits it, but is afraid to try to give Dorothy true love's kiss, as she doesn't know if Dorothy ever reciprocated her feelings. Snow convinces her to try. Zelena goes to Hades' lair, where he pours Em into the River of Lost Souls, and explains that he has done this only because Dorothy is Zelena's enemy.
