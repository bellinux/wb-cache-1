5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such <b>as</b> <b>community</b> gatherings, school events, {{or trade}} shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend {{on the number of}} tickets sold.|$|E

It aims to answer the question ‘What do we now know about the effects of operating classrooms as learning communities?’. Despite the fact that this mode of operating classrooms is not the dominant one, and is correspondingly under-researched, there is good evidence that it brings significant benefits...|$|R

5|$|In January 1998, Marburger became {{president}} of Brookhaven Science Associates, which subsequently won a bid to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory for the federal government, and he became {{the director of the}} lab. He took office after a highly publicized scandal in which tritium leaked from the lab's High Flux Beam Reactor, leading to calls by activists to shut down the lab. Rather than directly oppose the activists, Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management of the lab as well <b>as</b> <b>community</b> involvement and transparency. Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, expanded the lab's program in medical imaging and neuroscience, and placed more emphasis on its technology transfer program.|$|E

40|$|The author {{explored}} {{the meaning of}} the Black community according to a purposeful sample of 60 Black adults in the mid-Atlantic United States. Purposeful stratified sampling resulted in equal numbers of participants along the lines of locale (Brooklyn, New York; Wilmington, Delaware; and Washington, D. C.), gender, and generational affiliation (older adults, middle-aged adults, and young adults). Content analysis of responses to a single open-ended survey question resulted in 11 emergent themes around {{the meaning of the}} Black community: the Black <b>community</b> <b>as</b> cultural, the Black <b>community</b> <b>as</b> residential, the Black <b>community</b> <b>as</b> global, the Black <b>community</b> <b>as</b> supportive, the Black <b>community</b> <b>as</b> visibly distinctive, the Black <b>community</b> <b>as</b> socioeconomic, the Black <b>community</b> <b>as</b> nonactualized, the Black <b>community</b> <b>as</b> nondifferential, the Black <b>community</b> <b>as</b> nihilistic, the Black <b>community</b> <b>as</b> nondefinable, and the Black <b>community</b> <b>as</b> other. Gender and generational variations in thematic endorsement were analyzed, and implications of these findings as they pertain to research, mental health programs, and policies for Blacks are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The Armenian Apostolic Church is {{the oldest}} {{national}} church in the world, and had {{a major role in}} protecting the Armenian identity through the centuries of foreign domination.

5|$|Under Morales, Bolivia {{experienced}} unprecedented economic strength, {{resulting in}} the increase in value of its currency, the boliviano. His {{first year in office}} ended with no fiscal deficit; the first time this had happened in Bolivia for 30 years, while during the global financial crisis of 2007–08 it maintained some of the world's highest levels of economic growth. Such economic strength led to a nationwide boom in construction, and allowed the state to build up strong financial reserves. Although the levels of social spending were increased, they remained relatively conservative, with a major priority being placed on constructing paved roads, as well <b>as</b> <b>community</b> spaces such as soccer fields and union buildings. In particular, the government focused on rural infrastructure improvement, to bring roads, running water, and electricity to areas that lacked them.|$|E

Instead, stub ASes and ISP’s have high-degree nodes which act as hubs and provide internal connectivity, while the external connectivity is usually provided by lower-degree nodes.
