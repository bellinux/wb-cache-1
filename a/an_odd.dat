5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the great}} rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all the {{primordial}} isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived radioisotope potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single beta-stable nuclide, since {{there is not a}} difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number (isobars) free to beta decay toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. Beryllium is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.|$|E

40|$|Chapter 1 is {{a general}} {{introduction}} to normal and abnormal lung development. It outlines {{the current state of}} knowledge of the molecular basis of normal fetal lung development and then discusses the importance of these molecules in aberrant human lung development. It highlights the most important growth and transcription factors in each phase of lung development and describes where neonatal disease may arise and deals with the possible culprits. In chapter 2 an outline of the thesis is given. The role of HIF during basic murine lung development and the impact of the HIF pathway in the etiology of clinical diseases such as PPHN and ACD are important for understanding the effect HIF has on angiogenesis and pulmonary development. With these new insights innovative treatment strategies may be contemplated. Vessel formation in the lung is crucial for normal lung branching in the early embryonic phase {{as well as in the}} alveolar phase of lung development. In chapter 3 we demonstrate that in early fetal lung development over-expression of oxygen insensitive HIF- 1 a (HIF- 1 <b>a.</b> <b>ODD)</b> in mice leads to increased vascularization. This increase in vasculature seen in transgenic mice did not have an impact on branching. Low oxygen stimulated vessel growth in control and transgenic lungs as shown before. Pulmonary morphometric analyses of postnatal mice at various stages in alveolar development (postnatal days 2, 8, 14, 21) show an advancement of alveolarization in the HIF- 1 <b>a.</b> <b>ODD</b> lungs. Moreover, small vessel density was increased in HIF- 1 <b>a.</b> <b>ODD</b> lungs at E 18. 5 and postnatal days 2, 8 and 14. The HIF- 1 <b>a.</b> <b>ODD</b> lungs had significantly higher VEGF mRNA expression than C 57 control lungs on postnatal days 2, 8, and 14. The continuous activation of the HIF pathway and subsequent up-regulation of VEGF may account for this enhanced vascularization and subsequent alveolar formation...|$|R
