50|$|The <b>Admirals</b> {{first game}} was in December 2002. In a rain soaked game the <b>Admirals</b> lost 28-18 to the Dublin Rebels in an 8-a-side {{challenge}} match.

The club would get its first 11-a-side victories against the same side that winter in two challenge games.The following year saw the Cork <b>Admirals</b> improve to a 3-5 record in the expanded IAFL.

The final game of that season was the <b>Admirals</b> best performance, beating the Dublin Dragons 68-20 at Pfizer Sports Grounds.The <b>Admirals</b> held a recruitment drive in the Autumn of 2004, adding starting players and depth alike.

A victory against Limerick in a November challenge game introduced the rookies to <b>Admirals</b> football and prepared them for the season ahead.The <b>Admirals</b> season got off to a poor start when the U.L. Vikings recorded their first ever win over the Cork side. This started a four-game losing spell for the <b>Admirals,</b> despite some encouraging performances and close losses, as injuries and low squad numbers took their toll. The Summer brought about improved play from the <b>Admirals</b> and the results followed. The <b>Admirals</b> won three of their final four contests of the season, including two home wins to clinch a playoff spot, and return the <b>Admirals</b> to playoff contender status.The Belfast Bulls, league winners in 2005, proved too strong for the <b>Admirals,</b> however, ending the <b>Admirals</b> hopes for a Shamrock Bowl berth that season. In May 2013, the <b>Admirals</b> encountered financial problems and briefly halted playing operations. However, they have now made a return guided by a core nucleus of young players, and having won the IAFL-1 with an undefeated season in 2016, reentered the Shamrock Bowl Conference for 2017.|$|R

Christie lobbied Vice <b>Admiral</b> Arthur 'Chips' Carpender, Douglas MacArthur's Commander Allied Naval Forces, to allow him to replace Fife as commander of the larger submarine force at Brisbane.

5|$|Despite the {{endorsement}} of <b>Admiral</b> Sims, the Navy Department initially rejected the British request. Like other navies of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the U.S. Navy rigidly adhered to the doctrine of Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose first tenet was that under no circumstances should a battle fleet be divided. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations <b>Admiral</b> William S. Benson and <b>Admiral</b> Henry T. Mayo—Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet—were particularly worried that if Britain fell, as developments at sea suggested it might, the U.S. Navy would be left to face the German High Seas Fleet completely on its own.|$|E
