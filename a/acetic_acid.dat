5|$|<b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When undiluted, {{it is sometimes}} called glacial <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Vinegar is roughly 3–9% <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> by volume, making <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{the main component of}} vinegar apart from water. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{chemical}} reagent {{for the production}} of chemical compounds. The largest single use of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is in the production of vinyl acetate monomer, closely followed by acetic anhydride and ester production. The volume of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> used in vinegar is comparatively small.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{produced}} and excreted by <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is produced}} naturally as fruits and other foods spoil. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is also a}} component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent.|$|E

40|$|Perfluoroalkyl <b>acetic</b> <b>acids,</b> RFCH 2 COOH, can be {{prepared}} in several ways. Particular attention is here paid to the method starting from the azonitrile-initiated addition of the corresponding perfluoroalkyl iodide, R(F) I, to vinyl acetate, CH 2 =CHOCOCH 3, with formation of the adduct RFCH 2 CHIOCOCH 3. This method is reported as a four-step process that synthesizes perfluoroalkyl <b>acetic</b> <b>acids</b> through {{the conversion of the}} adduct into the corresponding ester RFCH 2 CH 2 OCOCH 3 and alcohol RCH 2 CH 2 OH. A simplified procedure consisting of three steps is also suggested: starting from the same reagents, perfluoroalkyl <b>acetic</b> <b>acids</b> can be easily prepared by the oxidation of the corresponding aldehyde RFCH 2 CHO obtained directly in good yields by acid hydrolysis of the primary adduct RFCH 2 CHIOCOCH 3...|$|R
5|$|By 1910, most glacial <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was {{obtained}} from the pyroligneous liquor, a product of the distillation of wood. The <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was isolated by treatment with milk of lime, and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 tons of glacial <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of indigo dye.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary use}} of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is the {{production}} of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM).

5|$|Amounts of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> used {{in these}} other {{applications}} together (apart from TPA) account for another 5–10% of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> use worldwide. These applications are, however, not expected to grow as much as TPA production.|$|E
5|$|Glacial <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is an {{excellent}} polar protic solvent, as noted above. It is frequently used as a solvent for recrystallization to purify organic compounds. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is used as a}} solvent in the production of terephthalic acid (TPA), the raw material for polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

40|$|Nowadays {{the use of}} {{probiotic}} products especially yogurt, due {{to having}} wonderful and health properties, has become popular in the world. In this study, the effect of homogenization pressure (100, 150 and 200 bars) and stage (single and two) {{on the amount of}} lactic and <b>acetic</b> <b>acids</b> was investigated. Yoghurts were manufactured from low-fat milk treated using high pressure homogenization at 100, 150 and 200 bar and at 60 °C. The amount of lactic and <b>acetic</b> <b>acids</b> was determined after the days 1, 7, 14 and 21 of storage at 4 ºC. The experiments were set up using a completely randomized design. With the increase of pressure and stage of homogenization, the amount of both acids was increased (p< 0. 01).

40|$|The total lipid {{and free}} fatty acid {{contents}} of Isotricha intestinalis, Entodinium simplex, and the rumen bacterial flora of the respective protozoa were determined. Warburg manometric data showed that the sodium salts of tributyrin, oleic, and <b>acetic</b> <b>acids</b> stimulated gas production in I. intestinalis, whereas tributyrin was stimulatory with E. simplex and less active with oleic and <b>acetic</b> <b>acids.</b> Rumen bacteria provided fatty acids produced lower manometric gaseous increases {{when compared with the}} protozoa. Volatile fatty acids were produced by I. intestinalis and rumen bacteria with tributyrin, but not with tripalmitin. Sodium oleate gave little volatile fatty acid response with I. intestinalis or rumen bacteria. Washed suspensions of I. intestinalis and rumen bacteria concentrated C 14 -labeled oleic, palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids within the cells during short incubation periods. Autoradiographs demonstrated the conversion of C 14 -labeled oleic, palmitic, stearic, linoleic, and <b>acetic</b> <b>acids</b> in the rumen protozoa and bacterial cells...|$|R
5|$|Ionization of acids is less in an acidic solvent than in water. For example, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a weak acid when dissolved in <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> This is because <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is a much}} weaker base than water.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of ethylenediamine dihydroiodide, provided as a nutritional supplement for livestock, consumes {{a large portion}} of available iodine. Another significant use is a catalyst for the {{production of}} <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> by the Monsanto and Cativa processes. In these technologies, which support the world's demand for <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> hydroiodic acid converts the methanol feedstock into methyl iodide, which undergoes carbonylation. Hydrolysis of the resulting acetyl iodide regenerates hydroiodic acid and gives <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E

The thermal behavior of the ATO gels powders and the microstructures of the thin films have been characterized by using thermogravimetric (TG), differential scanning calorimetric (DSC), Fourier transform infra-red spectral (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The electrical resistivity of the thin films was detected by four-probe instrument measurement. The thin films with HAc+MEA as coordination ligands had a good crystal quality and showed a preferred orientation along (101) plane when heated at 450 degrees C. As a consequence, it exhibited the best electrical performance. An electrical resistivity of about 6. 3 x 10 (- 3) Omega. cm could be achieved for the films with 500 nm thickness...|$|R

5|$|<b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} budget of formic and <b>acetic</b> <b>acids,</b> {{two of the}} most abundant trace gases in the atmosphere. Our bottom-up estimate of the global source of formic and <b>acetic</b> <b>acids</b> are ~ 1200 and ~ 1400 Gmol yr − 1, dominated by photochemical oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds, in particular isoprene. Their sinks are dominated by wet and dry deposition. We use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to evaluate this budget against an extensive suite of measurements from ground, ship and satellite-based Fourier transform spectrometers, as well as from several aircraft campaigns over North America. The model captures the seasonality of formic and <b>acetic</b> <b>acids</b> well but generally underestimates their concentration, particularly in the Northern midlatitudes. We infer that the source of both carboxylic acids may be up to 50 % greater than our estimate and report evidence for a long-lived missing secondary source of carboxylic acids that may be associated with the aging of organic aerosols. Vertical profiles of formic acid in the upper troposphere support a negative temperature dependence of the reaction between formic acid and the hydroxyl radical as suggested by several theoretical studies...|$|R
