5|$|In the 13th century, a new fiscal {{system was}} {{introduced}} and the hundreds were gradually included into larger <b>administrative</b> units called len, with a castle {{serving as the}} <b>administrative</b> center. This new <b>administrative</b> development {{was a result of}} the increased power of the aristocracy. In each len, a noble man was put in charge, with the title lensmand.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{consists}} of 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor, legislature and <b>administrative</b> bureaucracy. Each prefecture is further divided into cities, towns and villages. The nation is currently undergoing <b>administrative</b> reorganization by merging {{many of the}} cities, towns and villages with each other. This process will {{reduce the number of}} sub-prefecture <b>administrative</b> regions and is expected to cut <b>administrative</b> costs.|$|E
5|$|The aim of <b>administrative</b> law is to {{regulate}} the executive government by providing remedies which individuals can apply for when challenging <b>administrative</b> actions and decisions, and failures to take action and make decisions. Where the exercise of statutory or other discretionary power by public authorities contravenes the Constitution or is unlawful under <b>administrative</b> law, various remedies may be available when a judicial review action is taken.|$|E

5|$|As of 1997, its {{official}} name is the Hong Kong Special <b>Administrative</b> Region of the People's Republic of China. This {{is the official}} title as mentioned in the Hong Kong Basic Law and the Hong Kong Government's website, but Hong Kong Special <b>Administrative</b> Region and Hong Kong are widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{organs of}} {{military}} occupation, and the orders issued by OKH, regulating {{as they did}} {{a wide range of}} <b>administrative,</b> political, economic, cultural and social matters, the Germans still needed to establish a public <b>administrative</b> body that would implement their directives. It was decided to establish a puppet government for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|Illegality {{is one of}} {{the three}} broad {{headings}} of judicial review of <b>administrative</b> action in Singapore, the others being irrationality and procedural impropriety. To avoid acting illegally, an <b>administrative</b> body or public authority must correctly understand the law regulating its power to act and to make decisions, and give effect to it.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the {{district}} replaced the province as the country's main <b>administrative</b> unit. Ampara District {{was created in}} April 1961, followed by the creation of Mullaitivu and Gampaha districts in September 1978 through a new constitution, which also reintroduced the province as the main <b>administrative</b> unit. The last district to be created was Kilinochchi in February 1984, and the current constitution (that of 1978) states that the territory of Sri Lanka consists of 25 <b>administrative</b> districts. These districts may be subdivided or amalgamated by {{a resolution of the}} Parliament of Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal {{stated that}} {{fundamental}} rules of natural justice {{embodied in the}} concept of law in constitutional provisions such as Articles 9(1) and 12(1) are the same in nature and function as common law rules of natural justice in <b>administrative</b> law, except that they operate at different levels of the legal order. The former invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality and can only be altered by amending the Constitution, while the latter invalidate <b>administrative</b> decisions on the ground of <b>administrative</b> law principles and can be abrogated or disapplied by ordinary legislation.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} noted that the figure above for Chongqing's <b>Administrative</b> Area {{includes}} the entire Municipality of Chongqing whereas the City Population only counts the urbanized districts making up Chongqing city. Thus the population of the <b>administrative</b> area shown will be significantly larger. Chengdu is similar.|$|E
5|$|Marrakesh, the {{regional}} capital, constitutes a prefecture-level <b>administrative</b> unit of Morocco, Marrakech Prefecture, forming {{part of the}} region of Marrakech-Safi. Marrakesh is a major centre for law and jurisdiction in Morocco {{and most of the}} major courts of the region are located here. These include {{the regional}} Court of Appeal, the Commercial Court, the <b>Administrative</b> Court, the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal of Commerce, and the <b>Administrative</b> Court of Appeal. Numerous organizations of the region are based here, including the regional government <b>administrative</b> offices, the Regional Council of Tourism office, and regional public maintenance organisations such as the Governed Autonomous Water Supply and Electricity and Maroc Telecom.|$|E
5|$|Regions in the Philippines are <b>administrative</b> {{divisions}} that serve primarily {{to organize the}} provinces {{of the country for}} <b>administrative</b> convenience. The Philippines is divided into 17 regions (16 <b>administrative</b> and 1 autonomous). Most government offices are established by region instead of individual provincial offices, usually (but not always) in the city designated as the regional center. , CALABARZON was the most populated region while the National Capitol Region (NCR) the most densely populated.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury {{has been}} twinned with Zutphen, Netherlands since 1977. The Royal Navy {{submarine}} HMS Talent {{is affiliated with}} Shrewsbury and the town also served as the <b>administrative</b> headquarters of the British Army's regional 143 (West Midlands) Brigade whose <b>administrative</b> HQ was based at Copthorne Barracks, until 2014.|$|E
5|$|Successive Reichsstatthalter decrees between 1933 and 1935 {{effectively}} {{abolished the}} existing Länder (constituent states) of Germany and {{replaced them with}} new <b>administrative</b> divisions, the Gaue, headed by NSDAP leaders (Gauleiters), who effectively became the governor of their respective regions. The change was never fully implemented, as the Länder were still used as <b>administrative</b> divisions for some government departments such as education. This led to a bureaucratic tangle of overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities typical of the <b>administrative</b> style of the Nazi regime.|$|E
5|$|Susquehanna Township's {{population}} was the fastest-growing population of any <b>administrative</b> division in Juniata County between 1990 and 2005, {{with an increase}} of 35.42%. Other fast-growing populations in the county include those of Milford Township (22.53%) and Thompsontown 20.1%). The populations of Mifflin and Mifflintown are the only <b>administrative</b> divisions in the county whose populations decreased in that time period (at a rate of -7.42% and -3.7%, respectively). However, between 2000 and 2005, eight <b>administrative</b> divisions experienced decreasing populations. Between 1990 and 2000, every borough and township in the county experienced an increase in population.|$|E

5|$|The park {{is governed}} by an <b>administrative</b> council (Conseil d'Administration, CA) {{composed}} of 88 members, {{the majority of them}} local representatives. It is elected for 6-year terms. A 15-member executive committee (Bureau du Parc national) was established during the first <b>administrative</b> council's term and acts on its behalf.|$|E
5|$|The republic's <b>administrative</b> {{divisions}} {{remained largely}} unchanged from the structure {{used during the}} Soviet era, with the notable exception of selsoviets—a low-level <b>administrative</b> unit type abolished after the new law on the administrative-territorial divisions had been adopted in May 2000. As of 2014, the republic's administrative-territorial divisions include seven <b>administrative</b> districts (raions) and two republican urban okrugs. The districts have <b>administrative</b> jurisdiction over the inhabited localities located on their territory. Territories of the republican urban okrugs are separate from the districts and include a city/town of the republican significance, {{as well as one}} or several inhabited localities in their vicinity which had historically been administratively subordinated to that city/town.|$|E
5|$|The university's {{administration}} is structured {{in a way}} similar to other public universities in Brazil. The supreme decision body is the University Council (CONSU), composed of all deans, plus several representatives from the academic community, students, <b>administrative</b> staff and the external community. The council meets roughly 4 to 5 times per year, ruling on high level <b>administrative</b> decisions such as approving the budget and has the final word in internal <b>administrative</b> processes. Routine {{administration is}} left to the rector, similar to a university chancellor in English-speaking countries, and the rectorate.|$|E
5|$|These unitary {{authorities}} formed {{part of the}} <b>administrative</b> {{county of}} Somerset before the creation of Avon (a county created to cover Bristol and its environs in north Somerset and south Gloucestershire) in 1974. Bath however was a largely independent county borough during {{the existence of the}} <b>administrative</b> county of Somerset (from 1889 to 1974).|$|E

25|$|The <b>Administrative</b> Procedure Act is enacted {{to ensure}} that all <b>administrative</b> acts are carried out in pursuance of a fair, open and {{democratic}} process based on the principle of administration by law so as to protect the rights and interest of the people, enhance <b>administrative</b> efficiency and further the people's reliance on administration. <b>Administrative</b> procedure means the procedure to be followed by <b>administrative</b> authorities in performing such acts as rendering <b>administrative</b> dispositions, entering into <b>administrative</b> contracts, establishing legal orders and <b>administrative</b> rules, deciding on <b>administrative</b> plans, employing <b>administrative</b> guidance and dealing with petitions. <b>Administrative</b> authority is an organization representing the State, any local self-governing body or any other subject of administration with an independent legal status, in declaration of its intention and carrying on public affairs. An individual or entity commissioned to exercise public authority shall be deemed to be an <b>administrative</b> authority within the scope of commission (Articles 1–2).|$|E
25|$|<b>Administrative</b> courts (idari mahkemeler) {{exist at}} provincial level. The next {{instance}} are regional <b>administrative</b> courts (bölge idari mahkemeleri). <b>Administrative</b> courts solved cases involving probate, bankruptcy, and citizenship matters. Tax and family law were handled in separate courts. The highest <b>administrative</b> court in Turkey is the Turkish Council of State (Danıştay also called Supreme <b>Administrative</b> Court) or, {{equivalent to a}} federal supreme <b>administrative</b> court such as the Conseil d'Etat in France or the Federal <b>Administrative</b> Court of Germany (Bundesverwaltungsgericht).|$|E
25|$|<b>Administrative</b> law in Singapore is {{a branch}} of public law that is {{concerned}} with the control of governmental powers as exercised through its various <b>administrative</b> agencies. <b>Administrative</b> law requires administrators– ministers, civil servants and public authorities– to act fairly, reasonably and in accordance with the law. Singapore <b>administrative</b> law is largely based on English <b>administrative</b> law, which the nation inherited at independence in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Tver is the <b>administrative</b> {{center of}} the oblast and, within the {{framework}} of <b>administrative</b> divisions, it also serves as the <b>administrative</b> center of Kalininsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an <b>administrative</b> division, it is incorporated separately as Tver Okrug—an <b>administrative</b> unit with a status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Tver Okrug is incorporated as Tver Urban Okrug.|$|E

25|$|<b>Administrative</b> law arose as a {{response}} to the advent of the <b>administrative</b> state. It is a 20th-century product of English <b>administrative</b> law, which Singapore inherited at independence. Like the English system, Singapore does not have a separate system of specialist <b>administrative</b> courts as is the case in most civil law jurisdictions. Singapore courts are generally conservative in their approach towards <b>administrative</b> law, drawing heavily from English case law in some respects but not engaging in innovative elaboration of the existing heads of judicial review.|$|E
