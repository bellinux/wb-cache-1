5|$|In captivity, sarus cranes {{have been}} known to live for as long as 42 years. Premature adult {{mortality}} is often the result of human actions.

Overall the share of <b>agricultural</b> <b>area</b> decreased a sizeable 11 %, from 70.41 % in 1990 to 59.41 % in 2015 (R. Taylor, January/February 1990).

5|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{controlling}} gopher populations in <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> include poisoning dandelions, clover, carrots, {{sweet potatoes and}} parsnips. Camas pocket gophers are larger than other gophers, so conventional gopher traps may fail to capture them. Toxic baits and fumigants may also fail, since the gophers will sometimes wall off {{a segment of the}} burrow. Gophers may also cause local flooding if their tunneling activities damage levees.|$|E

5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E
5|$|Although much of Massachusetts {{had been}} cleared for agriculture, leaving only traces of old-growth forest in {{isolated}} pockets, secondary growth has regenerated in many rural areas as farms have been abandoned. Currently, forests cover around 62% of Massachusetts.

There are currently 219 endangered species in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Farmers use live {{electric}} wires to guard their farms, which kills other animals as well. Farmers in Neemuch (Madhya Pradesh) {{went on a}} hunger strike in 2015 demanding {{compensation for the damage}} caused by nilgai. Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, the damage caused by them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> as remedies for the menace.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies of}} the house sparrow in {{temperate}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> have found the proportion of seeds in its diet to be about 90%. It will eat almost any seeds, but where it has a choice, it prefers oats and wheat. In urban areas, the house sparrow feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans, such as bread, though it prefers raw seeds. The house sparrow also eats some plant matter besides seeds, including buds, berries, and fruits such as grapes and cherries. In temperate areas, the house sparrow has an unusual habit of tearing flowers, especially yellow ones, in the spring.|$|E
5|$|The CCF {{represented}} many <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> in the Commons, and it proposed several {{measures to}} assure financial security for farmers.

For the Atlantic fisherman, the CCF proposed cash advances {{at the start of the}} fishing season and government-owned depots which would sell fishing equipment and supplies to fishermen at much lower than market prices.|$|E
