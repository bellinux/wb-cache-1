50|$|Transite {{originated}} as a {{brand that}} Johns-Manville created in 1929 for {{a line of}} <b>asbestos-cement</b> products, including boards and pipes. In time it became a generic term for other companies' similar <b>asbestos-cement</b> products, and later an even more generic term for a hard, fireproof composite material, fibre cement boards, typically used in wall construction. It {{can also be found}} in insulation, siding, roof gutters, and cement wallboard.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, the {{discovery}} of broken <b>asbestos-cement</b> sheeting in the school hall was publicised in the local media. The problem has since been resolved.|$|E
50|$|The Dixon Centre is a {{substantial}} two storey brick building, rectangular in plan with a super six <b>asbestos-cement</b> roof covering the original roof of <b>asbestos-cement</b> slates. The site is bounded by Montague Road and Drake and Raven Streets, along which are located {{a substantial}} brick fence (which becomes a retaining wall in places) surmounted by regularly spaced brick piers. The timber picket fence which original enclosed {{the space between the}} piers is no longer extant. Also located on the site is the store for the Queensland Ballet props (formerly the store for wooden lasts), the engine house, air raid shelter and 1965 brick addition to the main building.|$|E
50|$|The village {{features}} 13 straight-line hayracks {{dating from}} the 19th century along a farm road south of the village center. The oldest hayracks are made of wood with tile roofs, {{and others have been}} renovated with concrete columns and <b>asbestos-cement</b> roof panels.|$|E
50|$|The Plešnar Hayrack (Plešnarjev kozolec) is {{a single}} straight-line hayrack dating from the 20th century. It has three masonry columns and two wooden ones, and is covered with <b>asbestos-cement</b> roofing. It stands on the north edge of the village {{along the road to}} Zadlog.|$|E
50|$|The state {{houses were}} {{constructed}} using over 400 designs, {{so that no}} two houses in a given area were identical. They were small by today's standards - the typical floor area was 882 sq ft for a two-bedroom house and 1055 sq ft for a three-bedroom house. The houses had timber frames and floors supported by piles and a perimeter wall. Exterior cladding was typically timber weatherboard, brick veneer, or <b>asbestos-cement</b> sheets or shingles. Roofs were typically hip or gable with a steep pitch (30 degrees), and were clad with concrete or clay tiles, or <b>asbestos-cement</b> sheets. Windows on state houses were of the timber casement type, with three panes vertically in larger windows and two panes in smaller windows.|$|E
50|$|Historically, CertainTeed {{was a major}} {{manufacturer}} of <b>asbestos-cement</b> pipes for water utilities for many decades. Asbestos was mixed into the cement as a binder. CertainTeed phased out the use of asbestos in its products around 1990. As a result, CertainTeed is now a major defendant in product liability lawsuits brought by persons who worked on water utility projects and their families.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} and middle years of the 20th century, many garden sheds and {{domestic}} garages were made of <b>asbestos-cement</b> sheets supported on a very light angle-iron frame. Concerns about safety led to the practice being discontinued, but they were cheap and long-lasting, and many can still be seen in British gardens. Advice on continued use or disposal is available.|$|E
5000|$|Smoke-developed index (abbreviated SDI) is {{a measure}} of the {{concentration}} of smoke a material emits as it burns. Like Flame Spread Index, it is based on an arbitrary scale in which <b>asbestos-cement</b> board has a value of 0, and red oak wood has 100. The SDI is measured using a horizontal test specimen, according to the Steiner tunnel test protocol.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{companies}} that produced <b>asbestos-cement</b> products that were reinforced with asbestos fibers have developed products incorporating organic fibers.

Cement-bonded wood fiber is another substitute. Stone fibers are used in gaskets and friction materials.|$|E
50|$|The {{progress}} of the flame front across the test material is measured by visual observation, while the smoke emitted {{from the end of}} the test assembly is measured as a factor of optical density. A flame spread index (FSI) and a smoke-developed index are calculated from these results. Both indices use an arbitrary scale in which <b>asbestos-cement</b> board has a value of 0, and red oak wood has 100.|$|E
5000|$|... "Almost no data {{exist on}} the {{possible}} long-term consequences of low level asbestos in early childhood. Causes of malignant mesothelioma have, however, {{been reported in the}} grown children of asbestos workers who were exposed to take-home asbestos; among non-working women in the asbestos mining townships of Quebec who were exposed in the community; and among long term residents of a community near an <b>asbestos-cement</b> plant in Northern Italy." ...|$|E

50|$|Jewish Community Center of White Sulphur Springs, {{also known}} as White Sulpher Springs Synagogue, is a {{historic}} synagogue located at White Sulphur Springs in Sullivan County, New York. It was built in 1934 and is a rectangular, 1-story building built into a hillside. It is a three-by-five-bay frame structure clad in <b>asbestos-cement</b> tiles. The front facade features a stepped, pedimented parapet that extends beyond the roofline. It {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1999.|$|E
50|$|The {{ruins of}} the chapel {{are located in the}} {{southern}} part of the village. According to stories told by elders there was a dome church instead of the chapel, however, it was destroyed by Shah Abbas during the deportation of local population in 1604. Later, the chapel was built there. In 1940 the chapel was destroyed and the rocks and cross-stones were used in the construction of the school basis. Currently, the roof is covered by <b>asbestos-cement</b> sheet.|$|E
5000|$|In 1908, AWWA began {{developing}} industry {{standards for}} products, processes and best practices. The AWWA Standards Program is recognized internationally {{as a source}} for scientific and management reference resources for the water community. Currently, there are over 150 AWWA Standards covering filtration materials, treatment chemicals, disinfection practices, meters, valves, utility management practices, storage tanks, pumps, and ductile iron, steel, concrete, <b>asbestos-cement,</b> and plastic pipe and fittings. [...] Standing committees periodically review and update the standards as required.|$|E
50|$|Sportivnaya (Спорти́вная) is a Moscow Metro {{station on}} the Sokolnicheskaya Line in Moscow, Russia. Named for the nearby Luzhniki Olympic Complex, it opened in 1957. The architects were Nadezhda Bykova, I. Gokhar-Kharmandaryan, Ivan Taranov, and B. Cherepanov. Sportivnaya has white marble pylons with green marble accents and a ceiling of {{embossed}} <b>asbestos-cement</b> tiles rather than the usual plaster. The upper two floors of the three-story vestibule are home to the Moscow Metro Museum, which displays 70 years of Metro memorabilia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} is symmetrically composed and uses materials which were uncommon for factory {{buildings of the}} period. It is Georgian Revival in style, with details including sills, banding and dressings picked out in dark blue salt glazed bricks. The roof was originally covered with diagonally laid <b>asbestos-cement</b> slates which were developed in France and not imported to Australia until [...] They were not manufactured in Australia until after the First World War. The slates survive under the present super-six sheeting.|$|E
5000|$|The Officers' Mess and {{quarters}} at Airfield Camp, {{completed in}} 1914, are Grade II* listed. The Mess is partly two-storey, while the linked accommodation block and the nine detached four-room chalets are single-storey. Construction is softwood framing with <b>asbestos-cement</b> panels, their joints covered with painted wood strips, under a tiled roof. Historic England describe {{the group of}} buildings as [...] "of outstanding historical interest, and of striking architectural form, comprising {{some of the earliest}} extant buildings erected for the RFC".|$|E
50|$|The Industrial Revolution {{increased}} {{population density}} in manufacturing districts, and produced pipes useful for drain-waste-vent systems from buildings to sewers. Gravity sewers have been assembled from cast iron pipe, vitrified clay pipe, precast concrete pipe, <b>asbestos-cement</b> pipe, and plastic pipe. While some older brickwork sewers remain in use, new sewers of diameters exceeding 1 m typically use reinforced concrete. Corrugated metal pipe {{may be used}} for storm drains or wastewaters with similarly low risk of corrosive conditions. Non-cylindrical cross-sections may have advantages for large-diameter sewers.|$|E

50|$|It would {{normally}} {{have had an}} earthen floor, but has been raised and a timber floor added. There are no ceilings in the core: all rooms {{are open to the}} unlined iron roof, while the walls of the largest room are lined with <b>asbestos-cement</b> sheeting. The building stands in well tended modern gardens of trees, shrubs and plants popular {{in the early part of}} this century. Behind the structure is a modern rectangular building which is used as a kitchen/livingroom by the present owner. Behind and to the left of this structure is an old shed and post and rail stock yards.|$|E
5000|$|For Fehr {{that meant}} local {{limestone}} rockwork inside and out. Floor coverings, walls and exterior sunscreens were fashioned from structural tile {{fired from the}} deep red clay of D'Hanis in South Texas. Casement and awning windows were of aluminum. Exterior wall surfaces and even sun shades were often simply gray <b>asbestos-cement</b> panels, either flat or corrugated and impervious to the rigorous Texas climate. The results tended to be too ascetic for some tastes. Fehr's own residence, built in 1949, was featured six years later in a House Beautiful article introduced as [...] "How to Learn from a house you may not Like" [...] (with photographs by Ezra Stoller).|$|E
50|$|The Milnes {{occupied}} No. 2 Warriston (the northern {{house and}} {{closest to the}} corner of Earle Street and Musgrave Road) until David Milne's death in 1897, while the other side was let to a succession of middle class occupants. These included surveyors WM Davidson and CT Bedford, Albert E Harte (a prominent Queen-street stock and share broker), and Captain James C O'Brien of the Queensland Defence Force. During the 1890s a private school operated in Warriston No. 1. From the 1910s Warriston served as a boarding house, and {{in the second half of}} the 20th century was converted into twelve flats (known as Berley Flats), the verandahs being enclosed and the exterior sheeted with <b>asbestos-cement</b> and stucco.|$|E

Petrochemical, chemical and pharmaceutical, microbiological industry. Basic engineering industry: agriculture (machinery for the comprehensive mechanization of cotton cultivation, cotton harvesters, etc.), production of tractors, equipment for the cotton and textile industry, construction and road machines, electrical engineering; developed aviation, electronic and instrument-making industry, chemical and petroleum engineering. The main centers of Tashkent, Samarkand, Namangan, Ferghana, Andijan. Materials companies worked out cement, <b>asbestos-cement</b> pipes, Slate, ceramic, wall materials and other (Bekabad, Akhangaran, Angren, Navoi, Tashkent and others).|$|E
50|$|When Indonesia {{joined the}} Colombo Plan in 1953, New Zealand quickly {{extended}} its Colombo Plan assistance to Indonesia. Under a technical assistance scheme, New Zealand sent experts to Indonesia while Indonesian trainees received training in New Zealand. New Zealand technical aid initiatives for Indonesia included {{the establishment of}} a technical trade training centre, short-term training courses for Indonesian dental nurses and dentists, the dispatch of New Zealand teachers to assist with English language teaching at teachers' colleges in Indonesia, and the construction of a Jakarta <b>asbestos-cement</b> board factory. New Zealand's Colombo Plan capital assistance was hampered by limited funds on the New Zealand side and limited technical expertise on the Indonesian side. By 1960, New Zealand had sent 29 experts to Indonesia while 99 Indonesians had been given scholarships for training in New Zealand.|$|E
5000|$|The {{industrial}} revolution introduced {{new methods of}} casting-iron and the railways brought a method of distributing the heavy cast-iron item to building sites. The relocation into the cities created a demand for housing {{that needed to be}} compact. Dryer houses controlled asthma, bronchitis, emphysema as well as pneumonia. In 1849 Joseph Bazalgette proposed a sewerage system for London, that prevented run-off being channelled into the Thames. By the 1870s all houses were constructed with cast iron gutters and down pipes. The Victorian gutter was an ogee, 115mm in width, that was fitted directly to the fascia boards eliminating the need for brackets. Square and half-round profiles were also available. For a brief period after the first world war <b>asbestos-cement</b> guttering became popular due to it being maintenance free: the disadvantages however ensured this was a short period: it was more bulky and fractured on impact ...|$|E
5000|$|The Ocvirk hayrack (Slovene: [...] ), at the {{southern}} entrance to Mirna to the left from the main road from Trebnje. It is a single stretched hayrack with ten frames. Between the third and the fifth pillar, it has a projecting roof. The pillars are made from oak, and the laths and the roofing from spruce and fir. It has simple roofing, covered with a double-pitched roof. Originally, it was thatched; however, since 1985, it has been covered with corrugated <b>asbestos-cement</b> roof panels. The hayrack was erected {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, on the right side of the road, but was moved to the left side in 1906 after the construction of the railroad started in 1908. A dendrochronological investigation, published in 2006, has shown that it was significantly renovated after 1923. It is part of the Path to Laze 1 homestead.|$|E
