It {{is defined as the}} average number of days per year when thunder can be heard in a given area, and the likelihood thereby of a thunderstorm. An isokeraunic map plots contours of equal keraunic number. The keraunic number has been used to set standards for safe design of electrical systems in structures connected to the local power grid.|$|E

As standard detection techniques implemented in {{the most commonly used}} systems cannot detect all of microemboli events whose energy is lower than the systolic energy, new techniques are proposed. By assuming that the Doppler signal is cyclostationary, we hypothesize that energy is statistically periodic. Furthermore, we hypothesis that embolic signals are unpredictable. Hence, the joint use of synchronous and linear prediction techniques could detect very small microemboli. If we periodically take and compare the values of the energy of the prediction error (or autoregressive parameters) at different time points in the cardiac cycle, we can therefore detect the presence of non-periodic events such as microemboli. In our study, we tested and compared our new technique to the standard technique (Fourier) using simulated and in vivo signals from patients with stenosis of high degrees of severity. From simulations, the standard automatic technique detected 60 % of microemboli detected by our gold standard technique (<b>audible</b> <b>detection</b> and sonogram visualization) whereas the synchronous linear prediction technique detects 97 % (the false alarm rate being set at 0 %). From clinic examinations, the standard automatic technique only detects 67 % of microemboli detected by our gold standard technique whereas the synchronous linear prediction technique detected 100 %. This study demonstrates that our new technique detects microemboli up to now not identified by classical methods.

40|$|Anthropogenic noise {{generated}} through {{travel in}} the Antarctic {{has the potential to}} affect the region's wildlife. Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) in particular can be exposed to anthropogenic noise because they live under, and breed on, the fast ice on which humans travel. To investigate the potential effects of anthropogenic noise on Weddell seals we developed sound profiles for pedestrian travel, over-snow vehicles, aircraft and watercraft operating at various distances and altitudes from breeding seals. The received 1 / 3 - octave noise levels were then related to an assumed detection threshold for the Weddell seal. We found that most noise levels generated by the pedestrian, quad (4 -wheeled, all-terrain vehicle) and Hagglunds (tracked, all-terrain vehicle) were commonly categorised in the inaudible and barely <b>audible</b> range of <b>detection</b> (both in-air and underwater), while noise levels generated by the helicopter, Twin Otter aircraft and Zodiac boat were categorised more commonly in the barely audible and clearly audible range. Experimental underwater recordings of vocal behaviour of Weddell seals exposed to continuous low-amplitude over-snow vehicle noise (i. e. Hagglund operation) were also made. Weddell seals underwater did not alter individual call types in response to low-level Hagglunds noise, but they did decrease their calling rate...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Unreliable and {{unsustainable}} {{electricity supply}} has been experienced in South Africa since 2007. Eskom implemented Demand Side Management (DSM) as a short-term solution to alleviate this problem. Several compressed-air DSM projects were implemented {{to help reduce}} the strain on the electrical network. Compressed air {{is an integral part}} of production in deep-level mining, and is extensively utilised. Problems are encountered with the effective management and repairing of leaks, since the majority of mines have little to no procedures in place for leak management. Awareness of the condition of the compressed-air system and leaks needed to be created at management level in order to achieve the best results. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of proper leak management on compressed-air systems in the mining industry. Peak-clipping DSM projects implemented in the mining industry were used for evaluation of results. Contribution to the sustainability of compressed-air DSM projects savings through successful leak documentation was the prime focus of this study. This was achieved through the development of a Compressed Air Leakage Documentation System (CALDS). This entailed the electronic field-data capture and record keeping of field data, using rugged PDA devices suitable for the extreme environmental conditions encountered in deep-level mining. Report generation on the status of detected leaks created awareness of compressedair- system performance and leak-repair tracking at management level. <b>Audible</b> <b>detection</b> was sufficient for this study, since the focus was on the larger more-severe leaks. Leaks were expressed in monetary terms to indicate the severity. It was found that successful management of leaks could contribute to an increase of as much as 85 % in project savings. The results also showed that creating awareness through documentation of leaks, and the effect this has on the system, resulted in regular repairing of these leaks. Sustainability of projects was maintained during an evaluation period of ten months, with projects achieving on average 125 % of target savings. The study showed that effective reporting on compressed-air leaks resulted in increased system efficiency and sustainable DSM project savings. It was also seen that leak detection by outsourced companies did not necessarily result in financial savings. When the mine took responsibility for its own leak detection and repairs, significant savings were realised. Master...|$|E
