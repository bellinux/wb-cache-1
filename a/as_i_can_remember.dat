He later recalled believing in the permanence of species, but [...] "as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> vague doubts occasionally flitted across my mind". When organising his Ornithological Notes between mid June and August, Darwin expanded on his initial notes on the Galapagos mockingbird Mimus thenca: ...|$|E
500|$|Dormand later {{described}} himself as [...] "a republican for as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> having an interest in politics" [...] and was a long-serving secretary of the all-party Parliamentary republican group. He spoke out {{in opposition to the}} monarchy, declaring in 1971 that [...] "the whole of the royal establishment from the Queen downwards could go, lock stock and barrel tomorrow". He extended his criticism to the hereditary peerage in February 1973. In 1974 he and fellow Labour MP Willie Hamilton took the required oath declaring their allegiance to the Queen, then admitted that they had not meant it. The same year, he criticised the number of Royal servants who appeared on the biannual honours lists, calling instead for [...] "scores of miners" [...] to be honoured as they were just as worthy.|$|E
500|$|Schuur {{started singing}} {{when she was}} about three years old. Her mother, who died when Schuur was 13, loved jazz and had a Duke Ellington record collection. Her father, a police captain, was an amateur {{musician}} who often played piano with his daughter sitting by his side. Schuur stated, [...] "As far back <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> singing was in my blood. My parents loved music, and I loved to sing. I was scatting at an early age". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if she hears a humming motor, she knows the name that note has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing.|$|E

500|$|Tracks on {{this album}} include [...] "E Pari Ra", [...] "One Fine Day", [...] "Let Me Lie", [...] "Danny Boy", and [...] "Abide with Me". Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also {{features}} singer Humphrey Berney. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name Celtic Treasure. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote: [...] "I come from a musical family, and one with {{a real sense of}} history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra. My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like Danny Boy from as early <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album." ...|$|E
500|$|In April, Farmer played {{shooting}} guard for the North {{team in the}} Kentucky Derby Festival Classic. He scored 14 points on 5 of 12 shooting and grabbed 3 rebounds, but his team lost to the South team 134125. Among his teammates in the Classic was Kentucky signee Sean Woods, who told the Lexington Herald-Leader that he and Farmer had become good friends and that he hoped Farmer would choose {{to play for the}} Wildcats. The paper also reported that Farmer had narrowed his list of potential college choices to three: Western Kentucky, LSU, and Kentucky. Farmer took an official visit to Western Kentucky the weekend of April 9, 1988, but on April 14, {{the second day of the}} April signing period, he held a press conference at his high school gymnasium to announce that he had signed a National Letter of Intent with Kentucky. He told the assembled crowd, [...] " [...] been a dream of mine as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> Even before kindergarten, I always wanted to play for Kentucky." ...|$|E
500|$|Many critics responded very {{positively}} to Inside No. 9. After the final {{episode of the}} first series, the comedic critic Bruce Dessau said on his website that it had [...] "really set an early benchmark to beat for comedy of the year. It has been consistently compelling as each week we entered an entirely different world." [...] On the same day, David Chater, writing in The Times, said of the series as a whole that [...] "t's hard to know which to admire more – the rich and perverse imaginations of Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith or the extraordinary range of acting talent that has brought this strange and memorable series to life." [...] Chater had previously described [...] "A Quiet Night In", the second episode of Inside No. 9, as [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen for as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> – one of those fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears". Mark Jones (The Guardian) considered the whole series, saying that the Inside No. 9 was [...] "never less-than-captivating", while a review in the Liverpool Echo described every episode as [...] "intriguing and lovingly-crafted", though {{it was felt that}} the first three episodes were stronger than the latter three. In December 2014, Metro television critic Keith Watson named Inside No. 9 the twentieth best television programme of 2014, and in January 2015, Daily Star Sunday columnist Garry Bushell named Inside No. 9 the best comedy TV programme of 2014.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} made {{available}} for streaming at Big Boi's MySpace page. Following leaks of several of its tracks, the album also leaked in its entirety to the Internet on June 29. Prior to its official release, anti-piracy companies had estimated that his tracks were being downloaded approximately 45,000 times a day. On July 1, Big Boi self-released his mixtape Mixtape for Dummies: Guide to Global Greatness as a free download through his website, featuring tracks compiled by DJ X-Rated and DJ Esco from Big Boi's solo recordings and work with OutKast. Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty was released by Big Boi's imprint Purple Ribbons label and Def Jam Recordings on July 5 in the United Kingdom and on July 6 in the US. A deluxe edition of the album was released simultaneously in the US, with the inclusion of two bonus tracks and a second DVD of music videos for several songs. Big Boi's official website store offered limited edition releases of the album, including the deluxe edition's two discs, ivory white vinyl LPs, a limited edition T-shirt, and a custom GoodWood chain. In promotion of the album's release, Converse produced a special limited edition run of Chuck Taylor All-Stars shoes in August 2010. The shoes were designed by Big Boi himself and feature the album title printed around the outer sides of the shoe's heel. On the collaboration, Big Boi {{said in a statement}} [...] "as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> music and Converse have gone hand in hand, so partnering up with them was a no-brainer".|$|E

2500|$|As {{far back}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> Father's place was all made and in order.

There were hawthorn hedges, primrose banks, and cow pastures with shrubberies." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was there}} that we lay upon that glorious afternoon. If we chose to roll upon our right sides, the whole weald lay in front of us, with the North Downs curving away in olive-green folds, with here and there the snow-white rift of a chalk-pit; if we turned upon our left, we {{overlooked}} the huge blue stretch of the Channel. A convoy, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> well <b>remember,</b> was coming up it that day, the timid flock of merchantmen in front; the frigates, like well-trained dogs, upon the skirts; and two burly drover line-of-battle ships rolling along behind them.

2500|$|From {{the early}} days of her career, Garbo avoided {{industry}} social functions, preferring to spend her time alone or with friends. She never signed autographs or answered fan mail, and rarely gave interviews. Nor did she ever appear at Oscar ceremonies, even when she was nominated. Her aversion to publicity and the press was undeniably genuine, and exasperating to the studio at first. In an interview in 1928, she explained that her desire for privacy began when she was a child, stating [...] "as early <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> I have wanted to be alone. I detest crowds, don't like many people." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{had written}} long-form before {{but it is}} pure story-telling in script writing and that goes back as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> for me, not just with my father but with myself. I slept in the same bedroom as my sister for many years, until it became indecent {{to do so and}} I would tell her stories every night—that is how she would get to sleep. She would say [...] "tell me a story" [...] so I would tell her a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so {{actually}} to write a script—it suddenly felt like I was just making up a big story.|$|E
2500|$|Elements of {{the album}} dated back {{to the end of}} the songwriting process for the {{previous}} album, Given to the Rising. Scott Kelly explained that the band continued to [...] "overwrite and then start subtracting ...As far back <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> there's always been an initial sort of reflection on where we were with the previous record and what we feel like doing, where we feel like we could be better. [...] We sort of let that settle in and then let the music go as it wishes". [...] Von Till explained that the lengthy songwriting process, which took over 5 years, was important to achieving the end result: [...] "For these songs, we had to kind of let them reconstitute themselves or transform into a new shape over time...It's basically finding the opportunities to surrender ourselves to that kind of tangible spirit that drives everything we do".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that remains}} to be seen," [...] Minver said. [...] "It was this sort of thing which my people valued above the other. Perhaps they were {{exclusive}} in their tastes, and did not care for an occultism which the crowd could share with them; though this is a conjecture too long after the fact to have much value. As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> now <b>remember,</b> they used to talk of the double presence of living persons, like their being where they greatly wished to be as well as where they really were; of clairvoyance; of what we call mind-transference, now; of weird coincidences of all kinds; of strange experiences of their own and of others; of the participation of animals in these experiences, like the testimony of cats and dogs to the presence of invisible spirits; of dreams that came true, or came near coming true; and, above everything, of forebodings and presentiments.|$|R

2500|$|Hal was memorialized with {{a chapter}} in the memoir written by his more famous mother, Ella Reeve Bloor, in 1940: [...] As a boy he loved the outdoors, was full of restless, eager {{vitality}} and bold curiosity. He had a startlingly vivid imagination, and an urge and talent for organizing that continued and marked his whole life. More than ordinarily shy, he forgot his shyness when engaged {{in one of his}} organizing ventures, and a flow of colorful, stirring talk would come from him so persuasive that those who heard him were completely carried away. He grew slim and tall, and when we moved to Arden was captain of the baseball team and a leader in tennis and other games. He missed a lot of school because of his siege of tuberculosis, but he read a lot and was always able to make up two or three years of ordinary schooling in a few months of intensive study. His interest in socialism began as early <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b>|$|E
2500|$|His {{music has}} been noted for its diversity, with Dusted {{saying that he had}} been [...] "defying strict genre classifications since the early nineties, {{swapping}} labels, styles, partners, motifs, and recording techniques as the desire has struck him". He has been recording for most of his life, telling Foxy Digitalis that [...] "I've made music as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> - ever since I was a child - and recorded the stuff as long as I've had the technology - I began with a cheap cassette player. So, it's strange to think what it'd be like not to make or record music. It seems unnatural!". When reviewing his 1996 CD Festival, Melody Maker described him as [...] "grand-meister of contemporary British improv, spiritual son of Eddie Prevost and Maddy Prior; gentle manipulator of English hymn-notics and religious incantations; protege, challenger and radicaliser of folk, blues, rock, minimalism and improvisation; translator for the sea and the rain and the sky; ambassador to war and peace, to love and anguish".|$|E

2500|$|Anthony Boucher, The New York Times Book Review (March 18, 1956) — Tantalizingly, the Viking Press {{informs us}} {{that one of}} the three novelettes in Rex Stout's Three Witnesses [...] "happens to be Stout's {{favorite}} among all the novelettes he has written." [...] Which one? Viking isn't telling; but I'll agree that one entry here is at least as good <b>as</b> any <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> among some two dozen novelettes of Nero Wolfe. [...] "Die Like a Dog" [...] (which, just to be confusing, appeared in American as [...] "The Body in the Hall" [...] and in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine as [...] "A Dog in the Daytime") combines one of Stout's most entertaining pictures of life in the menage at 918 West Thirty-fifth, as the hard-headed Nero {{turns out to be a}} dog lover at heart, with one of the best pure puzzles I've read in years: a technical model in the fair play and misdirection of the classic adventure form. The other two novelettes here assembled are only slightly less good; and connoisseurs will note with interest the fact {{that one of the}}m succeeds, incredibly, in keeping Wolfe away from the comforts [...] of Thirty-fifth Street for an entire case.|$|R
60|$|About {{the middle}} of the Miocene period, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> now <b>remember</b> (for <b>I</b> made no note of the precise date at the moment), my islands first {{appeared}} above the stormy sheet of the North-West Atlantic as a little rising group of mountain tops, capping a broad boss of submarine volcanoes. My attention was originally called to the new archipelago by a brother investigator of my own aerial race, who pointed out to me on the wing that at a spot some 900 miles {{to the west of the}} Portuguese coast, just opposite the place where your mushroom city of Lisbon now stands, the water of the ocean, as seen in a bird's-eye view from some three thousand feet above, formed a distinct greenish patch such as always betokens shoals or rising ground at the bottom. Flying out at once to the point he indicated, and poising myself above it on my broad pinions at a giddy altitude, I saw at a glance that my friend was quite right. Land making was in progress. A volcanic upheaval was taking place on the bed of the sea. A new island group was being forced right up by lateral pressure or internal energies from a depth of at least two thousand fathoms.|$|R

The evidence against him was as plain as a pike-staff. All I could find out was that on a certain day a horse had trod on the fellow's foot.

6000|$|Well, {{not to make}} {{my story}} too long in these early childish stages, {{we went on the}} train, as it seemed to me, a long way across fields to Aunt Emma's. I didn't know she was Aunt Emma then for, indeed, I had never seen her before; but I {{remember}} arriving there at her pretty little cottage, and seeing a sweet old lady--barely sixty, I should say, but with smooth white hair,--who stood {{on the steps of the}} house and cried like a child, and held out her hands to me, and hugged me and kissed me. And it was there that I learned my first word. A great many times over, she spoke about [...] "Una." [...] She said it so often, I caught vaguely at the sound. And nurse, when she answered her, said [...] "Una" [...] also. Then, when Aunt Emma called me, she always said [...] "Una." [...] So it came to me dimly that Una meant ME. But I didn't exactly recollect it had been my name before, though I learned in due time afterwards that I'd always been called so. However, just at first, I picked up the word as a child might pick it up; and when, some months later, I began to talk easily, I spoke of myself always in the third person <b>as</b> Una. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> with a smile now how I went one day to Aunt Emma--I, a great girl of eighteen--and held up my skirt, that I'd muddied in the street, and said to her, with great gravity: ...|$|R

60|$|What I {{really thought}} was that we both had had just about enough of it. The {{manner in which the}} great West Wind chooses at times to {{administer}} his possessions does not commend itself to a person of peaceful and law-abiding disposition, inclined to draw distinctions between right and wrong in the face of natural forces, whose standard, naturally, is that of might alone. But, of course, I said nothing. For a man caught, as it were, between his skipper and the great West Wind silence is the safest sort of diplomacy. Moreover, I knew my skipper. He did not want to know what I thought. Shipmasters hanging on a breath before the thrones of the winds ruling the seas have their psychology, whose workings are as important to the ship and those on board of her as the changing moods of the weather. The man, as a matter of fact, under no circumstances, ever cared a brass farthing for what I or anybody else in his ship thought. He had had just about enough of it, I guessed, and what he was at really was a process of fishing for a suggestion. It was the pride of his life that he had never wasted a chance, no matter how boisterous, threatening, and dangerous, of a fair wind. Like men racing blindfold for a gap in a hedge, we were finishing a splendidly quick passage from the Antipodes, with a tremendous rush for the Channel in as thick a weather <b>as</b> any <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> but his psychology did not permit him to bring the ship to with a fair wind blowing--at least not on his own initiative. And yet he felt that very soon indeed something would have to be done. He wanted the suggestion to come from me, so that later on, when the trouble was over, he could argue this point with his own uncompromising spirit, laying the blame upon my shoulders. I must render him the justice that this sort of pride was his only weakness.|$|R
