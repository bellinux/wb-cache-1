25|$|The {{line was}} opened at Easter 1896. In {{anticipation}} of this, Colonel Sir Francis Marindin from the Board of Trade made an unofficial {{inspection of the}} line on Friday 27 March.

25|$|Before the {{development}} of locomotive-actuated train braking systems in the late 19th century, designated railroad employees known as brakemen would move about the tops of cars, setting hand brakes {{in an effort to}} stop the train in a timely manner. This process was imprecise and extremely dangerous. Many brakemen lost life and limb as a result of falling from a moving train, icy and wet conditions often adding to the hazards involved in negotiating the top of a swaying boxcar. In the U.S., an 1893 federal law, the Railroad Safety Appliance Act, required <b>automatic</b> <b>brakes</b> on all railroads, effective in 1900.|$|E

In order to ensure the accuracy of information conducted research for determination of optimal combination of different sensors that provide an adequate perception of road conditions. The tracking system should be equipped with a combination of sensors, which in the case of detection of an obstacle or dangers of signal is transmitted to the information processing system and decision making. Information from the monitoring system should include data for the identification of the object, its condition, the speed. ...|$|R

25|$|On 19 December 2016, a {{truck was}} {{deliberately}} {{driven into the}} Christmas market next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at Breitscheidplatz in Berlin, leaving 12 people dead and 56 others injured, a total of 68 people that were involved in this incident. One of the victims was the truck's original driver, Łukasz Urban, who was found shot dead in the passenger seat. The truck was eventually stopped by its <b>automatic</b> <b>brakes.</b> The perpetrator was Anis Amri, a Tunisian failed asylum seeker, urged by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Four days after the attack, {{he was killed in}} a shootout with police near Milan in Italy. An initial suspect was arrested and later released due to lack of evidence. The event was designated as a terrorist attack.|$|E
25|$|Air {{brakes on}} the train are {{supplied}} with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air brake pipe connects to each car and locomotive {{on the train}}. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If {{the system is not}} recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no braking force. When the air brake control valves sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, they are designed to activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is slow and steady, the <b>automatic</b> <b>brakes</b> may not be applied {{as in the case of}} the Lac-Mégantic accident. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be. Also, the TSB found that the “reset safety control” on the lead locomotive was not wired to set the entire train’s brakes in the event of an engine failure.|$|E

One of the passengers, Ellis Griffith Roberts of Llanberis, on seeing the driver and fireman jump from the locomotive did likewise. Falling to the ground, he sustained a serious cut to the head and later died from loss of blood.|$|E

25|$|The <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> {{works by}} {{monitoring}} the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the <b>brakes</b> operate. The <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|R
6000|$|The great {{voice of}} {{material}} Fate cried Halt! And {{in the midst}} of the play the actors staggered, dropped, and were still. The figure runs from my pen. In New York that very thing occurred. Most of the theatrical audiences dispersed, but in two crowded houses the company, fearing a panic, went on playing amidst the gloom, and the people, trained by many a previous disaster, stuck to their seats. There they sat, the back rows only moving a little, and there, in disciplined lines, they drooped and failed, nodded, and fell forward or slid down upon the floor. I am told by Parload--though indeed I know nothing of the reasoning on which his confidence rests---that within an hour of the great moment of impact the first green modification of nitrogen had dissolved and passed away, leaving the air as translucent as ever. The rest of that wonderful interlude was clear, had any had eyes to see its clearness. In London it was night, but in New York, for example, people were in the full bustle of the evening's enjoyment, in Chicago they were sitting down to dinner, the whole world was abroad. The moonlight must have illuminated streets and squares littered with crumpled figures, through which such electric cars as had no <b>automatic</b> <b>brakes</b> had ploughed on their way until they were stopped by the fallen bodies. People lay in their dress clothes, in dining-rooms, restaurants, on staircases, in halls, everywhere just as they had been overcome. Men gambling, men drinking, thieves lurking in hidden places, sinful couples, were caught, to arise with awakened mind and conscience amidst the disorder of their sin. America the comet reached in the full tide of evening life, but Britain lay asleep. But as I have told, Britain did not slumber so deeply but that she was in the full tide of what may have been battle and a great victory. Up and down the North Sea her warships swept together like a net about their foes. On land, too, that night was to have decided great issues. The German camps were under arms from Redingen to Markirch, their infantry columns were lying in swathes like mown hay, in arrested night march on every track between Longuyon and Thiancourt, and between Avricourt and Donen. The hills beyond Spincourt were dusted thick with hidden French riflemen; the thin lash of the French skirmishers sprawled out amidst spades and unfinished rifle-pits in coils that wrapped about the heads of the German columns, thence along the Vosges watershed and out across the frontier near Belfort nearly to the Rhine.
