40|$|ATP-driven proton pumps, {{which are}} {{critical}} to the operation of a cell, maintain cytosolic and organellar pH levels within a narrow functional range. These pumps employ two very different mechanisms: an elaborate rotary mechanism used by V-ATPase H+ pumps, and a simpler <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> mechanism used by P-ATPase H+ pumps. Why are two different mechanisms used to perform the same function? Systematic analysis, without parameter fitting, of kinetic models of the rotary, <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> and other possible mechanisms suggest that, when the ratio of protons transported per ATP hydrolyzed exceeds one, the one-at-a-time proton transport by the rotary mechanism is faster than other possible mechanisms across {{a wide range of}} driving conditions. When the ratio is one, there is no intrinsic difference in the free energy landscape between mechanisms, and therefore all mechanisms can exhibit the same kinetic performance. To our knowledge all known rotary pumps have an H+:ATP ratio greater than one, and all known <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> ATP-driven proton pumps have a ratio of one. Our analysis suggests a possible explanation for this apparent relationship between coupling ratio and mechanism. When the conditions under which the pump must operate permit a coupling ratio greater than one, the rotary mechanism may have been selected for its kinetic advantage. On the other hand, when conditions require a coupling ratio of one or less, the <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> mechanism may have been selected for other possible advantages resulting from its structural and functional simplicity...|$|R

Our data indicate discrepancies in the <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> model of cotransport, which cannot consistently explain substrate transport and electrophysiological data. We are able simultaneously to isolate distinct external and internal binding sites for substrate, which exert different effects upon currents conducted by hSERT, in contradiction to the <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> model. External binding sites of coupled Na ions are likewise simultaneously accessible from {{the internal and external}} face. Although Na and Cl are putatively cotransported, they have opposite effects on the internal face of the transporter. Finally, the internal K ion does not compete with internal 5 -hydroxytryptamine for empty transporters. These data can be explained more readily in the language of ion channels, rather than carrier models distinguished by <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> mechanisms: in a channel model of coupled transport, the currents represent different states of the same permeation path through hSERT and coupling occurs in a common pore...|$|R

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) is a membrane transporter that exchanges a cytosolic ADP for {{a matrix}} ATP. Atomic structures in an outward-facing (OF) form which binds an ADP from the intermembrane space have been solved by X-ray crystallography, and revealed their unique pseudo three-fold symmetry fold which is qualitatively different from pseudo two-fold symmetry of most transporters of which atomic structures have been solved. However, any atomic-level information on an inward-facing (IF) form, which binds an ATP from the matrix side and is fixed by binding of an inhibitor, bongkrekic acid (BA), is not available, and thus its <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> {{mechanism for the}} transport process is unknown. Here, we report an atomic structure of the IF form predicted by atomic-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> transition with a recently developed accelerating technique. We successfully obtained a significantly stable IF structure characterized by newly formed well-packed and -organized inter-domain interactions through the accelerated simulations of unprecedentedly large conformational changes of the <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> without a prior knowledge of the target protein structure. The simulation also shed light on an atomistic mechanism of the strict transport selectivity of adenosine nucleotides over guanosine and inosine ones.

40|$|International audienceIn {{analogy with}} many other proteins, Na(+) /Ca(2 +) {{exchangers}} (NCX) adapt an inverted twofold symmetry of repeated structural elements, while exhibiting a functional asymmetry by stabilizing an outward-facing conformation. Here, structure-based mutant analyses of the Methanococcus jannaschii Na(+) /Ca(2 +) exchanger (NCX_Mj) were performed in conjunction with HDX-MS (hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry) to identify the structure-dynamic determinants of functional asymmetry. HDX-MS identified hallmark differences in backbone dynamics at ion-coordinating residues of apo-NCX_Mj, whereas Na(+) or Ca(2 +) binding to the respective sites induced relatively small, but specific, changes in backbone dynamics. Mutant analysis identified ion-coordinating residues affecting the catalytic capacity (kcat/Km), but not {{the stability of the}} outward-facing conformation. In contrast, distinct "noncatalytic" residues (adjacent to the ion-coordinating residues) control the stability of the outward-facing conformation, but not the catalytic capacity. The helix-breaking signature sequences (GTSLPE) on the α 1 and α 2 repeats (at the ion-binding core) differ in their folding/unfolding dynamics, while providing asymmetric contributions to transport activities. The present data strongly support the idea that asymmetric preorganization of the ligand-free ion-pocket predefines catalytic reorganization of ion-bound residues, where secondary interactions with adjacent residues couple the <b>alternating</b> <b>access.</b> These findings provide a structure-dynamic basis for ion-coupled <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> in NCX and similar proteins...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSodium coupled cotransporters of the five-helix {{inverted}} repeat (5 HIR) superfamily use an <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> mechanism to transport {{a myriad of}} small molecules across the cell membrane. One of the primary steps in this mechanism is the conformational transition from a state poised to bind extracellular substrates to a state that is competent to deliver substrate to the cytoplasm. Here, we construct a coarse-grained model of the 5 HIR benzylhydantoin transporter Mhp 1 that incorporates experimental structures of the outward- and inward-open states to investigate the mechanism of this conformational change. Using the weighted ensemble path-sampling method, we rigorously sample the outward- to inward-facing transition path ensemble. The transition path ensemble reveals a heterogeneous set of pathways connecting the two states and identifies two modes of transport: one consistent with a strict <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> mechanism and another where decoupling of {{the inner and outer}} gates causes the transient formation of a continuous permeation pathway through the transporter. We also show that the conformational switch between the outward- and inward-open states results from rigid body motions of the hash motif relative to the substrate bundle, supporting the rocking bundle hypothesis. Finally, our methodology provides the groundwork for more chemically detailed investigations of the alternating mechanism...|$|R

The rapidly growing number of atomic structures of transporters in different conformations and the constant progress in bioinformatics have recently added deeper insights.   The unifying mechanism of energized solute transport across membranes is assumed to consist of the conformational cycling of a carrier protein {{to provide access to}} substrate binding sites from either side of a cellular membrane. Due to the central role of active membrane transport there is considerable interest in deciphering the principles {{of one of the most}} fundamental processes in nature: the <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> mechanism.   This book brings together particularly significant structure-function studies on a variety of carrier systems from different transporter families: Glutamate symporters, LeuT-like fold transporters, MFS transporters and SMR (RND) exporters, as well as ABC-type importers.   The selected examples impressively demonstrate how the combination of functional analysis, crystallography, investigation of dynamics and computational studies has made it possible to create a conclusive picture, or, more precisely, “a molecular movie”.

40|$|Redox-driven proton pumps such as {{cytochrome}} c oxidase (CcO) {{are fundamental}} {{elements of the}} energy transduction machinery in biological systems. CcO is an integral membrane protein that acts as the terminal electron acceptor in respiratory chains of aerobic organisms, catalyzing the four-electron reduction of O 2 to H 2 O. This reduction also requires four protons taken from the cytosolic or negative side of the membrane, with an additional uptake of four protons that are pumped across the membrane. Therefore, the proton pump must embody a “gate,” which provides <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> of protons to {{one or the other}} side of the membrane but never both sides simultaneously. However, the exact mechanism of proton translocation through CcO remains unknown at the molecular level. Understanding pump function requires knowledge of the nature and location of these structural changes that is often difficult to access with crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. In this paper, we demonstrate, with amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS, that transitions between catalytic intermediates in CcO are orchestrated with opening and closing of specific proton pathways, providing an <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> for protons to the two sides of the membrane. An analysis of these results in the framework of the 3 D structure of CcO indicate the spatial location of a gate, which controls the unidirectional proton flux through the enzyme and points to a mechanism by which CcO energetically couples electron transfer to proton translocation...|$|R
