5|$|The trial, Illinois vs. August Spies et al., {{began on}} June 21, 1886, {{and went on}} until August 11. The trial was {{conducted}} {{in an atmosphere of}} extreme prejudice by both public and media toward the defendants. It was presided over by Judge Joseph Gary. Judge Gary displayed open hostility to the defendants, consistently ruled for the prosecution, and failed to maintain decorum. A motion to try the defendants separately was denied. The defense counsel included Sigmund Zeisler, William Perkins Black, William Foster, and Moses Salomon. Selection of the jury was extraordinarily difficult, lasting three weeks, and nearly one thousand people called. All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed. In the end a jury of 12 was seated, most of whom confessed prejudice towards the defendants. Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would acquit if the evidence supported it, refusing to dismiss for prejudice. Eventually the peremptory challenges of the defense were exhausted. Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed, a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random. The bailiff proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position <b>and</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> the defendants. The prosecution, led by Julius Grinnell, argued that since the defendants had not actively discouraged the person who had thrown the bomb, they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators. The jury heard the testimony of 118 people, including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and the defendants Fielden, Schwab, Spies and Parsons. Albert Parsons' brother claimed there was evidence linking the Pinkertons to the bomb. This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of consumersâ€™ trust <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> online shopping. <b>Attitude</b> {{is referred to as}} a positive or negative evaluation of people, activities, ideas, objects, event, or just about anything in the environment. Different facets of the e-shopping behavior of consumers have been investigated in previous literature. These facets can generally be divided into three namely, behavioral intention, actual behavior <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> behavior. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of consumersâ€™ trust <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> online shopping. A quantitative research design was adopted to collect data. Multiple regression analysis method was used to conduct this study. The findings of the study will contribute to both theory and practice. The results of this study have important contributions and implications for practitioners and policy-makers. This study contributed to the field of consumersâ€™ trust <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> relationship with online shopping in the context of developing countries. It is contended that the examination of the effects of consumersâ€™ trust <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> online shopping is more significant than the examination of a direct relationship, which is quite obvious...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. – <b>Attitude</b> <b>toward</b> nature <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> {{environmental}} protection are two separate but correlated attitudes. Little {{is known about}} the two attitudes’ stability/volatility over time, despite the practical value of such knowledge. Objectives & method. – Using longitudinal survey data from 251 adults in a cross-lagged structural equation model, we assessed the degree of spontaneous (i. e., unprompted) change in the two attitudes. We also considered whether such change could provide evidence regarding causal direction; causation could go in either of two directions between the two attitudes, or it could even be bi-directional. Results. – We corroborated the substantive connection between <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> nature <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> {{environmental protection}}; however, the absence of change in the attitudes despite the passage of two years disallows reliable statements about causal direction. Conclusion. – It is possible to protect the environment by encouraging appreciation of nature, but change in <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> nature <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> environmental protection may be difficult to achieve with mature individuals...|$|R

25|$|A {{crossing}} sweeper was {{a person}} who would sweep a path ahead of people crossing dirty urban streets in exchange for a gratuity. This practice was an informal occupation among the urban poor, primarily during the 19th century. It was the focus of fairly intense study and commentary, <b>and</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> the presence of crossing sweepers on city streets varied greatly among urban residents, ranging from appreciation for their work to feelings that they were a public nuisance. Crossing sweepers also found their way into 19th-century fiction and artwork, including a novel by Charles Dickens and a popular painting by William Powell Frith.|$|E

In 1992, Frederick Busch wrote in The New York Times that Hemingway had gone out of fashion.

A series of laboratory experiments will be conducted with consumers as the participants. Quantitative data collected through the experiment will be analyzed and a research model will be tested.

40|$|Background: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is {{a serious}} illness {{characterized}} by emotional dysregulation, impulsivity and impaired interpersonal relationship. Yet, {{few studies have examined}} borderline personality features, concomitant alexithymia and impaired relationship toward parents in adolescents. Objectives: This article explored the association between alexithymia <b>and</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> mother as predictive factors of borderline personality features in high school sample of students. Patients and Methods: Three hundred students (150 females, 150 males) {{with a mean age of}} 15. 72 years, were selected via multistage random sampling. Data was collected by Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children, Toronto Alexithymia Scale <b>and</b> Child’s <b>Attitude</b> <b>toward</b> Mother Scale. Analyzing data were performed using canonical correlation. Results: Structural coefficients showed that the pattern of high scores in borderline personality features correlated with the pattern of high scores in alexithymia <b>and</b> child’s <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> mother. Therefore, the results showed that combination of low borderline personality features can probably decrease the likelihood of alexithymia <b>and</b> child’s <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> mother. Conclusions: Alexithymia <b>and</b> child’s <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> mother can predict borderline personality features and explain a considerabl...|$|R

As a result, many Australian Vietnam veterans were excluded from joining the Returned Servicemen's League (RSL) during the 1960s and 1970s {{on the grounds that}} the Vietnam War veterans did not fight a [...] "real war". The response of the RSL varied across the country, and while some rejected Vietnam veterans, other branches, particularly those in rural areas, were said to be very supportive. Nevertheless, many Vietnam veterans were excluded from marching in Anzac Day parades during the 1970s because some soldiers of earlier wars saw the Vietnam veterans as unworthy heirs to the ANZAC title and tradition, a view which hurt many Vietnam veterans and resulted in continued resentment towards the RSL. Regardless, in 1972 the RSL decided that Vietnam veterans should lead the march, which attracted large crowds throughout the country.|$|E

Methods: A within-subject design was used in which participants were exposed to 8 different movie clips containing alcohol (positive or negative context) or no alcohol portrayals in a controlled laboratory setting.
