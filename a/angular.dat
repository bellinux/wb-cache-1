5|$|Although the Sun {{dominates the}} system by mass, it {{accounts}} for only about 2% of the <b>angular</b> momentum. The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account {{for most of the}} rest of the <b>angular</b> momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Angular</b> motions occur over {{synovial}} {{joints and}} {{causes them to}} either increase or decrease angles between bones.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{twinkling}} {{limits the}} resolution obtainable from ground-based telescopes since turbulence degrades <b>angular</b> resolution.|$|E
5|$|Each photon carries two {{distinct}} and independent forms of <b>angular</b> momentum of light.|$|E
5|$|In many contexts, a {{positive}} <b>angular</b> coordinate {{means that the}} angle ϕ is measured counterclockwise from the axis.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stars are}} {{observed}} {{to be members}} of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its <b>angular</b> momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that <b>angular</b> momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some <b>angular</b> momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{differential}} rotation is observed on {{stars such as}} the Sun when the <b>angular</b> velocity varies with latitude. Typically the <b>angular</b> velocity decreases with increasing latitude. However the reverse has also been observed, such as on the star designated HD31993. The first such star, other than the Sun, to have its {{differential rotation}} mapped in detail is AB Doradus.|$|E
5|$|The disks of most {{stars are}} much too small in <b>angular</b> size to be {{observed}} with current ground-based optical telescopes, and so interferometer telescopes are required to produce images of these objects. Another technique for measuring the <b>angular</b> size of stars is through occultation. By precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the Moon (or the rise in brightness when it reappears), the star's <b>angular</b> diameter can be computed.|$|E
5|$|The light orbital <b>angular</b> {{momentum}} {{of a particular}} photon can be any integer N, including zero.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the stellar wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of <b>angular</b> velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, <b>angular</b> momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E
5|$|The moon being {{almost exactly}} at perigee (making its <b>angular</b> {{diameter}} {{as large as}} possible).|$|E
5|$|The {{physics of}} {{accretion}} disks encounters some problems. The {{most important one}} is how the material, which is accreted by the protostar, loses its <b>angular</b> momentum. One possible explanation suggested by Hannes Alfvén was that <b>angular</b> momentum was shed by the solar wind during its T Tauri star phase. The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses. Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding <b>angular</b> momentum is magnetic braking, where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star's magnetic field. The main processes responsible for {{the disappearance of the}} gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo-evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The {{tip of the}} <b>angular</b> is {{situated}} close to {{the midpoint of the}} bone in K. langenbergensis rather than being at the back as in K. guimarotae. In both species, the back of the <b>angular</b> contributes to the retroarticular process. The inner surface of the <b>angular</b> is roughened in K. guimarotae, and the top margin of the inner wall transitions from an upward-projecting tip at the front to a low, rounded crest at the back; the same margin maintains its height along the <b>angular</b> in K. langenbergensis. The surangular bears a thin, forward-projecting process that, in K. langenbergensis, extends forward {{to the back of the}} tooth row and bears a groove on the bottom. The presence of the oval-shaped external mandibular fenestra is unique to the genus among atoposaurids.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism that}} causes differential rotation is turbulent convection inside a star. Convective motion carries energy {{toward the surface}} through the mass movement of plasma. This mass of plasma carries {{a portion of the}} <b>angular</b> velocity of the star. When turbulence occurs through shear and rotation, the <b>angular</b> momentum can become redistributed to different latitudes through meridional flow.|$|E
5|$|These lists detail {{all known}} and {{predicted}} baryons in total <b>angular</b> momentum J= and J= configurations with positive parity.|$|E
5|$|This <b>angular</b> scaling {{can be seen}} in the apsidal precession, i.e., in {{the gradual}} {{rotation}} of the long axis of the ellipse (Figure3). As noted above, the orbit as a whole rotates with a mean <b>angular</b> speed Ω=(k−1)ω, where ω equals the mean <b>angular</b> speed of the particle about the stationary ellipse. If the particle requires a time T to move from one apse to the other, this implies that, in the same time, the long axis will rotate by an angle β=ΩT=(k−1)ωT=(k−1)×180°. For an inverse-square law such as Newton's law of universal gravitation, where n equals 1, there is no <b>angular</b> scaling (k=1), the apsidal angle α is 180°, and the elliptical orbit is stationary (Ω=β=0).|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{relating the}} two radial forces {{can be understood}} qualitatively as follows. The difference in <b>angular</b> speeds (or equivalently, in <b>angular</b> momenta) causes {{a difference in the}} centripetal force requirement; to offset this, the radial force must be altered with an inverse-cube force.|$|E
5|$|This was {{established}} by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without <b>angular</b> momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects.|$|E
5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total <b>angular</b> momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the <b>angular</b> momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E
5|$|Einstein and De Haas {{demonstrated}} that magnetization {{is due to}} the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's <b>angular</b> momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the <b>angular</b> momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, a {{prominent}} radio source was identified overlapping {{the location of}} M87, and this was labeled Virgo-A. This source was confirmed to be M87 by 1953, and the linear relativistic jet emerging from {{the core of the}} galaxy was suggested as the cause. This jet extended from the core at a position angle of 260° to an <b>angular</b> distance of 20″ with an <b>angular</b> width of 2″. In 1969–70, a strong component of the radio emission was found to closely align with the optical source of the jet.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{diameter}} of Eris {{was measured to be}} , using images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The size of an object is determined from its absolute magnitude (H) and the albedo (the amount of light it reflects). At a distance of 97AU, an object with a diameter of 3,000km would have an <b>angular</b> size of 40milliarcseconds, which is directly measurable with the Hubble Space Telescope. Although resolving such small objects is at the very limit of its capabilities, sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution can be used to measure such <b>angular</b> sizes fairly accurately.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Monica Guica, Thomas Hartman, Wei Song, and Andrew Strominger {{showed that}} the ideas of AdS/CFT could {{nevertheless}} be used to understand certain astrophysical black holes. More precisely, their results apply to black holes that are approximated by extremal Kerr black holes, which have the largest possible <b>angular</b> momentum compatible with a given mass. They showed that such black holes have an equivalent description in terms of conformal field theory. The Kerr/CFT correspondence was later extended to black holes with lower <b>angular</b> momentum.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{with the}} James Clerk Maxwell Telescope at a {{wavelength}} of 850μm show an extended flux of radiation {{out to an}} <b>angular</b> radius of 35arcseconds around Epsilon Eridani. The peak emission occurs at an <b>angular</b> radius of 18arcseconds, which corresponds to a radius of about 60AU. The highest level of emission occurs over the radius 35–75 AU from Epsilon Eridani and is substantially reduced inside 30AU. This emission is interpreted as coming from a young analogue of the Solar System's Kuiper belt: a compact dusty disk structure surrounding Epsilon Eridani. From Earth, this belt is viewed at an inclination of roughly 25° {{to the line of}} sight.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1920, Betelgeuse {{became the}} first star outside the Solar System to have the <b>angular</b> size of its {{photosphere}} measured. Although interferometry was still in its infancy, the experiment proved a success. The researchers, using a uniform disk model, determined that Betelgeuse had a diameter of 0.047arcseconds, although the stellar disk was likely 17% larger due to the limb darkening, resulting in an estimate for its <b>angular</b> diameter of about 0.055". Since then, other studies have produced <b>angular</b> diameters that range from 0.042 to 0.069arcseconds. Combining these data with historical distance estimates of 180 to 815ly yields a projected radius of the stellar disk of anywhere from 1.2 to 8.9AU. Using the Solar System for comparison, the orbit of Mars is about 1.5AU, Ceres in the asteroid belt 2.7AU, Jupiter 5.5AU—so, assuming Betelgeuse occupying {{the place of the}} Sun, its photosphere might extend beyond the Jovian orbit, not quite reaching Saturn at 9.5AU.|$|E
5|$|Stellar {{rotation}} is the <b>angular</b> {{motion of}} a star about its axis. The rate of rotation can be measured from the spectrum of the star, or by timing the movements of active features on the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservation}} of the LRL vector A and <b>angular</b> momentum vector L {{is useful in}} showing that the momentum vector p moves on a circle under an inverse-square central force.|$|E
5|$|The earth {{being very}} near {{aphelion}} (furthest {{away from the}} sun in its elliptical orbit, making its <b>angular</b> diameter nearly as small as possible).|$|E
5|$|The orbital <b>angular</b> {{momentum}} of electrons is quantized. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that {{is proportional to}} the <b>angular</b> momentum. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital (so called, paired electrons) cancel each other out.|$|E
5|$|The type, direction, intensity, and {{duration}} of forces all contribute to the characteristics and severity TBI. Forces that may contribute to TBI include <b>angular,</b> rotational, shear, and translational forces.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{cultivated}} Cucurbita {{species has}} five-lobed or palmately divided leaves with long petioles, with the leaves alternately arranged on the stem. The stems in some species are <b>angular.</b> All of the above-ground parts may be hairy with {{various types of}} trichomes, which are often hardened and sharp. Spring-like tendrils grow from each node and are branching in some species. C.argyrosperma has ovate-cordate (egg-shaped to heart-shaped) leaves. The shape of C.pepo leaves varies widely. C.moschata plants can have light or dense pubescence. C.ficifolia leaves are slightly <b>angular</b> and have light pubescence. The leaves of all four of these species {{may or may not}} have white spots.|$|E
25|$|The {{conservation}} of <b>angular</b> momentum explains the <b>angular</b> acceleration of an ice skater as she brings {{her arms and}} legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because <b>angular</b> momentum is the product of moment of inertia and <b>angular</b> velocity, if the <b>angular</b> momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the <b>angular</b> velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} of eigenstates {{of the total}} conserved <b>angular</b> momentum from the <b>angular</b> momentum eigenstates of the individual subsystems {{is referred to as}} <b>angular</b> momentum coupling.|$|E
25|$|In physics, the <b>angular</b> {{velocity}} {{of an object}} is {{the rate of change}} of its <b>angular</b> displacement with respect to time. The SI unit of <b>angular</b> velocity is radians per second. <b>Angular</b> velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega (ω, rarely Ω).|$|E
25|$|The {{subsystems}} {{are therefore}} correctly {{described by a}} set of , m quantum numbers (see <b>angular</b> momentum for details). When there is interaction among the subsystems, the total Hamiltonian contains terms that do not commute with the <b>angular</b> operators acting on the subsystems only. However, these terms do commute with the total <b>angular</b> momentum operator. Sometimes one refers to the non-commuting interaction terms in the Hamiltonian as <b>angular</b> momentum coupling terms, because they necessitate the <b>angular</b> momentum coupling.|$|E
25|$|In modern (20th century) {{theoretical}} physics, <b>angular</b> momentum (not including any intrinsic <b>angular</b> momentum – see below) {{is described}} {{using a different}} formalism, instead of a classical pseudovector. In this formalism, <b>angular</b> momentum is the 2-form Noether charge associated with rotational invariance. As a result, <b>angular</b> momentum is not conserved for general curved spacetimes, unless {{it happens to be}} asymptotically rotationally invariant.|$|E
