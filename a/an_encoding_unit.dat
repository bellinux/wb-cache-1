40|$|Successful {{trials have}} been made through a {{designed}} algorithm to quantize, compress and optically encode unsigned 8 bit integer values {{in the form of}} images using Nano optical features. The periodicity of the Nano-scale features (Nano-gratings) have been designed and investigated both theoretically and experimentally to create distinct states of variation (three on states and one off state). The use of easy to manufacture and machine readable encoded data in secured authentication media has been employed previously in bar-codes for bi-state (binary) models and in colour barcodes for multiple state models. This work has focused on implementing 4 states of variation for unit information through periodic Nano-optical structures that separate an incident wavelength into distinct colours (variation states) in order to create an encoding system. Compared to barcodes and magnetic stripes in secured finite length storage media the proposed system encodes and stores more data. The benefits of multiple states of variation in <b>an</b> <b>encoding</b> <b>unit</b> are 1) increased numerically representable range 2) increased storage density and 3) decreased number of typical set elements for any ergodic or semi-ergodic source that emits these encoding units. A thorough investigation has targeted the effects of the use of multi-varied state Nano-optical features on data storage density and consequent data transmission rates. The results show that use of Nano-optical features for encoding data yields a data storage density of circa 800 Kbits/in 2 via the implementation of commercially available high resolution flat-bed scanner systems for readout. Such storage density is far greater than commercial finite length secured storage media such as barcode family with maximum practical density of 1 kbits/in 2 and highest density magnetic stripe cards with maximum density circa 3 Kbits/in 2. The numerically representable range of the proposed encoding unit for 4 states of variation is [0 255]. The number of typical set elements for an ergodic source emitting the optical encoding units compared to a bi-state encoding unit (bit) shows a 36 orders of magnitude decrease for the error probability interval of [0 0. 01]. The algorithms for the proposed encoding system have been implemented in MATLAB and the Nano-optical structures have been fabricated using Electron Beam Lithography on optical medium...|$|E

As multi-national collaborations grow, as new measurement instruments appear, and as Linked Open Data infrastructures become increasingly pervasive, {{the number of}} such conflicts will similarly increase. Methods: We propose a generic approach to the problem of (<b>a)</b> <b>encoding</b> measurement <b>units</b> in datasets in a machine-readable manner, (b) detecting when a dataset contained mixtures of measurement units, and (c) automatically converting any conflicting units into a desired unit, as defined for a given study.

40|$|The Maltese Broken Plurals {{have always}} been treated as a {{mechanism}} totally lacking in rules or structure. The traditional view has been that {{there is simply no}} relation between the singular, and broken plural forms. Tamara Schembri [1], in her B.

In this paper we describe an attempt to examine the computational implications of Schembri’s work for classification of the singular nouns and generation of the corresponding plural form.

40|$|The Occurrence of {{filled and}} {{unfilled}} pauses was examined {{with respect to}} their location in phonemic clauses. Both types of hesitation were most frequent after the first word in the clause, regardless of length. These data are regarded as directly challenging the transitional probability theory of hesitations. The phonemic clause is proposed as the <b>encoding</b> <b>unit</b> of speech at the grammatical level. This study is concernecf with two varieties of hesitations in spontaneous English speech: silent pause and “filled pause ” (uh /a/, ah /a/, urn /am/, and similar variants).

The data and the theoretical issue are inferentially related. The linking hypothesis is that hesitations in spontaneous speech occur at points where decisions and choices are being made.

The identification is based on the investigation of four issues: the scope of a left-peripheral modifier; the dependency between the modifier of unit word and that of a noun; the complement and predicate status of the combination of a numeral and a unit word; the semantic selection relation between a unit word and a noun. The paper also shows that the co-occurrence of a numeral and a unit word and the position of certain partitive markers are not reliable in identifying syntactic constituents. It also argues against quantity-individual semantic mappings with different syntactic structures. Finally, the paper presents a comparative deletion analysis of the constructions in which the functional word de follows a unit word...|$|R

To study {{the role of}} provirus insertional mutagenesis {{in the development of}} these neoplasias, we searched for common provirus integration sites in BL/VL 3 radiation leukemia virus-induced tumors. Using cellular sequences flanking a provirus cloned from one of these thymomas, we found that the viral genome was integrated into a common region, designated Vin- 1, in a low percentage (5 %) of these tumors. The proviruses found in this locus were integrated in the same orientation, close to a CpG-rich island, at proximity of <b>a</b> transcriptional <b>unit</b> <b>encoding</b> <b>a</b> 6 -kb RNA.

40|$|Established {{linguistic}} theoretical frameworks {{propose that}} alphabetic language speakers use phonemes as phonological <b>encoding</b> <b>units</b> during speech production whereas Mandarin Chinese speakers use syllables.

However, {{there is no evidence of}} non-initial phoneme involvement in Chinese phonological encoding among representative Chinese speakers, rendering the functional role of phonemes in spoken Chinese controversial. Here, we addressed this issue by systematically investigating the word-initial and non-initial phoneme repetition effect on the electrophysiological signal using a picture-naming priming task in which native Chinese speakers produced disyllabic word pairs. We found that overlapping phonemes in both the initial and non-initial position evoked more positive ERPs in the 180 - to 300 -ms interval, indicating position-invariant repetition facilitation effect during phonological encoding. Our findings thus revealed the fundamental role of phonemes as independent phonological <b>encoding</b> <b>units</b> in Mandarin Chinese...|$|R

The chromosomal joining on the 1 p+ chromosome occurred at the T-cell receptor delta diversity (D delta 2) segment, and the reciprocal chromosomal joining on the 14 q- chromosome occurred at the T-cell delta diversity segment D delta 1. The involvement of delta diversity segments at the translocation junctions suggests that the translocation occurred during an attempt at D delta 1 -D delta 2 joining in a stem cell.

This activation may participate in the oncolytic effect of parvoviruses, given that P 4 drives <b>a</b> transcriptional <b>unit</b> <b>encoding</b> cytotoxic nonstructural proteins. Our {{results suggest that the}} higher transcriptional {{activity of}} promoter P 4 in FREJ 4 cells is mediated at least in part by upstream CRE elements. Accordingly, mutations in the CRE motifs impair P 4 function more strongly in the FREJ 4 derivative than in its FR 3 T 3 parent. Further evidence that these elements contribute to hyper{{activity of the}} P 4 promoter in the ras transformant is the fact that they form distinct complexes with proteins from FREJ 4 and FR 3 T 3 cell extracts. This difference can be abolished by treating the FREJ 4 cell extracts with cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or treating original cultures with a PKA activator. These findings can be linked with two previously reported features of ras-transformed cells: the activation of a PKA-inhibited protein kinase cascade and the reduction of PKA-induced protein phosphorylation. In keeping with these facts, P 4 -directed gene expression can be up- or downmodulated in vivo by exposing cells to known inhibitors or activators of PKA, respectively.
