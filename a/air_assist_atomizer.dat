The spray {{characteristics}} of the double-concentric <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> <b>atomizer</b> have been explored using the Greenfield digital spray analyzer. Prior to utilizing non-Newtonian fluids to simulate coal-water slurries, water was used for the initial survey. The improved performance of the double concentric <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> <b>atomizer,</b> as measured by the total amount of air required to generate a particular average droplet size, was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|In {{preparation}} for coal-water slurry tests, a Delavan nozzle was characterized using {{water and a}} Malvern 2600 particle sizer. Actual tests using coal-water slurry failed due to phase segregation of the coal particles in the liquid supply lines and within the atomizer. The triple-concentric atomizer characterization was refined using the Malvern 2600. The triple- concentric atomizer displays an eight-fold reduction in air mass flow requirements compared to a conventional coflow <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> <b>atomizer...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} mouse nose-only {{inhalation}} exposures with VX {{were conducted in}} the recently established McNamara glove box facility {{for the purpose of}} providing LCt 50 reference data for future studies in this facility and to serve as a benchmark for ranking the toxicity of other agents. Neat VX challenge aerosols were generated by feeding micro-liter quantities of agent from a loaded syringe to a custom-made <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> <b>atomizer.</b> Exposure concentrations were assessed by both real-time aerosol monitor and gas chromatograph analysis of chamber filter pack samples. Exposures were run for 10 minutes in duration with 4 animals per test. An “up and down ” paradigm was used to sequentially select target agent concentration levels from one exposure run to the next based on the resulting 24 hour lethality fraction. Chamber sampling results indicated that over the concentration range tested, the agent existed primarily in the aerosol phase most likely because of the brief transit time between the atomizer and the chamber exposure ports which did not allow sufficient time for vapor equilibration. The resulting LCt 50 for neat VX aerosol in the mouse via the inhalation route was significantly lower than anticipated based on another recent nose-only study in which mice were challenged with saline aerosols laced with VX. Overall our results indicate that the LCt 50 for VX aerosol in the mouse via the nose-only exposure method is comparable to previously reported values for head only and whole body exposures under conditions of vapor and aerosol challenge...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA twin-fluid {{atomizer}} {{was designed}} and developed for fuel atomization. The droplet characteristic in the spray which was produced with the atomizer was investigated experimentally. Air flow induced in the atomizer causes a pressure reduction, hence the fuel is sucked into the atomizer. The mixture flow of air and liquid caused the atomization downstream due to the turbulence. In the twin-fluid atomizer, atomization is attained by injecting an air stream at tip of the liquid inlet port. In this research, the test liquid supply pressure was kept constant and the air flow rate through the atomizer was varied over a range of air supply pressure to obtain the variation in air liquid mass flow ratio (ALR) from 0. 2 to 2. 7. The results revealed that the <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>atomizer</b> had a capability to inject the test liquid {{in the range of}} the rates of 0. 0019 - 0. 00426 kg/s, with the use of air pressure supplied from 68. 9 to 689 kPa. The images of the spray were obtained with a shadowgraph technique and analyzed to obtain the particle size and its distribution. Droplet size from twin-fluid atomizer had various sizes in the range of about 17 - 200 μm. The atomizer can be applied for aerosol and combustion purposes...|$|R

The authors have successfully developed the falling droplet technique {{to measure the}} extensional viscosity of very dilute polymeric solutions. They have also determined that the polymeric materials used behaved as elastic solids even at very low concentrations {{of the order of}} 30 ppm. A published paper contains a complete description of the technique and is enclosed within this report. They have designed and built the air-assist effervescent atomizer.

40|$|In pressure-swirl atomizer, a {{swirling}} motion is imparted to the fuel, leading {{it under the}} action of the centrifugal force to spread out {{in the form of a}} hollow cone as soon as it leaves the exit orifice. This kind of atomizer finds its use in gas turbines and liquid propellant rockets. The combustion usually starts at the periphery of spray and the flame front travels towards the center of the spray. The availability of air for combustion therefore decreases as the flame travels towards the center of the spray from pressure swirl atomizer. The newer approach is to develop {{a swirling}} air core in the center of the spray. This approach led to the development of <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> pressure swirl <b>atomizer.</b> This paper presents the experimental investigations of <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> pressure swirl <b>atomizer</b> for spray cone angle and penetration length at different injection pressure differential ranging from 3 bar to 18 bar in an increment of 3 bar. The results are then compared with conventional pressure swirl atomizer; with same nozzle dimensions, same inlet pressure and temperature, same mass flow rate and same injection pressure differential...|$|R
40|$|In {{line with}} the general theme of the International Workshop series on Turbulent Combustion of Sprays (TCS), this Chapter {{addresses}} relevant issues of turbulent flame structure, auto-ignition and atomization with reference to wellcharacterized burners that could be implemented by modelers with relative ease. The discussion of turbulent combustion is limited to dilute sprays stabilized on a simple piloted burner. Attention is shifted {{to the structure of}} the reaction zones and the challenges of computing chemical composition of flames of different fuels. Another section is dedicated to studying auto-ignition of turbulent dilute spray flames as observed in a hot vitiated co-flow. A common feature to all liquid fuels studied here is the presence of ignition kernels which grow (and sometimes extinguish) to induce flaming combustion further downstream. It is noted that this downstream region is responsible for the bulk of heat release and its local compositional structure depends on the parent fuel. The last section focuses on non-reacting dense sprays with a view to shed some light on the effects of turbulence on secondary atomization. Two configurations are discussed: one for droplets flowing in a pipe and the other uses dense sprays generated with an <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>atomizer.</b> The carrier velocity is changed in both configurations to induce turbulence which affects atomization as clearly demonstrated by the reported measurements. While this chapter is not necessarily a roadmap for the efforts of future TCS workshops, the topics addressed here form a logical progression that is somewhat commensurate with the increasing order of complexity generally sought for computations. 29 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} of mean drop size (SMD) and size distribution parameters {{have been made}} using a Fraunhofer diffraction particle sizing instrument {{in a series of}} sprays generated by an <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> swirl <b>atomizer.</b> Thirty-six different combinations of fuel and air mass flow rates were examined with liquid flow rates up to 14 lbm/hr and atomizing air flow rates up to 10 lbm/hr. Linear relationships were found between SMD and liquid to air mass flow rate ratios. SMD increased with distance downstream along the center line and also with radial distance from the axis. Increase in obscuration with distance downstream was due to an increase in number density of particles as the result of deceleration of drops and an increase in the exposed path length of the laser beam. Velocity components of the atomizing air flow field measured by a laser anemometer show swirling jet air flow fields with solid body rotation in the core and free vortex flow in the outer regions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} laser {{machining}} of silicon wafer at various process parameters. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to investigate the effect of laser machining parameters on the cut surface quality and determine the feasible laser machining parameters that can machine silicon wafer. The thesis describes how machining parameters and <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> gas affects cut surface quality. The silicon wafer was machined by laser with and without <b>air</b> <b>assists.</b> Principally, two experimental sets with different cutting speed and laser power were designed in statistical software. The kerf widths and quality were observed under microscopes. The results then were analyzed using statistica software. The analysis indicated that cutting speed has significant effect to the kerf width and laser cutting with <b>air</b> <b>assists</b> produced wider kerf. Result obtained also showed that laser cutting without <b>air</b> <b>assists</b> produced better cut surface quality. The feasible machining parameter of silicon is estimated at 1. 0 - 2. 0 mm/min for cutting velocity, 0. 80 - 0. 94 watt for laser power in laser cutting without <b>air</b> <b>assist</b> and 1. 0 - 4. 0 mm/min for cutting velocity, 0. 80 - 0. 90 watt for laser power in laser cutting with <b>air</b> <b>assist...</b>|$|R

40|$|Reduction of {{environmental}} contamination and improvement of biological efficacy {{are the two}} main targets in the optimization of orchard sprayers. There are {{a wide variety of}} <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> orchard sprayer designs and plant training systems that are currently in use around the world. Both the environmental and biological efficacy of any spray application process are the result of the complex interaction between these various spray flow patterns and tree architectures besides the environmental condition. Therefore, finding the optimal combination between these different designs and the various tree architectures should be the first step in any optimization analysis. To this end, three different designs of <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> orchard sprayers are compared in this work for the apple classical training system using computational fluid dynamics.

40|$|Apples at 24 ± 2 °C were heated in a {{pilot scale}} hot <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> (40 °C) {{continuous}} pentagonal microwave system, {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of this treatment on insect mortality (variety Mutsu) and fruit quality (variety Granny Smith). An average temperature of 53. 4 ± 1. 3 °C at core, bottom and flesh of the apple was recorded at the end of the treatment. One hundred percent mortality of the most tolerant stage of Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni, Froggatt) and Jarvis's fruit fly (Bactrocera jarvisi, Tryon), were observed when the Mortality value (M 52, equivalent time of isothermal treatment at 52 °C) at the slowest heating point applicable for each experiment was ≥ 50 min and ≥ 37 min, respectively. Results showed that microwave heat treatment is effective for insect disinfestation without any adverse impact on total soluble solids, flesh or peel firmness of the treated apples. The treated apples recorded a significantly higher pH and lower ion leakage than the untreated apples after 3 or 4 weeks. Therefore, the microwave heat treatment has the potential to be developed as an alternative chemical free quarantine treatment against economically significant insect pests. Industrial relevance Hot <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> microwave heating of fruits and vegetables, is more cost effective compared to vapour heat treatment and ionising radiation for disinfestation of insects. Microwave treatment is environmentally friendly compared to fumigation and chemical treatments. Hot <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> microwave disinfestation can be performed at farms or centralised pack houses since the capital cost would be comparatively lower than vapour heat or ionising radiation treatments...|$|R

40|$|The CAI/HCCI {{combustion}} {{was achieved}} through residual gas trapping using the negative valve overlap method {{in a direct}} injection single cylinder gasoline engine with optical access. Effects of injection timing and spark discharge on the engines performance and emission were investigated by means of simultaneous in-cylinder heat release analysis and the high-speed chemiluminescence imaging technique. The presence and magnitude of fuel reformation and heat release associated with the fuel injection into lean-burn residual gases were identified. Furthermore, the effect of quantity of directly injected air from an <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> injector into stoichiometric burned residual gas was studied. The in-cylinder heat release and imaging showed that spark discharge had much less effect on the heat release process in the lean-burn CAI operation than that in the stoichiometric operation because of the less ignitability of the leaner mixture. Direct injection into the hot residual gas was found to produce minor heat release and lead to chemiluminescence. This process resulted in higher charge temperature and earlier autoignition followed. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} small quantity of air injection included in the <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> injection process during the negative valve overlap period could be used to promote the fuel reforming and minor heat release reactions in order to control the main combustion phasing. ...|$|R

Subjects completed the ocular surface disease index(OSDI), which was followed by fluorescein tear breakup time(BUT), corneal fluorescein staining(CFS), Schirmer I test(SⅠt) and meibomian gland secretion function evaluation at baseline, and 2 and 4 wk after treatment. RESULTS: In these 60 patients, 48 patients(23 in artificial tear treated group and 25 in the new warm moist <b>air</b> device <b>assisted</b> with eyelid massage treated group) were positive for meibomian gland dysfunction(MGD).
