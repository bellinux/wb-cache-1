New technology {{and changes in the}} way work is organised are two examples of situations which may engender the need for new or evolving knowledge and skills. This is {{the context in which the}} German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) supports the initiative for the <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> <b>needs.</b> Work and research undertaken as part of this initiative are linked up through the FreQueNz network and are intended to identify new or changing <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> as early as possible. This work is accompanied by programmes and processes relating to technology foresight programmes and processes.

With relatively little effort, the use of lingua receptiva can contribute significantly towards achieving these goals. Including it in the Skills Agenda as a “transversal skill” could: – enhance the key competence “Communicating in and learning a foreign language”; – refine the European Qualification Framework (EQF); and, – strengthen the Europass.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{and efficiency of}} a national vocational education and training (VET) system depends, amongst others, on whether it provides its learners with the required skills {{now and in the}} future. These requirements have changed over the last decades and they are expected to change again in the future. National VET systems need to adapt to these changes in time to avoid costly skill mismatches as not having the right skills means lower wages and lower job satisfaction for workers, lower productivity and more hiring costs for employers, and lower economic output for the economy as a whole. Skill mismatches are omnipresent in developed countries: on average 45 % of workers in 27 EU countries reported being under- or over-skilled in 2010. Skill mismatches can be reduced by certain policies, however these depend heavily on information about current and future demand for and supply <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> and corresponding mismatches. Therefore, this report gives an overview of the current mechanisms used by international institutions and developed countries to identify and anticipate the <b>skills</b> requirements <b>of</b> firms, and furthermore it shows how this information is then used for policy development and communication. Special attention is given to the identification and <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> individuals with a Vocational Education and Training (VET) background, either at secondary or tertiary level.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{research findings}} on competence needs for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in manufacturing. These are {{from studies of}} the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research's initiative for early identification <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> (FreQueNz) {{as well as the}} Office of Technology Assessment at the German Bundestag (TAB). The findings are partly statements on possible future developments as – at least according to the mentioned studies during their periods of inquiry – the degree of CPS implementation in enterprises has been fairly low. Further development of CPS competence needs depends on which combinations of technologies and work organization will come to prevail in the enterprises in the course of broader implementation. As this seems rather open, two of the studies distinguish at least two ideal scenarios with regard to possible directions of competence developments. Within the first scenario more and more decisions would be taken by IT which would control the production employees. These are expected to intervene into the process in case of malfunctions only but cannot develop the respective competences during the trouble-free process. Within the second scenario the technology would serve as decision-supporting system to employees still expected to optimize and able to intervene into the process. Starting from a maturity model of innovations, the presentation of research findings in this paper is linked to a thesis on the added value of stronger links between technology forecasting and early identification <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> <b>needs.</b> By such links early identification <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> <b>needs</b> could be focused at an early stage on topics which are considered by technology forecasting to have major potential. This could help reducing skill gaps at the diffusion stage of technological innovations...|$|R
