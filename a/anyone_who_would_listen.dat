25|$|Stewart {{tried to}} file a {{complaint}} with Deputy U.S. Marshal Sylvester S. Taylor but found no comfort. Taylor was under Smith's control and informed Stewart that if he kept quiet about the affair he (Taylor) would see what he could do. Stewart complained to <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen,</b> including U.S. Commissioner Charles A. Sehlbrede, who was stationed in the neighboring town of Dyea.|$|E
500|$|When Scott {{unexpectedly}} {{married in}} 1969, {{it appeared that}} the problem might be over, but by 1970 the marriage had ended; Scott convinced himself that Thorpe was to blame. Early in 1971 Scott moved to the village of Talybont, in North Wales, where he befriended a widow, Gwen Parry-Jones, to whom he recounted his tale of ill-treatment at the hands of Thorpe. She passed the information to Emlyn Hooson, who was MP for the adjoining Welsh constituency; Hooson precipitated the party enquiry which cleared Thorpe and left Scott feeling bitter and humiliated. After Parry-Jones's death the following year, Scott fell into a depression and for a while was quiescent. In time, however, he began to tell his story to <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen.</b> [...] By 1974 Thorpe, at the crest of the Liberal revival, was terrified of exposure that might lose him the Liberal leadership. As Dominic Sandbrook observes in his history of the times: [...] "The stakes had never been higher; silencing Scott had never been more urgent".|$|E
500|$|MacPhisto {{was created}} to parody the devil and was named after Mephistopheles of the Faust legend. Initially called [...] "Mr. Gold", MacPhisto wore a gold lamé suit with gold {{platform}} shoes, pale makeup, lipstick, and devil's horns atop his head. As MacPhisto, Bono spoke with an exaggerated upper-class English accent, {{similar to that of}} a down-on-his-luck character actor. The character was created as a European replacement for the American-influenced Mirror Ball Man. The initial inspiration for MacPhisto came from the stage musical The Black Rider. Realisation of the character did not come about until rehearsal the night before the first of the 1993 shows. According to Bono, [...] "We came up with a sort of old English Devil, a pop star long past his prime returning regularly from sessions on The Strip in Vegas and regaling <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen</b> to him at cocktail hour with stories from the good old, bad old days." [...] MacPhisto sang the closing [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love" [...] with an oddly childlike manner that many reviewers found one of the most poignant moments of the show.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Laffer curve" [...] was {{reportedly}} coined by Jude Wanniski (a writer for The Wall Street Journal) after a 1974 dinner {{meeting at the}} Two Continents Restaurant in the Washington Hotel with Arthur Laffer, Wanniski, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and his deputy press secretary Grace-Marie Arnett. In this meeting, Laffer, arguing against President Gerald Ford's tax increase, reportedly sketched the curve on a napkin to illustrate the concept. Cheney did not accept the idea immediately, but it caught the imaginations of those present. Laffer professes no recollection of this napkin, but writes: [...] "I used the so-called Laffer Curve {{all the time in}} my classes and with <b>anyone</b> else <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen</b> to me".|$|R
5000|$|After Manson {{and some}} of his {{followers}} were arrested for the Tate/La Bianca murders in 1969, Fromme and the remaining [...] "Manson family" [...] camped outside the trial. When Manson and his fellow defendants, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houten, and Atkins carved Xs into their foreheads, so did Fromme and her compatriots. They proclaimed Manson's innocence and preached his apocalyptic philosophy to the news media and to <b>anyone</b> else <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen.</b> She was never charged with involvement in the murders, but was convicted of attempting to prevent Manson's imprisoned followers from testifying, as well as contempt of court when she herself refused to testify. She was given short jail sentences for both offenses.|$|R

500|$|... "Time Will Crawl" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Bowie in mid– to late–1986 at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland. He produced the recording alongside David Richards. Lyrically, the song addresses the pollution {{and destruction of}} the planet by industry. Bowie has cited hearing of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986 as {{the genesis of the}} lyrics, and was in Switzerland {{at the time of the}} accident. He said, [...] "I was taking a break from recording [...] it was a beautiful day and we were outside on a small piece of lawn facing the Alps and the lake. Our engineer, who had been listening to the radio, shot out of the studio and shouted: 'There's a whole lot of shit going down in Russia.' The Swiss news had picked up a Norwegian radio station that was screaming – to <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen</b> – that huge billowing clouds were moving over from the Motherland and they weren't rain clouds." [...] In another contemporary interview, Bowie said that the song [...] "deals with the idea that someone in one's own community could be the one responsible for blowing up the world." [...] At the time, he also stated that it was his favorite song from the album.|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare for Berlioz {{represented}} {{the summit of}} poetic utterance, with the bard's veracity of dramatic expression and freedom from formal constraints resounding in the composer's spirit. More profoundly, Shakespeare became a source, by way of its dramatic truth, for Berlioz' fundamental notion of expressive truth; this was how he could call Romeo and Juliet [...] "the supreme drama of my life." [...] He read from the plays constantly, often aloud for <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen.</b> He quoted from them {{for the rest of}} his life and would associate any personal upheaval with its Shakespearian counterpart.|$|E
2500|$|Spitzer {{had already}} {{concluded}} that known theory {{suggested that the}} ZETA was nowhere near the temperatures the team was claiming, {{and as part of}} the publicity surrounding the release of the work suggested that [...] "Some unknown mechanism would appear to be involved". Other researchers in the US, notably Furth and Colgate, were far more critical, telling <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen</b> that the results were bunk. In the Soviet Union, Lev Artsimovich rushed to have the Nature article translated, and after reading it, declared [...] "Chush sobachi!" [...] (dog shit).|$|E
50|$|In 1870, Galloway began {{investigations}} into the cause of explosions in dry mines, and became convinced that the cause was coal dust as well as fire damp. He was called on, as a mining inspector, to investigate the causes of between 60 and 80 explosions in Scottish mines and it became his life's work {{to find ways to}} reduce the risk to the lives on miners underground. He carried out tests with safety lamps, finding that the flame was deflected through the gauze when shots were fired, measured the varying size and colour of flame depending on the atmospheric conditions and composition. He wrote papers on his findings and presented them to the Institute of Mining, the Royal Society, the Athenaeum Club, London and <b>anyone</b> else <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen.</b>|$|R
500|$|Stengel tried incessantly {{to promote}} the Mets, talking to reporters or <b>anyone</b> else <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen.</b> He often used the word [...] "amazin'" [...] (as he put it) and soon this became the [...] "Amazin' Mets", a {{nickname}} that stuck. Stengel urged the fans, [...] "Come out and see my amazin' Mets. I been in this game a hundred years but I see new ways to lose I never knew existed before." [...] Stengel was successful in selling the team to some extent, as the Mets drew 900,000 fans, half again as many as the Giants had prior to their departure, though the games against the Giants and Dodgers accounted for half of the total. The team was less successful on the field, finishing {{with a record of}} 40–120, the most losses of any 20th century major league team. They finished 60 games behind the pennant-winning Giants, and 18 games behind ninth-place Chicago.|$|R
50|$|Returning to Europe at {{the peace}} aboard HMS Barfleur, Schomberg was {{unemployed}} until 1786 on half-pay. Returning to the sea, Schomberg was appointed mentor to the notoriously prickly Prince William Henry, then serving as captain of HMS Pegasus. Schomberg was far {{older and more}} experienced than his commander and also possessed an aggressive temperament, the two rapidly becoming embroiled {{in a series of}} bitter and long-lasting disputes. Eventually, in 1787 whilst stationed in the West Indies, Nelson solved the problem by removing Schomberg from Pegasus under arrest for a charge trumped-up by William. Within days, the charges were quietly dropped and Schomberg returned to Britain. Three months later Sir Samuel Hood appointed Schomberg to his flagship Barfleur. Hood had served with both Schomberg and Prince William before and was well aware of the circumstances of the argument, appointing Schomberg in the hopes of ending the dispute. This hope was dashed when William responded with a torrent of extremely offensive letters to Schomberg, Hood and <b>anyone</b> else <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Bryant {{sold the}} Copping farm for $143,000 {{and kept the}} Hobart mansion. While living at Copping, the white {{overalls}} he habitually wore were replaced with clothing {{more in line with}} Harvey's financial status. Now that he was alone, his dress became more bizarre. He often wore a grey linen suit, cravat, lizard skin shoes and a Panama hat while carrying a briefcase during the day, telling <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen</b> that he had a well-paying career. He often wore an electric blue suit with flared trousers and a ruffled shirt to the restaurant he frequented. The restaurant owner recalled: [...] "It was horrible. Everyone was laughing at him, even the customers. I really felt suddenly quite sorry for him. I realised this guy didn't really have any friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gladstone {{went beyond}} image by {{appealing}} {{directly to the}} people. In his Midlothian campaign – so called because he stood {{as a candidate for}} that county – Gladstone spoke in fields, halls and railway stations to hundreds, sometimes thousands, of students, farmers, labourers and middle class workers. Although not the first leader to speak directly to voters – both he and Disraeli had spoken directly to party loyalists before on special occasions – {{he was the first to}} canvass an entire constituency, delivering his message to <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen,</b> encouraging his supporters and trying to convert his opponents. Publicised nationwide, Gladstone's message became that of the party. Noting its significance, Lord Shaftesbury said, [...] "It is a new thing and a very serious thing to see the Prime Minister on the stump." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Faces {{released}} {{their final}} album Ooh La La, which reached {{number one in}} the UK and number 21 in the US in 1973. During the recording of the album, the rift between Stewart {{and the rest of the}} Faces grew further, as (according to Ian McLagan), Stewart didn't participate until two weeks into the sessions, [...] "and then complained that some songs were in the wrong key for him. So we recorded them again and waited a week for him to come back. We cut the track for 'Ooh La La' three times before he eventually passed on it, leaving it for Woody to sing. [...] The week the album came out he did all he could to scuttle it and told <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen</b> how useless it was.". The band toured Australasia, Japan, Europe and the UK in 1974 to support the album and the single [...] "Pool Hall Richard".|$|E

6000|$|It was so in Mr. Stone's old bottle, hour by {{hour and}} day by day, {{throughout}} the month. A pinker, robuster look {{came back to}} his cheeks; his blue eyes, fixed on distance, had in them more light; his knees regained their powers; he bathed, and, all unknown to him, for he only saw the waters he cleaved with his ineffably slow stroke, Hilary and Martin, on alternate weeks, and keeping at a proper distance, for fear he should see them doing him a service, attended at that function in case Mr. Stone should again remain too long seated {{at the bottom of}} the Serpentine. Each morning after his cocoa and porridge he could be heard sweeping out his room with extraordinary vigour, and as ten o'clock came near <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>would</b> remark a sound of air escaping, as he moved up and down on his toes in preparation for the labours of the day. No letters, of course, nor any newspapers disturbed the supreme and perfect self-containment of this life devoted to Fraternity--no letters, partly because he lacked a known address, partly because for years he had not answered them; and with regard to newspapers, once a month he went to a Public Library, and could be seen with the last four numbers of two weekly reviews before him, making himself acquainted with the habits of those days, and moving his lips as though in prayer. At ten each morning anyone in the corridor outside his room was startled by the whirr of an alarum clock; perfect silence followed; then rose a sound of shuffling, whistling, rustling, broken by sharply muttered words; soon from this turbid lake of sound the articulate, thin fluting of an old man's voice streamed forth. This, alternating with the squeak of a quill pen, went on till the alarum clock once more went off. Then he who stood outside could smell that Mr. Stone would shortly eat; if, stimulated by that scent, he entered; he might see the author of the [...] "Book of Universal Brotherhood" [...] with a baked potato in one hand and a cup of hot milk in the other; on the table, too, the ruined forms of eggs, tomatoes, oranges, bananas, figs, prunes, cheese, and honeycomb, which had passed into other forms already, together with a loaf of wholemeal bread. Mr. Stone would presently emerge in his cottage-woven tweeds, and old hat of green-black felt; or, if wet, in a long coat of yellow gaberdine, and sou'wester cap of the same material; but always with a little osier fruit-bag in his hand. Thus equipped, he walked down to Rose and Thorn's, entered, and to the first man he saw handed the osier fruit-bag, some coins, and a little book containing seven leaves, headed [...] "Food: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday," [...] and so forth. He then stood looking through the pickles in some jar or other at things beyond, with one hand held out, fingers upwards, awaiting the return of his little osier fruit-bag. Feeling presently that it had been restored to him, he would turn and walk out of the shop. Behind his back, on the face of the department, the same protecting smile always rose. Long habit had perfected it. All now felt that, though so very different from themselves, this aged customer was dependent on them. By not one single farthing or one pale slip of cheese would they have defrauded him for all the treasures of the moon, and any new salesman who laughed at that old client was promptly told to [...] "shut his head." ...|$|R

2500|$|Armstrong was {{concerned}} with his health. He used laxatives to control his weight, a practice he advocated both to acquaintances and in the diet plans he published under the title Lose Weight the Satchmo Way. [...] Armstrong's laxative of preference in his younger days was Pluto Water, but he then became an enthusiastic convert when he discovered the herbal remedy Swiss Kriss. [...] He would extol its virtues to <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>listen</b> and pass out packets to everyone he encountered, including members of the British Royal Family. (Armstrong also appeared in humorous, albeit risqué, cards that he had printed to send out to friends; the cards bore {{a picture of him}} sitting on a toilet—as viewed through a keyhole—with the slogan [...] "Satch says, 'Leave it all behind ya!'") The cards have sometimes been incorrectly described as ads for Swiss Kriss. In a live recording of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] with Velma Middleton, he changes the lyric from [...] "Put another record on while I pour" [...] to [...] "Take some Swiss Kriss while I pour." ...|$|E
