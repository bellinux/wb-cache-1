Full drum sets, a piano, an organ, and various other instruments are frequently used. The type of music sung is generally popular worship choruses, such as those by Calvary Chapel and Hillsong. Worship is often characterized as intense <b>and</b> <b>enthusiastic.</b>|$|E
5|$|If the Wartburg and Hambach rallies had {{lacked a}} {{constitution}} and administrative apparatus, that problem was addressed between 1867 and 1871. Yet, as Germans discovered, grand speeches, flags, <b>and</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> crowds, a constitution, a political reorganization, {{and the provision}} of an imperial superstructure; and the revised Customs Union of 1867–68, still did not make a nation.|$|E

5|$|In those days, Europe {{produced}} {{a great many}} child prodigies, inspired by the phenomenal success of the young Czech virtuoso Jan Kubelík and formed by rigorous teaching <b>and</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> parents.

5|$|Mendelssohn {{was a fine}} <b>and</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> {{artist in}} pencil and watercolour, a skill which he used {{throughout}} his life for his own amusement {{and that of his}} friends.

5|$|Although his Parisian {{audience}} deserted him, Offenbach had by {{now become}} highly popular in England. John Hollingshead of the Gaiety Theatre presented Offenbach's operettas to large <b>and</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> audiences. Between 1870 and 1872, the Gaiety produced 15 of his works. At the Royalty Theatre, Richard D'Oyly Carte presented La Périchole in 1875. In Vienna, too, Offenbach works were regularly produced. While {{the war and}} its aftermath ravaged Paris, the composer supervised Viennese productions and travelled to England as the guest of the Prince of Wales.|$|E

5|$|In 1949 Palmer left Ziff-Davis and was {{replaced}} by Howard Browne, who was knowledgeable <b>and</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> about fantasy fiction. Browne briefly managed {{to improve the quality of}} the fiction in Fantastic Adventures, and the period around 1951 has been described as the magazine's heyday. Browne lost interest when his plan to take Amazing Stories upmarket collapsed, and the magazine fell back into predictability. In 1952, Ziff-Davis launched another fantasy magazine, titled Fantastic, in a digest format; it was successful, and within a few months the decision was taken to end Fantastic Adventures in favor of Fantastic. The March 1953 issue of Fantastic Adventures was the last.|$|E
5|$|Max Newman {{had been}} {{appointed}} to the Chair of Pure Mathematics at Manchester University in 1945. During the Second World War he {{had worked as a}} cryptanalyst at Bletchley Park, and had led the team which in 1943 produced the first of the Colossus code-breaking computers. Although Newman played no active {{role in the development of}} the SSEM, or any of the subsequent Manchester computers, he was generally supportive <b>and</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> about the project, and arranged for the acquisition of war-surplus supplies for its construction, including GPO metal racks from Bletchley.|$|E
5|$|Portrayed by Rob Lowe, Chris Traeger {{begins the}} show as an auditor working for the Indiana state {{government}} in Indianapolis, but eventually becomes the acting city manager of Pawnee, the fictional Indiana city where Parks and Recreation is set. Originally from Wisconsin, he is an excessively positive and optimistic person, who is constantly upbeat and extremely energetic. As a baby, Chris {{was diagnosed with a}} rare blood disorder and was not expected to live longer than three weeks, but miraculously survived.

At work, SpongeBob answers to Eugene Krabs, a greedy crab who shows SpongeBob favor, alongside his ill-tempered, snobbish next-door neighbor Squidward Tentacles. His hobbies include jellyfishing, practicing karate at an elementary level, and blowing bubbles.|$|E
5|$|Such {{extensive}} <b>and</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> {{collaboration with}} the Einsatzgruppen {{has been attributed to}} several factors. Since the Russian Revolution of 1905, the Kresy Wschodnie and other borderlands had experienced a political culture of violence. The period of Soviet rule had been profoundly traumatic for residents of the Baltic states and areas that had been part of Poland until 1939; the population was brutalised and terrorised by the imposed Soviet rule, and the existing familiar structures of society were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Frederick grew {{up during}} a tumultuous {{political}} period as {{the concept of}} liberalism in Germany, which evolved during the 1840s, was gaining widespread <b>and</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> support. The liberals sought a unified Germany and were constitutional monarchists who desired a constitution to ensure equal protection under the law, the protection of property, and the safeguarding of basic civil rights. Overall, the liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation. When Frederick was 17, these emergent nationalistic and liberal sentiments sparked a series of political uprisings across the German states and elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, their goal was to protect freedoms, such as the freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, {{and to create a}} German parliament and constitution. Although the uprisings ultimately brought about no lasting changes, liberal sentiments remained an influential force in German politics throughout Frederick's life.|$|E

30|$|In a 2014 survey, The Forum Poll asked {{respondents}} in Canada {{to rate their}} dedication to NHL hockey as ‘part-time,’ ‘regular,’ ‘enthusiastic,’ or ‘extreme’ [13]. Combining the part-time and regular fans in one group, <b>and</b> the <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>and</b> extreme fans in another, we expanded the classic SIR model to include a chronically infected compartment (C). Essentially, once a person is infected by the ‘disease’ of fan allegiance, {{it is possible for}} this infected person to become a chronic fan of one team, beyond recovery. This compartment represents <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>and</b> extreme fans who are very devoted to their respective teams of choice and are unlikely to recover from this ‘disease’.|$|R
5|$|They added American touches to the course. They {{used the}} names of American birds for patrol names; {{challenged}} patrols {{to make their own}} flags instead of using store-bought flags; introduced patrol totems and signatures; and added singing Back to Gilwell when each patrol's name was mentioned. Each member took turns as the patrol leader, and they met daily as the Patrol Leaders Council to conduct daily inspections. The staff taught course attendees basic Scout requirements and how to handle the U.S. flag. The patrols took an unsupervised patrol hike and overnight camp. Other American features included a program and a service patrol, a cracker barrel after each evening's event, a feast, and other ceremonies. The first course, begun on July 31, 1948, was attended by 29 men from 12 states. Although it rained on four of the nine days, the Scouters were excited by the experience <b>and</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> about sharing it with others.|$|E
5|$|When the Kingdom of Montenegro {{declared}} war on Turkey on 8 October 1912, it was joined quickly by Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece in {{what is known as}} the First Balkan War. George was on vacation in Denmark, so he immediately returned to Greece via Vienna, arriving in Athens to be met by a large <b>and</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> crowd on the evening of 9 October. The results of this campaign differed radically from the Greek experience at the hands of the Turks in 1897. The well-trained Greek forces, 200,000 strong, won victory after victory. On 9 November 1912, Greek forces commanded by Crown Prince Constantine rode into Thessaloniki, just a few hours ahead of a Bulgarian division. Three days later King George rode in triumph through the streets of Thessaloniki, the second-largest Greek city, accompanied by the Crown Prince and Venizelos.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} new ministry, {{which set}} up its offices in the 18th-century Ordenspalais across from the Reich Chancellery, was to {{centralise}} Nazi control of all aspects of German cultural and intellectual life. Goebbels hoped to increase popular support of the party from the 37 per cent achieved at the last free election held in Germany on 25 March 1933 to 100 per cent support. An unstated goal was to present to other nations {{the impression that the}} NSDAP had the full <b>and</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> backing of the entire population. One of Goebbels' first productions was staging the Day of Potsdam, a ceremonial passing of power from Hindenburg to Hitler, held in Potsdam on 21 March. He composed the text of Hitler's decree authorizing the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses, held on 1 April. Later that month, Goebbels travelled back to Rheydt, where he was given a triumphal reception. The townsfolk lined the main street, which had been renamed in his honour. On the following day, Goebbels was declared a local hero.|$|E
