There was also the record of the Gorbals in Glasgow made by Bert Hardy (1913–95), Joseph MacKenzie (b. 1929) and Oscar Marzaroli (1933–88), but, having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> native photographers was not high in {{the early twentieth}} century.|$|E

5|$|In God Speaks, Meher Baba {{describes}} {{the journey of}} the soul from its original state of unconscious divinity to the ultimate <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> conscious divinity. The whole journey is a journey of imagination, where the original indivisible state of God imagines becoming countless individualized souls which he likens to bubbles within an infinite ocean. Each soul, powered {{by the desire to}} become conscious, starts its journey in the most rudimentary form of consciousness. This limitation brings the need of a more developed form to advance it towards an increasingly conscious state. Consciousness grows in relation to the impressions each form is capable of gathering.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the white}} dwarf's mass {{approach}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 it {{will no longer}} be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and it will undergo a collapse. For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a neutron star. In this case, only a fraction of star's mass will be ejected as a result. If the core is instead made of carbon-oxygen, however, increasing pressure and temperature will initiate carbon fusion in the center prior to <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> the Chandrasekhar limit. The dramatic result is a runaway nuclear fusion reaction that consumes a substantial fraction of the star within a short time. This will be sufficient to unbind the star in a cataclysmic, Type Ia supernova explosion.|$|E

Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the determinants <b>of</b> educational <b>attainments</b> at the primary, middle and high school levels. <b>Attainments</b> <b>of</b> boys and girls are examined separately so as to shed light on the causes for the significantly lower level <b>of</b> <b>attainment</b> for girls.

5|$|The four {{objectives}} of the operation (which evolved over time) were to boost the sagging morale of the Saigon regime in the Republic of Vietnam, to persuade North Vietnam to cease its support for the communist insurgency in South Vietnam without actually taking any ground forces into communist North Vietnam, to destroy North Vietnam's transportation system, industrial base, and air defenses, and to halt the flow of men and material into South Vietnam. <b>Attainment</b> <b>of</b> these objectives was made difficult by both the restraints imposed upon the U.S. and its allies by Cold War exigencies and by the military aid and assistance received by North Vietnam from its communist allies, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and North Korea.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{could only}} be valid if intelligence assessments were correct. To German intelligence, {{it seemed as if}} the RAF might be on the verge of collapse. The attacks on London, thus far, seemed to confirm the assumption. None of the Luftwaffe bomber formations had encountered the well organised, effective and ferocious defence that had characterised the battles in August 1940. If the German intelligence was correct, then by striking against vital choke points in London that the RAF would be forced to defend, the Luftwaffe had the opportunity to destroy the remaining RAF fighter forces. Not only would the attacks allow for the <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> air superiority, they would eliminate a vital rail network, destroy shipping and supplies brought in from North America, and affect civilian morale by demonstrating London’s vulnerability to air power.|$|E
5|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} to the National Socialist leadership that the United Kingdom {{was not interested in}} a military alliance, anti-British policies were adopted to ensure the <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> Germany’s war aims. Even during the war however, hope remained that Britain would in time yet become a reliable German ally. Hitler preferred to see the British Empire preserved as a world power, because its break-up would benefit other countries far more than it would Germany, particularly the United States and Japan. In fact, Hitler's strategy during 1935-1937 for winning Britain over was based on a German guarantee of defence of the British Empire. After the war, Ribbentrop testified that in 1935 Hitler had promised to deliver twelve German divisions to the disposal of Britain for maintaining the integrity of her colonial possessions.|$|E

5|$|Although Phra Candasaro {{had studied}} with many masters, and had {{mastered}} many important Pali texts, {{he was not}} satisfied. He withdrew himself in the more peaceful area of his hometown twice. Some sources state he also withdrew himself in the jungles to meditate more, but Newell doubts this. In the eleventh rains retreat (vassa) after his ordination, in 1916, he stayed at Wat Botbon at Bangkuvieng, Nonthaburi Province. Wat Botbon was the temple {{where he used to}} receive education as a child, a temple known for its peacefulness. As seen from Luang Pu Sodh's autobiographical notes, he reflected to himself that he had been practicing meditation for many years and had still not understood the essential knowledge which the Buddha had taught. Thus, on the full-moon day in the tenth lunar month of 1916, he sat down in the main shrine hall of Wat Botbon, resolving not to waver in his practice of sitting meditation, whatever might disturb his single-mindedness. That same night he experienced in meditation {{what became known as the}} <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> the Dhammakaya, which marked the start of Dhammakaya meditation as a tradition.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{favorable}} economic development, the military potential of 16th century Poland was modest {{in relation to}} the challenges and threats coming from several directions, which included the Ottoman Empire, the Teutonic state, the Habsburgs, and Muscovy. Given the declining military value and willingness of pospolite ruszenie, the bulk of the forces available consisted of professional and mercenary soldiers. Their number and provision depended on szlachta-approved funding (self-imposed taxation and other sources) and tended to be insufficient for any combination of adversaries. The quality of the forces and their command was good, as demonstrated by victories against a seemingly overwhelming enemy. The <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> strategic objectives was supported by a well-developed service of knowledgeable diplomats and emissaries. Because of the limited resources at the state's disposal, the Jagiellonian Poland had to concentrate on the area most crucial for its security and economic interests, which was the strengthening of Poland's position along the Baltic coast.|$|E
5|$|Most bovids are polygynous. In a few species, {{individuals}} are monogamous, resulting in minimal male-male aggression and reduced selection for large body size in males. Thus, sexual dimorphism is almost absent. Females may be {{slightly larger than}} males, possibly due to competition among females for the acquisition of territories. This {{is the case in}} duikers and other small bovids. The time taken for the <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> sexual maturity by either sex varies broadly among bovids. Sexual maturity may even precede or follow mating. For instance the impala males, though sexually mature by a year, can mate only after four years of age. On the contrary barbary sheep females may give birth to offspring even before they have gained sexual maturity. The delay in male sexual maturation is more visible in sexually dimorphic species, particularly the reduncines, probably due to competition among males. For instance, the blue wildebeest females become capable of reproduction within a year or two of birth, while the males become mature only when four years old.|$|E
