25|$|Opposition to the Chávez {{government}} was then particularly strong, {{with some of}} those who were previously in the government before the election of Chávez. The independent media became the primary check on Chávez after he had taken control of most of the Venezuelan government, with the Venezuelan media acting like other forms of media in Latin America at the time that demanded accountability for governmental abuses and exposing corruption. The opposition was worried with Chávez because they believed his rewriting Venezuela's constitution were signs that Chávez was trying to maintain power through authoritarianism. In early 2002, there were also increasing signs of discontent in the military; in February four military officials, including a general and a rear admiral, publicly called on Chávez to resign. On 7 February 2002 Venezuela Air Force Colonel Pedro Vicente Soto and National Reserve Captain Pedro Flores Rivero led a rally protesting the Chávez government's allegedly undemocratic and authoritarian practices. Rear Admiral Carlos Molina Tamayo said on television that if Chávez did not resign, he should be impeached. Besides the opposition accusations that Chávez was undermining democracy and free speech, the military's complaints included Plan Bolívar 2000's use of the armed forces for poverty reduction activities instead of national defense. They also said Chávez was alienating the United States through a foreign policy involving negotiations with Colombian rebels and strengthening links with OPEC countries considered enemies of the United States, including Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Chávez and his allies suggested other motives, including Soto's being passed over for promotion, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> report in The Washington Post alleging that Soto and Tamayo had received $100,000 each from Miami bank accounts in return for denouncing Chávez.|$|E

500|$|At 11:30am on 18October1968, {{the flat}} was raided by Sgt. Norman Pilcher, of Scotland Yard's Drugs Squad. In 1974, Lennon remembered that Ono {{answered}} {{the front door}} as a female voice had said (over the intercom), {{that there was a}} message from the Apple office. Ono opened the door and saw the female with five men, who were all dressed in plain-clothes. She panicked and closed the door, thinking they were Beatles' fans. Meanwhile, at the back window, another person was banging on the window and holding up a search warrant for Lennon to read. As Lennon was also panicking—not knowing at that point that they were all police officers—the raid consisted of seven police officers and two police dogs—he played for time and refused to open the window. Because of this, Pilcher later accused Lennon of obstruction of justice, which was a crime. Inside the flat, the police searched every room thoroughly, even though Lennon was supposed to accompany them whilst they did so, according to the law. Pilcher then summoned Lennon <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> binocular case on a mantelpiece, asking him, [...] "Is this yours?" [...] Lennon replied in the affirmative, and was then shown 219grams of hashish, which was in the case.|$|E
2500|$|Walton {{also played}} a {{significant}} role in choosing the location for Kennedy's burial. While many in the media, Kennedy's family, and the Kennedy administration believed that Kennedy would be buried in the family plot in Brookline, Massachusetts, Jacqueline Kennedy and Robert McNamara believed he should be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. In a driving rain, McNamara visited the site early in the morning on Saturday, November 24. After reviewing three sites (one of which was the lawn below Arlington House) with cemetery superintendent John C. Metzler, Sr., McNamara returned around mid-morning with Robert Kennedy, Kennedy's sisters Jean Smith and Pat Lawford, and Walton. After reviewing all three sites, the group agreed on the Arlington House lawn. Walton was one of the first to speak in favor of the lawn site, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> site higher up the hill where he thought the grave should be. During a third trip that afternoon, McNamara and Walton accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to the site. Walton again pointed to where the president should be buried, and others noted that Walton had instinctively chosen a plot along the axis between Arlington House and the Lincoln Memorial. Walton's reckoning was so good, his preferred site was only [...] off the axis line.|$|E
