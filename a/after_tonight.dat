2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review: [...] "From Camelot to Neverland, the show has never quite been able to sustain itself when it’s simply Storybrooke, as much {{as some of the}} better stories have been rooted there. So it’s not a shock to find out that, <b>after</b> <b>tonight,</b> we’re probably going to be spending some time in the Underworld next month. We already know we’re meeting Hercules and Megara; given tonight’s events, does that also mean we’re meeting Hades? The bigger (and more interesting) question at stake is the fact that now that we’re in the Underworld, how many previously dead characters {{are going to get a}} chance to return? We’ve already had confirmations of past-dead characters like Cruella and Cora, though both of those characters are supposedly strictly for the show’s 100th episode. Regardless, moving to the Underworld opens up a host of options for 5B in terms of characters and plot, and I’m curious to see what those options are." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leno was, in reality, {{overcome}} with incredulity; in private conversations, he likened {{the situation to}} a relationship, noting that he was loyal and still ended up [...] "heartbroken". From his perspective, the situation made no sense: they had remained number one in ratings and consistently brought in money. He began frequently lamenting his confusion to producer Vickers, explaining that he was [...] "sick of lying" [...] when people inquired on his retirement. Eventually, he began mulling around his options <b>after</b> <b>Tonight,</b> telling his staff that after the transition, they could simply move to ABC, and work at the Disney lot not far from their current Burbank studio. His frustration with the situation came across in his nightly monologues, as more jokes regarding NBC's fourth-place position in the ratings, as well as jokes regarding the future transition, began to appear. While NBC executives tended to not worry in the immediate years following the decision, by 2007, Zucker began to ponder what losing Leno might mean for the network. Around this time, Fox and ABC began to court Leno privately, conveying interest and holding discreet conversations.|$|E
