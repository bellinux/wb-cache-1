The mechanisms of adhesion of P. aeruginosa to mouse epidermal cells was studied by using four mutants derived from a single strain: flagellated and piliated (F+P+), flagellated and nonpiliated (F+P-), nonflagellated and piliated (F-P+), and nonflagellated and nonpiliated (F-P-) mutants. F+P+ and F-P+ bacteria efficiently <b>adhered</b> <b>to</b> mouse epidermal cells, while F+P- and F-P- bacteria hardly <b>adhered</b> <b>to</b> mouse epidermal cells. The number of F+P+ bacteria that <b>adhered</b> <b>to</b> mouse epidermal cells was almost {{the same as that}} of F-P+ bacteria.

There were no significant differences between the number of bacteria <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> mouse epidermal cells isolated from normal skin and those <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> cells isolated from burned skin. Heating of the mouse epidermal cell suspension had no effect on the adhesion of P. aeruginosa.
