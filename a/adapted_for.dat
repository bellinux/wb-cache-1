5|$|The {{pinniped}} ear is <b>adapted</b> <b>for</b> hearing underwater, {{where it}} can hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While {{they are capable of}} hearing a wide range of frequencies (e.g. 500 to 32,000Hz in the northern fur seal, compared to 20 to 20,000Hz in humans), their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best <b>adapted</b> <b>for</b> airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better <b>adapted</b> <b>for</b> underwater hearing. Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it is useless underwater as their nostrils are closed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution to}} the global adaptive partial state feedback control problem for rigid-link, flexible-joint (RLFJ) robots. The proposed tracking controller <b>adapts</b> <b>for</b> parametric uncertainty throughout the entire mechanical system while only requiring link and actuator position measurements. A nonlinear filter is employed to eliminate the need for link velocity measurements while a set of linear filters is utilized to eliminate the need for actuator velocity measurements. A backstepping control strategy is utilized to illustrate global asymptotic link position tracking. An output feedback controller that <b>adapts</b> <b>for</b> parametric uncertainty in the link dynamics of the robot manipulator is presented as an extension. Experimental results are provided as verifica-tion of the proposed controller...|$|R
