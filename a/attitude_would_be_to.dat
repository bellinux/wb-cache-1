Design/methodology/approach – Data to answer the study’s key questions were taken from the 2010 - 2011 UK citizenship survey, where only the main sample was analysed. Findings – The findings reveal that first-generation immigrants have a higher prevalence of pro-violence attitudes than the native population.

Another <b>attitude</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> make some slight molecular level chemical modifications in the explosive structure that cause a diminished sensitivity without substantial loss in explosive impact. RDX has three nitro groups. We assumed that by the conversion of these nitro groups to nitroso and amino groups, {{it might be possible}} to lower the sensitivity somewhat.

40|$|Research on {{infertile}} couples {{applying for}} treatment is scanty. Their education {{and socioeconomic status}} are above average and their marriages extraordinarily stable. Allowing for the stress of infertility and its treatment, they appear in psychological tests and psychiatric interviews very similar to controls. As prognosis {{on the quality of}} later parenthood for persons in the grey zone between complete psychological normalcy and definable psychiatric disorder is impossible, self selection for artificial procreation rather than selection by a team of psychologists and social workers should take place. A decision not to treat {{because of the presence of}} evident psychiatric disorder should be taken on the investigating physicians' own responsibility and explained to the couple. Very little as well is known about the development of children conceived by AID or IVF. There is no rationale for the belief that extraordinary expectations by their parents will impair their psychosocial development. The literature on adopted children puts the importance of so-called genealogic bewilderment in true perspective. Still the access to non-identifying information on donors could be useful for children and parents. As proof of genetic risk factors for major and minor psychiatric disorder is rapidly accumulating, a careful psychiatric screening of donors is recommended. By artificial procreation parenthood can be extended to widows, to single women and to homosexual couples. Epidemiologic studies in child and adult psychiatry make it evident that the quality of emotional relationship within a family is more important for psychosocial development of children than family structure. Today the rate of single parents is rapidly increasing. Nonetheless artificial procreation should not be used to promote social change and to create new structures. While fully acknowledging that the conventional family is neither of divine origin nor an anthropological necessity, a cautious <b>attitude</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> wait until new structures are so well established and generally accepted that they attract the average person and make up an average environment for a child.

40|$|Inevitably, {{education}} is considered {{as the main}} tool for development. Regardless of nationality, race, age and culture, everyone in this contemporary world believes that {{education is}} the commonest medicine that cures every disease hindering {{the development of a}} nation. Keeping this view, countries put endless efforts in the development of education. Major phenomena for the development process of education include: privatization, teacher education, design of modern and well-timed course and curricula and establishment of infrastructure and logistics. For the allocation of national budget, most of the states provide the highest preference to education. Despite these efforts, many countries fail to achieve the target that is especially aimed for their national development through education.

40|$|The Implicit Association Test (IAT) aims {{to measure}} participants' {{automatic}} evaluation of an attitude object and is useful {{especially for the}} measurement of attitudes related to socially sensitive subjects, e. g. doping in sports. Several studies indicate that IAT scores can be faked on instruction. But fully or semi-instructed research scenarios might not properly reflect what happens in more realistic situations, when participants secretly decide to try faking the test. The present study <b>is</b> the first <b>to</b> investigate IAT faking when there is only an implicit incentive to do so. Sixty-five athletes (22. 83 years ± 2. 45; 25 women) <b>were</b> randomly assigned <b>to</b> an incentive-to-fake condition or a control condition. Participants in the incentive-to-fake condition <b>were</b> manipulated <b>to</b> believe that athletes with lenient doping <b>attitudes</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> referred <b>to</b> a tedious 45 -minute anti-doping program. Attitudes were measured with the pictorial doping brief IAT (BIAT) and with the Performance Enhancement Attitude Scale (PEAS). A one-way MANOVA revealed significant differences between conditions after the manipulation in PEAS scores, {{but not in the}} doping BIAT. In the light of our hypothesis this suggests that participants successfully faked an exceedingly negative attitude to doping when completing the PEAS, but were unsuccessful in doing so on the reaction time-based test.

40|$|Background: Any {{approach}} {{promoting a}} culture of safety and the prevention of health care-associated infections (HCAIs) should involve all stakeholders, including by definition the patients themselves. This qualitative study explored the knowledge and attitudes of health care workers toward the concept of patient empowerment focused on improving infection control practices. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 29 staff from a large hospital in Sydney, Australia. Results: There was virtually unanimous agreement among the participants that patients should {{be thought of as}} a stakeholder and should have a role in the prevention of HCAI. However, the degree of patient responsibility and level of system engagement varied. Although very few had previously <b>been</b> exposed <b>to</b> the concept of empowerment, they were accepting of the idea and were surprised that hospitals had not yet adopted the concept. However, they felt that a lack of support, busy workloads, and negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> key barriers <b>to</b> the implementation of any empowerment programs. Conclusion: Although the World Health Organization has recommended that patients have a role in encouraging hand hygiene as a means of preventing infection, patient engagement remains an underused method. By extending the concept of patient empowerment to a range of infection prevention opportunities, the positive impact of this intervention will not only extend to the patient but to the system itself...|$|R

40|$|Purpose We {{examined}} {{the contribution of}} implicit and explicit risk-attitudes {{to the prediction of}} risky management decisions. Indirect methods allow for the measurement of implicit attitudes, while self-report <b>is</b> typically used <b>to</b> measure explicit, reflective attitudes. Indirect methods make it difficult to fake test results or use impression management, because they are based on reaction times and assess the strengths of associations in memory. Design/Methodology In a field experiment, managers were tested for their implicit and explicit risk-attitudes and <b>were</b> asked <b>to</b> make risky management decisions. An Implicit Association Test (IAT) <b>was</b> constructed <b>to</b> measure implicit risk-taking and compared to an explicit risk questionnaire in its influence on several management decisions. Results Results showed that the chance that managers take the risk is significantly higher when the IAT classified them as risk-seeking. This, however, was only found if the decision was framed as a loss situation. Under a gain framing, the IAT was not a significant predictor, but the explicit measure significantly differentiated between managers choosing the risk versus not. Research/Practical Implications These results can be explained by theories on impulsive decision making. Implicit attitudes may assess impulsive risk-decisions in loss situations better than explicit <b>attitudes.</b> It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> worthwhile <b>to</b> further develop indirect measures to assess managerial decision making. Originality/Value In loss situations, managers may make decisions more impulsively. Thus, implicit attitudes may predict risky decision making in loss situations better than explicit attitudes...|$|R
60|$|Concealed behind Angelo's {{modest and}} unassuming exterior, and unsuspected by any but his intimates, was a lofty pride, a pride of almost {{abnormal}} proportions, indeed, and this rendered him ever the prey of slights; {{and although they}} were almost always imaginary ones, they hurt none the less on that account. By ill fortune judge Driscoll had happened to touch his sorest point, i.e., his conviction that his brother's presence was welcomer everywhere than his own; that he was often invited, out of mere courtesy, where only his brother was wanted, and that in a majority of cases he <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> included in an invitation if he could be left out without offense. A sensitive nature like this <b>is</b> necessarily subject <b>to</b> moods; moods which traverse the whole gamut of feeling; moods which know all the climes of emotion, from the sunny heights of joy to the black abysses of despair. At times, in his seasons of deepest depressions, Angelo almost wished {{that he and his}} brother might become segregated from each other and be separate individuals, like other men. But of course as soon as his mind cleared and these diseased imaginings passed away, he shuddered at the repulsive thought, and earnestly prayed that it might visit him no more. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> separate, and as other men are! How awkward it would seem; how unendurable. What would he do with his hands, his arms? How would his legs feel? How odd, and strange, and grotesque every action, <b>attitude,</b> movement, gesture <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> <b>To</b> sleep by himself, eat by himself, walk by himself--how lonely, how unspeakably lonely! No, no, any fate but that. In every way and from every point, the idea was revolting.|$|R

Toma como suporte empírico a representação que trabalhadores acidentados na construção civil constroem acerca daqueles eventos. Parte de um conjunto de entrevistas com seis trabalhadores que se encontravam afastados do trabalho por invalidez decorrente do acidente. A análise realizada busca mostrar que os indivíduos tendem a construir explicações e justificativas a partir de uma perspectiva fatalista de modo a poderem aceitar e conviver com o medo do acidente e da morte ou com a dor da perda. Argumenta também que a atitude fatalista, não pode se modificar apenas com a tomada de consciência, por parte dos trabalhadores, de que acidentes e mortes no trabalho estão relacionados a condições precárias de trabalho. Para modificarem suas atitudes, seria necessário, também, que experimentassem novas condições de vida e trabalho, podendo, assim, construir uma nova concepção de mundo e de vida. This article {{proposes a}} discussion about the fatalistic posture adopted when a worker faces work accidents and death. It has its empirical support on the representation which injured construction workers create about these events. The study was based on interviews made with six workers who <b>were</b> unable <b>to</b> return to work due to the disability caused by accidents. The accomplished analysis intends to show that the individuals create explanations and justifications based on a fatalistic perspective. This way of thinking enables them to accept and to live with the fear of accidents and death, or with the pain caused by a loss. It also argues that the fatalistic attitude cannot be modified only by understanding that accidents and deaths that happen at the work environment <b>are</b> related <b>to</b> its precarious conditions. In order to change this <b>attitude,</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> necessary <b>to</b> experience new conditions of life and work, so that the workers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> create a new conception of the world and of life...|$|R
60|$|But Daudet did not whisper; {{he spoke}} loudly, with animation, {{with a clear}} felicity of tone--as a bird sings. He saw life around him with extreme clearness, and he felt it as it is--thinner than air and more elusive than a flash of lightning. He hastened to offer it his compassion, his indignation, his wonder, his sympathy, without giving a moment of thought to the momentous issues that <b>are</b> {{supposed}} <b>to</b> lurk in the logic of such sentiments. He tolerated the little foibles, the small ruffianisms, the grave mistakes; {{the only thing he}} distinctly <b>would</b> not forgive <b>was</b> hardness of heart. This unpractical <b>attitude</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> fatal <b>to</b> a better man, but his readers have forgiven him. Withal he <b>is</b> chivalrous <b>to</b> exiled queens and deformed sempstresses, he <b>is</b> pityingly tender <b>to</b> broken-down actors, to ruined gentlemen, to stupid Academicians; he is glad of the joys of the commonplace people in a commonplace way--and he never makes a secret of all this. No, the man was not an artist. What if his creations are illumined by the sunshine of his temperament so vividly that they stand before us infinitely more real than the dingy illusions surrounding our everyday existence? The misguided man is for ever pottering amongst them, lifting up his voice, dotting his i's in the wrong places. He takes Tartarin by the arm, he does not conceal his interest in the Nabob's cheques, his sympathy for an honest Academician plus bete que nature, his hate for an architect plus mauvais que la gale; he is in the thick of it all. He feels with the Duc de Mora and with Felicia Ruys--and he lets you see it. He does not sit on a pedestal in the hieratic and imbecile pose of some cheap god whose greatness consists in being too stupid to care. He cares immensely for his Nabobs, his kings, his book-keepers, his Colettes, and his Saphos. He vibrates together with his universe, and with lamentable simplicity follows M. de Montpavon on that last walk along the Boulevards.|$|R

While directly south of the light, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> found that the north pole <b>would</b> <b>be</b> illuminated, while no revolution on the axis would bring the south pole within the circle of the light. This is when a line drawn from the axis of the globe would cut the lamp, were the inclination brought as low as the surface of the table. Next set the globe in motion, following the rim of the table, and proceeding to the east or right hand, keeping its axis always looking in the same general direction, or in an <b>attitude</b> that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> parallel <b>to</b> a north and south line drawn through the sun, were the inclination as low as the surface of the table. This movement <b>would</b> <b>be,</b> in one sense, sideways, the circle of light gradually lessening around the north pole, and extending towards the south, as the globe proceeded east and north, diminishing the length of the days in the northern hemisphere, and increasing them in the southern. When at east, the most direct rays of the light would fall on the equator, and the light would cut the two poles, rendering the days and nights equal. As the globe moved north, the circle of light <b>would</b> <b>be</b> found <b>to</b> increase around the south pole, while none at all touched the north. When on the north side of the table, the northern pole of the globe would incline so far from the sun as to leave a space around it in shadow that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> of precisely the same size as had been the space of light when it was placed on the opposite side of the table. Going round the circle west, the same phenomena <b>would</b> <b>be</b> seen, until coming directly south of the lamp, the north pole would again come into light altogether, and the south equally into shadow.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} child welfare {{literature}} suggested that foster parents tend to manifest authoritarian child-rearing attitudes, resulting in foster children {{being exposed to}} inadequate parenting. A concurrent review of research literature related to families and socialization theory found that authoritarian child-rearing attitudes do have {{detrimental effects on the}} socialization of the child. It was thought that, if Newfoundland foster parents <b>were</b> similar <b>to</b> foster parents in the child welfare studies reviewed, they would reflect authoritarian child-rearing <b>attitudes</b> which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> related <b>to</b> their parenting adequacy. [...] Methodology provided for the examination of the child-rearing attitudes of a population of foster parents serviced by a local child welfare agency. The foster parents were divided in two groups by child care social workers at the agency. They rated one group as more adequate, and the other as less adequate. Instruments used to examine their child-rearing attitudes consisted of six scales selected from the Parental Attitude Research Instruments [...] Mother Form and Father Form. The foster parents' demographic characteristics were examined. All respondents were personally interviewed. [...] Descriptive measures <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> observe for differences between the more and less adequate foster parents in the study group. Data analysis revealed that foster parents in the study group did have demographic characteristics somewhat similar to those of foster parents studied in other countries. Differences between mean scores obtained for more adequate and less adequate foster parents on the attitude scales were minimal. Possible explanation {{lies in the fact that}} more adequate and less adequate foster mothers displayed marginal differences between means on both restrictive and permissive scales. Also, more adequate foster fathers tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less permissive on some scales than did the less adequate foster fathers. [...] When examined as subgroups, foster mothers and foster fathers who were rated by agency social workers as being less adequate did show a tendency <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more authoritarian in their child-rearing attitudes than the more adequate foster mother and father subgroups. Overall, less adequate foster parents scored in the direction of being more authoritarian than more adequate foster parents, when taking into consideration the former's scores as subgroups. [...] A final observation is that agency social workers did prove capable in rating the adequacy of foster parents in their caseloads. Their judgement was upheld in that the less adequate foster parents tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less permissive and more restrictive in their child-rearing attitudes, even though the differences were somewhat marginal...|$|R
