40|$|AbstractExperiments to {{investigate}} bone's physiological adaptation to mechanical loading frequently employ models that apply dynamic loads to bones in vivo {{and assess the}} changes in mass and architecture that result. It is axiomatic that bones will only show an adaptive response if the applied <b>artificial</b> <b>loading</b> environment differs in a significant way from that to which the bones have been habituated by normal functional loading. It is generally assumed that this normal loading is similar between experimental groups. In {{the study reported here}} we found that this was not always the case. Male and female 17 -week-old C 57 BL/ 6 mice were housed in groups of six, and a single episode (40 cycles) of non-invasive axial loading, engendering 2, 200 με on the medial surface of the proximal tibiae in sample mice, was applied to right tibiae on alternate days for two weeks. This engendered an adaptive increase in bone mass in females, but not males. Observation revealed the main difference in behaviour between males and females was that males were involved in fights 1. 3 times per hour, whereas the females never fought. We therefore housed all mice individually. In females, there was a similar significant osteogenic response to loading in cortical and trabecular bone of both grouped and individual mice. In contrast, in males, adaptive increases in the loaded compared with non-loaded control bones was only apparent in animals housed individually. Our interpretation of these findings is that the frequent vigorous fighting that occurs between young adult males housed in groups could be sufficient to engender peak strains and strain rates that equal or exceed the stimulus derived from <b>artificial</b> <b>loading.</b> This indicates the importance of ensuring that physical activity is consistent between groups. Reducing the background level of the naturally engendered strain environment allows adaptive responses to <b>artificial</b> <b>loading</b> to be demonstrated at lower loads...|$|R

This diversity of approach has been largely superseded by non-invasive transcutaneous loading in rats and mice which is now the model of choice for many studies. Together such studies have demonstrated that; over the physiological strain range, bone’s mechanically-adaptive processes are responsive to dynamic but not static strains; the size and nature of the adaptive response controlling bone mass is linearly related to the peak loads encountered; the strain-related response is preferentially sensitive to high strain rates and unresponsive to static ones; is most responsive to unusual strain distributions; is maximized by remarkably few strain cycles and that these are most effective when interrupted by short periods of rest between them...|$|R

Examples of uses for their products are fans, pumps, lifts and cranes. The project {{is to look at}} Emotrons end of line test. The company has seen that at the final test-ing there is a bottleneck that restricts the outflow and prevents {{an increase in the number}} of tested products. The purpose of this project is to review how Emotrons end-of-line test works today and if there is a possibility to make the test more efficient in such a way that the quality is not at risk, while increasing the outflow of tested products. The projects first step is to look at and analyse what is causing the bottleneck at the end-of-line. When the analysis is complete, the next step is to review whether there is a possibility to solve the bottleneck and if so in what way can this be done. Emotrons most overall objective of the project is to increase the outflow of the number of tested products without jeopardizing the quality. An analysis has been made on frequency inverters, soft starters and shaft power monitors. Fail reports for the year 2007 have been reviewed. Faults that have been detected have been sub-mitted by type and size. The testing has been divided into various phases of error. A time pre-cision has been established to show the time of the test stages. The distinction has been made to provide a picture of where and when errors occur during the testing. A logging test has been carried out on the largest frequency inverter types to determine the characteristics of frequency inverters when tested with load by today's test method. It has also carried out a logging test with an <b>artificial</b> <b>load.</b> An analysis is made on a test machine that is under construction, which today is called PEBB test.

40|$|When {{designing}} {{control laws}} for systems with constraints {{added to the}} tracking performance, control allocation methods can be utilized. Control allocations methods are used when there are more command inputs than controlled variables. Constraints that require allocators are such task as; surface saturation limits, structural load limits, drag reduction constraints or actuator failures. Most transport aircraft have many actuated surfaces compared to the three controlled variables (such as angle of attack, roll rate & angle of side slip). To distribute the control effort among the redundant set of actuators a fixed mixer approach can be utilized or online control allocation techniques. The benefit of an online allocator is that constraints can {{be considered in the}} design whereas the fixed mixer cannot. However, an online control allocator mixer has a disadvantage of not guaranteeing a surface schedule, which can then produce ill defined loads on the aircraft. The load uncertainty and complexity has prevented some controller designs from using advanced allocation techniques.

The method involves the additive decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor into 'crack' and 'bulk material' components. The response of the intact bulk material is represented by a reduced deformation gradient tensor, {{and the opening of}} an embedded cohesive interface is represented by a normalized cohesive displacement-jump vector. The rotation of the embedded interface is tracked as the material deforms and as the crack opens.

The improvements to the accuracy of CDM models that incorporate the presented method over existing approaches are demonstrated for a single element subjected to simple shear deformation and for a finite element model of a unidirectional open-hole tension specimen.
