500|$|The {{release of}} the {{controversial}} [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] music video prior to the album's release has often been cited as having the greatest promotional impact. Directed by Paul Hunter, the video features D'Angelo, filmed from the waist-up, lip-synching in the nude. According to writer Keith M. Harris, it portrayed D'Angelo's [...] "discursive play with masculinity and blackness". The video gained {{a significant amount of}} airplay on the BET and MTV networks, and increased mainstream notice of D'Angelo upon Voodoos release, while exposing him as a sex icon to a newer generation of fans. It also proved to contribute significantly to the album's commercial success. The music video for [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] was also viewed at a promotional party thrown in celebration of the album's release, which took place in January 2000 at the Centro-Fly nightclub in Chelsea, Manhattan. Douglas Century of The New York Times wrote of the club's appearance as [...] "packed <b>and</b> <b>sweaty,</b> with decor and soul music out of a 1970's time warp: multiple video screens playing images of Curtis Mayfield and vintage Soul Train episodes, replete with dancers in Day-Glo bell-bottoms".|$|E
500|$|Mars {{had been}} filming the music video for [...] "Gorilla" [...] as he {{announced}} on his Twitter account, on October 2, 2013. He said [...] "Sorry i've been M.I.A, I was shooting a music video. #WinkWink #FRIKIKIKIKI #BangBang Wait {{till you see}} this". It was directed by Mars' himself and regular collaborator Cameron Duddy. On October 10, 2013 it was announced on Bruno Mars' official website, {{leading up to the}} release of the video, the unveil of teasers every day via Mars' Instagram account. The teasers included a car parked in front of a strip club, a reptile, and an angry boss played by Luis Guzmán. Duddy along with Mars sought to create [...] "more than a standard strip-club video" [...] by researching and going into strip clubs to appreciate the architecture of the local. Nevertheless, the search for the ideal strip club was fruitless, so Mars and Duddy decided to build one: [...] "a joint that seemed like it was lifted straight out of Havana, dark <b>and</b> <b>sweaty</b> and seemingly untouched by time. They painted the walls themselves, and went back and forth on just what color neon they should use". When the time came to cast someone to play a stripper, the only name was Freida Pinto's one. However, Duddy had some doubts her choice, since he considered her [...] "safe". To this, Mars replied [...] "it's important to use someone who hasn't been seen in this light before". All in all, Duddy confessed that he trusted Mars instincts regarding Pinto's choice for the role. Duddy explained that some scenes recorded for the video were dangerous. Pinto could have harmed herself in the scene where [...] "she sheds her clothes among a sea of sparks", as well as Mars' guitar player [...] "He got dangerously close to having his head burned". Muriel Villera starts as one of the jealous strippers. The official music video was set to premiere on October 14, 2013. Nevertheless, its release was delayed one day by Mars himself stating [...] "I want it to be the best it can be. With that being said, I need one more day". The video, finally arrived on October 15, 2013 exclusively via Facebook.|$|E

Roger Ebert gave the film four of a possible four stars and wrote: [...] "This is a very physical movie, one of the healthiest <b>and</b> <b>sweatiest</b> celebrations of physical exertion I can remember...It {{is filled with the}} uncertainties, risks, cares, and rewards of real life, and it considers its characters' hearts and minds, and sees their sexuality as an expression of their true feelings for each other." ...|$|R

2500|$|From {{at least}} the late Republic onward, the toga became {{increasingly}} unsuited to manual work or physically active leisure. It was expensive, heavy, hot <b>and</b> <b>sweaty,</b> hard to keep clean, costly to launder and challenging to wear. A toga worn correctly constrained both posture and gait; it was best suited to stately processions, oratory, sitting in the theatre or circus, and displaying oneself before one's peers and inferiors while [...] "ostentatiously doing nothing" [...] at salutationes. These early morning, formal [...] "greeting sessions" [...] were {{an essential part of}} Roman life, in which clients attended their patrons, competing for favours or investment in business ventures. A client who dressed well and correctly - in his toga, if a citizen - showed respect for himself and his patron, and might stand out among the crowd. A canny patron might equip his entire family, his friends, freedmen, even his slaves, with elegant, costly and impractical clothing, impyling his entire extended family's condition as one of [...] "honorific leisure" [...] (otium), buoyed by limitless wealth.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Rolling Stone {{named him}} the biggest pop {{star of the}} year and {{featured}} him on the magazine's cover, commenting that he [...] "attained the one thing most pop stars don't, and the one thing he wanted more than anything else: credibility." [...] For Entertainment Weekly his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, [...] "redefined pop's cutting edge"; for Vibe it [...] "pushed boundaries more forcefully" [...] than works by his male contemporaries. Fuse TV's editor Jason Lipshutz stated it [...] "changed the game. [...] was steely <b>and</b> <b>sweaty,</b> a universal dance opus that made room for intimacy. It had the best first half of any pop album in 25 years. You {{have to go back to}} 1979 for Off the Wall, to find a pop album with a first half that matches up." [...] He was ranked 66th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time. Timberlake appeared for the first time on the Time 100 list of most influential people in 2007. In 2013, Timberlake made his second appearance on the 100 list, with Stevie Wonder writing [...] "Justin has accomplished a lot at a young age, taking advantage of all the possibilities, and yet he's found time to give of himself too—he gets and gives back. He has a spirit. He does God's work through using the most of his talent." [...] In October 2015, he was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, becoming its youngest member.|$|E
