5000|$|As an example, {{consider}} a Norton source (<b>current</b> <b>IA,</b> parallel resistance RA) driving a resistor load RL. Because of current division (also {{referred to as}} [...] "loading") the current delivered to the load is only IA RA / ( [...] RL + RA [...] ). However, if the Norton source drives a unity gain buffer such as that in Figure 1 (bottom, with unity gain), the current input to the amplifier is <b>IA,</b> with no <b>current</b> division because the amplifier input resistance is zero. At the output the dependent current source delivers <b>current</b> βi <b>IA</b> = IA to the load, again without current division because the output resistance of the buffer is infinite. A Norton equivalent circuit of the combined original Norton source and the buffer is an ideal <b>current</b> source <b>IA</b> with infinite Norton resistance.|$|R

50|$|The simple tetrode or screen-grid tube {{offered a}} larger {{amplification}} factor, {{more power and}} a higher frequency capability than the earlier triode. However, in the tetrode secondary electrons knocked out of the anode (plate) by the electrons from the cathode striking it (a process called secondary emission) can flow to the screen grid due to its relatively high potential. This current of electrons leaving the anode reduces the net anode <b>current</b> <b>Ia.</b> As the anode voltage Va is increased, the electrons from the cathode hit the anode with more energy, knocking out more secondary electrons, increasing this current of electrons leaving the anode. The result {{is that in the}} tetrode the anode <b>current</b> <b>Ia</b> is found to decrease with increasing anode voltage Va, over part of the characteristic curve. This property (ΔVa/ΔIa < 0) is called negative resistance. It can cause the tetrode to become unstable, leading to parasitic oscillations in the output, called dynatron oscillations in some circumstances.|$|R

The pheromone subsystem of the olfactory system of moths is a particularly well-defined example in which rapid variations of odor content in turbulent plumes require fast, concentration-invariant neural representations. It is not clear how cellular and network mechanisms in the moth antennal lobe contribute to coding efficiency. Using computational modeling, we show that intrinsic potassium <b>currents</b> (<b>IA</b> and ISK) in projection neurons may combine with extrinsic inhibition from local interneurons to implement a dual latency code for both pheromone identity and intensity. The mean latency reflects stimulus intensity, whereas latency differences carry concentration-invariant information about stimulus identity. In accordance with physiological results, the projection neurons exhibit a multiphasic response of inhibition-excitation-inhibition. Together with synaptic inhibition, intrinsic <b>currents</b> <b>IA</b> and ISK account for the first and second inhibitory phases and contribute to a rapid encoding of pheromone information. The first inhibition plays the role of a reset to limit variability in the time to first spike. The second inhibition prevents responses of excessive duration to allow tracking of intermittent stimuli...|$|R

40|$|A large patch {{electrode}} {{was used}} to measure local currents from the cell bodies of Aplysia neurons that were voltage-clamped by a two-microelectrode method. Patch currents recorded at the soma cap, antipodal to the origin of the axon, and whole-cell currents were recorded simultaneously and normalized to membrane capacitance. The patch electrode could be reused and moved to different locations which allowed currents from adjacent patches on a single cell to be compared. The results show that the current density at the soma cap is smaller than the average current density in the cell body for three components of membrane current: the inward Na current (INa), the delayed outward current (Iout), and the transient outward <b>current</b> (<b>IA).</b> Of these three classes of ionic <b>currents,</b> <b>IA</b> is found to reach the highest relative density at the soma cap. Current density varies between adjacent patches on the same cell, suggesting that ion channels occur in clusters. The kinetics of Iout, and on rare occasions IA, were also found to vary between patches.

Two clear populations were identified consistent with: principal neurons which {{are involved in}} detecting interaural intensity differences (IIDs) and efferent neurons of the lateral olivocochlear (LOC) system which project to the cochlea. Principal neurons fired a short latency action potential (AP) often followed by an AP train during maintained depolarization. They possessed sustained outward K(+) currents, {{with little or no}} transient K(+) <b>current</b> (<b>I(A))</b> and a prominent hyperpolarization-activated non-specific cation conductance, I(H). On depolarization, LOC neurons exhibited a characteristic delay to the first AP. These neurons possessed a prominent transient outward <b>current</b> <b>I(A),</b> but had no I(H). Both LOC and principal neurons received glutamatergic and glycinergic synaptic inputs. LOC synaptic responses decayed more slowly than those of principal neurons; the mean decay time constant of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs was around 1 ms in principal neurons and 4 ms in LOC neurons. Decay time constants for glycinergic IPSCs were around 5 ms in principal neurons and 10 ms in LOC neurons. We conclude that principal cells receive fast synaptic responses appropriate for integration of IID inputs, while the LOC cells possess excitatory and inhibitory receptors with much slower kinetics. 7574...|$|R

Through {{selection}} of an approproate low <b>arcing</b> <b>current,</b> mechanical milling under an arc discharge {{can be employed}} to rapidly pulverise particles under local extremes of pressure and temperature while avoiding complete particle melting.

Discharge milling of hematite for prolongued periods in Ar/ 3 %H 2 resulted {{in the formation of}} hematite plus magnetite, with eventual formation of a mixture pure iron, FeO and some non-reacted hematite. Preliminary TEM investigation of the reduced hematite also revealed novel Fe-rich particles and nanofragments. As with previous studies of electric discharge milling applied to oxide ceramics, particle coarsening and spheroidisation is believed to result from repeated sintering of individual particles. The observations are taken as further confirmation that electric discharge milling may be employed for non-equilibrium processing of materials...|$|R

Here we have characterized biophysically and pharmacologically an <b>IA</b> <b>current</b> in lamprey locomotor network neurons that is activated by suprathreshold depolarization and is specifically blocked by catechol at 100 μM. The biophysical properties of this current {{are similar to the}} mammalian Kv 3. 4 channel. The role of the <b>IA</b> <b>current</b> both in single neuron firing and in locomotor pattern generation was analyzed. The <b>IA</b> <b>current</b> facilitates Na+ channel recovery from inactivation and thus sustains repetitive firing. The role of the <b>IA</b> <b>current</b> in motor pattern generation was examined by applying catechol during fictive locomotion induced by N-methyl-d-aspartate. Blockade of this current increased the locomotor burst frequency and decreased the firing of motoneurons. Although an alternating motor pattern could still be generated, the cycle duration was less regular, with ventral roots bursts failing on some cycles.

40|$|The A-type voltage-dependent K+ <b>current</b> (<b>IA)</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} in several types of smooth muscle cells including the pulmonary artery (PA), but {{little is known about}} the pharmacological and molecular characteristics of IA in human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (hPASMCs). We investigated IA expressed in cultured PASMCs isolated from the human main pulmonary artery, using patch-clamp techniques, reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR), quantitative real-time RT–PCR and immunocytochemical studies. With high EGTA and ATP in the pipette, the outward currents were dominated by a transient K+ <b>current</b> (<b>IA),</b> followed by a relatively small sustained outward <b>current</b> (IK). <b>IA</b> was inhibited by 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) concentration-dependently, and could be separated pharmacologically into two components by tetraethylammonium (TEA) sensitivity. A component was sensitive to TEA, and the second component was insensitive to TEA. IA was inhibited by blood depressing substrate (BDS) -II, a specific blocker of KV 3. 4 subunit, and phrixotoxin-II, a specific blocker of KV 4. 2 and 4. 3. Flecainide inhibited IA concentration-dependently, but it inhibited it preferentially in the presence of TEA (TEA-insensitive IA). Systematic screening of expression of KV genes using RT–PCR showed the definite presence of transcripts of the IA-encoding genes for KV 3. 4, KV 4. 1, KV 4. 2 and KV 4. 3 as well as the IK-encoding genes for KV 1. 1, KV 1. 5 and KV 2. 1. The real-time RT–PCR analysis showed that the relative abundance of the encoding genes of IA α-subunit and KV channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs) was KV 4. 2 >KV 3. 4 >KV 4. 3 (long) >KV 4. 1, and KChIP 3 ≫KChIP 2, respectively. The presence of KV 3. 4, KV 4. 2 and KV 4. 3 proteins was also demonstrated by immunocytochemical studies, and confirmed by immunohistochemical staining using intact human PA sections.

In particular, A-type K+ <b>currents</b> (<b>IA)</b> {{play a key}} role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the peptidic toxin Tx 3 - 1, a selective blocker of <b>IA</b> <b>currents,</b> extracted from the venom of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, on memory of mice. Administration of Tx 3 - 1 (i. c. v., 300  pmol/site) enhanced both short- and long-term memory consolidation of mice tested in the novel object recognition task. In comparison, 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP; i. c. v., 30 – 300  pmol/site), a non-selective K+ channel blocker did not alter long-term memory and caused toxic side effects such as circling, freezing and tonic–clonic seizures. Moreover, Tx 3 - 1 (i. c. v., 10 – 100  pmol/site) restored memory of Aβ 25 - 35 -injected mice, and exhibited a higher potency to improve memory of Aβ 25 - 35 -injected mice when compared to control group. These results show the effect of the selective blocker of <b>IA</b> <b>currents</b> Tx 3 - 1 in both short- and long-term memory retention and in memory impairment caused by Aβ 25 - 35, reinforcing the role of IA in physiological and pathological memory processes...|$|R

In addition, arachidonic add increased the M-current (IM), a different potassium current that does not inactivate. Neither indomethacin nor nordihydroguaiaretic acid, cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors respectively, prevented IA reduction. In contrast, nordihydroguaiaretic acid prevented IM enhancement.

The voltage-dependent outward potassium <b>currents,</b> <b>IA</b> and ICa(2 +) -K+, the inward voltage-dependent calcium current, ICa 2 + and the light-induced current, IIgt, were then described with Hodgkin-Huxley-type equations. The fast-activating and inactivating potassium <b>current,</b> <b>IA,</b> was described by the equation; IA(t) = gA(max) (ma infinity[1 -exp(-t/tau ma) ]) 3 x (ha infinity [1 -exp(-t/tau ha) ] + exp(-t/tau ha)) (Vm-EK), where the parameters ma infinity, ha infinity, tau ma, and tau ha are functions of membrane potential, Vm, and ma infinity and ha infinity are steady-state activation and inactivation parameters. Similarly, the calcium-dependent outward potassium current, ICa(2 +) -K+, was described by the equation, ICa(2 +) -K+ (t) = gc(max) (mc infinity(VC) (1 -exp[-t/tau mc (VC) ])) pc (hc infinity(VC) [1 -exp(-t/tau hc) ] + exp(-t/tau hc(VC) ]) pc(VC-EK). In high external potassium, ICa(2 +) -K+ could be measured in approximate isolation from other currents as a voltage-dependent inward tail current following a depolarizing command pulse from a holding potential of - 60 mV.
