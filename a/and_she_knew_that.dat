500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E

[...] In the opening, he discusses the conditions of the victims of the Rwandan Genocide and focuses on one of his woman patients: “There were hundreds of women, children and men brought to the hospital that day, so many that we had to lay them out on the street and even operate on some of them there. [...] The gutters around the hospital ran red with blood. [...] The woman had not just been attacked with a machete, but her entire body rationally and systematically mutilated. [...] Her ears had been cut off. [...] And her face had been so carefully disfigured that a pattern was obvious in the slashes. [...] She was one among many — living an inhuman and simply indescribable suffering. [...] We could do little more for her at the moment than stop the bleeding with a few necessary sutures. [...] We were completely overwhelmed, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> there were so many others. [...] She said to me in the clearest voice I have ever heard, 'Allez, allez…ummera, ummerasha' — 'Go, go…my friend, find and let live your courage.'" ...|$|E
