5|$|Pepsiman is {{an action}} game that {{consists}} of four stages, each divided into smaller segments, and each involving the superhero Pepsiman saving {{a person who is}} in need of a drink, such as a military man {{in the middle of a}} desert, by giving them a can of Pepsi. The stages are all based on real locations, such as San Francisco and New York City. The game is played from a third-person perspective, with Pepsiman <b>automatically</b> <b>running</b> forwards through the stage, sometimes running through people's living rooms. The player aims to dodge obstacles, such as cars, construction cranes, and people, as well as Pepsi-branded obstacles, including a Pepsi truck. The player does this by using four different moves: running, dashing, jumping, and super-jumping. The player gains points by collecting Pepsi cans.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{is a brief}} {{overview}} of what the Reporters believe to be the four basic contributions of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA or Act). First, RUPA changes the law of partnership breakups and gives greater stability to partnerships by abandoning the traditional rule that a partnership is dissolved every time a member leaves. Second, RUPA makes clear that partners are not fiduciaries among themselves in the same sense as disinterested trustees. Specifically, RUPA states that partners legitimately may pursue self-interest without <b>automatically</b> <b>running</b> afoul of their fiduciary duties. On the other hand, RUPA provides an irreducible core of fiduciary duties among partners. Third, RUPA rewrites the rules on the nature and transfer of partnership property. It adopts an entity approach for the sake of simplicity and provides for the filing of partnership statements, including statements of partnership authority, dissociation, and dissolution. Fourth, RUPA for the first time expressly authorizes the conversion and merger of partnerships and provides “safe harbor” rules for those transactions...|$|E

The meteorological station, which is located in our university campus provides information about a temperature, a humidity, a dew point, a rain, a wind speed and an atmospheric pressure. The developed tool generates a call every five minutes through GSM network, a reference sample is transmitted and finally the MOS is calculated in PESQ model. The human ear performs a time-frequency transformation and in PESQ this is modelled by a short term FFT with a Hann window.

40|$|International audienceA tool called Belief Scheduler is {{proposed}} for state sequence {{recognition in the}} Transferable Belief Model (TBM) framework. This tool makes noisy temporal belief functions smoother using a Temporal Evidential Filter (TEF). The Belief Scheduler makes belief on states smoother, separates the states (assumed to be true or false) and synchronizes {{them in order to}} infer the sequence. A criterion is also provided to assess the appropriateness between observed belief functions and a given sequence model. This criterion is based on the conflict information appearing explicitly in the TBM when combining observed belief functions with predictions. The Belief Scheduler is part of a generic architecture developed for on-line and automatic human action and activity recognition in videos of athletics taken with a moving camera.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the design of shell-type, single-phase distribution transformers to obtain the manufacturing specifications. The method is simple, efficient and accurate. By an exhaustive analysis, it is concluded that the obtained solution is the global optimum. The following constraints are imposed: excitation current, no-load losses, total losses, impedance and efficiency. The methodology of this paper requires only six input data: transformer rating, low voltage, high voltage, connection of low-voltage coil, connection of high-voltage coil, and frequency. These data are included in the transformer nameplate. In this paper, the minimization of the following four objective functions is considered: total owing cost, mass, total losses and material cost. The consideration of these four objective functions is implemented <b>automatically</b> by <b>running</b> the optimization algorithm four times without intervention of a designer. Consequently, transformer manufacturers save designman-hours and increase capacity. A design example on a 25 kVA transformer is presented for illustration.

40|$|The {{possibility}} to develop <b>automatically</b> <b>running</b> models which can capture {{some of the}} most important factors driving the urban climate would be very useful for many planning aspects. With the help of these modulated climate data, the creation of the typically used “Urban Climate Maps” (UCM) will be accelerated and facilitated. This work describes the development of a special ArcGIS software extension, along with two support databases to achieve this functionality. At the present time, lacking comparability between different UCMs and imprecise planning advices going along with the significant technical problems of manually creating conventional maps are central issues. Also inflexibility and static behaviour are reducing the maps’ practicality. From experi-ence, planning processes are formed more productively, namely to implant new planning parameters directly via the existing work surface to map the impact of the data change immediately, if pos-sible. In addition to the direct climate figures, information of other planning areas (like regional characteristics / developments etc.) have to be taken into account to create the UCM as well. Taking all these requirements into consideration, an automated calculation process of urban climate impact parameters will serve to increase the creation of homogenous UCMs efficiently...|$|E
40|$|Research in {{automated}} {{planning is}} {{getting more and more}} focused on empirical evaluation. Likewise the need for methodologies and benchmarks to build solid evaluations of planners is increasing. In 1998 the planning community made a move to address this need and initiated the Interna-tional Planning Competition – or IPC for short. This com-petition has typically been conducted every two years {{in the context of the}} International Conference on Automated Plan-ning and Scheduling (ICAPS) and tries to define standard metrics and benchmarks to reliably evaluate planners. In the sixth edition of the competition, IPC 2008, there was an at-tempt to automate the evaluation of all entries in the compe-tition which was imitated to a large extent and extended in several ways in the seventh edition, IPC 2011. As a result, a software for <b>automatically</b> <b>running</b> planning experiments and inspecting the results is available, encouraging researchers to use it for their own research interests. The software allows researchers to reproduce and inspect the results of IPC 2011, but also to generate and analyze new experiments with pri-vate sets of planners and problems. In this paper we provide a gentle introduction to this software and examine the main difficulties, both from a scientific and engineering point of view, in assessing the performance of automated planners...|$|E
40|$|Variable {{temperature}} experiments have, in the past, {{involved a}} large amount of operator input and effort. As a result many interesting results may have been missed or found only as a result of serendipity. In Southampton this situation has been addressed by the development of in-house software to perform such variable temperature experiments in a fully automated manner. The code is written in PYTHON and utilises the ability of a Kappa CCD to talk to a cryostream, and the accessibility of the collect [1] data collection modules, classes and functions. The user is able to select the start and end temperatures (going either up or down), the ramp step and rate and a wait time to allow the cryostream to stabilise. Thus it is possible to easily study any crystalline sample over a range of temperatures (80 - 500 K) with no human interaction. The types of experiment that can be carried out include thermal dehydration of compounds such as zeolites, parametric studies to look for effects like negative thermal expansion, phase transition location, and investigation of temperature dependant ion migration. Many of these utilise the capability of the cryostream plus to go up in temperature above ambient, as well as down. As an example a phase transitions can be located by <b>automatically</b> <b>running</b> a series of unit cell determinations over a selected range of temperatures. Once located it can be studied in more detail in full data collection mode via either a preset or calculated strategy.
