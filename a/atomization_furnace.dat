Comparative response was measured in the same source using the AAS mode of operation. Radiative power losses from the plasma due to excitation of the EIE matrix species and probable alteration of the electron energy distribution function (due to EIE ionization and collisional dissociation of molecules) appear to be the major sources of interference.

With a 30 W forward power plasma, double peaks are observed in atomic emission during atomization of Cd, Pb, Ag, Mn, Cu, Fe and Co, reflecting early release of analyte from both the wall (primary site of deposition) and, subsequently, the radiationally-heated centre electrode (secondary release). With increased r. f. power, there is a corresponding early shift in all emission transients, reflecting plasma induced heating of both the tube wall and the centre electrode.

40|$|The {{effect of}} bias voltage and the {{presence}} of easily-ionized elements (EIEs) on the spatial distribution of excited-state atoms and ions of Cu, Ag, Cs and Ca in <b>furnace</b> <b>atomization</b> plasma emission spectrometry is presented. The dc bias of the centre electrode significantly affects the spatial distribution of He I, Cu I, Ag I, Cs I, and Ca II emission in the absence of EIEs. A reasonably uniform distribution of excited-state analyte atoms over the central cross-section of the tube occurs when the centre electrode is self-biased during the course of an atomization transient. A depleted area of Cs I emission around the centre electrode coupled with enhanced Ca II emission in the same region reveals that ionization of analytes is most pronounced in this region. With positive dc bias, concentric rings of enhanced emission occur between the centre electrode and the tube wall for analyte atoms and the He I plasma gas, although the overall breadth of analyte emission distribution is decreased. With NaCl, NaNO 3 and CsCl serving as EIEs, analyte emission from Ag I, Cu I and Ca II in the region between the centre electrode and the tube wall is strongly suppressed with self-bias. The degree of the suppression depends on the extent of vapour cloud overlap between analyte and EIE. In general, equimolar amounts of NaNO 3 and CsCl suppress analyte emission similarly and both produce a greater suppression than NaCl. Equal amounts of Fe, added as an interfering matrix, produces a suppression of analyte emission similar to that of EIEs, suggesting that the primary cause of suppression is the loss of energy from the plasma (as photons) due to excitation and ionization of matrix vapour. Control of the dc bias enhances the radial distribution of excited analyte atoms in the presence of EIEs and Fe, but only at low (2 ̆ 2642 5 g) interferent loadings.

La localisation des métaux est évaluée à l'aide du schéma d'extractions sélectives préconisé par Legret et al. (1988). Les résultats ont montré que l'horizon superficiel renferme des teneurs en métaux très élevées. Parmi les métaux étudiés, le Cr s'avère retenu essentiellement dans la phase résiduelle mais il se présente aussi sous des formes plus mobiles. Le Cu est principalement associé avec la phase résiduelle et organique. Le Pb est lié aux phases acido-soluble et réductible. De ce fait, l'épandage des eaux usées de tanneries, sans aucun traitement préalable, peut être une source de contamination des sols et des eaux souterraines, notamment pour le Cr. In Morocco, {{the town}} of Marrakesh, as {{in other areas of}} the country, is subject to multiple daily aggressions generated by industrial pollution, in particular from tanneries. The tannery waste water is discharged directly into the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems without any preliminary processing. In order to evaluate the danger that can be generated by tannery effluents in the receiving ecosystems, and to study the ecotoxicological and environmental impact resulting from that chemical treatment of these effluents, we determined, before and after treatment, the inhibitory effect of the two most polluted effluents originating from manufactured leather: liming-deliming and chromium tanning. The purpose of our investigation was thus to evaluate the acute toxicity of the chromium tanning and epilage-coat waste waters before and after chemical treatment. The invertebrate Daphnia pulex was used for the toxicity test and the toxicity due to these industrial waste waters was evaluated by regression analysis. The processing carried out on the chromium tanning waste water consisted of precipitation with sodium carbonate at different pH values. The treatment of liming-deliming wastewaters consisted of an elimination and recovery of the sulphide compounds without carrying out their degradation. The chromium level was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry with graphite <b>furnace</b> <b>atomization.</b> The results of the toxicity test showed that the investigated chromium tanning and liming-deliming effluents presented were toxic, with respective IC 50 - 24 h values of 0. 15 and 3. 36 (expressed as dilution ratios). This toxicity could be explained by high levels of chromium, sulphides and organic matter in these waste waters. It is however difficult to correlate the IC 50 values obtained with those of the physical-chemical parameters. The tested effluents are very complex matrices. On the other hand, we noticed a notable difference between these two effluents. The mineral tanning effluent is contaminated with chromium and organic matter, whereas the second is especially rich in organic matter and sulphide. The total chromium concentration corresponding to the IC 50 - 24 h value of the raw chromium tanning effluent is lower than that which would be expected on the basis on the known toxicity of K 2 Cr 2 O 7, showing the toxicity of raw chromium waste waters is due not only to chromium, but also to other chemicals used during the manufacturing process of leather. After processing by chemical precipitation, the IC 50 - 24 h values increased from 0. 15 to 26. 6 and from 3. 36 to 11. 1 respectively, for the chromium tanning and the epilage-coat effluents. Consequently, these treated sewages can be classified as low toxicity wastes. The comparison of the results is very difficult considering that the test conditions and the physicochemical and heavy metal characteristics of the effluents vary enormously over time, without forgetting the physicochemical composition of the experimental solution used by standard OECD (fresh water) and the standard ISO (synthetic water). From where necessity to vary tests for determining well the degree of an effluent toxicity which the effects appear differently at various levels trophic. The diminution observed in the toxicity of the effluents is linked to a reduction of suspended matter (95 %), COD (55 %), Cr (90 %) and sulphides (50 %). Hence, this treatment presents at least two advantages. The first is environmental as just mentioned. The second is economic since chromium can be recycled for reuse in leather tanning. The results suggest that the recovered chromium is similar to commercial tanning chromium. These results also show that the fixing of chromium does not depend on the nature of the treated skin. In fact, a technical and economic analysis showed that proposed treatment can be economically beneficial (3112, 5 $ per 1000 tons of skins) ...|$|R

A quantificaÃÂÃÂo de metais em mel ainda ÃÂ considerada um desafio analÃÂtico, devido ÃÂ complexidade da matriz. Muitos mÃÂtodos analÃÂticos desenvolvidos envolvem uma etapa de prÃÂ-tratamento da amostra antes da quantificaÃÂÃÂo dos metais, podendo causar contaminaÃÂÃÂo da amostra ou perda do analito. Neste estudo foram estabelecidas bases analÃÂticas para a determinaÃÂÃÂo direta de espÃÂcies metÃÂlicas em amostras de mel empregando a espectrometria de absorÃÂÃÂo atÃÂmica. Um protocolo analÃÂtico foi desenvolvido e implantado para a determinaÃÂÃÂo de Pb, Cd e Cr em amostras de mel de forma direta, ou seja, sem etapa de prÃÂ-tratamento, empregando a Espectrometria de AbsorÃÂÃÂo AtÃÂmica com AtomizaÃÂÃÂo EletrotÃÂrmica em Forno de Grafite. Para tal, suspensÃÂes aquosas de mel foram preparadas e inseridas diretamente no forno de grafite. A adiÃÂÃÂo de ÃÂcido nÃÂtrico e perÃÂxido de hidrogÃÂnio nas suspensÃÂes aquosas de mel possibilitaram a eliminaÃÂÃÂo da matriz orgÃÂnica da amostra durante a etapa de pirÃÂlise do programa de aquecimento do GF AAS. Os programas de aquecimentos do forno de grafite foram otimizados para cada elemento. A necessidade do uso de modificadores quÃÂmicos, tais como PalÃÂdio, dihidrogenofosfato de amÃÂnio e nitrato de magnÃÂsio foi avaliada. Na determinaÃÂÃÂo de cÃÂdmio foi necessÃÂrio empregar o modificador {{universal}} (Pd-Mg) a fim de evitar perdas do elemento durante as etapas de aquecimento do forno de grafite. As caracterÃÂsticas analÃÂticas dos mÃÂtodos foram avaliados atravÃÂs dos testes de calibraÃÂÃÂo, avaliaÃÂÃÂo da sensibilidade, da precisÃÂo e exatidÃÂo. Curvas analÃÂticas em meio aquoso foram empregadas nas determinaÃÂÃÂes de Pb e Cr, e em meio de frutose nas quantificaÃÂÃÂes de Cd em amostras de mel. Os limites de quantificaÃÂÃÂo foram baixos com valores de 2, 0; 5, 4 e 9, 4 ng g- 1 para Cd, Pb e Cr, respectivamente. As estimativas de desvio padrÃÂo relativo foram inferiores a 10 % nos testes de repetibilidade e precisÃÂo intermediÃÂria. As recuperaÃÂÃÂes obtidas nos testes de exatidÃÂo foram adequadas e variaram entre 90 % e 105 % para os trÃÂs elementos. Assim, apÃÂs a validaÃÂÃÂo dos mÃÂtodos desenvolvidos realizou-se a aplicaÃÂÃÂo da metodologia analÃÂtica em 52 amostras de mel provenientes de diferentes regiÃÂes do Estado do ParanÃÂ. Os teores de Pb, Cd e Cr variaram entre > 2, 0 ng g- 1 atÃÂ 413 ng g- 1 e estÃÂo concordantes com a literatura. De modo geral, nota-se que a concentraÃÂÃÂo dos elementos seguiu a seguinte ordem: Pb > Cr > Cd, com as concentraÃÂÃÂes de Pb na faixa entre 86 - 413 ng g- 1; para Cr 46 - 132 ng g- 1 e 2, 0 - 16, 3 ng g- 1 para Cd, respectivamente. Uma ferramenta quimiomÃÂtrica foi aplicada para avaliar os dados gerados para amostras de mel do Estado do ParanÃÂ. AtravÃÂs da AnÃÂlise de Componentes Principais (PCA) observa-se que as amostras de mel obtidas na regiÃÂo Centro-Sul e Sudeste apresentam teores similares de Pb e Cd, sendo que o teor mais elevado de Pb foi obtido na amostra de CandÃÂi (3) e de Cd na amostra de Rio Piquiri (4). Isso pode estar relacionado com o fato destas localidades terem sua economia baseada na agricultura. A presenÃÂa destes metais em agrotÃÂxicos e fertilizantes e tambÃÂm na atmosfera, devido a partÃÂculas suspensas provenientes da emissÃÂo de fumaÃÂa de veÃÂculos, faz com que seus teores aumentem nessas regiÃÂes. JÃÂ as amostras das regiÃÂes Oeste, Sudoeste, Noroeste e Metropolitana apresentaram teores similares de Cr. Portanto, com a PCA, foi possÃÂvel notar que as amostras de mel do ParanÃÂ se classificaram de acordo com sua regiÃÂo geogrÃÂfica e teores dos elementos traÃÂo. Com base em cÃÂlculos de ingestÃÂo diÃÂria de mel, observou-se que os mÃÂis paranaenses tambÃÂm apresentaram seguranÃÂa alimentar em relaÃÂÃÂo ao teor de Pb, Cd e Cr ingeridos na alimentaÃÂÃÂo humana atravÃÂs do consumo deste produto. In {{the honey}} production, Apis melÃÂfera honeybees roam vast areas and it {{come into contact}} with various environmental compartments. In this process, they can accumulate contaminants, especially metal species, and honey can act as an indicator of environmental quality, reflecting the concentrations found in the environment. The quantification of metals in honey is still considered an analytical challenge due to the complexity of the matrix. Many analytical methods developed involve a step of pretreatment of the sample prior to quantification of the metals that may cause sample contamination or loss of analyte. In this study were established analytical basis for the direct determination of metal species in the honey samples using atomic absorption spectrometry. An analytical protocol was developed and implemented for the determination of Pb, Cd and Cr in honey samples directly, i. e., without pretreatment step, using the Atomic Absorption Spectrometry with Electrothermal <b>Atomization</b> in Graphite <b>Furnace.</b> For this purpose, aqueous suspensions of honey were prepared and inserted directly into the graphite furnace. Addition of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide in aqueous suspensions of honey possible the elimination of the organic matrix of the sample during the pyrolysis step of heating program of GF AAS. The programs of the heating graphite furnace were optimized for each element. The need to use chemical modifiers such as palladium, ammonium dihydrogenphosphate and magnesium nitrate was evaluated. In the determination of cadmium was necessary to employ the universal modifier (Pd-Mg) in order to avoid losses of the element through the steps of heating the graphite furnace. The analytical characteristics of the methods were evaluated through calibration tests, evaluation of sensitivity, precision and accuracy. Aqueous analytical curves were used for determinations of Pb and Cr, and in middle of fructose in the quantification of Cd in honey samples. The quantification limits were low with values of 2. 0, 5. 4 and 9. 4 ng g- 1 for Cd, Pb and Cr, respectively. Estimates of relative standard deviation was below 10 % in tests of repeatability and intermediate precision. The recoveries obtained in the accuracy tests were adequate and ranged between 90 % and 105 % for the three elements. So, after validation of the developed methods was performed applying the analytical methodology in 52 honey samples from different regions of the State of ParanÃÂ. The levels of Pb, Cd and Cr ranged from > 2. 0 ng g- 1 to 413 ng g- 1 and are consistent with the literature. In general, it is noted that the concentration of elements followed the order: Pb > Cr > Cd, Pb with concentrations in the range of 86 - 413 ng g- 1, and for Cr 46 - 132 ng g- 1 and 2. 0 - 16. 3 ng g- 1 to Cd, respectively. A chemometric tool was applied to evaluate data generated for honey samples of ParanÃÂ. Through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was observed that the honey samples obtained in the Center-South and Southeast regions have similar contents of Pb and Cd, and the higher content of Pb was obtained in the sample from CandÃÂi (3) and Cd in the sample from Rio Piquiri (4). This {{may be related to the}} fact that these places have their economy based on agriculture. The presence of these metals in pesticides and fertilizers and also in the atmosphere, because the particulate matter from the smoke emission vehicle, causes his levels are higher in these regions. The samples of the regions West, Southwest, Northwest and Metropolitan had similar contents of Cr. Therefore, with the PCA, it was possible to note that the honey samples from ParanÃÂ are qualified according to their geographical region and levels of trace elements. Based on calculations of daily ingestion of honey, it was observed that the honeys from ParanÃÂ also present food safety in relation to the content of Pb, Cd and Cr in foods ingested by consumption of this product...|$|R
