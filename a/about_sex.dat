The album was released simultaneously with Madonna's first book publication, Sex, a coffee table book containing explicit photographs featuring the singer. It marked Madonna's first release under her own multimedia entertainment company, Maverick. Erotica is a concept album <b>about</b> <b>sex</b> and romance, incorporating her alter ego named Mistress Dita, inspired by actress Dita Parlo. Some songs also take on a more confessional tone, influenced {{by the loss of}} Madonna's two close friends to AIDS.|$|E

40|$|Opinions <b>about</b> premarital <b>sex</b> {{have been}} {{attributed}} to several social factors. Religiosity is thought to be one influence on peoples’ sexual behavior. Many studies confirm that religiosity reduces the number of sexual acts outside of marriage, but there is a scarcity of studies that examine the social ideology surrounding sexual acts. In an effort to fill the gap in explaining beliefs <b>about</b> premarital <b>sex,</b> the main objective of the current research is to investigate the extent to which religiosity affects views <b>about</b> premarital <b>sex.</b> Using the General Social Survey datasets for 1988, 1998, and 2008, the present paper examines the effects of religiosity and other selected control factors on the opinions of ordinary Americans <b>about</b> premarital <b>sex.</b> The results of the regression analysis indicate that religiosity {{is the single most important}} factor that determines one’s beliefs <b>about</b> premarital <b>sex.</b> The effects of control variables, such as age, sex, race, social class, marital status, and education were found to be inconsistent over time, and did not seem to mediate the effects of religiosity on the beliefs about premarital se...|$|R

5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes <b>about</b> <b>sex.</b> As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E
5|$|Counseling <b>about</b> <b>sex</b> and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part}} of most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E
5|$|The Bengal slow loris {{has a small}} {{swelling}} on the {{ventral side}} of its elbow called the brachial gland, which secretes a pungent, clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb. The oil has been analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, {{and it has been}} shown that almost half of the several dozen volatile or semi-volatile chemicals present do not occur in the closely related pygmy slow loris. The most predominant component was the phenolic compound m-cresol. The authors of the study suggest that the chemically complex oils may help the lorises communicate with each other, allowing them to transmit by scent information <b>about</b> <b>sex,</b> age, health and nutritional status, and dominance.|$|E

5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth <b>about</b> <b>Sex,</b> a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} birth-control clinic {{was established}} in Britain in 1921 by Marie Stopes working with the Malthusian League. The clinic, run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors, offered women's birth-control advice and taught them {{the use of a}} cervical cap. Her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms. In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League, which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. In 1924 the Society for the Provision of Birth Control Clinics was founded to campaign for municipal clinics; this led to the opening of a second clinic in Greengate, Salford in 1926. Throughout the 1920s, Stopes and other feminist pioneers, including Dora Russell and Stella Browne, {{played a major role in}} breaking down taboos <b>about</b> <b>sex.</b> In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control and abortion into the political sphere – three months later, the Ministry of Health, in the United Kingdom, allowed local authorities to give birth-control advice in welfare centres.|$|E
