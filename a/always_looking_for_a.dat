5|$|Being {{a part of}} Best's family meant Mona was accorded respect on Merseyside, which {{included}} meeting well-known sports personalities {{of the time and}} receiving preferential treatment when booking a table in a restaurant, or a seat in the theatre. The Bests lived for a short time at the Best family's large home in West Derby, which was called Ellerslie, but Mona fell out with John Best's sister, Edna, who resented her brother's choice of wife. The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool (above Ma Edgerton's public house) but Mona was <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large house—as she had been used to in India—instead of a smaller semi-detached house, which were prevalent in the area. After moving to a three-bedroom house in Princess Drive, Mona persuaded her parents, Thomas and Mary Shaw, to leave India and live with them in Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Earp was {{a lifelong}} gambler and was <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{quick way to}} make money. After leaving Tombstone, Earp went to San Francisco, where he reunited with Josephine Earp. She became his common-law wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining {{interests}} and a saloon. They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons–Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many {{to believe that he}} fixed the fight. They moved briefly to Yuma, Arizona, before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. In partnership with Charlie Hoxie, they opened a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $80,000 (about $2 million in 2017 dollars). Returning to the lower 48, they opened another saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles. Earp made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood and tried to get his story told. He was portrayed in film only once before he died, and very briefly, in the 1923 film Wild Bill Hickok.|$|E
500|$|Former Scotland international, and McLean's {{teammate}} at St Mirren, Gary Teale has compared him to Barry Ferguson. Teale {{said that}} McLean had shown incredible maturity {{at such a}} young age and that from their first training session together he could see McLean's talent. McLean has an excellent first touch and is also very composed and assured on the ball. McLean also has very high energy, work rate and athleticism which enable him to make lots of attacking runs. McLean's manager at St Mirren, Danny Lennon, said that he thought McLean was an excellent passer and that he could [...] "open a tin of beans" [...] with his left foot and was also decent with his right. Lennon also said that McLean was a rare type of Scottish player because he was <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 'slide-rule' pass and he was actually capable of delivering them.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Tenacious D {{started their}} second {{nationwide}} concert tour, performing at larger venues, {{many of which}} sold out. Until 2006, Tenacious D usually performed only with acoustic guitars, rarely with a full backing band. The band has also staged two international concert tours as well as numerous domestic tours, though they have rarely played in non-English speaking countries. Black says this is because foreign concerts are [...] "a little funky" [...] because [...] "the subtleties do get lost in translation". In addition, he comments on the angst they experience before concerts saying: [...] "We're <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> loophole. Pretty much every concert we've ever done, we're {{trying to find a}} way to cancel the show at the last minute." [...] The band permits live recording during concerts if the venue allows recording. Many of these recordings have been recorded and released through Live Music Archive and are available for free digital download.|$|E
500|$|McConaughey and Harrelson {{were among}} a small pool of actors {{considered}} suitable candidates for top billing. Producers contracted McConaughey, {{who had recently}} finished filming Killer Joe (2011), well before True Detective was greenlit by HBO. Pizzolatto, impressed with the actor's performance in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), originally assigned him the role of Martin Hart, but McConaughey offered [...] "a really compelling argument" [...] for portraying Rustin [...] "Rust" [...] Cohle. When asked about his decision to switch parts in a Variety interview, McConaughey replied: [...] "I wanted to get in that dude’s head. The obsession, the island of a man—I’m <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> guy who monologues. It’s something really important as I feel I’m going into my better work." [...] To prepare, the actor studied his character through what he described the [...] "Four Stages of Rustin Cohle", a 450-page document he created detailing Rustin's evolution {{over the course of}} the story.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the series}} is an anthology, each season has a {{self-contained}} narrative, following a disparate set of characters in various settings. Pizzolatto began contemplating the lead roles while he was pitching the series to networks in early 2012. True Detective anthology format only required actors to commit to a single season, so Pizzolatto was able to attract film stars who normally avoid television series because of their busy schedules. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey were among the actors Pizzolatto considered for star billing. McConaughey, who had recently finished filming Killer Joe (2011), was contracted well before HBO commissioned the season. Impressed with his performance in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), Pizzolatto at first assigned him to play Hart, but McConaughey convinced him {{to give him the}} part of Cohle. When asked in a Variety interview about his decision to switch parts, the actor replied, [...] "I wanted to get in that dude's head. The obsession, the island of a man—I'm <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> guy who monologues. It's something really important as I feel I'm going into my better work."

500|$|Best's {{family lived}} {{for a short time}} at the family home, [...] "Ellerslie" [...] in West Derby, until Best's mother fell out with her sister-in-law, Edna, who resented her brother's choice of wife. The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool, but Mona Best was <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large house—as she had been used to in India—instead of a smaller semi-detached house, which were {{prevalent}} in the area. After moving to 17 Queenscourt Road in 1948, where the Bests lived for nine years, Rory Best saw a large Victorian house for sale at 8 Hayman's Green in 1957 and told Mona about it. The Best family claim that Mona then pawned all her jewellery and placed a bet on Never Say Die, a horse that was ridden by Lester Piggott in the 1954 Epsom Derby; it won at 33–1 and she used her winnings to buy the house in 1957. The house had previously been owned by the West Derby Conservative Club and was unlike many other family houses in Liverpool as the house (built around 1860) was set back from the road, had 15 bedrooms and an acre of land. All the rooms were painted dark green or brown and the garden was totally overgrown. Mona later opened The Casbah Coffee Club in its large cellar. The idea for the club first came from Best, as he asked his mother for somewhere his friends could meet and listen to the popular music of the day.|$|E

Buckley said that many mistakenly questioned Tatangelo's motives: [...] "Very few people really understood him or his motives. They were <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> secondary motive or for something other than what he wasn't saying, but Aldo didn't have ulterior motives, none whatsoever." [...] Buckley said that Tatangelo's management style was not that of [...] "micromanager" [...] but of a [...] "task manager" [...] who did not [...] "tolerate laziness".|$|E
2500|$|Stinkoman 20X6 (abbreviated to 20X6; {{pronounced}} [...] "twenty exty-six"), {{a parody}} of the Mega Man and EarthBound games' [...] "year 200X", originated from Strong Bad Email #57, japanese cartoon, an email asking Strong Bad what he would look like {{if he were in}} a Japanese anime. The main character, Stinkoman, is an anime version of Strong Bad with blue hair, a shiny body and robot boots. He is <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fight, asking various characters he interacts with to engage him in a [...] "challenge" [...] ("Are you asking for a challenge?"). The characters in 20X6 cartoons each have a counterpart in the Homestar Runner universe, and their features are {{a parody of}} anime and Japanese video game stereotypes. The game of the same name was heavily based on the Mega Man series, particularly the first 6 levels. Stinkoman's name comes from a conversation Homestar Runner and Strong Bad had while marooned on a desert island. Strong Bad created Stinkoman by applying several anime stereotypes (head shaped like a little bean, big shiny eyes, shiny body, mouth that is tiny when closed and huge when opened, blue hair, and robot boots) to his own appearance.|$|E

She was written as a sympathetic character; with Doug Petrie claiming [...] "I connected with Faith early on. I love that character. She's totally tragic." [...] According to Petrie, [...] "The whole key to Faith is that she's in pain. If you took that away, {{she would be a}} monster. But she's so lonely and so desperate, and all of her toughness comes out of trying to cover that. That's what real monsters are made of. No one thinks they're really a monster." [...] Petrie claims Faith's main motivation is to find a family and friends; she sees treacherous Watcher Gwendolyn Post as the mother she never had, the Scooby Gang as the friends she never had, and the Mayor as the father she never had. [...] "So she's <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> family and always coming up short and making these horrible choices, and it drove her insane" [...] says Petrie. [...] "Plus I think she was missing a couple of screws to begin with. 'If you don't love me, you will fear me,' is kind of her m.o. She's not a stable girl, but a fun one." [...] Petrie describes the character's name as [...] "wildly ironic", due to her cynical nature. According to Petrie, [...] "She's the most faithless character we've got. She doesn't trust herself or anyone around her. We try to do that a lot with our monsters. It's much more fun {{if you look at it}} from their point of view." ...|$|E

60|$|Milton {{is not a}} picturesque, but a musical, poet; {{although}} he has this merit that the object chosen by him for any particular foreground always remains prominent to the end, enriched, but not incumbered, by the opulence of descriptive details furnished by an exhaustless imagination. I wish the Paradise Lost were more carefully read and studied than I can see any ground for believing it is, especially those parts which, from the habit of <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> story in poetry, are scarcely read at all,--as for example, Adam's vision of future events in the 11th and 12th books. No one can rise from the perusal of this immortal poem without {{a deep sense of}} the grandeur and the purity of Milton's soul, or without feeling how susceptible of domestic enjoyments he really was, notwithstanding the discomforts which actually resulted from an apparently unhappy choice in marriage. He was, as every truly great poet has ever been, a good man; but finding it impossible to realize his own aspirations, either in religion, or politics, or society, he gave up his heart to the living spirit and light within him, and avenged himself on the world by enriching it with this record of his own transcendant ideal.|$|E
