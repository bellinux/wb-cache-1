5|$|Boniface of Savoy (c. 1217– 18 July 1270) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Belley in France and Archbishop of Canterbury in England. He {{was the son}} of Thomas, Count of Savoy, and owed his initial ecclesiastical posts to his father. Other members of his family were also clergymen, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> succeeded his father as count. One niece was married to King Henry III of England and another was married to King Louis IX of France. It was Henry who secured Boniface's {{election}} as Archbishop, and throughout his tenure of that office he spent much time on the continent. He clashed with his bishops, with his nephew-by-marriage, and with the papacy, but managed to eliminate the archiepiscopal debt which he had inherited on taking office. During Simon de Montfort's struggle with King Henry, Boniface initially helped Montfort's cause, but later supported the king. After his death in Savoy, his tomb became the object of a cult, and he was eventually beatified in 1839.|$|E

In 1938, {{at the age of}} 17, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, intending to study mathematics, but became interested in physics, particularly particle physics, then emerging as an exciting new field. This led him to transfer to the West Lafayette, Indiana, campus of Purdue University, which graduated him in 1942 with a bachelor of Science degree. He then commenced work on his doctorate, assisting Marshall Holloway with the cyclotrons. In 1944, while still a graduate student, he joined Otto Frisch's Critical Assembly Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory of the Manhattan Project.|$|E
