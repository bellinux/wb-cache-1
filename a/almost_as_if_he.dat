And I will never, ever forget how he stopped <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} impacts To Kill a Mockingbird has had is Atticus Finch's model of integrity for the legal profession. As scholar Alice Petry explains, [...] "Atticus {{has become something of a}} folk hero in legal circles and is treated <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were an actual person." [...] Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center cites Atticus Finch as the reason he became a lawyer, and Richard Matsch, the federal judge who presided over the Timothy McVeigh trial, counts Atticus as a major judicial influence. One law professor at the University of Notre Dame stated that the most influential textbook he taught from was To Kill a Mockingbird, and an article in the Michigan Law Review claims, [...] "No real-life lawyer has done more for the self-image or public perception of the legal profession," [...] before questioning whether [...] "Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun".|$|E
500|$|Film writer Paul Simpson notes {{how closely}} Steiger {{prepared}} for his roles, {{and how he}} [...] "effortlessly" [...] recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini, in a [...] "compelling take on an enigmatic figure". Judith Crist of New York Magazine, reviewing Duck, You Sucker!, commented that Steiger was [...] "totally without mannerisms, always with manner", and noted that his [...] "silences are stunningly effective". Roger Ebert later echoed this statement, concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms, writing, [...] "When he gets a character worth playing with, he creates it new from the bottom up, out of whole cloth. I don't know how he does it. It's <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> gets inside {{the skin of the}} guy he's playing and starts being that person for a while". Steiger said: [...] "I always tried to do things different. If I got a role which was similar to another I'd try to do it a little different." [...] His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors, including Robert De Niro, who used Steiger's portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in The Untouchables (1987). Elvis Presley was highly impressed with Steiger's [...] "powerful and wrenching performance" [...] in The Pawnbroker.|$|E
5000|$|Cissy Strut is a {{compilation}} album of thirteen songs released by Island Records in 1974. All songs were originally released by Josie Records on The Meters' first three albums from 1969 to 1970. Robert Christgau {{had a positive}} review and called Ziggy Modeliste's drumming [...] "The secret" [...] adding [...] "it's <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> the lead." ...|$|R

500|$|From November 2008 to January 2009, Morrissey {{returned}} to the theatre {{for the first time}} in nine years to appear in the Almeida Theatre's British premiere of Neil LaBute's In a Dark Dark House. He played Terry, one of two brothers who had been abused as a child, opposite Steven Mackintosh and Kira Sternbach. He took the role because he liked LaBute's previous play, The Mercy Seat (2002). After accepting the part, he researched the character by reading case studies of adults who were abused when they were children. He learned about how they coped with the shame of their abuse, and incorporated those feelings into his acting. He was also able to consult LaBute during rehearsals but avoided asking him exactly how to play Terry. In a Daily Telegraph review that criticised the play, Charles Spencer wrote that Morrissey's was the best performance [...] "as the blue-collar older brother who reveals extraordinary depths of grief, damage and forgiveness that finally light up this dark, flawed play." [...] Benedict Nightingale of The Times initially believed that Morrissey's acting was [...] "a bit stiff, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was waiting for his cues rather than reacting instantaneously to their content" [...] but found him more impressive as the play went on.|$|E

2500|$|The first quatrain of the sonnet {{lets the}} reader know the poet has been [...] "infected", in a sense, by his mistress. Though {{the idea of}} being [...] "love-sick" [...] has been often {{idealized}} and romanticized in modern culture, the way the poet describes his lustfulness and want leads to a more dark reading, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is a host to some sort of sickly desired parasite feeding on his sense and reason. The poet begins the sonnet by linking and treating love and disease as parallel and intricately linked concepts. The poet's mistress has planted a sickly fever within the poet, being a type of bodily love and desire, which is causing an illness within him. His love/lust and wantonness is weakening him to the point where his lust has perhaps taken on its own sort of force and being, much as a fever does, and is now occupying a space in his body. There also appears a never ending cycle, within the first two lines. Carl Atkins points out that , [...] "In this author longing still For that which longer nurseth the disease' is not idle wordplay, but suggests the patient's sense that this condition is never going to end". It is also {{important to note that the}} idea that the poet would [...] "feed" [...] his fever would have been quite contrary in Elizabethan England, as the going knowledge at the time was to never feed a fever, based on the Four Humours medical belief. The common idiom and medical belief of the times was to [...] "feed a cold, starve a fever".|$|E

2500|$|Modeliste's {{work has}} been influential. His {{signature}} drumming style has amassed a large following in the drumming community, in which Modeliste occasionally gives master classes. Some of his best known grooves include [...] "Cissy Strut" [...] and [...] "Look-Ka Py-Py". In reviewing a compilation album of The Meters' early works, music critic Robert Christgau called Modeliste's drumming [...] "the secret" [...] adding [...] "it's <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> the lead". In 2016 he was listed as the 18th best drummer of all time by the Rolling Stone magazine. In describing his drumming style, in 2008 Modeliste said, [...] "It's just a collage of all the drummers that I heard play in my lifetime from [...]" ...|$|R
