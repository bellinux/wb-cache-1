500|$|It {{was decided}} {{the effects of}} kryptonite {{poisoning}} on Clark, [...] "Clark time", {{and the appearance of}} kryptonite when in the proximity of Clark would need to be illustrated in a way the audience could understand if they were not familiar with the character. Gough and Millar, <b>after</b> <b>doing</b> <b>some</b> research, learned the female audience was not aware of what was happening when Clark was exposed to kryptonite. Beginning with [...] "Metamorphosis", whenever Clark was exposed to kryptonite, his veins would rise up and develop a green hue to illustrate the effect it was having. Close-up shots of Clark's hand were used for these scenes, and it was all created with digital animation. Gough and Millar developed the idea that kryptonite would only glow when it was around Clark, as it was meant to demonstrate the draining of his powers. [...] "Clark time", the same idea behind bullet time, was created because previous incarnations had not explained the idea of what the world appears like to Clark when he is using his powers. The first instance of [...] "Clark time" [...] was used in the [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] scene where Greg Arkin attacks Clark and Jonathan in their barn. Jonathan is pushed over a banister and falls in the direction of some dangerous farm equipment. The effect involved slowing time down for everything except Clark, who would be moving at normal pace. When tackling Clark's emerging power of X-ray vision, Gough and Millar {{wanted to be able to}} see skeletons and bones, as opposed to previous incarnations that treated the ability like [...] "see-through" [...] vision.

40|$|Sickle is the {{agriculture}} traditional tools which made from hardness steel that usually used to cut grass, twig, clump, etc. In Yogyakarta many farmers still use sickle {{to cut the}} grass manually. This conventional sickle is made by small industry. The weakness of the conventional sickle is on the form {{and the size of}} handle. The form and the size of handle is different each other, because the form and the size of handle is measured based on hand of blacksmith. During the survey was found the problem on the existing design of sickle handle. The conventional sickle handle tends to make deflection on the user hand. <b>After</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> analyses is need to be developed the new design of sickle handle. The result of this research is a new design of sickle handle which can reduce or eliminate the deflection on hand. The dimension of sickle handle is adjusted based on the anthropometry data which are measured from the farmer. So the new design of sickle handle can make the farmer work more comfortable. ...|$|R
