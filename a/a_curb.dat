5|$|On the October 13 {{episode of}} Raw, Orton asked The Authority {{to face the}} loser of John Cena and Dean Ambrose's No Holds Barred Contract on a Pole match. Ambrose won the match, setting up a Hell in a Cell match between Orton and Cena. On the Raw before the event, Triple H {{revealed}} that the winner would receive a future WWE World Heavyweight Championship match against Brock Lesnar. Later in {{the night in a}} 3-on-2 handicap street fight which pitted Orton, Kane, and Seth Rollins against Cena and Ambrose, Orton picked up the win but was immediately attacked by Rollins with <b>a</b> <b>Curb</b> Stomp. At Hell in a Cell, Cena defeated Orton. The following night on Raw, Orton attacked Rollins with an RKO, thus defying The Authority for not controlling Rollins the previous week and beginning a face turn {{for the first time since}} 2013. On the November 3 Raw, after increasing frustration, Orton attacked Rollins during his Intercontinental Championship against Dolph Ziggler, causing Rollins to win by disqualification, and demanded a match with Rollins to settle their dispute, which Triple H granted in order to keep Orton on their side. Rollins won, and Orton completed his face turn by attacking The Authority before being attacked by The Authority, which ended with Rollins executing <b>a</b> <b>Curb</b> Stomp onto the steel steps on Orton. He was then carried on a stretcher after he sustained a scripted injury so he could start filming The Condemned 2: Desert Prey.|$|E
5|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} came from the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned {{in the general population}} since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law {{less than a year later}} amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a Companhia Correcional (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as <b>a</b> <b>curb</b> on the practice, as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the Companhia Correcional but not have any change in their daily routines.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{undesirable}} consequences {{when using}} <b>a</b> very tight <b>curb</b> chain. First, the bit immediately exerts curb pressure and increased {{pressure on the}} bars as soon as pressure {{is applied to the}} reins. Therefore, <b>a</b> tight <b>curb</b> chain is much harsher, and provides less finesse in signaling the horse than <b>a</b> looser <b>curb</b> chain would, as the horse is never given a chance to respond before the curb chain engages. Secondly, <b>an</b> extremely tight <b>curb</b> chain causes the mouthpiece to constantly push down on the sensitive tongue, never allowing the horse relief.|$|R

5|$|Torrential rain {{prevented}} {{the resumption of}} the Grand Prix for over two hours, until the rain eased at 15:50 local time. The race was restarted behind the safety car with the drivers in the positions held before the suspension. Vettel was first, followed by Kobayashi, Massa, Heidfeld, Petrov and di Resta. Webber was in seventh place with Alonso, de la Rosa and Button behind. The safety car remained out for seven laps, during which the circuit began drying enough to be suitable for intermediate tyres, and D'Ambrosio pitted on lap 33 to change from the full wets. Vettel began to extend the lead over Kobayashi once the safety car came in on lap 35, as Massa and Heidfeld fought for Kobayashi's second place. Schumacher led several cars into the pitlane to change to intermediate tyres, while Button, Heidfeld and di Resta were among those who pitted the next lap. Vettel and Karthikeyan were the only drivers not to change tyres by lap 37, when Button came upon tenth placed Alonso as he exited the pitlane. As Button attempted to pass at turn 3 the two cars touched, and Alonso's Ferrari spun and beached upon <b>a</b> <b>curb,</b> bringing out the safety car. When the race resumed three laps later, Vettel, Kobayashi and Massa retained their positions, as Heidfeld, di Resta, Webber and Schumacher fought for fourth place. Button had a punctured tyre after the collision and was in twenty-first and last place, but immediately began to make up positions and was 14th by lap 44. Di Resta damaged his front wing attempting to overtake Heidfeld; the subsequent pit-stop and drive-through penalty dropped him down to last. Schumacher, having overtaken Webber, passed Heidfeld in fourth place, and set the fastest lap of the race.|$|E

40|$|The hexose {{transport}} system of a fibroblast mutant, DS 7, unable to convert glucose 6 -phosphate to fructose 6 -phosphate ("the phosphoglucose isomerase mutant"), {{is subject to}} a specific down-regulation ("curb") evoked by only glucose or D-allose. Neither fructose nor mannose has <b>a</b> <b>curbing</b> effect on this mutant. Further addition of tunicamycin intensified the transport curb on the mutant mediated by glucose or allose. Mannose added to the parental cell line 023 seems able to mimic <b>a</b> glucose-mediated transport <b>curb.</b> In this line, but not the mutant, tunicamycin also intensifies <b>a</b> mannose-mediated <b>curb.</b> It seems that the tightening of the allose-mediated <b>curb</b> is <b>a</b> function of {{a specific type of}} transport regulation and perhaps too of interference with glycosylation of the hexose transporter.

25|$|As is {{well known}} in bicycle racing, the countersteering becomes evident when there is an {{obstacle}} preventing the wheel from countersteering (e.g., when closely overlapping wheels or riding very close to <b>a</b> <b>curb).</b> In these situations, the way to initiate a turn with the handlebars away from the obstacle is to countersteer towards obstacle to avoid crashing into it. Lack of understanding of this principle leads to accidents in novice bicycle races.|$|E
25|$|The parking {{strategy}} for sequencing resembles {{the process of}} parking cars along <b>a</b> <b>curb.</b> Each car is a sequenced clone, and the curb is the genomic target. Each clone sequenced is screened to ensure that subsequently sequenced clones do not overlap any previously sequenced clone. No sequencing effort is redundant in this strategy. However, much like the gaps between parked cars, unsequenced gaps less than {{the length of a}} clone accumulate between sequenced clones. There can be considerable cost to close such gaps.|$|E

25|$|In June 1435, {{family members}} {{gathered}} to put <b>a</b> <b>curb</b> on Gilles. They appealed to Pope Eugene IV to disavow the Chapel of the Holy Innocents (which {{he refused to}} do) and carried their concerns to the king. On 2July 1435, a royal edict was proclaimed in Orléans, Tours, Angers, Pouzauges and Champtocé-sur-Loire denouncing Gilles as a spendthrift and forbidding him from selling any further property. No subject of Charles VII was allowed to enter into any contract with him, and those in command of his castles were forbidden to dispose of them. Gilles' credit fell immediately and his creditors pressed upon him. He borrowed heavily, using his objets d'art, manuscripts, books and clothing as security. When he left Orléans in late August or early September 1435, the town was littered with precious objects {{he was forced to}} leave behind. The edict did not apply to Brittany, and the family was unable to persuade the Duchy of Brittany to enforce it.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the biggest}} {{incident}} {{of the year}} happened at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. With two laps remaining, Senna held a five-second lead over the Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto, who were {{closing in on the}} McLaren (Prost had earlier retired with a badly misfiring engine). Going into the Rettifilo Chicane, Senna closed on the Williams of Jean-Louis Schlesser (standing in for a sick Nigel Mansell). Schlesser steered wide, attempting to give Senna room to lap him, losing then regaining control to avoid going into the sand trap. Unfortunately, Senna did not give the Williams room and took his normal racing line. Subsequently, Senna's McLaren was T-boned and ended up beached on <b>a</b> <b>curb</b> with broken rear suspension. Ferrari would go on to an emotional 1–2 finish, the first in an Italian Grand Prix since the death of the team's founder Enzo Ferrari.
