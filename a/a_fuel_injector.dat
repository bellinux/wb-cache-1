40|$|The present {{experimental}} study examines {{the performance of}} <b>a</b> novel <b>fuel</b> injector/burner configuration with respect to reduction in nitrogen oxide NOx emissions. The lobed injector/burner is a device in which very rapid initial mixing of reactants can occur through strong streamwise vorticity generation, producing high fluid mechanical strain rates which can delay ignition and thus prevent the formation of stoichiometric diffusion flames. Further downstream of the rapid mixing region. this flowfield produces a reduced effective strain rate, thus allowing ignition to occur in a premixed mode, where {{it is possible for}} combustion to take place under locally lean conditions. potentially reducing NOx emissions from the burner. The present experiments compare NO/NO 2 /NOx emissions from <b>a</b> lobed <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> configuration with emissions from <b>a</b> straight <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> to determine the net effect of streamwise vorticity generation. Preliminary results show that the lobed injector geometry can produce lean premixed flame structures. while for comparable flow conditions, <b>a</b> straight <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> geometry produces much longer. sooting diffusion flames or slightly rich pre-mixed flames. NO measurements show that emissions from <b>a</b> lobed <b>fuel</b> injector/burner can be made significantly lower than from <b>a</b> straight <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> under comparable flow conditions...|$|R

New 29,000 PSI piezo injectors, a complete fuel system-hardening to tolerate up to 20% biodiesel mixtures and urea injection (to reduce nitrogen oxides) with a 5.3 gallon urea tank are updating the fuel and emissions systems. This engine has <b>a</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> in the exhaust tract, to allow raw fuel injection during the particulate filter recycling routine. The RPO LML engine is rated at [...] at 3000 rpm and 765 lbft Nm of torque at 1600 rpm.|$|E
50|$|In diesel engines, a {{mechanical}} injector system vaporizes the fuel {{directly into the}} combustion chamber or a pre-combustion chamber (as opposed to a Venturi jet in a carburetor, or <b>a</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> in a fuel injection system vaporising fuel into the intake manifold or intake runners as in a petrol engine). This forced vaporisation means that less-volatile fuels can be used. More crucially, because only air is inducted into the cylinder in a diesel engine, the compression ratio can be much higher {{as there is no}} risk of pre-ignition provided the injection process is accurately timed. This means that cylinder temperatures are much higher in a diesel engine than a petrol engine, allowing less volatile fuels to be used.|$|E
5000|$|The TDI engine uses direct injection, where <b>a</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> sprays {{atomised}} fuel {{directly into}} the main combustion chamber of each cylinder, rather than the pre-combustion chamber prevalent in older diesels which used indirect injection. The engine also uses forced induction {{by way of a}} turbocharger {{to increase the amount of}} air which is able to enter the engine cylinders, and most TDI engines also feature an intercooler to lower the temperature (and therefore increase the density) of the 'charged', or compressed air from the turbo, thereby increasing the amount of fuel that can be injected and combusted. [...] These, in combination, allow for greater engine efficiency, and therefore greater power outputs (from a more complete combustion process compared to indirect injection), while also decreasing emissions and providing more torque than the non-turbo and non-direct injection petrol engined counterpart from VAG.|$|E

5000|$|... 1951: Engineers for The Texas Company—i.e. now Chevron—developed a {{four stroke}} engine with <b>a</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> that {{employed}} {{what was called the}} Texaco Combustion Process, which unlike normal four stroke gasoline engines which used a separate valve for the intake of the air-gasoline mixture, with the T.C.P. engine the intake valve with a built in special shroud delivers the air to the cylinder in a tornado type fashion and then the fuel is injected and ignited by a spark plug. The inventors claimed their engine could burn on almost any petroleum based fuel of any octane and even some alcohol based fuels—e.g. kerosene, benzine, motor oil, tractor oil, etc.—without the pre-combustion knock and the complete burning of the fuel injected into the cylinder. While development was well advanced by 1950, there are no records of the T.C.P. engine being used commercially.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} burning coal {{that has been}} {{pulverized}} into a fine powder stems from the belief that if the coal is made fine enough, it will burn almost as easily and efficiently as a gas. The feeding rate of coal according to the boiler demand {{and the amount of}} air available for drying and transporting the pulverized coal fuel is controlled by computers. Pieces of coal are crushed between balls or cylindrical rollers that move between two tracks or [...] "races." [...] The raw coal is then fed into the pulverizer along with air heated to about 650°F / 340°C from the boiler. As the coal gets crushed by the rolling action, the hot air dries it and blows the usable fine coal powder out to be used as fuel. The powdered coal from the pulverizer is directly blown to a burner in the boiler. The burner mixes the powdered coal in the air suspension with additional pre-heated combustion air and forces it out of a nozzle similar in action to fuel being atomized by <b>a</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> in modern cars. Under operating conditions, there is enough heat in the combustion zone to ignite all the incoming fuel.|$|E
5000|$|Indirect {{injection}} in {{an internal}} combustion engine is fuel injection where fuel is not directly injected into the combustion chamber. In the last decade, gasoline engines equipped with indirect injection systems, wherein <b>a</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> delivers the fuel at some point before the intake valve, have mostly fallen out of favor to direct injection. However, certain manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Toyota have developed a 'dual injection' system, combining direct injectors with port (indirect) injectors, combining the benefits of both types of fuel injection. Direct injection allows the fuel to be precisely metered into the combustion chamber under high pressure {{which can lead to}} greater power, fuel efficiency. The issue with direct injection is that it typically leads to greater amounts of particulate matter and with the fuel no longer contacting the intake valves, carbon can accumulate on the intake valves over time. Adding indirect injection keeps fuel spraying on the intake valves, reducing or eliminating the carbon accumulation on intake valves and in low load conditions, indirect injection allows for better fuel-air mixing. This system is mainly used in higher cost models due to the added expense and complexity.|$|E

50|$|Diesel, PPC and HCCI engines, rely {{solely on}} heat and {{pressure}} created by the engine in its compression process for ignition. The compression level that occurs is usually twice or more than a gasoline engine. Diesel engines take in air only, and shortly before peak compression, spray a small quantity of diesel fuel into the cylinder via <b>a</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> that allows the fuel to instantly ignite. HCCI type engines take in both air and fuel, but continue to rely on an unaided auto-combustion process, due to higher pressures and heat. This is also why diesel and HCCI engines {{are more susceptible to}} cold-starting issues, although they run just as well in cold weather once started. Light duty diesel engines with indirect injection in automobiles and light trucks employ glowplugs (or other pre-heating: see Cummins ISB#6BT) that pre-heat the combustion chamber just before starting to reduce no-start conditions in cold weather. Most diesels also have a battery and charging system; nevertheless, this system is secondary and is added by manufacturers as a luxury for the ease of starting, turning fuel on and off (which can also be done via a switch or mechanical apparatus), and for running auxiliary electrical components and accessories. Most new engines rely on electrical and electronic engine control units (ECU) that also adjust the combustion process to increase efficiency and reduce emissions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The primary {{function}} of an {{electronic control unit}} (ECU) of an engine is to calculate the amount of fuel to be delivered into the combustion chamber. The injection duration and duty cycle of the injector {{will be based on}} several sensors whose signals the ECU will process to ensure the best engine running condition. However, to study new injection and combustion strategies, where such operation is unavailable in standard ECU, a custom-built fuel injection control system need to be made. This paper describes the development of <b>a</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> signal controller, which is being used for internal combustion engine experiment or for the evaluation of any fuel injector static flow rate. Herewith a new term Injector-Volume Ratio (IVR) was introduced to assist the development process. Using the custom-built fuel injection controller, the static flow rate of an injector for a single cylinder 125 cc motorcycle engine was determined in accordance to SAEJ 1832. From the experiment, the IVR value is proven useful in choosing the right size of <b>a</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injector</b> to fit any specified engine displacement of a spark ignition engine...|$|E
