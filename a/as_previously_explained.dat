[...] Some of the block units moved down and others moved up while fault movement created north—south-trending fault-block mountain ranges. About 100million years of erosion took place that washed most of the Chuar Group away along with part of the Unkar Group (exposing the Shinumo Quartzite <b>as</b> <b>previously</b> <b>explained).</b> The mountain ranges were reduced to hills, and in some places, the whole [...] of the supergroup were removed entirely, exposing the basement rocks below. Any rocks that were deposited {{on top of the}} Grand Canyon Supergroup in the Precambrian were completely removed. This created a major unconformity that represents 460million years of lost geologic history in the area.|$|E

The trials above given were made several years before, and when I read over my notes, I could not believe in the results; so I resolved to begin again with moderately strong solutions. Six leaves were first immersed, each in thirty minims of a solution of one part of the nitrate to 8750 of water (1 gr. to 20 oz.), so that each received 1/320 of a grain (.2025 mg.). Before 30 m. had elapsed, four of these leaves were immensely, and two of them moderately, inflected. The glands were rendered of a dark red. The four corresponding leaves in water were not at all affected until 6 hrs. had elapsed, and then only the short tentacles on the borders of the disc; and their inflection, <b>as</b> <b>previously</b> <b>explained,</b> is never of any significance.|$|E

The latter is in agreement with [Co 3 (CO) 10]- as the intermediate. These results are important mainly because neutral and anionic metal carbonyls frequently exist together as a result of side reactions...|$|R

The first slug of CO 2 injection changed the mobility of the water in the core, and thus the water slug following the CO 2 slug recovered some more oil.

60|$|In {{throwing}} off a ring from its equator, the Sun re-established that equilibrium between its centripetal and centrifugal forces {{which had been}} disturbed {{in the process of}} condensation; but, as this condensation still proceeded, the equilibrium was again immediately disturbed, through the increase of rotation. By the time the mass had so far shrunk that it occupied a spherical space just that circumscribed by the orbit of Uranus, we are to understand that the centrifugal force had so far obtained the ascendency that new relief was needed: a second equatorial band was, consequently, thrown off, which, proving ununiform, was broken up, as before in the case of Neptune; the fragments settling into the planet Uranus; the velocity of whose actual revolution about the Sun indicates, of course, the rotary speed of that Sun’s equatorial surface at the moment of the separation. Uranus, adopting a rotation from the collective rotations of the fragments composing it, <b>as</b> <b>previously</b> <b>explained,</b> now threw off ring after ring; each of which, becoming broken up, settled into a moon:—three moons, at different epochs, having been formed, in this manner, by the rupture and general spherification of as many distinct ununiform rings.|$|E
60|$|A {{few words}} must be added on the {{complete}} abortion of organs. When a part becomes diminished by disuse prolonged during many generations, {{the principle of}} economy of growth, together with intercrossing, will tend to reduce it still further <b>as</b> <b>previously</b> <b>explained,</b> but this will {{not account for the}} complete or almost complete obliteration of, for instance, a minute papilla of cellular tissue representing a pistil, or of a microscopically minute nodule of bone representing a tooth. In certain cases of suppression not yet completed, in which a rudiment occasionally reappears through reversion, dispersed gemmules derived from this part must, according to our view, still exist; we must therefore suppose that the cells, in union with which the rudiment was formerly developed, fail in their affinity for such gemmules, except in the occasional cases of reversion. But when the abortion is complete and final, the gemmules themselves no doubt perish; nor is this in any way improbable, for, though a vast number of active and long-dormant gemmules are nourished in each living creature, yet there must be some limit to their number; and it appears natural that gemmules derived from reduced and useless parts would be more liable to perish than those freshly derived from other parts which are still in full functional activity.|$|E
60|$|In {{the last}} and third Family, namely the Acridiidæ or grasshoppers, the stridulation is {{produced}} {{in a very different}} manner, and is not so shrill, according to Dr. Scudder, as in the preceding Families. The inner surface of the femur (fig. 13, r) is furnished with a longitudinal row of minute, elegant, lancet-shaped, elastic teeth, from 85 to 93 in number;[463] and these are scraped across the sharp, projecting nervures on the wing-covers, which, are thus made to vibrate and resound. Harris[464] says that when one of the males begins to play, he first “bends the shank of the hind-leg beneath, the thigh, where it is lodged in a furrow designed to receive it, and then draws the leg briskly up and down. He does not play both fiddles together, but alternately first upon one and then on the other.” In many species, the base of the abdomen is hollowed out into a great cavity which is believed to act as a resounding board. In Pneumora (fig. 14), a S. African genus belonging to this same family, we meet with a new and remarkable modification: in the males a small notched ridge projects obliquely from each side of the abdomen, against which the hind femora are rubbed.[465] As the male is furnished with wings, the female being wingless, it is remarkable that the thighs are not rubbed in the usual manner against the wing-covers; but this may perhaps be accounted for by the unusually small size of the hind-legs. I {{have not been able to}} examine the inner surface of the thighs, which, judging from analogy, would be finely serrated. The species of Pneumora have been more profoundly modified for the sake of stridulation than any other orthopterous insect; for in the male the whole body has been converted into a musical instrument, being distended with air, like a great pellucid bladder, so as to increase the resonance. Mr. Trimen informs me that at the Cape of Good Hope these insects make a wonderful noise during the night There is one exception to the rule that the females in these three Families are destitute of an efficient musical apparatus; for both sexes of Ephippiger (Locustidæ) are said[466] to be thus provided. This case may be compared with that of the reindeer, in which species alone both sexes possess horns. Although the female orthoptera are thus almost invariably mute, yet Landois[467] found rudiments of the stridulating organs on the femora of the female Acridiidæ, and similar rudiments on the under surface of the wing-covers of the female Achetidæ; but he failed to find any rudiments in the females of Decticus, one of the Locustidæ. In the Homoptera the mute females of Cicada, have the proper musical apparatus in an undeveloped state; and we shall hereafter meet in other divisions of the animal kingdom with innumerable instances of structures proper to the male being present in a rudimentary condition in the female. Such cases appear at first sight to indicate that both sexes were primordially constructed in the same manner, but that certain organs were subsequently lost by the females. It is, however, a more probable view, <b>as</b> <b>previously</b> <b>explained,</b> that the organs in question were acquired by the males and partially transferred to the females.|$|E

40|$|How is {{scientific}} knowledge used, adapted, and extended in deriving phenomena and realworld systems? This paper aims at developing a general account of ‘applying science’ within the exemplar-based framework of Data-Oriented Processing (DOP), {{which is also}} known as Exemplar-Based Explanation (EBE). According to the exemplar-based paradigm, phenomena are explained not by deriving them all the way down from theoretical laws and boundary conditions but by modelling them on previously derived phenomena that function as exemplars. To accomplish this, DOP proposes to maintain a corpus of derivation trees of previous phenomena together with a matching algorithm that combines subtrees from the corpus to derive new phenomena. By using a notion of derivational similarity, a new phenomenon can be modelled as closely <b>as</b> possible on <b>previously</b> <b>explained</b> phenomena. I will propose an instantiation of DOP which integrates theoretical and phenomenological modelling and which generalises over various disciplines, from fluid mechanics to language technology.
