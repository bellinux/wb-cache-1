Knowledge of these relations has a fundamental bearing on management of chaparral ecosystems. This study was conducted to determine the effect of shrub species and topographic aspect on availability of soil N and P in Arizona chaparral soils. Soil was collected under the canopy of 32 randomly selected shrubs, eight each of birchleaf mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides Nutt.) and shrub live oak (Quercus turbinella Greene) from both north and south aspects. A pot culture technique, using barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. gustoe) and mountain mahogany (C. montanus Torr.) as test plants, was used to estimate availability of soil N and P. Both test plants showed that shrub species and aspect influenced nutrient <b>availability.</b> <b>Availability</b> of P was very low, while that of N was quite high. Lower availability of P in soils from southerly aspects was associated with low amounts of total soil P, probably the result of long-standing differential erosion between north and south aspects, aggravated by fire. High N availability was probably associated with inputs of N via symbiosis between actinomycetes and mountain mahogany.

We developed a scale to measure the 'attractiveness' of prescription opioids to potential abusers, and used the scale to measure the relative attractiveness of 14 opioid analgesic products. Methods First, the concept of attractiveness was empirically defined with a group of prescription opioid abusers and experts in opioid abuse using a process called Concept Mapping. Abuse liability consisted of two components: factors intrinsic to the drug formulation (e. g., speed of onset, duration) and factors extrinsic to drug formulation (e. g., <b>availability,</b> <b>availability</b> of alternatives, cost). A 17 -item Opioid Attractiveness Scale (OAS) was constructed, focusing on factors intrinsic to the drug product. Results A total of 144 individuals participated in tests of validity and reliability.

A single-zone heat release model with constant thermodynamic properties is built into the air cycle simulation, while a more comprehensive two-zone combustion model with burning rate as a sinusoidal function of crank angle is built into the fuel/air thermodynamic engine cycle simulation. The computations mainly include pressure, unburned and burned zone temperature, indicated work, heat loss, mass blowby, availability destruction due to combustion, fuel chemical <b>availability,</b> <b>availability</b> transfer with heat, availability transfer with work and availability exhaust to the environment.

40|$|Transport {{diversity}} {{is a general}} terminology used for selecting or preferring a network exit-point for end-user application traffic across network topologies that {{have a variety of}} characteristics. These characteristics include things like monetary cost, reliability or <b>availability,</b> <b>availability</b> of bandwidth, and latency. One example of transport {{diversity is}} a branch office environment that has a primary path using Frame Relay and a backup or alternate path using basic rate ISDN. An example of why the concept of diversity is important is evident in Frame Relay outages that affected over 6, 000 customers following a series of events that included a software upgrade of a Frame Relay switch. Enterprise customers who relied solely on Frame Relay for their branch office connectivity may have experienced outages lasting several hours or days. Enterprise customers who deployed branches with a primary link provisioned as Frame Relay and a backup link using basic rate ISDN were able to maintain branch office connectivity throughout the network failure. This WAN diversity is based on decision making based on link failure. As the WAN technologies advance and mature, the concept of transport diversity also advances to include path selection over ‘always on ’ links like Cable, DSL, wireless broadband, or satellite. Now, it is economically feasible to maintain dedicated multiple WAN transport links as there is no variable cos...|$|E

However, {{there is a}} utilization gap between academic emergency departments (ED) and other emergency settings. We elucidated barriers to PoC US use in a multistate sample of predominantly non-academic EDs to inform future strategies to increase PoC US utilization, particularly in non-academic centers. Methods: In 2010, we surveyed ED directors in five states (Arkansas, Hawaii, Minnesota, Vermont, and Wyoming; n= 242 EDs) about general ED characteristics. In four states we determined barriers to PoC US use, proportion of EPs using PoC US, use privileges, and whether EPs can bill for PoC US. Results: Response rates were > 80 % in each state. Overall, 47 % of EDs reported PoC US <b>availability.</b> <b>Availability</b> varied by state, from 34 % of EDs in Arkansas to 85 % in Vermont. Availability was associated with higher ED visit volume, and percent of EPs who were board certified/board eligible in emergency medicine. The greatest barriers to use were limited training (70 %), expense (39 %), and limited need (perceived or real) (32 %). When PoC US was used by EPs, 50 % used it daily, 44 % had privileges not requiring radiology confirmation, and 34 % could bill separately for PoC US. Only 12 % of EPs used it ≥ 80 % {{of the time when}} placing central venous lines. Conclusion: Only 47 % of EDs in our five-state sample of predominantly non-academic EDs had PoC US immediately available. When available, the greatest barriers to use were limited training, expense, and limited need. Recent educational and technical advancements may help overcome these barriers. ...|$|E

However, most studies have considered the influence of either niche breath or resource availability in isolation, while it is the interactive effects {{that are likely to}} influence local abundance. We examined geographic variation in the feeding ecology and distribution of coralfeeding butterflyfish to determine the influence of dietary specialization and dietary resource availability on their local abundance. Dietary composition and abundance of five butterflyfish and coral dietary resource availability were determined at 45 sites across five locations (Lizard Island and Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef; Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea; Noumea, New Caledonia; and Moorea, French Polynesia). Multiple regression models using variables representative of total dietary resource <b>availability,</b> <b>availability</b> of specific dietary resources, and interspecific competition were used to determine the best predictors of local abundance across all sites and locations for each species. Factors influencing local abundance varied between butterflyfish with specialized and generalized diets. Dietary resource availability had the strongest influence on the abundance of Chaetodon trifascialis—the most specialized species. Local abundance of C. trifascialis was best predicted by availability of the Acropora corals that it preferentially feeds on. In contrast, abundance of generalist butterflyfish was poorly described by variation in availability of specific resources. Rather, indices of total dietary resource availability best predicted their abundance. Overall, multiple regression models only explained a small proportion of the variation in local abundance for all five species. Despite their relatively specialized diets, dietary resource availability has limited influence on the local abundance of butterflyfish. Only the most specialized species appear to be consistently limited by prey availability. Local and total abundance of species are influenced by a wide range of different factors and there is definite need to conduct independent species assessments...|$|E
