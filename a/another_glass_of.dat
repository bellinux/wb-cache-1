'We seldom see {{our present}} visitor, sir,' he said, {{addressing}} Mr. Wickfield, sitting, such {{a contrast to}} him, {{at the end of}} the table, 'and I should propose to give him welcome in <b>another</b> <b>glass</b> or two <b>of</b> wine, if you have no objections.

For {{at the corner of}} his square, high, narrow forehead, revealed for an instant by the thrusting back of the hair, a curious stumpy excrescence had been visible; and the top of his ear--he had a pointed top to his ear! ...|$|R

40|$|A grand {{seduction}} indeed Was it over <b>another</b> bottomless <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> sangria {{or during}} the boat ride on a sparkling lake? I’m not sure exactly when it occurred to me, but I am suddenly very popular. People laugh more at my jokes, request that I be seated first, and listen to even the longest of my stories. And while I {{would like to believe}} that my Semitic features or past travels have invoked such interest, the truth is this: my name is Eric, and I am a graduating fam-ily physician.

Both pieces <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> were bound together creating a detailed, albeit fragile, image. The process was derived from the 18th century mezzotint process.|$|R
