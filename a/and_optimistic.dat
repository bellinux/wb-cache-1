Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{described}} the normally intelligent, humorous <b>and</b> <b>optimistic</b> Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg tried to talk to him and was ignored, and later wondered whether this was due to combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.|$|E

5|$|Portrayed by Rob Lowe, Chris Traeger {{begins the}} show as an auditor working for the Indiana state {{government}} in Indianapolis, but eventually becomes the acting city manager of Pawnee, the fictional Indiana city where Parks and Recreation is set. Originally from Wisconsin, he is an excessively positive <b>and</b> <b>optimistic</b> person, who is constantly upbeat and extremely energetic. As a baby, Chris {{was diagnosed with a}} rare blood disorder and was not expected to live longer than three weeks, but miraculously survived. As a result, he sees every day he is alive as a gift, which results in his intensely cheerful and enthusiastic personality. He has a stepbrother who lives in London.|$|E
5|$|Following his birth, Nemo {{develops}} a smaller right fin due to {{damage to his}} egg, which limits his swimming ability. Worried about Nemo's safety, Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip. Nemo disobeys his father and sneaks away from the reef towards a boat, and is captured by scuba divers. As the boat departs, a diver accidentally knocks his diving mask overboard. While attempting to save Nemo, Marlin meets Dory, a good-hearted <b>and</b> <b>optimistic</b> regal blue tang with short-term memory loss. Marlin and Dory meet three Australian sharks– Bruce, Anchor and Chum– who claim to be vegetarians. Marlin discovers the diver's mask and notices an address written on it. When he argues with Dory and accidentally gives her a nosebleed, the blood causes Bruce to lose control of himself and enter a violent feeding frenzy. The pair escape from Bruce, but the mask falls into a trench in the deep sea.|$|E
5|$|Tanasescu {{explores the}} idea of rights for nature, an idea which, though unorthodox, has seen success in implementation. He first {{introduces}} the concept, {{with a focus on}} the differences between moral and legal rights, before examining the particular case of Ecuador's entrenchment of rights for nature in its 2008 constitution, which is compared with other real-world cases. He finally addresses what can be learnt from these theoretical and practical considerations. He concludes that much work on the topic is left to be done, but the key lesson to be learnt is the significance of innovation; environmental politics, he claims, should remain both inventive <b>and</b> <b>optimistic.</b> Theory and Practice".

5|$|From 1999 to 2001 a 40-year-old {{homemaker}} named Debbie Swenson perpetrated a ruse {{under the}} identity Kaycee Nicole, a 19-year-old woman in Kansas who shared {{the details of}} her battles with leukemia online. The Guardian newspaper reported that millions of Internet users read the fictional blog, as well as Swenson's own blog, in which she posed as Kaycee Nicole's mother, describing the trials of living with an intelligent <b>and</b> <b>optimistic</b> daughter who was dying. On May 16, 2001, Kaycee Nicole's death of an aneurysm was announced, shocking her readers and causing them intense grief. Soon however, Swenson caused skepticism in online communities. Although many cards and gifts had been previously sent, she refused to accept more. People began to learn that no one named Kaycee Nicole lived in Kansas, had been enrolled in schools, or admitted to local hospitals, and no obituary had been printed. The photo representing the girl was found to be that of a basketball player from Gracemont, Oklahoma, who was alive. After repeated questioning, Swenson posted that she had woven the stories of three cancer patients to create the character of Kaycee Nicole, who had never existed.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} whether {{managers}} use <b>optimistic</b> <b>and</b> pessimistic language in earnings press releases {{to provide information}} about expected future firm performance to the market, and whether the market responds to <b>optimistic</b> <b>and</b> pessimistic language usage in earnings press releases after controlling for the earnings surprise and other factors likely to influence the market*s response to the earnings announcement. We use textual-analysis software to measure levels of <b>optimistic</b> <b>and</b> pessimistic language for a sample of approximately 24, 000 earnings press releases issued between 1998 and 2003. We find a positive (negative) association between optimistic (pessimistic) language usage and future firm performance and a significant incremental market response to <b>optimistic</b> <b>and</b> pessimistic language usage in earnings press releases. Results suggest managers use <b>optimistic</b> <b>and</b> pessimistic language to provide credible information about expected future firm performance to the market, and that the market responds to managers' language usage.

Marilyn is seen as an involuntary victim of the mass culture of her time, a figure only superficially serene <b>and</b> <b>optimistic,</b> a heroine in spite of herself, whose contradictory personality is represented in twelve scenes, equally distributed in the two acts.|$|E
25|$|Fire: The fire {{signs are}} Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. A native with mainly fire signs will be energetic, {{enthusiastic}} <b>and</b> <b>optimistic,</b> with {{a need to}} be {{in the center of the}} action making things happen. They can be egotistical, headstrong and sometimes arrogant, but also can be generous, warm-hearted, and spontaneously kind. Fire subjects are independent and prefer to have control over their own lives, but they can also be sometimes autocratic. A subject lacking fire signs will be fearful or over-cautious, pessimistic and shy, and will lack enthusiasm, confidence and faith in the future. Planets in the 1st, 5th and 9th houses and an emphasis on cardinal signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|SQL Server allows {{multiple}} {{clients to}} use the same database concurrently. As such, it needs to control concurrent access to shared data, to ensure data integrity—when multiple clients update the same data, or clients attempt to read data that {{is in the process of}} being changed by another client. SQL Server provides two modes of concurrency control: pessimistic concurrency <b>and</b> <b>optimistic</b> concurrency. When pessimistic concurrency control is being used, SQL Server controls concurrent access by using locks. Locks can be either shared or exclusive. Exclusive lock grants the user exclusive access to the data—no other user can access the data as long as the lock is held. Shared locks are used when some data is being read—multiple users can read from data locked with a shared lock, but not acquire an exclusive lock. The latter would have to wait for all shared locks to be released.|$|E

25|$|In 1974 Labour {{returned}} {{to power and}} introduced the Social Contract which implemented a voluntary incomes policy, {{with the backing of}} many left wing union leaders such as Hugh Scanlon and Jack Jones. This period also saw {{an increase in the number}} of full-time union convenors, and these factors along with an increase in unemployment have been blamed by Tony Cliff and the SWP for a drastic fall in union militancy. In 1974 the IS was ambitious <b>and</b> <b>optimistic</b> expecting to double the number of its factory branches over the next year. In practice they declined swiftly from 38 in 1974 to only three or four by 1976. When the firefighters went on strike in 1977 against the Social Contract the IS was unable to deliver any significant solidarity. The national rank and file movement fell apart. In 1976 the SWP decided to stand in parliamentary by-elections but the results were very poor and the original idea of standing in 60 seats at the next election was dropped.|$|E
25|$|The early nineties {{were a very}} chaotic, but {{exciting}} <b>and</b> <b>optimistic</b> era {{in terms}} of comics. Because no one was told {{what is and is}} not to be published, many saw great opportunities in releasing comics. In these years a large variety of comics came into the country (not as direct import, but in the form of translations): all kinds of European, American comics. Although most companies were full of enthusiasm, but only few were strong in capital. In the meantime, the whole newspaper and magazine distribution system went through major changes, leaving magazines in a worse situation. Magazine print numbers dropped by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude. Therefore, most of them disappeared after a few months or years. By 1992 such great series as Menő Manó (Italian comics for teenage readers), Krampusz (Italian comics for adult readers), Hepiend Magazin (Conan, Punisher), Vampi (European and American horror, fantasy, erotic comics) vanished. Besides the inexperience of the small publishing companies, the comics-reading audience might not have been ready for these type of comics. In many cases their true value was only discovered in recent years.|$|E
25|$|During 1915 Redmond felt {{secure in}} his course {{and that the}} path was already partly cleared for Home Rule to be {{achieved}} without bloodshed. He was supported by continued by-election successes of the IPP, and felt strong enough {{to turn down the}} offer of a cabinet seat, which would have offset Carson's appointment to the war cabinet but would have been unpopular in Ireland. Even in 1916 he felt supremely confident <b>and</b> <b>optimistic</b> despite timely warnings from Bonar Law of an impending insurrection. Redmond did not expect the 1916 Easter Rising, which was staged by the remaining Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, led by a number of influential republicans, under Patrick Pearse. Pearse, who had in 1913 stood with Redmond on the same platform where the Rising now took place, had at that time praised Redmond's efforts in achieving the promise of Home Rule. Redmond later acknowledged that the Rising was a shattering blow to his lifelong policy of constitutional action. It equally helped fuel republican sentiment, particularly when General Maxwell executed the leaders of the Rising, treating them as traitors in wartime.|$|E
